1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,170
I think it's better this time.

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:05,440
It has gotten so much smoother.

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,320
Thank you.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,239
Oh, Winter is going to have a recording session. Don't forget to go and watch.

5
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,119
Okay. Got it.

6
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:22,440
And when this project is done, I have a surprise for you.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,899
Okay.

8
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:27,440
- Well, I'd better go.
- Okay.

9
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,460
- See you.
- Bye.

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,120
- Good bye.
- See you later.

11
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,190
Finally, Mr. Duean Yi can successfully finish this project.

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,739
After this, we'll wait for them to use this song the best they can.

13
00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:49,699
I really have to thank you for finishing this song.

14
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:52,539
Plus, it came out extremely good too!

15
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:54,659
You praise me all the time.

16
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:56,840
Well, that's what friends do.

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,260
So, what about your resignation?

18
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:08,819
I want to take care of Winter first and then think about it again.

19
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,200
All right. If you need any help, let me know.

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,359
Okay.

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,759
- Do you want to go grab something to eat?
- Sure! Let's go!

22
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,739
What shall we eat?

23
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:17,900
- I don't know...
- Excuse me.

24
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,599
My name is First. Can I talk to you?

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,160
Sure… What seems to be the problem?

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,000
Can I talk to Duean Yi first?

27
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,580
What's the matter?

28
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,900
Janjao, wait for me in the car.

29
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,979
What is it?

30
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:52,600
Well, I want to talk to you about Plaengrak.

31
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,120
Okay. What about him?

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,839
Actually, Plaengrak and I have not broken up yet.

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,320
I think it's better for you to stop involving yourself with someone who already has a boyfriend.

34
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,820
Excuse me.

35
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,699
But I think this is not something I should know.

36
00:02:18,699 --> 00:02:21,559
I think both of you should talk this through between yourselves.

37
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:26,040
We did, I just wanted to let you know.

38
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,879
Are you sure that you just wanted to tell me?

39
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,639
Not that you're scared?

40
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,439
And you told me that you guys talked, but did it really happen though?

41
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,760
Not that you got kicked out?

42
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,879
How funny... He doesn't want you, so you're here trying to force me.

43
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,339
Isn't that too much?

44
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:47,539
You don't seem to be effected by these kinds of words.

45
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:49,319
I feel bad for you.

46
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:53,979
You put in so much effort, but he still doesn't want you. Plus, you're trying to force me away.

47
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:55,819
Hey! You!

48
00:02:55,819 --> 00:02:57,479
Stay back!

49
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,159
Didn't I already tell you not to mess with my person?

50
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,180
Plaeng...

51
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,919
Stay out of the way, Yi.

52
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,019
Don't get involved with someone like him.

53
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,179
I told you not to come back!

54
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:11,480
If you don't leave, I'll be even harsher!

55
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,120
Get going!

56
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,040
I'm very sorry.

57
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,160
Are you all right?

58
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,240
I'm fine.

59
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,980
Next time, tell me if something like this happens again.

60
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,620
- Okay?
- Yes.

61
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,480
I won't allow anybody to speak to you like that ever again.

62
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,540
Thank you.

63
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,360
Should we go to the café?

64
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,960
Let's go.

65
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,710
[Half Moon | Slow Bar Coffee]

66
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,139
The intern barista is here today.

67
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:14,580
- Oops!
- Oops!

68
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,179
Sure. I'll train this one myself.

69
00:04:18,179 --> 00:04:19,880
All right, then I'll leave him to you.

70
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,999
By the way, Duean Yi, are you afraid of getting lost?

71
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:26,079
You come here so often, why are you holding hands?

72
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,439
Gene!

73
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:28,920
Let's continue working, shall we?

74
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,639
All right. Let's start doing some new menus that we got

75
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,480
from the time we got closer. What do you think?

76
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,020
Let's go.

77
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,440
All right, let's take a look.

78
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,730
How is it?

79
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,900
It's okay now.

80
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,040
This time, do not return it again. Okay?

81
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,580
Okay.

82
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,060
Now, try brewing the coffee that I taught you.

83
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,600
- All right!
- Okay

84
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,500
You seem much more agile.

85
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,419
I've got a great person teaching me, of course I'll do well.

86
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:25,640
You're such a sweet talker.

87
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,699
Yi, do you know what the most important thing to put in when brewing coffee is?

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,360
Putting in coffee?

89
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,619
That is obvious.

90
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:45,039
But what you must not forget, is your care.

91
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,179
Brew every cup of coffee as if you're giving it to the ones you love.

92
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,279
Now, let me see you try putting your care into this cup.

93
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,539
What are you laughing at?

94
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,540
It's touching.

95
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,060
How did it go today, Duean Yi? Are you tired?

96
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,300
It's not bad. It's easy.

97
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,780
So how's everything about Plaengrak?

98
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,420
Look at my face. Look at how happy I am.

99
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:33,800
Congratulations to you for succeeding like the fairy tales.

100
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,640
What about you and Thitnuea? How are things going?

101
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,420
For me, I don't like him!

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,200
Say it again.

103
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,600
Well, there's a little bit of shyness.

104
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,039
You already know,

105
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,020
no one would like someone like me.

106
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,180
I've encountered it so many times since I've been born.

107
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,119
The ones who just like to play and tease like Thitnuea.

108
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,580
Come one, Gene. Don't think of it like that.

109
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:12,740
What if Thitnuea really wants to get serious with you?

110
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,840
Well, I...

111
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,740
You should give it a try. Be open-minded.

112
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,680
Being in love feels really good.

113
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,499
You're kind of... delusional.

114
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:31,139
Gene! I'm your senior!

115
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,020
I'm just kidding!

116
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,399
Don't think no one will notice what's going on between you two.

117
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,900
What are you talking about?! Nonsense!

118
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,040
Oh no! Thitnuea is here!

119
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,510
You guys!

120
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,540
What's wrong?

121
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,679
Nara, I think you should be the one to tell them.

122
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,840
All right! All right!

123
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,479
From now on, you guys won't get to be with us anymore.

124
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:13,260
Does it mean we won't have to train now?

125
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:19,500
You guys won't be able to be with us anymore because...

126
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,660
Because...

127
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,140
Because you all are going to debut!

128
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,180
Yay!

129
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,320
What?! Aren't you guys happy?

130
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,119
Is it really happening?

131
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,940
You're not fooling us, right?

132
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,019
We're so happy!!!

133
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:44,700
- Yay!
- Yay!

134
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,080
How are you doing? Are you all right?

135
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,240
I'm okay. I just want to have some alone time to think.

136
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:07,279
Congrats to you. You've finally succeeded with the kids' debut.

137
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,639
Part of the reason I could do it was because I received positive energy from you.

138
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:17,319
Seriously asking, are you overreacting?

139
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:18,339
It's true.

140
00:09:18,339 --> 00:09:22,540
I'm actually jealous of you. You are both smart and beautiful.

141
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,380
I don't even have half of your skills.

142
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,810
Nara.

143
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,480
Yes?

144
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,439
You're the luckiest person, you know?

145
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:37,740
Lucky, how?

146
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,960
Well, no matter what troubles you face,

147
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,190
I see that you can always think positively.

148
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:51,099
Are you crazy?! If I'm always that happy, I'd go insane.

149
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,000
Janjao.

150
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,000
In order for us to be happy,

151
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,100
the first thing you must do is ask yourself

152
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,700
how are you feeling right now?

153
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:09,900
There is nothing wrong if you're not happy to be here.

154
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,500
Because in the end,

155
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,400
you'll have to live your own life.

156
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
Thank you.

All right, Sekram start.

166
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,600
♪ But it turns out— ♪

167
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,360
How will you hit the note singing like that?

168
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,900
I told you not to sing like that!

169
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,559
Why are you always arguing with me?

170
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,180
We'll be recording in a few days.

171
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,760
If that's the best you can sing,

172
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,099
no matter how good the song is, it won't do any good.

173
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,760
What the heck is your problem?

174
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,179
I just made a little mistake.

175
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:29,019
How's it different from you cursing at me?

176
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:31,201
- I made a little mistake, too.
- Hey!

177
00:11:31,201 --> 00:11:32,839
What is wrong with you guys?

178
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:34,599
Why don't we calm down and talk?

179
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:37,340
Calm down and talk? You told me to calm down?!

180
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:39,139
I will have nothing against him

181
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:42,580
if he devotes his time to practice the same way, he has time to flirt with fucking Gene!

182
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,139
What the fuck! Now you're crossing the line!

183
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:46,740
You're the one putting your nose in my fucking business!

184
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,260
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

185
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,640
Just so you know, if the band flops, it's because of you!

186
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,700
- Asshole!
- Hey!

187
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
What the hell is going on?!

188
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,800
I asked, what's going on?

189
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,100
- He crossed the line first!
- You insulted me first!

190
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,100
I told you to stop!

191
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:14,600
You're all adults! Can't you speak properly to each other?

192
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,000
In a few days, you will turn into artists.

193
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,040
Is this all you can do?!

194
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,100
Just arguing between yourselves?

195
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,040
If you guys still don't love each other, which fan will love you guys?

196
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:38,020
This might be the other reason why I want to quit.

197
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,240
If you can't be together, then just quit!

198
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,520
I feel bad for those who are working hard for this.

199
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,920
Do you understand?

200
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,140
Janjao.

201
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,600
How is it?

202
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,700
I saw your very sweet post on Instagram.

203
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,200
Let me have this moment.

204
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,100
I have been a drama queen crying myself to sleep for so long.

205
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,680
Did you cry?

206
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:51,600
Who hurt you? Tell me now!

207
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,200
Relax, dude.

208
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:02,780
I've just been feeling... tired lately.

209
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,140
What's wrong?

210
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,260
The band members were fighting again.

211
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,400
What's the matter now?

212
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,840
I don't know, either.

213
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:23,600
Janjao, if you're tired, then get some rest.

214
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,200
I think this time you should let them clear things up by themselves.

215
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,300
Would that be okay?

216
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,300
Give it a try.

217
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,000
By doing that, you'll be able to rest.

218
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,300
Think of it as a test for them to become artists.

219
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,300
And as for you...

220
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:50,200
I know that you want things to go smoothly and perfect.

221
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,000
But whether it works out or not, it isn't your fault.

222
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Go and rest up. Watch some series and cry your eyes out.

223
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,600
Then get back up and fight again tomorrow. All right?

224
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,900
Okay.

225
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,059
Love you... my crazy friend.

226
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:21,420
You are crazy. You can stop crying now.

227
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:28,400
- ♪ I will send this song to you... ♪
- Hello...

228
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:35,500
♪ But it turns out, I'm the one who's delusional ♪

229
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,380
What are you doing?

230
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,400
Nothing.

231
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,660
What's up?

232
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,220
Are you guys coming to talk to me about the argument?

233
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,800
I just wanted to tell you...

234
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,200
that we've come this far already.

235
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,600
I miss the time that we just started.

236
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,460
We just wanted to sing...

237
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,520
and follow our dream.

238
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,580
That's it.

239
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,400
Are you tired today?

240
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,560
Tired, but I had fun.

241
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,300
Want some dessert? I made some for you.

242
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,200
You're taking care of me so well.

243
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,800
Whose taking care? I haven't done anything.

244
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,800
I just made too much and couldn't finish it myself.

245
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,900
Okay.

246
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,700
I'm just kidding. I'm sorry.

247
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,900
You like to sulk.

248
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,600
Here, have a try.

249
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,700
- What is this?
- It's a waffle.

250
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,420
Delicious?

251
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,200
Plaengrak.

252
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,900
I'm sorry that I just disappeared.

253
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,700
It's okay.

254
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,100
I'm sorry, too.

255
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,900
Also, thank you for coming back to me.

256
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,100
Sure.

257
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:04,100
It's because I want to try being honest to my feelings.

258
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,400
So I decided to come back to you.

259
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,000
That time I also went to see you at your condo.

260
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,800
But someone was unable to be reached...

261
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,780
You are... pretty adorable.

262
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,600
It's not often I can see this side of you.

263
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,400
Don't tease me!

264
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,000
If you say that, I'll get shy.

265
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,920
Want to have a try?

266
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,680
Can you feed me?

267
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,360
- Is it good?
- It's delicious.

268
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,799
Be careful.

269
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:09,000
You too, walk carefully.

270
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,860
Are you done writing the song?

271
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,860
Yes, I finished.

272
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,560
What is your next plan?

273
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,460
I have some thoughts about it. Why?

274
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,339
Recently you seem to be happy.

275
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:33,339
So you might write a song

276
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:37,100
to make others happy just like how you make me feel now.

277
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,700
If it wasn't for you,

278
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,160
maybe I wouldn't be this happy.

279
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,460
Today, I just felt that

280
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,239
the way you write your music is similar to how I brew coffee.

281
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,460
How is it?

282
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:05,390
I think the last note of the song

283
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:11,200
is like the last drop of coffee I pour.

284
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,819
Because everything is important,

285
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:19,200
when mixed together it's gentle and just the way you want it.

286
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,160
Maybe it's true.

287
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:28,120
It might be the thing that makes us understand each other.

288
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,060
Do you need me to take you home?

289
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,960
I can go by myself.

290
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,899
If you take me home you'll get back late. You have to open up the café in the morning.

291
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:43,839
Then call me when you're home.

292
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:45,540
Got it.

293
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,060
I've got something for you.

294
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,680
What is it?

295
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,840
Happy belated birthday.

296
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,290
Aww, how did you know?

297
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:06,640
Thank you.

298
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:13,820
What if I don't want a thank you...

299
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,379
Can you give me something else instead?

300
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:18,740
Stop it!

301
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,040
I didn't mean it that way.

302
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,879
Can I give you a kiss on the cheek?

303
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,640
- Nope.
- Hey!

304
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,279
You've been playing hard to get recently.

305
00:21:34,279 --> 00:21:36,579
I have to, though.

306
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:42,359
Well... can't I give you one kiss on the cheek before you go?

307
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,340
No!

308
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,720
- Really?
- Yes.

309
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,300
In the end, you kissed me instead.

310
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,930
I'd better get going then.

311
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,650
- Okay.
- See you later.

312
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,599
Okay. Call me when you're there.

313
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,419
- Got it.
- Get home safely.

314
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:10,899
- Sure.
- Bye-bye.

315
00:22:10,899 --> 00:22:14,600
- And thank you for the present.
- Of course.

316
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,040
Are you okay?

317
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,980
No, I'm not.

318
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,500
Are you mad at Thitnuea?

319
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,120
I am angry with myself.

320
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,280
Hey! Can you tell me how Winter

321
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,780
came about and got assembled?

322
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,280
What has gotten into you? Suddenly asking about it.

323
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,820
Come on, just tell me.

324
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,460
Actually,

325
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,260
we knew each other since high school.

326
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:05,160
At that time, we were going to sign up for the musical club.

327
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,420
But it turned out to be full.

328
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,560
And suddenly, Thitnuea says

329
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,600
"Hey, guys, let's open up a new club."

330
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,799
And then we all got together.

331
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,820
Making music. It was all over the place.

332
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,060
At that time it was so damn fun.

333
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,800
You guys must have enjoyed yourselves.

334
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,760
Yes, it was really fun. There were hardships, though.

335
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,580
We didn't even have a practice room.

336
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,560
I don't know where Namnao found a room.

337
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:42,260
But it turned out to be our hangout spot for a while.

338
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,520
You guys seem to have gone through so much together.

339
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,919
Soon we will reach the goal that we set.

340
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:50,920
You can do it, Bro!

341
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,940
Thank you so much, dude.

342
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,940
I have to thank you, too.

343
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:01,600
From the first day I arrived until now, I've gotten so much better.

344
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,280
Did you know? I thought you were so angry with me, you wouldn't come back.

345
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,980
I understand you.

346
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,320
You're kind of adorable.

347
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,760
What's the matter?

348
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,420
You're sitting here sadly alone.

349
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,040
I have some stuff to think about.

350
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,380
You can talk to me.

351
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,680
Why are you acting like this?

352
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,300
I see you're upset, so I just want to help you out. Do you understand?

353
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:24,080
If there's nothing, then good.

354
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,160
Aww, stay with me a bit.

355
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,260
So, what is wrong?

356
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,880
I had a little argument with Tanwa.

357
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,799
What happened? Is it that bad?

358
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,360
Not that bad, right? You guys are friends.

359
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,660
Right?

360
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,360
Nuea...

361
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,320
You are not going to quit, right?

362
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,940
Say something.

363
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:11,180
Lately everyone has been stressed.

364
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,280
You got this!

365
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,260
You can do it!

366
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:31,340
Actually, the argument was...

367
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,120
very small.

368
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,180
But I don't know what to do.

369
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,420
It's fine.

370
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,360
I'm serious.

371
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,720
Everyone is working hard on it.

372
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:01,800
Trust me. Everything will be all right.

373
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,540
Are you cheering me up?

374
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,920
I'm just saying.

375
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,580
Hey...

376
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,280
Are you shy?

377
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,420
Gosh!

378
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,680
It's stressful. Why are you teasing me right now?

379
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,120
I'm not upset now.

380
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,320
Gene.

381
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,860
If one day...

382
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,520
our band had our own concert,

383
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,960
you have to go watch us.

384
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,460
It's like you're asking me on a date...

385
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,979
Weren't you sad just now? What is wrong with you?

386
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:54,680
Okay?

387
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,980
You have to go and watch us, okay?

388
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,700
Promise me first.

389
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,940
On two conditions.

390
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,440
What are they?

391
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,980
First,

392
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,199
you have to express whenever something is wrong.

393
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,260
You don't have to smile anymore.

394
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,960
Secondly,

395
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,120
you can play a concert for me now.

396
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,320
Then you have to play the guitar.

397
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,780
I don't know how. I'm a barista.

398
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,039
Can't a barista play guitar?

399
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,740
Take it.

400
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,159
If I make mistakes, don't scold me.

401
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,280
I won't.

402
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:50,139
♪ It's just a love song that you do not love ♪

403
00:28:50,139 --> 00:28:53,600
♪ That you do not accept ♪

404
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,840
How is it, Ai? Are you full today?

405
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,579
I'm full. Please excuse me, I'll go back to my room.

406
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:16,959
Wait a second.

407
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:19,580
I have something to talk to you about.

408
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,979
If you want to speak about that matter,

409
00:29:21,979 --> 00:29:24,459
can it be another day?

410
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:29,679
Let's do it today. We don't know what other day there is. Let's talk it out.

411
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,360
- Just tell him.
- I'm about to tell him now.

412
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,959
How's it going with the band you mentioned?

413
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:42,179
Well... about the band, the song is done already.

414
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:45,360
And Duean Yi is looking for someone to help out.

415
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,199
- Is it doing well?
- It's pretty good, Pa.

416
00:29:48,199 --> 00:29:52,299
Okay. If it's good then... keep doing it.

417
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:56,779
But creating music or songs is not an easy thing to do.

418
00:29:56,779 --> 00:30:00,639
- Yes.
- There may not always be happiness,

419
00:30:00,639 --> 00:30:02,199
there will be some bad days.

420
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:07,479
There will be days that make us want to give up, and days that make us feel like a failure.

421
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,519
Yes, Pa. I understand that.

422
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,080
But I really want to do it.

423
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,619
- Really?
- Yes

424
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:19,239
You really want to do it?

425
00:30:19,239 --> 00:30:22,500
- Yes.
- If so, then okay.

426
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,780
- But...
- Yes?

427
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,060
Once you're done, let your Ma and I hear it.

428
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,080
Once I'm done... ?

429
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:36,199
Do you really mean it?

430
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:40,739
- Of course.
- Thank you so much.

431
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,620
Thank you.

432
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,699
- Okay.
- Thank you.

433
00:30:50,699 --> 00:30:52,319
Yes.

434
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,300
Are you happy now?

435
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,299
- Pa you are the cutest.
- That's right.

436
00:30:58,299 --> 00:31:00,019
- Of course,
- You helped speak to Pa,

437
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:02,359
- if there's someone cuter than me, there will be a problem.
- thank you, Ma.

438
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:04,480
You'll get a scolding!

439
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,299
I just found out that Duean Yi works at this café.

440
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,359
Oh, the person that he likes is the owner of this place.

441
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:19,200
Oh! I knew it!

442
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,919
Oh, hey. About the issues with my parents,

443
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:24,919
they are okay with it now.

444
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:27,459
- Shit, really?
- Yes.

445
00:31:27,459 --> 00:31:29,779
That's great then!

446
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:34,359
We have to work harder from now on.

447
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,479
Of course. I will find the time to come.

448
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:40,499
Bro! Have you been here long?

449
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:42,479
No, not yet.

450
00:31:42,479 --> 00:31:47,739
Everyone, this is Plaengrak, the owner of the café.

451
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:52,219
Plaengrak, this is Duean Ai, my brother.

452
00:31:52,219 --> 00:31:56,480
And this is Jo, the producer at the music company.

453
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,579
- Hello. Hello.
- Hello.

454
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:05,219
If you would like anything else or want to try our special coffee, please let me know.

455
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:08,079
My brother has such a good eye.

456
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:10,800
Your boyfriend looks better than I pictured.

457
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,320
What boyfriend?

458
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,719
And I heard that you wanted to start a band.

459
00:32:19,719 --> 00:32:23,619
If you want to use space from the café for any events, please let us know.

460
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:24,979
Sure, sounds good.

461
00:32:24,979 --> 00:32:29,300
If I may excuse myself. I'll go and make coffee.

462
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,380
Take a seat.

463
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,279
Oh, Yi.

464
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:42,699
I want to thank you for speaking to Pa and Ma for me.

465
00:32:42,699 --> 00:32:47,739
I'm just trying to help you like you have always helped me.

466
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:51,459
We will have a recording session next week.

467
00:32:51,459 --> 00:32:54,240
If you are free, you can come and join us.

468
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,439
He probably won't be free.

469
00:32:57,439 --> 00:32:59,799
You're preparing for your new project, aren't you?

470
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:02,359
Please wait for me.

471
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:06,460
- Then I'll have to go now.
- Okay,

472
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,560
What are you smiling at, Bro?

473
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,560
I told you that he's not working here.

474
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,460
Dude.

475
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,920
You can stay.

476
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,860
Are you crying again?

477
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,740
You are a cry baby as always.

478
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
What cry baby?

479
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:57,260
What were you thinking about coming here?

480
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,280
I just miss the old days,

481
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,060
so I came back.

482
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,400
And what about you?

483
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,560
About yesterday,

484
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,820
I'm sorry.

485
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,960
I'm sorry, too.

486
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,280
Do you remember back then?

487
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,600
No matter how hard we tried, it was not good enough,

488
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,380
but I had a lot of fun.

489
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,600
Don't leave me, all right?

490
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,940
Even if we argue countless times,

491
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,379
I want you to remember...

492
00:34:54,379 --> 00:35:00,180
that this place is where we grew up together.

493
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,000
The place...

494
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,100
full of our dreams.

495
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,100
You and I, we will never separate.

496
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:19,040
Because if anyone's missing from, Winter,

497
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,680
it won't be the band, Winter, anymore. Right?

498
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,780
That's why we are, Winter.

499
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,699
Here they are, the rest of the band waiting to practice.

500
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,180
Are you ready guys?

501
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,940
Let's do it!

502
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,559
♫ Every time I listen to a love song ♫

503
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:28,220
♫ I always think of you ♫

504
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,319
♫ And dream about you every day ♫

505
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:34,399
♫ There is someone the love song is written for ♫

506
00:36:34,399 --> 00:36:38,039
♫ It seems their wish came true after listening to it ♫

507
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:42,319
♫ And hearing the words, "love" in the song ♫

508
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:47,179
♫ I will send this song to you ♫

509
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:51,519
♫ And I hope you feel the same way ♫

510
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:58,839
♫ But it turns out, I'm the one who's delusional ♫

511
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:03,699
♫ It's just a love song, that you do not love ♫

512
00:37:03,699 --> 00:37:06,499
♫ That you do not accept ♫

513
00:37:06,499 --> 00:37:09,599
♫ You won't feel affected, no matter how much you listen to it ♫

514
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,539
♫ It's just a love song, with sweet lyrics ♫

515
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:15,939
♫ But instead I am heartbroken ♫

516
00:37:15,939 --> 00:37:19,359
♫ With a song I heard ♫

517
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,299
♫ It's just a love song, that you do not love ♫

518
00:37:23,299 --> 00:37:26,019
♫ That you do not accept ♫

519
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:29,199
♫ You won't feel affected, no matter how much you listen to it ♫

520
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:33,199
♫ It's just a love song, with sweet lyrics ♫

521
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:35,639
♫ But instead I am heartbroken ♫

522
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:39,299
♫ With a song I heard about love without love ♫

523
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:44,139
♫ What do you do when you listen to love songs,
but it's ineffective, unlike before♫

524
00:37:44,139 --> 00:37:50,290
♫ The melody that used to be sweet, but today it feels gray ♫
