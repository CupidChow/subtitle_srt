1
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,440
Are you sneaking a peek at me?

2
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,820
Why didn't you tell me you had woken up?

3
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,180
When did you fall asleep last night?

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,599
You slept and left me watching the movie alone.

5
00:00:34,599 --> 00:00:36,400
Oh!

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,420
I guess we were really tired yesterday.

7
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,620
Can I hold your hand?

8
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,320
Did you sleep well?

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,280
I did.

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,039
Plaengrak.

11
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,840
Yes?

12
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,080
Can you be my boyfriend?

13
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,620
I think...

14
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,140
I'm not ready for a relationship.

15
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,919
♫ It's like I'd already forgotten ♫

16
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,959
♫ That someone ever broke my heart ♫

17
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,600
♫ It's like I'd already forgotten ♫

18
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,320
♫ That someone use to make time slow down ♫

19
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,040
♫ But as soon as someone showed up ♫

20
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:33,579
♫ I found out that I truly never forgot ♫

21
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:38,539
♫ The past made me realize that you never left ♫

22
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:40,919
♫ You're buried in my mind ♫

23
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:46,280
♫ I can't move on with anyone else ♫

24
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,039
♫ I'm afraid my heart will be broken once again ♫

25
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,579
♫ I know I've never walked away from the image of you leaving, ♫

26
00:02:55,579 --> 00:03:01,459
[Duean Yi: Are you going to the café today? I'll bring you snacks.]

27
00:03:01,459 --> 00:03:07,980
♫ It hurts so much I can't love anyone else ♫

28
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,620
[Duean Yi: Are you going to the café today? I'll bring you snacks.]

29
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:24,320
[Duean YI: Why did you read the message but not reply?]

30
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,050
Gosh, it's too early!

31
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,160
Relax.

32
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,080
- Yesterday, I got home pretty late.
- Yes.

33
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,480
I'm tired.

34
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,000
Are your uniforms okay? If not, we'll get scolded.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,140
He's coming.

36
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,919
All right, everyone. Today, we're adding two more things to our café.

37
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:50,099
They are desserts and board games.

38
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,760
For dessert, I'll let Tasmin and Baibua be in charge of recommending them to customers.

39
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,630
- No problem!
- Got it!

40
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,619
Baibua, follow me to make desserts behind the counter.

41
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:01,720
Sure, I got this.

42
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,899
Gene, you take care of the board games.

43
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:06,660
A lot of our customers requested it. Is that okay?

44
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,860
Got it!

45
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,900
I'm the number one in games. I can't lose.

46
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,259
Okay, let's get to work!

47
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:16,780
Let's begin. You got this!

48
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:56,340
Namo tassa. Namo tassa. Namo tassa.
(T/N: Beginning of a Buddhist chant)

49
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,799
That's all you can recite?

50
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,360
What the heck!

51
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,260
You shocked me!

52
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,239
You're number one at games?

53
00:05:11,239 --> 00:05:13,880
Yet, you're sitting here confused?

54
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,540
I'm not confused, but I'm trying to figure it out.

55
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,830
Do you want me to help?

56
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,910
With the way you speak... no, thanks!

57
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,319
If you're going to tease me, leave me alone!

58
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:29,719
Every time you see me, do you think I'm going to tease you?

59
00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:30,879
Is that even a question?

60
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,179
Yes, that's why I asked.

61
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:36,459
It's not fun to paint it by yourself.

62
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:38,399
It's better than painting it with you!

63
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:41,019
Look, I'm the best when it comes to art.

64
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:42,920
You can trust me with colors.

65
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,619
You can go paint over there.

66
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:46,839
So, you want my help or not?

67
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:49,259
If you tease me, I'm going to tell Plaengrak.

68
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:51,119
Okay, got it!

69
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:54,160
- What do I do?
- Start painting it.

70
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,660
- Where?
- Here.

71
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,340
What is this thing?

72
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,440
You're so curious!

73
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,919
Hi, Duean Yi! Why are you here so early?

74
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:13,000
Hi, Duean Yi. Who are you looking for?

75
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,200
Are you looking for Plaengrak?

76
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,260
Yes, of course. I want to see my future boyfriend first.

77
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,719
You should tone it down.

78
00:06:21,719 --> 00:06:23,839
He's not at the café.

79
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,620
He came to open up and probably went to check out the coffee beans we ordered.

80
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:32,040
Oh! He's not here anymore?

81
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,300
He didn't mention that. I came here for nothing.

82
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,540
Here. I bought you all some snacks.

83
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,180
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

84
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,980
I'll take it.

85
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,320
I think we should talk.

86
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,300
Do you want anything? I'll make it for you.

87
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,500
Then anything is fine.

88
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,759
If you think he'll be back,

89
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,680
he won't be.

90
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,460
He told me that he has some errands to do.

91
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,880
Why did he tell you and not me?

92
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,819
Excuse me, I work here.

93
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:50,540
He needs someone to look after the café.

94
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:54,580
Although he's not here, our livelihoods are still important.

95
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,940
Yes, I know that.

96
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,760
I'm just a little upset he didn't tell me anything.

97
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,479
Especially when I told him that I'd be bringing some snacks.

98
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:16,080
So, how's it going between you and Plaengrak?

99
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,760
It's going consistently.

100
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,300
Consistently? Are you human or a log?
(T/N: "Consistently" and "sawing" sounds the same, a wordplay)

101
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,620
Is that so funny?

102
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,560
Well... I just wanted to know.

103
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,920
Why is it so hard to understand?

104
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,360
Hey, ro. I understand.

105
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,280
I meant Plaengrak.

106
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,660
Duean Yi who is cute and good-looking.

107
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,320
Your attractiveness is stronger than 5G wifi speed!

108
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,620
I'm just kidding, please don't be mad at me.

109
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,680
It's pretty hard to guess Plaengrak's mood.

110
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,380
Some days, we can talk normally and other days, he disappears.

111
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,120
Modern-day relationships are like that.

112
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,020
Friends and friends with benefits, it's all like that.

113
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,700
Hello, Duean Yi.

114
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,140
Hi, Gene.

115
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,219
By the way, what are you talking about?

116
00:09:34,219 --> 00:09:36,620
(Not your business.)

117
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
It's nothing.

118
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,079
Well, we're talking about Duean Yi and Plaengrak.

119
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:45,980
Gene!

120
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,700
I knew it.

121
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:54,820
Anyways, how are you two doing?

122
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,140
I don't know how to answer that.

123
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,980
At first, we were good together.

124
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,059
And suddenly, it seems like he's trying to avoid me.

125
00:10:08,059 --> 00:10:12,380
- Oh...
- I don't even know what I did wrong.

126
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,040
I don't think you did anything wrong actually.

127
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,460
I think it has more to do with Plaengrak.

128
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,180
How so?

129
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,680
In my opinion,

130
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,620
everyone has wounds in their heart.

131
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,980
Especially Plaengrak.

132
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,780
He's probably scared to be in love again.

133
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,330
And maybe he thinks if he falls in love with someone again,

134
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,980
he might be hurt by it one day.

135
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,920
He must have not wanted to put himself in that position.

136
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,460
Why don't you try giving him some time?

137
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,810
He's actually trying his best.

138
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:58,800
Besides, I do know that he likes you, too.

139
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,159
If he didn't really like you, he wouldn't be trying to keep his distance.

140
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,640
His past relationship was that bad?

141
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,400
If I tell you, don't tell him about it. All right?

142
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,700
I won't tell for sure.

143
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,520
Plaengrak use to date someone.

144
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,739
They went to learn to make coffee together.

145
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:32,320
They were in a relationship for 4-5 years.

146
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,800
Their dream was to open up a café together.

147
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,840
But one day, when Plaengrak almost achieved his dream,

148
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,220
that person stole his money.

149
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,119
And left him after that.

150
00:11:44,119 --> 00:11:45,920
That jerk.

151
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,600
Oh my...

152
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:56,940
So that's probably why he's scared of falling in love again.

153
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:00,910
But if you really like him,

154
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,400
I think you still have a chance.

155
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,640
I'm rooting for you.

156
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,980
Thank you.

157
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,860
Well then... I'll leave first.

158
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,500
- Duean Yi, you're okay. Right?
- Yes.

159
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,039
You have to keep on fighting, Duean Yi!

160
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,440
An ex is just an ex. You got this!

161
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,300
You should go back to work.

162
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,600
- Sure, sure.
- Yes.

163
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,319
I didn't have to call and wake you up today.

164
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,220
Yes.

165
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,060
Wait, you haven't slept yet?

166
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,499
Look! If staying in the room makes you feel sluggish,

167
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:55,000
why don't you try going outside?

168
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,400
Aren't you going to answer me?

169
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,720
I don't know either. I think I'm fine.

170
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,220
Why can't I cry?

171
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,310
Maybe it's because I understand him.

172
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,220
Sure. That's good then.

173
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,779
Here, I brought you some snacks.

174
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:20,240
Just in case you want them for breakfast.

175
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,339
But I have to go to work.

176
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:26,800
There's a meeting early in the morning.

177
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,359
Thank you so much. I will follow you later.

178
00:14:31,359 --> 00:14:33,959
- You're okay. Right?
- Yes.

179
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:38,400
Okay, I'll go now. Bye...

180
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,040
Bye.

181
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:36,099
Hello, everyone. My name is Nara and this is...

182
00:15:36,099 --> 00:15:39,540
- I'm Prim.
- I'm Lee Jia.

183
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:45,279
We will be the ones to take care of you all while you're here.

184
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,619
But before that,

185
00:15:47,619 --> 00:15:49,799
we would like to know your names.

186
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:54,279
Please introduce yourselves like it's a school orientation.

187
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:59,200
I am Yuri, the eldest one.

188
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,900
I am Botan, the youngest one.

189
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,999
As for me, I am Lilly. The prettiest one!

190
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,219
Oh, sure.

191
00:16:08,219 --> 00:16:14,199
Oh, okay... so Lee Jia will take you all to tour the company first.

192
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:16,699
You guys can follow me. Okay?

193
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:18,500
Come on.

194
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,239
Oh! Hello, Joe.

195
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:25,119
Hi, take a seat.

196
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:31,079
- So?
- I guarantee that this time you will like it for sure.

197
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:33,480
- Let me see.
- Here.

198
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,379
This part here is where I revised it.

199
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,300
How is it?

200
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,240
I'm going to be honest.

201
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,279
It's okay...

202
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,160
But I think it can be better than this.

203
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,579
Try going back and revising it again.

204
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:03,040
And let's talk later.

205
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,300
Okay.

206
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,419
Try to put your heart into it.

207
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:11,660
Got it, thank you.

208
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:22,039
Here are drinks and snacks. My mom bought it for you.

209
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,199
Thank you.

210
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,119
Who is this?

211
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,639
My niece. She's the daughter of my brother.

212
00:17:27,639 --> 00:17:29,420
I have to babysit her for a day.

213
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,280
Did you properly greet them yet?

214
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,240
Hello, Thitnuea. Hello, Sekram.

215
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,399
- Hi.
- Hi.

216
00:17:36,399 --> 00:17:39,399
And how did you know our names?

217
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,740
Uncle Tanwa showed me your pictures before.

218
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,779
And what is your name?

219
00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:50,480
- My name is Jebi.
- Oh, Jebi.

220
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,920
Do you like Thitnuea's hair color?

221
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,620
A little bit.

222
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,919
If you want to dye your hair like mine,

223
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,279
wait until you're older.

224
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:01,280
Then we'll have Uncle Tanwa take you to the salon.

225
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,300
You with that color alone is enough.

226
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,660
- Let's go practice.
- Okay.

227
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,999
- Let's go.
- Okay.

228
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:11,800
You guys go ahead. I'm going to buy lunch quickly.

229
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,490
- Okay.
- Let's go.

230
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:17,179
This one first.

231
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,980
Okay.

232
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,300
♪ Will it be wrong ♪

233
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,479
♪ That I fall for you like this? ♪

234
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,600
♪ I know it's... ♪

235
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,320
Hey, everyone! I bought some food.

236
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,660
We can take a break then. Come on.

237
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,960
- Wow, you even have names on them.
- Hand them out. This one's mine.

238
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,719
I chose all of your favorite menus!

239
00:18:48,719 --> 00:18:50,620
Are you sure?

240
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,060
I don't like eating Pad Krapao.
(T/N: Stir-fry chicken or pork with holy basil)

241
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,340
I don't like it, either.

242
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,380
You just took a guess, didn't you?

243
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,899
- Yes...
- Let's eat.

244
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:05,519
We'll eat whatever you buy,

245
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,420
our dearest little brother.

246
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,939
So, let's see my dear friend Tanwa.

247
00:19:10,939 --> 00:19:14,200
Do you like what he got for you?

248
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,319
How did you know that I like omelets?

249
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,919
Don't tell me...

250
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:22,259
The one who gets the omelet is the one who gets my heart.

251
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,359
Just kidding!

252
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,679
I just remembered the menu you liked to frequently order.

253
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,120
But you can't remember ours?

254
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,579
Just eat it!

255
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:38,679
- All right.
- Let's eat.

256
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,840
Let's quickly eat, so we can get back to practice.

257
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,859
So, what happened? Plaengrak disappeared?

258
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:52,239
He's probably just busy...

259
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,759
You're always siding with the men!

260
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,080
Well, I just don't know what's wrong with him.

261
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,420
But when I start thinking about his ex,

262
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,339
it makes me upset a little bit.

263
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:06,490
His ex?

264
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:09,860
Yes, I just found out from Thitnuea.

265
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,000
What happened?

266
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,039
It was pretty bad.

267
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:17,800
But deep down, I understand him.

268
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,659
Yeah, don't think too much about it.

269
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:23,280
Just think about the present.

270
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,119
But I'm not sure...

271
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,620
if anything will come out of trying.

272
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,920
Do your best.

273
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,299
Didn't you say you were a fighter?

274
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:41,020
Fine, I'll try.

275
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,020
Anyway, did you bring the song?

276
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,679
Yes, but... it's pretty much just a rough draft.

277
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,220
Let's try having the band members practice it first.

278
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:51,359
Then, I'll go back and make some changes.

279
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,799
Sure, that sounds good.

280
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:56,520
Let's go together.

281
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,919
So, did we get better?

282
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:09,719
You guys only practice this much and want to be praised already?

283
00:21:09,719 --> 00:21:13,059
If this song is out, you will have to hire bodyguards to take care of us.

284
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:15,340
You're always over the top!

285
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,199
What about you Sekram? How's it going?

286
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,479
I'm okay.

287
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:22,000
I just have to practice a bit more than usual.

288
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,940
Do you have any suggestions for us, Duean Yi?

289
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,279
Duean Yi?

290
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,100
Yi? Yi?

291
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,420
They're asking you a question!

292
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,160
Huh? What is it?

293
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,180
Oh, it's...

294
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,679
If there is something you want us to improve, just tell us.

295
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,320
If there is anything, it's on me.

296
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,759
If you want me to change or improve anything in the song,

297
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,960
just let me know. Let's help each other.

298
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,380
If it's about the song, we fully trust you.

299
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,860
Excuse me for a moment.

300
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,660
Plaengrak...

301
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,200
Plaengrak.

302
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,420
Can I talk to you for a moment?

303
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,160
I'm pretty busy right now.

304
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,620
Then, we can talk after you close.

305
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,600
Can you do this for me, please?

306
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,320
Duean Yi, we've already gathered here together,

307
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,900
let's raise our glasses!

308
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,559
Duean Yi!

309
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,200
Let's drink together.

310
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,240
Come, come, come!

311
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,819
Let's clink glasses at a distance, like wifi!

312
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,440
(Are you okay?)

313
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,540
Get home safely, everyone.

314
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,559
Yes, will do.

315
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:44,480
We'll head out first then.

316
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,999
- Good bye.
- See you later.

317
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:47,839
See you later.

318
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:50,119
Duean Yi, would you like to leave with us?

319
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:52,160
It's okay.

320
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,359
Janjao, you can leave first.

321
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,620
I need to stay and take care of something.

322
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,379
Do you want me to stay with you?

323
00:23:59,379 --> 00:24:02,960
It's okay. Let's talk later.

324
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,999
Let me know when you get home then.

325
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,919
Okay.

326
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,440
Bye. Let's go.

327
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,500
I'll go first.

328
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,780
Plaengrak,

329
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,780
I think we should talk.

330
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,160
Did I do something to make you upset?

331
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:08,540
I should be the one asking this question.

332
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,139
What's wrong with you?

333
00:25:12,139 --> 00:25:15,360
Why are you trying to avoid me?

334
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,399
It's nothing.

335
00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:20,140
Can you stop lying?

336
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
If there's something wrong, tell me frankly.

337
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,400
There's nothing going on.

338
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,340
Then, what about that night?

339
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,380
It doesn't mean anything to you, does it?

340
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,840
If you only wanted me just as a friend,

341
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,000
shouldn't you have told me from the beginning?

342
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,939
I didn't even say anything yet.

343
00:25:57,939 --> 00:26:00,519
It's because you didn't say anything!

344
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:03,280
It's making me assume things on my own!

345
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,440
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

346
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,860
You don't have to apologize.

347
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:26,139
You can do anything but don't play with my feelings like this!

348
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,099
If you want me to be honest, I'm not ready for a relationship.

349
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:33,679
And you're just telling me that now?!

350
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,500
When things were just about to start happening!

351
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,140
Do you know that you're so damn selfish!

352
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,639
Fine! I'm selfish!

353
00:26:45,639 --> 00:26:47,239
Why don't you leave then?!

354
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:48,980
- Why should you love me?!
- Fine!

355
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,060
I'm leaving for sure!

356
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,330
But let me tell you something,

357
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:57,020
I'm not your ex-boyfriend!

358
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,119
Even though you encountered bad situations in the past,

359
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,400
not everyone else and neither am I, are like that!

360
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,539
And if you aren't ready for a relationship,

361
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:11,640
don't give other people hope!

362
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,539
Because you know best how painful disappointment feels.

363
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:20,580
Fine! Just go!

364
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,040
Don't let me see you ever again!

365
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,659
♫ Maybe it's because you don't like flowers ♫

366
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:35,800
I thank you, then.

367
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,660
For letting me realize that we shouldn't have met in the first place.

368
00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:47,879
♫ Maybe it's because you don't like the song that I sang ♫

369
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:53,100
♫ You don't like the ring that I gave you ♫

370
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,479
♫ I finally understand a certain truth ♫

371
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,860
♫ The truth that is so very painful ♫

372
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:06,740
♫ If it's from someone who isn't the one ♫

373
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,660
♫ In the end, that's all there is to it ♫

374
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:17,920
♫ It could probably be anyone who isn't me ♫

375
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,200
♫ The person whom you'll give importance to ♫

376
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,859
♫ But it's not me, I must understand ♫

377
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:31,019
♫ No matter how much I try ♫

378
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:36,300
♫ I'm just like dust, with no value ♫

379
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,879
♫ When I'm not the one, this is all I can do ♫

380
00:28:41,879 --> 00:28:44,780
And if you aren't ready for a relationship,

381

don't give other people hope!

383
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:58,100
Fine! Just go! Don't let me see you ever again!

384

♫ It could probably be anyone who isn't me ♫

385

391
00:29:37,459 --> 00:29:39,940
It's okay, Duean Yi.

392
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:46,919
♫ It could probably be anyone who isn't me ♫

393

♫ It could probably be anyone who isn't me ♫

396
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,620
Do you know why Chinese people drink tea?

397
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,799
How could I know?

398
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:16,060
Because they don't drink coffee!

399
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:19,599
You've got a lot of jokes.

400
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:22,199
- Oh?
- What's going on Ai?

401
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:24,199
Have a seat. Sit down.

402
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,719
- What's going on?
- Yes, what is it?

403
00:30:25,719 --> 00:30:29,039
- Go ahead and speak.
- Well, I...

404
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,960
would like permission to start a band with my friends. Can I?

405
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,360
What did you say?

406
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:47,640
I... would like to start a band with my friends. Is that okay, Pa?

407
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,939
What are you talking about?

408
00:30:49,939 --> 00:30:53,520
What about our family business?

409
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,799
Pa and Ma, you two remember right,

410
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,760
that I've liked to sing since I was young.

411
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:07,140
Now, I just want to try doing it seriously for once.

412
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,420
You can stop thinking about it.

413
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,919
Ai, you're a grown-up now.

414
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,820
You need to think carefully before doing anything.

415
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,320
I've thought it through already, Ma.

416
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,300
Just stop thinking about it! I won't allow it.

417
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,999
- Why, Pa?
- Why?

418
00:31:34,999 --> 00:31:38,979
You're a grown-up now! Why are you wasting your time on nonsense?!

419
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:41,360
Calm down.

420
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,679
How can you say it's a waste of time?

421
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,279
Isn't it a waste of time

422
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,519
being a singer or musician like that?

423
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,780
Can it financially support you for the rest of your life? Think!

424
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,680
It's because it's me.

425
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,520
I'm not your most beloved child!

426
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:04,840
Whatever I want to do or want to ask,

427
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,320
you never consented to it, Pa.

428
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,860
Ma, you never agreed to it either.

429
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:22,180
I have worked really hard for the family.

430
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:26,820
Being a good brother, and also a good son.

431
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:31,860
Was there ever a time that I disappointed you both?

432
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,940
Oh. I totally forgot,

433
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:45,280
I'm not your favorite child.

434
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,800
It has nothing to do with it!

435
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:53,420
Fine, I won't do it!

436
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,820
I'm not like Yi.

437
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:03,360
Whatever Yi asks for, you're always willing to give it to him.

438
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,680
And you as well, Ma.

439
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:12,000
Why, Pa? Why?

440
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,820
Did you know that being born as the eldest brother in this family,

441
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,800
is such a damn disappointment, Pa!

442
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,060
Duean Yi!

443
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:37,159
♫ Because of the pressure of goodbyes  ♫

444
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:42,200
♫ That is why I'm singing this song ♫

445
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:48,159
♫ If anyone hears this, if anyone is listening ♫

446
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:53,399
♫ This is the sound of my last song ♫

447
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:59,959
♫ It's because of the rain in October that led me there ♫

448
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:04,159
♫ In a world that's so lonely ♫

449
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,959
♫ I'm down on my knee ♫

450
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:15,860
♫ To ask about making our love as you dreamed ♫

451
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:22,039
♫ But you turned and looked at me ♫

452
00:34:22,039 --> 00:34:27,199
♫ Closing the ring box that I was offering ♫

453
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:33,459
♫ I cried beneath the falling rain before you
refusing to look me in the eyes ♫

454
00:34:33,459 --> 00:34:42,840
♫ And you said one thing... that you were sorry ♫

455
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,519
♫ I was more silent than numb ♫

456
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:56,000
♫ The tears I had inside flowed out ♫

457
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,420
♫ Too painful to let it show ♫
