1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,639
Duean Yi, please come back home more often so you can help me care for the plants.

2
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:09,940
Sure! I'll come back home more often.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,539
- Okay! I'll go see Aunty now.
- All right.

4
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:16,020
Be careful, it's slippery.

5
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,200
You woke up early today.

6
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,979
I wanted to find something to do.

7
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:40,480
So I came down to help Ma take care of the plants.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,700
And also...

9
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:47,360
About last night, I'm really sorry.

10
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,900
You don't have to apologize.

11
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,980
It's me who has to apologize to you.

12
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,019
No.

13
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:08,340
Actually, I think I was too harsh on Pa and Ma.

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,080
Do you really want to start a band?

15
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,140
About the band...

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:20,400
I don't think... I'll do it anymore.

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,800
Don't be like that.

18
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:28,800
If you really want to do it, I will help you.

19
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,520
When I had problems, you never left my side.

20
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:42,019
If you really want to be a singer, I'll be your first fan.

21
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,079
Thank you so much, Yi.

22
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,079
By the way, why did you come home suddenly?

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,500
Usually, it's not easy for you to come home.

24
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,940
I had a fight with that person who I told you that I liked.

25
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,900
And are you okay?

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,759
I'm okay.

27
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,540
I'm trying to be understanding.

28
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,920
- Bro.
- Yes?

29
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,660
Can you promise me

30
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,160
from now on, if something is bothering you, please tell me.

31
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,479
Of course!

32
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:33,440
If there's anything, you'll be the first to know.

33
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,759
As for Pa and Ma, I think they'll understand you eventually.

34
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:41,320
Okay.

35
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,460
Don't give up. Let me give you a hug.

36
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,360
You too, Brother.

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,199
♫ It's just a love song, that you do not love ♫

38
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,739
♫ But instead I am heartbroken ♫

39
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:07,860
♫ With a song I heard about love without love ♫

40
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,560
Compared to last time, I think it's good!

41
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,319
- Thank you.
- Sure.

42
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,140
The lyrics you wrote were so deep. Are you in love?

43
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,700
But I think it can be better than this.

44
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:31,519
During the pre-chorus, I think you can play with words more creatively.

45
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,079
But I think it sounds pretty good.

46
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,119
I still think it can be improved.

47
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:40,200
You probably still don't understand it deeply enough.

48
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,180
Want to try being heartbroken?

49
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,240
I'm just kidding.

50
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:49,519
Oh, yeah. Winter is having their pre-debut show soon.

51
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,519
Can you please fix it on time?

52
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:52,539
Sure.

53
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:55,839
I'll go back and revise the pre-chorus for you again.

54
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,079
And for the next song, can it please be a sad song?

55
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,620
I can guarantee that the fans will be crying for sure.

56
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,319
I'll contact you again about that.

57
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,120
Got it.

58
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,160
Right, I totally forgot.

59
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,299
If this song is done, you can get ready to write the next song.

60
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:18,259
- Really?
- Really!

61
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,340
Why would I lie to you?

62
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,360
Jo, can I ask you something?

63
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,360
Sure, what is it?

64
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,059
I heard that you like to sing and you are interested in starting an indie band.

65
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:36,379
That's right, why?

66
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:43,539
Well, my brother is starting a band, in case you're interested.

67
00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:48,520
I think someone as talented as you can make the band successful.

68
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,259
I think I better not.

69
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:56,240
Come on! Why don't you try it out first? Please?

70
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,760
Duean Yi, with the amount of work I do, I don't have enough time as it is.

71
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,520
Okay, that's fine then. I'm leaving now.

72
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,419
You are throwing away your opportunity to be a singer.

73
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:15,120
I'm leaving.

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,539
Fine! I'll give it a try.

75
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,759
- Thank you.
- Yeah…

76
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,080
- I'm going for real this time.
- Yup.

77
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,699
- I'm not going to turn around.
- Yeah…

78
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,239
- Just go!
- Okay.

79
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,699
- Bye now.
- Bye, see you later.

80
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,800
Sure.

81
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,599
Meji, your dad will get here soon.

82
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:42,279
Okay. I want to color my drawings at home.

83
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:46,039
Wow, you really like to draw and paint.

84
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,939
Next time I get off work early, I'll buy you coloring books.

85
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:55,219
Yay! Really? You are the best, Uncle Nawa.

86
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:57,659
You made a promise, okay?

87
00:05:57,659 --> 00:05:59,360
I promise.

88
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,400
- Do you want some?
- Sure.

89
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,360
You're just saying that.

90
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,180
I'll take one.

91
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,180
Want more? Here.

92
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,960
Nawa, did you call me?

93
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,160
Come in first.

94
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:41,339
So... where have you been?

95
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,419
I took Duean Yi to see Jo, a moment ago.

96
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:47,439
I see.

97
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,650
Well, I have something to talk to you about.

98
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,630
Sure.

99
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,760
When you talk to the band members,

100
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,579
I'm afraid it'll look like you're close to them.

101
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:02,260
It won't look good on you.

102
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,320
But I think I act appropriately with them though.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,879
I just mean that sometimes. You might have put your guard down.

104
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:23,260
Then... can you tell me what is considered inappropriate?

105
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,220
I just wanted to give you a reminder.

106
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,959
Well...

107
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,839
But it sounds unreasonable.

108
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,480
Janjao, when I'm giving you advice and warnings, I'd like for you to listen.

109
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,719
I didn't say that I won't listen to you.

110
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,840
You're doing it right now.

111
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,040
If this is all you have to say,

112
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,560
please excuse me.

113
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,060
Janjao...

114
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,100
I'm being jealous.

115
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,060
What... do you mean?

116
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,020
I like you.

117
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,780
What?

118
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,700
I think you also have the same feelings for me, right?

119
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,700
Nawa... I...

120
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,820
really respect you as my senior and boss.

121
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,899
But... I don't think this is right.

122
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,660
I think it'll be better to go back to how we were.

123
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,139
But... didn't you have feelings for me when we were in university?

124
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:57,320
That was then. It's not the same.

125
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,520
Please excuse me. I'm going back to work.

126
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,219
Hey, boy! Is my coffee ready yet?

127
00:09:20,219 --> 00:09:23,239
Shit! Why is it taking so long?

128
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,439
Here it is! Nitro cold brew and sugar-free black coffee. Is that correct?

129
00:09:27,439 --> 00:09:29,700
Oh... I know why it took so long.

130
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,119
I think the waiter was busy tucking.
(T/N: A technique to hide the crotch bulge)

131
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,359
He must have taken so long because he didn't want to shock the customers.

132
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:44,779
It's because nitro cold brew needs time to drip, but it is delicious for sure.

133
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:50,080
And if I taste you instead, will I have diarrhea?

134
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,320
If there's nothing else, please excuse me.

135
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,219
You better avoid him carefully before he walks behind you.

136
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,239
Excuse me! If you're so free, you should find something more useful to do.

137
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:13,819
Such as getting an education. Do you know what that is?

138
00:10:13,819 --> 00:10:16,399
No one is tucking to impress others.

139
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,219
Hey! You're pretty fucking brave!

140
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,780
Don't start with me! I know I'm "pretty!"

141
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,139
Shit!

142
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:29,240
Bon appetite.

143
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,959
Come on! If you're brave enough!

144
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,840
From the looks of it, you're all talk!

145
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,000
You know what? What you just did was very cool.

146
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,000
Who wants to be cool about that?

147
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,000
Aren't you upset about it?

148
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
They were talking shit about you.

149
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,500
I am furious deep down inside.

150
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,000
But I don't see why I have to show it.

151
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's like I tried to get them to sympathize with me,

152
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,100
but it makes me look even more vulnerable.

153
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,000
Next time, if someone does this again,

154
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,200
just fight them as you did.

155
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,700
I'm already doing the best I can.

156
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,000
Ever since I've become who I am now,

157
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,400
I've been bullied and made fun of constantly.

158
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Then...

159
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,200
If someone makes fun of you again,

160
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,200
you can tell me anytime.

161
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,500
Who will make fun of me except you?

162
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,000
Only I can do that.

163
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,400
Gene, you know what?

164
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,200
What you just did,

165
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,300
makes me feel that...

166
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,800
from now on, if something bad happens to me,

167
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,000
I'll fight back, just like you.

168
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,700
Thank you.

169
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,200
Thank you, Thitnuea.

170
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,900
Sure.

171
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,900
Hey! What are you doing Nuea!?

172
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh my…

173
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,100
Let's go.

174
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,200
Seriously?

175
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,800
Hurry up.

176
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,100
Are you coming?

177
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
Slow down.

178
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,300
They're here, Plaengrak.

179
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,400
Hey, Gene.

180
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,000
You've got good support.

181
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,400
Are you feeling better now?

182
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,800
With him, I feel worse than before.

183
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,100
We shouldn't stop them, you know.

184
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,100
That's right. They're flirting. We shouldn't stop them.

185
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,800
Enough, both of you. Just stop.

186
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,000
Gene, if something like this happens again,

187
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,600
you can tell me right away.

188
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
- You can tell us, too.
- Yes.

189
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,400
Right! If there's anything, just tell us.

190
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:37,100
Thank you.

191
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,400
We should get back to work, right?

192
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,700
- Thank you.
- Let's go.

193
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,900
Let's go and clear that up over there.

194
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,000
Bring this cup to fill and...

195
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,279
This is the finalized budget

196
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,600
for the pre-debut until the debut day.

197
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,400
From the budget that Mr. Nawa set, there's nothing more to add.

198
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,100
And I think we'll even have a lot of it left.

199
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,900
The promotional art

200
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:10,500
from the content that Nara came up with is fine.

201
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,800
I've sent everything to Nara and Ms. Mermaid already.

202
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:17,800
Ms. Mermaid and I are the best at creating media hype.

203
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,900
But mostly, Ms. Mermaid is better.

204
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:27,100
We've already thought of the contents for promotion according to the plan.

205
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,300
As for the date and time, we'll update in the group chat later.

206
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:37,200
Next week, we'll have a cute little activity.

207
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,100
We'll let the band give it a try for the first time.

208
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,800
It'll be a pre-debut at the location Janjao selected

209
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,400
that was proposed at...

210
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,800
the Half Moon Café.

211
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,500
Very good.

212
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,700
So, is the song from Duean Yi finished yet?

213
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,000
I already followed up with him.

214
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,800
Duean Yi made an update with Jo the other day.

215
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,200
I'll check on it for you soon.

216
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,300
How can I be sure the band will have enough practice?

217
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,100
Until now, they haven't seen the song.

218
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,600
If we follow the timeline,

219
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,200
it's still within the plans we made.

220
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,000
Okay. That's good, then.

221
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,200
Mr. Nawa, you don't have to worry about it.

222
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,500
I guarantee the song will be done on time.

223
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,600
Please excuse me.

224
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,900
Hey, what are you doing here, Jebi?

225
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,800
I am waiting for Uncle Tanwa.

226
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,700
Where are the two of you going?

227
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,700
We are going to see the trainees practice their dance.

228
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,800
Woah, seems fun.

229
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,100
Is Uncle Tanwa in the practice room?

230
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,600
That's right.

231
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,900
Then, how about this?

232
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,500
You come with us to watch the trainees practice.

233
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,100
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

234
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,400
I will let Uncle Tanwa know, all right?

235
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,700
In case one day, when you get older,

236
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,800
you want to be like that. How's that sound?

237
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,600
Sounds good.

238
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,300
Then, shall we go?

239
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,500
Let's go. Are you happy? Let's go.

240
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,900
Lilly, where does it hurt?

241
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:29,000
My ankle hurts. It seems like it might be sprained.

242
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,100
Hey! Lilly fell down, we should check up on her.

243
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,100
Wait. Let her get up herself first.

244
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,700
Please help me move Lilly to that side.

245
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,800
I will help you.

246
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,200
If she chooses to walk on this path,

247
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,500
she has to be able to overcome this obstacle.

248
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,800
Oh my! Is this really you?

249
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:58,500
I never expected you'd have a good mindset.

250
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:01,500
I actually remembered it from Janjao,

251
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,420
seeing how she sounds so cool saying it.

252
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,920
[Half Moon | Slow Bar Coffee]

253
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,500
What's wrong?

254
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,700
You seemed like you've been in a war.

255
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,700
Please spare me for a day. I can't deal with it.

256
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,700
Fine. I'm yielding because it's you.

257
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,300
What happened to you? How did you end up in this condition?

258
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,100
I think...

259
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:28,200
I don't want to work there anymore.

260
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,600
Should I quit?

261
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,530
Seriously?

262
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,300
What happened? Tell me.

263
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:39,200
I think... I'm pretty professional.

264
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,500
But… every time I discuss work,

265
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,300
it's like I'm in a war zone.

266
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,800
Fine. I won't ask any further.

267
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
By the way,

268
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Duean Yi doesn't come by much anymore.

269
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Duean Yi?

270
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,100
He might be in a worse situation than me.

271
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,900
What do you think...

272
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,200
about us going to do merits at nine different temples?
(T/N: To dispel bad luck)

273
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,700
Or maybe eighteen temples is better?

274
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,200
In case going to more would help. We'll go immediately!

275
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,000
- That's not too much...
- Really?

276
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,500
I haven't talked to him yet.

277
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,300
Just leave him alone first.

278
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,800
That's good.

279
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,600
As for you, if you are lonely or bored,

280
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,000
you can always come here. Okay?

281
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,400
Aww, Gene! Thank you so much.

282
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,800
At least I know that I have you by my side.

283
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,600
And also order drinks here, too!

284
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,500
Gosh, Gene!

285
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,900
You'll have an iced cappuccino as always?

286
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,100
Yes. And add more sweetness,

287
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,200
because my life is bitter nowadays.

288
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,500
Will do!

289
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,000
Janjao?

290
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,900
Oh, Plaengrak.

291
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,500
Are you leaving already?

292
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,700
Yes, I was on my way out.

293
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,800
Is there something you needed?

294
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,600
No, not that.

295
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,700
I wanted to ask...

296
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,400
if you have talked to Duean Yi.

297
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,700
Oh… well…

298
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,400
I haven't talked with him yet.

299
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,900
By the way, may I ask you something?

300
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,500
What happened?

301
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,000
Why did Duean Yi suddenly act like that?

302
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:45,700
Well… It's my fault.

303
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,600
I… just feel that I'm not ready for a relationship.

304
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:59,900
I told him... to keep a distance.

305
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,700
I was afraid he would get hurt even more.

306
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,700
I made dessert for Duean Yi.

307
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,200
Can you give it to him?

308
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,400
Maybe not yet, if you're not ready.

309
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:25,040
Once you are ready, you can give it to him.

310
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,700
Plaengrak?

311
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,540
Plaengrak!

312
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,599
Oh, okay.

313
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,380
I'll excuse myself then.

314
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,360
- Yes.
- See you later.

315
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,519
Sun, can you listen to this tone?

316
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:05,519
I think you got the wrong key-chord.

317
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:07,740
Sun! Come here!

318
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,319
- What the heck is wrong with you?
- What do you mean?

319
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:16,180
If you didn't want to practice, then why are you here?

320
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,540
Aren't you being too much?

321
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,900
I can do whatever the heck I want.

322
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,140
What about practice?

323
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,039
The other day, you were telling the Winter band members that you idolized them.

324
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:26,999
But today, this is how you're acting?

325
00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:29,360
Aren't you ashamed?

326
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,980
Our life is really uncertain.

327
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:41,240
A few days ago, someone was just cooking for you.

328
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,500
Oh, dude...

329
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,380
- What?
- I have something to tell you.

330
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,480
Today, Nawa said he likes me.

331
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,720
Oh! Why did he confess out of the blue?

332
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,480
He told me he didn't like that I was too close to the band members.

333
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,040
And he also told me that he was jealous.

334
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,160
How about you?

335
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,660
I told him that…

336
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:23,480
I don't want my love life to mix with my work.

337
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,180
We're better the way we are.

338
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,720
That's true.

339
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,120
Think about it…

340
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,620
What if we have a fight in the future?

341
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,360
Wouldn't the company be a mess?

342
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,959
You are so weird.

343
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:47,259
As soon as the person you've had a crush on for so long confesses,

344
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,559
you rejected him just like that.

345
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,860
Gosh, you...

346
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,900
Like today, we were putting pressure on everyone in the meeting.

347
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,390
Oh, hey...

348
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:06,380
I met your Plaengrak today.

349
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,360
So… did he say anything about me?

350
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,340
He seems remorseful.

351
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,780
There were a lot of customers today.

352
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,920
But I'd like to thank all of you.

353
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,079
Thank you.

354
00:24:33,079 --> 00:24:36,539
It's because our barista is handsome. Everyone wants to come enjoy.

355
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,660
Do you mean they come for the coffee?

356
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:44,639
Yes, of course.

357
00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:47,159
Well… I'm heading home now.

358
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,720
- See you tomorrow, Gene.
- Let's go.

359
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,280
- Get home safe.
- Thanks.

360
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,940
Let me help.

361
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,380
How was today? Are you tired?

362
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,300
Why were there so many people today?

363
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,860
Yes, it's true.

364
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,560
Gene.

365
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,760
You did really well today.

366
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,879
They messed with the wrong person.

367
00:25:22,879 --> 00:25:27,859
Lucky for them, I am who I am now. If this was the past,

368
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,940
those two wouldn't have survived.

369
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,240
You're speaking bravely now.

370
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,580
But... you don't have to act so strong all the time.

371
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,339
Next time, if something like this happens,

372
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:46,360
you can tell me.

373
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:51,740
And everyone is ready to help you.

374
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,920
Especially, Thitnuea.

375
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,319
Gosh, what are you talking about?

376
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,000
What? What's wrong?

377
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,160
I was just shocked.

378
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,160
Shocked or shy?

379
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:08,199
Why every time Thitnuea is mentioned, you always act like this?

380
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,900
Plaengrak!

381
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,999
What?

382
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:15,359
Hey! I'm the owner of the café. You can't just throw stuff at me.

383
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,260
It's almost done, let's hurry so we can go home.

384
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,260
You're... going to see Thitnuea.

385
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,779
Are you rushing to go see him?

386
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:27,639
Are you going to stop?

387
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:29,760
Okay, quickly clean it.

388
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,919
Are you going home now?

389
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:35,220
- What is it?
- Do you want me to take you home?

390
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,959
No need, before Plaengrak sees.

391
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:39,279
Let's go together, okay?

392
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,200
No!

393
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,770
- Gene is going home with…
- Quite down and come here!

394
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,179
He's going to hear us!

395
00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:45,680
So what?

396
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,760
Oh, hey...

397
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,520
There is one thing I haven't told you.

398
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,620
What is it?

399
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:12,000
The argument I had with Pleangrak

400
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,540
was really bad.

401
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,800
And so?

402
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,500
The Winter band members were also at the café that day.

403
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,699
Can you tell me in more detail, please?

404
00:27:24,699 --> 00:27:27,299
Tell me exactly what happened.

405
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:30,859
I walked out crying and Tanwa saw it.

406
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:34,160
He also came to hug me.

407
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,620
Tanwa? The cute bassist of the band?

408
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,679
Maybe he likes me...

409
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,399
What are you thinking?

410
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,720
Actually, he is pretty cute.

411
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,839
Maybe if my boyfriend is a musician,

412
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:54,420
he might be understanding to a songwriter like me.

413
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:57,179
Dude...

414
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:03,340
Whoever you like or love, I will always support you.

415
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,839
But I don't want you to make decisions

416
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:11,400
at your happiest or saddest moments.

417
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,620
Because at that time, you won't be reasonable.

418
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:19,780
It's the moment our heart is the most vulnerable.

419
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,580
Thank you so much.

420
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:29,059
If I didn't have you, I'd probably be dating ten people.

421
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:31,080
Gosh, you...

422
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:37,759
Is this why you decided to speak to Nawa straightforwardly?

423
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,160
You're afraid it would affect your job.

424
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,200
Yes.

425
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,680
But it looks like he doesn't think that way.

426
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,840
Why so?

427
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,539
Because after I rejected him,

428
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:54,819
he didn't look pleased about it.

429
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:57,620
He was also nitpicking at me about work.

430
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:00,339
He would do that?

431
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:04,439
Yes. Just thinking about facing him,

432
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:07,080
already stresses me out!

433
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,720
Duean Yi,

434
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:58,939
is this the first song you're playing on the piano?

435
00:29:58,939 --> 00:30:02,339
Yes. I still remember

436
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:05,060
I had to lie to Ma that I was sick at that time.

437
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:07,620
So I could practice this song.

438
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,940
Back then, you were such a nerd.

439
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:18,760
I never imagined that you'd grow up to be slutty.

440
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,680
(Bitch!)

441
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,940
Duean Yi...

442
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,380
When we were kids...

443
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:33,360
we were so happy.

444
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,200
That's true.

445
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,319
When you first started working as a secretary,

446
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,300
you came to see me while crying your eyes out every day.

447
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:51,260
And we ended up crying together in this room.

448
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,900
Do you remember?

449
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:04,200
When my Pa and Ma forced me to quit doing this job,

450
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,859
there was you,

451
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:09,920
who told them that you would take care of me.

452
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,120
It's true.

453
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,820
But at that time, I didn't know why I said it.

454
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,460
If I didn't have your help back then,

455
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:31,140
my first song probably wouldn't have been done by now.

456
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,820

476
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:25,280
Namnao, you think you can beat me?

477
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,380
Move ten spots.

478
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,319
Will you fight?

479
00:34:33,319 --> 00:34:35,119
- Come on!
- Come here!

480
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,300
You're changing your opponent?

481
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,760
- Fourteen!
- Hey!

482
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,019
- All right!
- Oh!

483
00:34:42,019 --> 00:34:44,779
- Got hit!
- How's it going, guys?

484
00:34:44,779 --> 00:34:47,240
- Hi, Plaengrak.
- Hello.

485
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,060
You're all here.

486
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,979
Today is our day off, so we decided to take some time off.

487
00:34:54,979 --> 00:34:58,759
Tanwa seemed stressed. We didn't want him to be alone.

488
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,359
Tell me if you need anything.

489
00:35:02,359 --> 00:35:04,260
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Okay.

You guys continue playing. I'll be right back.

491
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:11,759
- Okay.
- Okay.

492
00:35:11,759 --> 00:35:14,040
- Hurry up.
- Yes!

493
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,699
- Tanwa, hurry up!
- Tanwa!

494
00:35:16,699 --> 00:35:18,439
- Let's continue!
- Yes!

495
00:35:18,439 --> 00:35:20,379
Hurry up!

496
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,600
You and Duean Yi haven't made up yet?

497
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:43,940
Ever since that day... I still feel bad.

498
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:47,020
Why do you think he disappeared?

499
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,800
I always saw him try to approach you.

500
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,760
You didn't notice?

501
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:59,280
I think for someone who tries a lot,

502
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,730
while the other person doesn't see the importance,

503
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,540
it will be meaningless.

504
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,620
No matter how much they try, it's not worth it.

505
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,980
Can I give you some advice?

506
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,040
If you really like Duean Yi,

507
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,500
you have to put in the effort as well.

508
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,399
What if my relationship... turns out like before?

509
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:29,200
What should I do then?

510
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:34,120
Not everyone in this world is like your ex.

511
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,319
I understand the scar buried in your heart.

512
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:45,520
But it doesn't mean it has to keep you wallowing in misery forever.

513
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,040
Oh hey, Tanwa.

514
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,199
What are you doing here?

515
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:03,979
I'm here to chill with my friends; they are sitting inside.

516
00:37:03,979 --> 00:37:06,540
By the way, what are you doing here?

517
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,940
I came to return some things to Plaengrak.

518
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,880
Since you're personally returning them yourself, it must be important.

519
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,379
It's just an apron.

520
00:37:17,379 --> 00:37:20,759
He let me borrow one when I was learning to make coffee with him.

521
00:37:20,759 --> 00:37:23,899
But now I probably won't be using it anymore.

522
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,860
I know what you're thinking with the matters involving Tanwa.

523
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:43,160
If you're jealous and protective, you should let Duean Yi know.

524
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,880
Do you think Duean Yi... still likes me?

525
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,700
I'll tell you one thing... The song that he wrote for us

526
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:58,920
with all the lyrics... I can feel that they're only about you.

527
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,460
I'll be back.

528
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,500
Duean Yi, can I please talk to you? Just a moment, okay?

529
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,200
What?

530
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,960
Come here.

531
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,980
I'd like to talk to you.

532
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,680
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

533
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,700
I just want to return the apron.

534
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:51,039
Duean Yi, you cannot return it ever again.

535
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,560
Why?

536
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,600
I just feel that it doesn't belong to me anymore.

537
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,020
And I shouldn't keep it.

538
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,919
Because no matter how hard I try,

539
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:08,120
I'm not suitable for this apron.

540
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,760
Normally, I don't give someone an apron that easily.

541
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,240
I don't need to be that person anymore.

542
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:26,440
I think I've had enough.

543
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,160
Since you already pushed me away.

544
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,620
Actually, I shouldn't have come here today.

545
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,840
Duean Yi, please calm down.

546
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,010
About that day... I'm sorry.

547
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,920
I'm really sorry.

548
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:58,140
I understand everything that you tried doing for me.

549
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:04,719
But it's me who's so concerned about the past

550
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:09,959
that it made me neglect the person I'd spend my future with.

551
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,840
I want to ask you for another chance.

552
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,260
Let's start over again, Yi.

553
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:29,280
I'm not sure that everything will be the same as before.

554
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,340
But...

555
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,740
However, I still like you.

556
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,700
Can you promise me...

557
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:51,960
that you'll focus on the future from now on?

558
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,479
Even if the person standing here isn't me.

559
00:40:58,479 --> 00:41:00,939
♫ These average words coming from an average person ♫

560
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:05,959
Don't let your past hurt you again.

561
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:08,040
Yes.

562
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,659
I promise.

563
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:14,059
♫ To penetrate your heart  ♫

564
00:41:14,059 --> 00:41:16,859
May I ask you something?

565
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:21,119
♫ I sing this song from my heart ♫

566
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,619
What's between you and Tanwa?

567
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:30,619
We're just friends.

568
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:33,639
There is nothing between us.

569
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,599
♫ I'm singing to you from my heart ♫

570
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,719
♫ I want you to keep it ♫

571
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,540
♫ As our song ♫

572
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:54,079
♫ This is the first love song, no matter how many
times I sing it for you ♫

573
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:56,439
♫ I'll only do this for one person ♫

574
00:41:56,439 --> 00:42:01,980
When you cry, you look cuter than usual.

575
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:20,999
♫ Time led us to meet, talk and, get to know each other ♫

576
00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:24,919
♫ It's not a coincidence, out of thousands of people ♫

577
00:42:24,919 --> 00:42:28,799
♫ But there's only you inside my heart ♫

578
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,539
♫ I sing this song ♫

579
00:42:31,539 --> 00:42:33,920
Such a crybaby...

580
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,879
♫ I sing to express what's inside my heart ♫

581
00:42:38,879 --> 00:42:41,000
Thank you, Duean Yi.

582
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,020
Thank you for giving me a chance.

583
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,879
♫ This is the first love song ♫

584
00:42:48,879 --> 00:42:51,800
And this... is your apron.

585
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,119
Please don't return it, all right?

586
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:00,939
♫ As our song ♫

587
00:43:00,939 --> 00:43:08,560
♫ This is the first love song, no matter how
many times I sing it for you ♫

588
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:15,340
♫ I'll only do this for one person, and that person is you ♫
