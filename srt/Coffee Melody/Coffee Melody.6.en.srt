1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,359
Today, my Uncle Nawa looks so handsome.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,939
Don't you think, Janjao?

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:09,119
That's right. Your uncle is handsome every day, isn't he?

4
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,739
Of course! Uncle Nawa is handsome every day.

5
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:14,599
Yes.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,000
- Nara.
- Yes?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,219
Today, there are a lot of people coming to watch Uncle Tanwa. Will he be nervous?

8
00:00:21,219 --> 00:00:27,180
You're here cheering him on, he won't be nervous. Trust me.

9
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,799
Let's show our support for Uncle Tanwa.

10
00:00:29,799 --> 00:00:33,820
- Okay! Uncle Tanwa, do your best!
- Yes.

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,759
I feel nervous for you all.

12
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:41,080
Even though we are not on the stage, we are still so nervous.

13
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:47,439
Look, you guys. It's like the Winter members are now true artists.

14
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:49,759
Look at that. The event is full of people.

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,479
I feel happy for them, don't you think?

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,280
Do you guys think it'll be okay to ask if I can go up and perform with them?

17
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,740
Just wait and see. One day we will be standing there.

18
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:04,559
Then you all have to try your best.

19
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,700
They'll try their best as well.

20
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,340
Hello, everyone.

21
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,780
We have all been waiting for this day.

22
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,919
As today is the pre-debut event for, Winter,

23
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,580
I hope you all have a great time.

24
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,179
If everyone is ready,

25
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:26,840
let's give it up for Winter.

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,980
Hello, everyone.

27
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,320
Have you ever heard that some songs

28
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,959
make you miss someone?

29
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:52,300
It is as if that person is hiding in our favorite song.

00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,479
- Thitnuea!
- Yes?

54
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,099
Can we take a photo with you?

55
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:29,459
Today, you sang so well. We really enjoyed it.

56
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:32,460
I'm so proud of you. You did really well.

57
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:36,839
You said all of that, what's left for us to say?

58
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,159
Sure.

59
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,199
- Here, let's take photos.
- I'll take it.

60
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,359
All right, let's get the whole band.

61
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,879
- This time don't mess me up, Paula.
- Take a photo of the whole band.

62
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,780
Okay, let's do it.

63
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,259
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

64
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:53,919
Wow! That was amazing guys! So hip!

65
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,419
The phrase you used showed your age, Madam!

66
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:58,440
This little—!

67
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,859
When you are singing, you look really cool.

68
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:06,419
That's right. It was such a success this time.

69
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:08,939
I hope we can do the same next time, okay?

70
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:14,320
I think once the debut day arrives, the band will be popular for sure!

71
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,999
Today, my uncle is so cool!

72
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:21,480
What? Am I just cool for today?

73
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,399
Thanks to everyone for looking after Sekram.

74
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:29,839
If it wasn't for you guys,

75
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,400
I can't imagine if there would be anyone else who would look after him this well.

76
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,040
I think we have to give credit to Janjao.

77
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,659
Agree. She took care of us so well,

78
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:43,599
that's why we are able to get through it.

79
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,059
Agree. Otherwise, Sekram and Tanwa would have fought each other to death.

80
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:50,759
Of course! Everything is because of Janjao!

81
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,299
Aww, you too, Miss Mermaid.

82
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:55,539
If it wasn't for you, we wouldn't be here as well.

83
00:06:55,539 --> 00:07:00,160
But I hope that the debut day will be better than this.

84
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,640
Right, Janjao?

85
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,000
Yes.

86
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,860
We want to thank you all so much

87
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,599
for always pushing and believing in us.

88
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:23,179
You all can wait and see our debut day, we will make it better for sure. Right guys?

89
00:07:23,179 --> 00:07:26,240
- Yay!
- Yay!

90
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,719
Uncle Nawa, please don't scold Janjao.

91
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:33,399
If you scold her again, I will hit you.

92
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,279
I was just speaking normally Meji.

93
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,999
Anyway, you cannot scold again Uncle. Okay?

94
00:07:40,999 --> 00:07:43,680
I understand, my dear niece.

95
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,399
You guys did so well today.

96
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,880
May I sign up to be a fan?

97
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,920
- Of course.
- So cute.

98
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,780
Hey, are you standing here alone because

99
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,340
you're the songwriter or the female lead in the music video?

100
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:07,700
You always like to exaggerate.

101
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,860
Oh, I just saw you talking to your colleagues.

102
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,340
What did Nawa say?

103
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,559
Well, it's the usual.

104
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,940
I'm starting to think about

105
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,940
whether I'm fit for this place or not.

106
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,639
Don't tell me that you…

107
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:31,479
I might find somewhere new that's more suitable for me.

108
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:36,660
Because my dream won't change anyway.

109
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,160
Just the fact that you know what you want should be enough.

110
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,580
But when I see the members right now, I can't help but worry.

111
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,459
- Anyway, don't change the subject.
- What?

112
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,819
When did you and Plaengrak get back together?

113
00:08:56,819 --> 00:09:01,760
Darn, that means I'm the one who becomes a joke?
(T/N: Because she interfered between Yi and Plaeng)

114
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,540
Well... the other day I went to return the apron to him.

115
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,479
After talking about this and that...

116
00:09:10,479 --> 00:09:13,799
he apologized and said he liked me too.

117
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:17,000
He wanted a chance... something along those lines.

118
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,320
My friend is so pretty.

119
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,520
Tanwa.

120
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,680
Here, for you.

121
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,460
You did well today.

122
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,320
Thank you, Yi.

123
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,999
Wait. What? Why?

124
00:09:57,999 --> 00:10:00,200
Stop what you are thinking.

125
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,700
Tanwa and I are just like brothers.

126
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,340
And what was the flower for?

127
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,780
I just want to thank him about that day.

128
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,239
Fine, if you say so.

129
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:15,560
You're annoying.

130
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,340
What? Don't act guilty.

131
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,720
Is my barista tired today?

132
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:45,320
I'm so tired today. I'm completely exhausted.

133
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,020
Will someone massage me?

134
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,330
Plaengrak,

135
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,440
is something wrong?

136
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,080
Are you mad at me?

137
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,239
Plaengrak.

138
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:09,939
I saw you giving flowers to Tanwa after the concert in front of the café.

139
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:13,920
And also, you went with Janjao, but I saw you hugging him.

140
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,140
When we had an argument.

141
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:27,560
I gave him those flowers... as a thank you.

142
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,440
If you won't stop sulking,

143
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,980
I will start to sulk as well.

144
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:42,360
One... Two... Three...

145
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,760
Okay, I'm sorry.

146
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,120
I'm not sulking anymore.

147
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,560
You're being unfair!

148
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,280
Are you jealous?

149
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,720
Well...

150
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,200
Who's jealous? No one here is jealous!

151
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:04,900
It's actually kind of cute when you're sulking.

152
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,579
Stop it.

153
00:12:06,579 --> 00:12:09,000
You always like to tease.

154
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,600
Let's go for a walk.

155
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,279
Okay, let me clear this up first.

156
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,360
What the heck?

157
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,559
Gosh, you.

158
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:22,600
You stopped sulking so quickly.

159
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,880
We have walked so far, can you tell me where we are going?

160
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,840
It's a secret.

161
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,620
If I tell you, then it won't be a surprise.

162
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,960
But taking a walk is also good.

163
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,100
It's like I get to rest my mind.

164
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,820
I feel like we both don't have time to go out anywhere.

165
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,540
Maybe getting out to explore new places

166
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:57,440
helps to heal the heart, too.

167
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,160
That's true.

168
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,959
- Oh, Plaengrak.
- Yes?

169
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,220
Can I ask you something?

170
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,420
Sure.

171
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:15,260
Why did you decide to open up to me again?

172
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,700
Actually...

173
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,340
After I thought about it,

174
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,500
I don't want my future to be affected because of my past.

175
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,680
Like what I told you before.

176
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,440
I want to follow my own heart.

177
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:51,639
Like the way you like me and are always trying to win my heart. Remember?

178
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,560
Duean Yi.

179
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,260
Yes?

180
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,120
From now on, you don't have to try alone anymore.

181
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,920
Because I like you, too.

182
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:26,560
Thank you.

183
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,160
You're welcome.

184
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,079
I heard that someone wrote a song for me.

185
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:41,020
And it was also emotional.

186
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,960
Is that right?

187
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,340
Do you want to listen to it?

188
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,419
- Can I?
- Sure.

189
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:51,800
Please let me hear it then.

190
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,060
Oh.

191
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,719
But if you listen to the song,

192
00:15:00,719 --> 00:15:02,960
please don't tease me. Okay?

193
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,800
I won't.

194
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,839
♫ Every time I listen to a love song ♫

195
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,500
♫ I always think of you ♫

196
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,559
♫ And dream about you every day ♫

197
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:34,620
♫ There is someone the love song is written for ♫

198
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:38,280
Is it, Plaengrak (Love song)?

199
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:42,499
♫ And hearing the words, "love" in the song ♫

200
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:47,439
♫ I will send this song to you ♫

201
00:15:47,439 --> 00:15:50,100
♫ And I hope you feel the same way ♫

202
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,699
It's a nice song.

203
00:15:51,699 --> 00:15:52,920
Thank you.

204
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:57,540
♫ I'm the one who's delusional ♫

205
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,919
Not that. I'd like your hand.

206
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:01,560
Okay.

207
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,940
♫ That you do not love ♫

208
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,660
♫ That you do not accept ♫

209
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,840
♫ You won't feel affected, no matter how much you listen to it ♫

210
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,679
♫ It's just a love song ♫

211
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,779
Watch me, okay?

212
00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:16,359
♫ But instead I am heartbroken ♫

213
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,019
Wow, Duean Yi!

214
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,759
You're so good.

215
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,360
Catch!

216
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,160
- Aren't you going to keep playing it?
- I have had enough.

217
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,520
I never noticed there was a nice place like this here.

218
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,700
I have never done something like this before either.

219
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,740
I've only seen it in those drama series.

220
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,080
It seem pretty romantic.

221
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:05,220
I think nowhere is as important as being with that person.

222
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,780
You such a sweet talker.

223
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,160
After sitting here like this,

224
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,520
I feel like we get to think about a lot.

225
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,420
Yes.

226
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,070
Usually, I'm sitting in a small little room every day.

227
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:46,720
Wherever I looked, I could see only blank walls.

228
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,619
Writing songs, eating, and sleeping.

229
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:53,400
And hanging out with Janjao.

230
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,020
Now that I got to walk around like this,

231
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,480
I'm feeling so happy.

232
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,380
Duean Yi.

233
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,240
I would like to thank you.

234
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,300
I am also really happy.

235
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,080
I almost forgot that

236
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,760
I haven't been this happy for quite some time.

237
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,180
And please don't play hard to get.

238
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:38,739
Got it.

239
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:42,460
♫ I always think of you ♫

240
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,559
♫ And dream about you every day ♫

241
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,639
♫ There is someone the love song is written for ♫

242
00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:52,279
♫ It seems their wish came true after listening to it ♫

243
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:56,540
♫ And hearing the words, "love" in the song ♫

244
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:01,379
♫ I will send this song to you ♫

245
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:05,799
♫ And I hope you feel the same way ♫

246
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:13,060
♫ But it turns out, I'm the one who's delusional ♫

247
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:17,999
♫ It's just a love song, that you do not love ♫

248
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,679
♫ That you do not accept ♫

249
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,879
♫ You won't feel affected, no matter how much you listen to it ♫

250
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,679
♫ It's just a love song ♫

251
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:29,199
Are you okay, Duean Yi?

252
00:19:29,199 --> 00:19:31,220
Duean Yi!

253
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,179
Are you okay?

254
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,280
Plaengrak...

255
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,940
Are you already drunk?

256
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,259
Smile for me.

257
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:43,219
Duean Yi, my face is over here.

258
00:19:43,219 --> 00:19:47,199
Didn't you say you can handle alcohol? You're weak!

259
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,880
Duean Yi, it's time to go home.

260
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,300
I'm not going home. I'll sleep here.

261
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:59,500
Duean Yi... Duean Yi, what's going on?

262
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,600
Get up first. Duean Yi, get up.

263
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,900
Duean Yi...

264
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,600
You can't sleep right here. You have to get home.

265
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,500
Of course, I can sleep here.

266
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,100
No, you can't.

267
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,900
- Plaengrak.
- What?

268
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,500
Have you ever seen a dolphin?

269
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,500
What dolphin? Duean Yi!

270
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,800
Duean Yi! Get up first!

271
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,000
Duean Yi, please cooperate.

272
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
One, two, three.

273
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,000
Come on, let's go home.

274
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Come, I can give you a piggyback.

275
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,500
One, two, three.

276
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,100
Are you all right?

277
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,900
Just hop onto my back.

278
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,000
We are going home now, all right?

279
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,600
Let's go.

280
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,800
Walk up to the door first.

281
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,000
Be careful, there are stairs. One step.

282
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,600
Can you do it?

283
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,400
Walk carefully.

284
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:16,100
Duean Yi. Are you okay?

285
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,200
We're at your place now.

286
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,500
I will put you down on the sofa.

287
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,300
Are you ready? Take it easy.

288
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,879
Duean Yi, are you really okay?

289
00:21:30,879 --> 00:21:34,300
Bring the pillow up and sleep properly.

290
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,800
Is that okay?

291
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,000
Duean Yi, I'll get going now.

292
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,500
- Can't you stay?
- I have to leave.

293
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,400
I have to open the café early tomorrow morning.

294
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,700
Please don't, Plaengrak.

295
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,800
I don't want to be alone. Please stay.

296
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,400
Okay, I'll stay.

297
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,700
Then I'll bring you a blanket, so you won't be cold.

298
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,800
Let me go, I'll be back with it soon.

299
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,400
Okay.

300
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,300
Lift your legs.

301
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,100
Okay.

302
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,500
I'm not going anywhere.

303
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,900
Are you okay?

304
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,500
You always like to tease me.

305
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,600
Scoot over a little, I'll sleep too.

306
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,400
Wow!

307
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,200
Since you're making that face, you're hungry. Aren't you?

308
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:37,900
I see that the barista is very determined.

309
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,800
Who wouldn't want some?

310
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,800
Then, Mr. Customer shall have the Ethiopia coffee as usual. Right?

311
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,000
Anything is fine actually.

312
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Whatever the barista think is good.

313
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,300
That's enough.

314
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,100
Here you go.

315
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,300
How was last night? Did you sleep well?

316
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,100
Very well.

317
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,900
Thank you. And...

318
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,700
I'm sorry for acting like a burden.

319
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,800
I still don't know how I came back.

320
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,300
Duean Yi.

321
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:27,500
When you go out with me, I can take care of you.

322
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,900
But if you go with someone else, you have to take care of yourself.

323
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,200
I will.

324
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:41,300
I didn't know you can play an instrument.

325
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,900
Just a little bit.

326
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,600
My dad was a musician before.

327
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:56,500
Oh, that is the reason why your name is Plaengrak. Right?

328
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,100
Let's see.

329
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:11,300
In the past, when my dad asked my mom to get married,

330
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,800
he wrote a song for my mom.

331
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,500
That's how I got my name, Plaengrak (love song).

332
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:27,300
The meaning comes from the love of two people.

333
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,200
♫ For a man to kneel ♫

334
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,700
That is so romantic.

335
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,000
♫ In front of hundreds and thousands of people ♫

336
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
But I think you are better than me.

337
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,500
Can you teach me?

338
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,960
Sure. What did you just play?

339
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,800
This one.

340
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,200
Right here.

341
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,400
- Is this right?
- Yes.

342
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:58,600
♫ It means, from this moment to eternity ♫

343
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,700
♫ He will spend it with you ♫

344
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,600
I think you should teach me.

345
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,100
I'll show you how to play.

346
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:14,100
♫ That overflows for you from within ♫

347
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,300
♫ It is a loyalty ♫

348
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,500
♫ That's worth more ♫

349
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,400
Can you do that?

350
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,000
♫ If only you accepted it ♫

351
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,600
♫ With all your heart for me ♫

352
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,700
♫ It would be nice if you finally answered ♫

353
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,700
♫ Please answer me with one word ♫

354
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,300
♫ I do. Yes, I do ♫

355
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:47,500
♫ If only you accepted it ♫

356
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,400
Let's have you teach me to play the piano now...

357
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,100
I'll show you one more time.

358
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,200
You didn't even place your fingers correctly.

359
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,500
Everyone, today, Duean Yi has brought us the lyrics.

360
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,100
Let's have you guys try practicing first.

361
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,400
Because he still needs to revise it anyway.

362
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,700
And if anyone has any suggestions or if you want to add to the lyrics, feel free to tell me.

363
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,310
- I'm excited.
- True, so excited!

364
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,520
Come on, we will just do our best.

365
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,080
You can do it!

366
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:42,719
Look who is finally here.

367
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:44,520
He's smiling already.

368
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,479
Someone came late...

369
00:29:47,479 --> 00:29:50,400
I think his salary will be reduced.

370
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,199
I know, right? I wonder what happened last night,

371
00:29:54,199 --> 00:29:56,159
for him to come in late like this.

372
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,700
Hey, why don't you two just ask him where he went last night?

373
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,179
Right, Plaengrak?

374
00:30:01,179 --> 00:30:05,720
That's right, where were you last night?

375
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,799
- He's silent.
- Well Well.

376
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,680
Are you going to tell us, or do we have to play detectives?

377
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,839
Let's investigate.

378
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,280
Why are you all asking? I didn't go anywhere.

379
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,270
Last night, I...

380
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,100
was at my own place.

381
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,200
- Your own place?
- Go back to work.

382
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,799
If you four enter the café after me, I'll reduce your payments.

383
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,299
What? Why is that?

384
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,639
Let's go, quick! Go!

385
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,759
- Hurry! Go!
- I'm going.

386
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,060
Oh my gosh!

387
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,860
- I'm going to wash the glasses.
- Gosh, you!

388
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,679
Gene.

389
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:45,579
- Yes?
- Can you deliver coffee for me?

390
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:47,139
Sure. Where to?

391
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:49,340
To Winter's practice room.

392
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,980
Why did you make that face?

393
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:59,680
Oh... I guess you don't want to see Thitnuea, right?

394
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,410
No way!

395
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:03,810
Who would think like that? Not me.

396
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,820
Then quickly deliver it.

397
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,920
Why don't you let Tasmin or Bai Bua deliver it?

398
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,119
Okay. Fine, I'll go.

399
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:17,500
Suddenly you guys got busy, huh?

400
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:22,799
All right. Quickly deliver it before... Thitnuea has been waiting for too long.

401
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,399
Brother!
(T/N: Hia is the Chinese word for Brother)

402
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,359
Say it clearly. If you changed your tone a bit, you'd be cursing at me.

403
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:30,679
Sure, Brother Plaengrak.

404
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,099
Go on now.

405
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,760
Hold it properly, you will spill it.

406
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:40,679
Hey, let me get into the frame too.

407
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:45,340
The picture actually looks good without Tanwa in the frame, I think.

408
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:51,399
Let's find the best angle that fits everyone.

409
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:53,260
How about...

410
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:57,360
- No, not this one.
- Excuse me, coffee is here!

411
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,279
What are you looking at?

412
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,820
You think I'm always going to tease you.

413
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:10,119
They say that guys like to tease someone pretty.

414
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,359
Sure!

415
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:12,379
- I just...
- I'm leaving.

416
00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:15,199
Why are you in such a hurry?

417
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:19,239
I was just going to ask you to film us while we practice.

418
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,639
I have work to do too!

419
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,480
- I'll talk to Plaengrak.
- No, don't!

420
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:29,360
Hey, Plaeng! Let me borrow Gene for a moment.

421
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,940
Okay. Sure. Okay.

422
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,460
- Nuea!
- It's fine now.

423
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,500
- I have not agreed to this.
- Please? Please?

424
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,400
Please film us.

425
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,020
All right, fine.

426
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:46,419
Come guys, let's get ready.

427
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:48,140
Please make sure I'm handsome.

428
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:50,060
That'll be difficult.

429
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,140

- What?

444
00:33:46,099 --> 00:33:49,079
What the heck were you filming? All you can see are our feet.

445
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:53,420
Oh... sorry, I thought I was filming your faces.

446
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,999
No!

447
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:58,919
I meant I'll refilm it for you. Go on.

448
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:00,720
- Go!
- Go!

449
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,799
- We were tricked.
- One, two, three, start!

450
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,419
- Be calm.
- I'm filming now!

451
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:09,880
If you're going to film like that, you can just go back to work.

452
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,060
Gene.

453
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,600
You did well filming today.

454
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,540
Nuea, watch if I lose my job,

455
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:21,860
it's your responsibility.

456
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,500
Thank you so much for today.

457
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,959
I'll have to go.

458
00:34:30,959 --> 00:34:32,639
here are a lot of customers in the evening.

459
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,200
Bai Bua must be complaining like crazy now.

460
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,340
- Gene.
- Yes?

461
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,639
What's up?

462
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:46,460
Well... I wanted to ask you...

463
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,770
When are you free?

464
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:54,220
Or when is your day off?

465
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,640
Nuea...

466
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm going to be honest.

467
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:13,360
You mean...

468
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,680
I don't want it to be like this anymore.

469
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,240
Did I upset you or do something wrong?

470
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,260
Please listen to me.

471
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:39,859
You should buy a tripod, or I can go and buy it for you.

472
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:43,319
I wasn't talking about that!

473
00:35:43,319 --> 00:35:45,760
Oh, really?

474
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:50,419
Yes... next week I'm free.

475
00:35:50,419 --> 00:35:52,560
I wanted to ask you out to eat.

476
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:59,840
Eat, go for a walk, and watch a movie. Stuff like that.

477
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,640
Just like a date.

478
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,900
I have to go!

479
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,780
I'll call you!

480
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:19,220
Janjao? Janjao!

481
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,820
What is going on? Why are you avoiding me?

482
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,720
I should be the one to ask you instead.

483
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,700
Hold on! It's you who are suddenly acting like this.

484
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,280
Why are you acting like this with me?

485
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,900
Are you the same Janjao that I know?

486
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,999
This is how I usually am.

487
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:48,700
I know what I am doing.

488
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:54,879
As for work, I am doing the best I can.

489
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,560
It's you who always tries to nitpick me.

490
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,700
I never did that. Aren't you thinking too much?

491
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,200
Nawa.

492
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,410
I am your subordinate.

493
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:10,320
I am your employee on a salary.

494
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:16,519
If you are angry because I didn't do a good job, I can accept it.

495
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:20,820
But if you are angry because I don't like you,

496
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,900
I don't think that's right.

497
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,359
How can I do that?

498
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,770
Suddenly, you just changed,

499
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,660
since that day.

500
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,020
Nawa.

501
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,190
The most important thing right now,

502
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:43,000
is that we have to work together.

503
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:49,120
I don't want these matters to become a problem in the future.

504
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,080
That means, what we have between us

505
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,880
cannot evolve into something more?

506
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,520
Do you realize...

507
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:12,120
that what you are doing right now is destroying someone's dream.

508
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,620
Just because that person does not agree with your needs.

509
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:22,380
Isn't this called a selfish person?

510
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,340
If we still have to work together,

511
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,360
please don't let emotions interfere with work.

512
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,600
Please excuse me.
