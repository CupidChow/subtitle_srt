1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,719
It's all because of you! By the time I got to sleep,

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:06,879
I tried so much of your coffee that I wasn't able to shut my eyes.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,220
You are exaggerating!

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:11,560
But at least, this time, it didn't explode, isn't that better?

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,639
Oh, wow! Have you ever been this focused on work? Tell me.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,799
You are exaggerating again.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,920
What exaggeration?

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,700
I have known you for ten years

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,040
and have never seen you like coffee or baking.

10
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,559
But as soon as you like a guy, you even bought a new oven.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,759
I'm astounded.

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,559
Of course!

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,759
If I want something, I work hard for it.

14
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,099
Oh, please.

15
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:38,039
Fine! If this time you come back crying,

16
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,840
I say you'll be drinking coffee instead of liquor for sure.

17
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,920
Sure. I'll wait for when you have these issues.

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,179
Oh! About Plaengrak and Thitnuea,

19
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:52,360
there's nothing going on between them.

20
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,840
How did you know?

21
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,219
Gene told me about it.

22
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:00,159
Woah! He is a real detective.

23
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,199
They were close childhood friends,

24
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,880
and Plaeng got his heart broken really badly.

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,480
Which makes Thitnuea really worried about him.

26
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,240
Oh...

27
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,719
Got it. This time I will do my best.

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,500
Sure, sure. I'll wait and see.

29
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,640
I'm so hungry.

30
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,279
We are about to start practice.

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,159
- Can I go and eat first?
- I'm actually also hungry.

32
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,440
It's kind of serious.

33
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,920
- Hello.
- Hello

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,630
Everyone, please follow me.

35
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:43,500
Yes, Ma'am.

36
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,319
Let's go.

37
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,600
We'll practice first and then go eat.

38
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,540
Excuse me, Duean Yi...

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,340
What is it?

40
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,680
Well, I have something to tell you about Plaeng.

41
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,860
Also, you were mad at me yesterday, weren't you?

42
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,760
Oh... no.

43
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,560
Well, actually a little bit.

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,100
Plaeng and I have been close since we were kids.

45
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,680
And also, there's nothing going on between us.

46
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,100
Gene already told me about it.

47
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,300
Gene?

48
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,600
Oh, it's nothing. Please continue.

49
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,060
The reason I'm around and near Plaeng so much,

50
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,360
it's because I'm worried about him.

51
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,620
I'm scared that he will get hurt again, like what happened with his ex.

52
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,660
His ex?

53
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,700
He was dating someone.

54
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,680
They were together for several years.

55
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,180
But suddenly that person left him.

56
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,640
He was so miserable at that time.

57
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,880
But you don't have to stress about it.

58
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,540
If you're serious about him, I'll root for you.

59
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,399
Do you really mean it?

60
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,870
You are not playing with me, right?

61
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,620
I mean it.

62
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,079
And one more thing.

63
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,020
From now on, I have to focus more on my band.

64
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,340
So you don't have to worry about the ship between Plaeng and me.

65
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,240
We won't be as sweet as before.

66
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,400
And if you have anything, feel free to ask me.

67
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,240
Thank you so much.

68
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,440
But one day we might have to ship the new couple,

69
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,440
like Plaeng-Yi?

70
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,160
- I'm rooting for you.
- Okay.

71
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,279
Let's get inside.

72
00:03:51,279 --> 00:03:53,080
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

73
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,640
[Half Moon | Slow Bar Coffee]

74
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,720
Plaeng, can I ask you something?

75
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,739
What's going on between you and Thitnuea?

76
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,000
You have worked here for quite some time. Why are you asking now?

77
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:20,840
You do know that Duean Yi really likes you, right?

78
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,680
If you don't like him,

79
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,760
you should tell him frankly.

80
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,459
You are blabbering too much.

81
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:34,159
Well, I just don't want you to give him false hope.

82
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,980
So annoying!

83
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,620
Hot guys always have people pursuing them.

84
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,559
Can I say something as well?

85
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:43,159
What do you want to say? Say it!

86
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,920
Because I'm totally single since birth.

87
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,339
Like, I've been keeping my virginity since I was born!

88
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:50,340
What about Thitnuea?

89
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,240
Stop it! Don't say it.

90
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,760
I'll wait and see about it.

91
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,820
You'll have to wait forever,

92
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,660
because a good-looking person like me

93
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,900
is unaffected. Do you understand "unaffected"?

94
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,419
Get back to work.

95
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:08,220
Fine.

96
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,220
By the way, will someone come to see you today?

97
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,820
I heard that yesterday

98
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,400
he left with a sulky and gloomy expression.

99
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,080
If you are being too arrogant, be careful of getting dumped.

100
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,220
Gene!

101
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,350
Yes?

102
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:29,180
Are you going to stop talking or stop working? Your choice.

103
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,500
I'll stop talking.

104
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,840
Is that so?

105
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,880
Okay.

106
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,460
There's some water left. I'm sorry, Gene.

107
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,880
Go back to work.

108
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,780
Hey now!

109
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,240
I saw you get shy speaking of Duean Yi.

110
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,339
Good thing that I called to remind you three days before.

111
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:01,080
Otherwise, you wouldn't be sitting here for Pa and Ma's anniversary.

112
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,360
You are overstating it.

113
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,640
Today is an important day, how could I forget?

114
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,399
But last time, I remembered you forgot to come.

115
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:12,260
- Hey, how's this?
- See? Just as I said.

116
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,550
There's a witness here. right?

117
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:17,100
Oh...

118
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,359
- Here's your present.
- Wow.

119
00:06:20,359 --> 00:06:24,199
Duean Ai and I carefully picked it out for you two.

120
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,600
- Thank you so much, Son.
- Yes, Ma.

121
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,180
Thank you so much. How kind of you.

122
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,220
There are two of us, but only one present.

123
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,620
- Pa...
- It's good that they gave us a gift.

124
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,420
I'm just kidding. Thank you so much.

125
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,720
- Okay.
- Thank you.

126
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,740
Oh, and how is it going right now?

127
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,639
Ai told us that you are writing a new song.

128
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,619
Oh, yes, Ma.

129
00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:52,080
Janjao is debuting a new band, so she wanted me to help write a song.

130
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,719
I am almost done with it. I think it'll be very successful.

131
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,680
Does that mean you still like write lyrics?

132
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,420
- Yes, Pa.
- That's cool.

133
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,380
I'm glad you like to do what you love.

134
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,359
At first, we wanted you to help out your brother because we were worried.

135
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:13,320
But hearing this, I'm relieved now.

136
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:15,920
- What a relief, right?
- Yes.

137
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,760
Don't forget to tell us when the song is out.

138
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:21,259
We will help you increase the views!

139
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,999
And I will help you too, Uncle.

140
00:07:24,999 --> 00:07:26,239
- There you go!
- Oh, wow.

141
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,899
There are three strong fighters to help increase the views.

142
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:31,339
- Me too, right?
- That's correct!

143
00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:32,959
You're laughing so freely.

144
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,580
So, are there any young men interested in my son yet?

145
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
- Oh!
- Honey.

146
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,459
How can you ask him that? He'll get shy.

147
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:47,060
- Am I too blunt?
- Yes.

148
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,359
But seriously, do you have any?

149
00:07:50,359 --> 00:07:51,620
- Oh, dear.
- Do you have a boyfriend?

150
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:57,819
If you do, let me know and quickly bring him home to meet us.

151
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:02,000
I will prepare a big table of food to welcome him.

152
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,319
Just wait until I have one first.

153
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,700
Actually, there is someone that I like right now.

154
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,559
- Who is it?
- Who?

155
00:08:09,559 --> 00:08:11,219
Let's wait until he likes me back first,

156
00:08:11,219 --> 00:08:14,199
then I will quickly bring him home for introductions.

157
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:16,959
Okay, you can do it, Dear!

158
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:25,439
Let me tell you something. Before I could be with your dad, it wasn't easy.

159
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:31,059
Back then, I didn't look like this. My face was brighter than yours. As beautiful as jade.

160
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:33,160
My hair was this long.

161
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,320
But now, I'm going bald!

162
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,640
She wanted to be with me so much, that she cooked a meal for me every day.

163
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,919
If it was edible I ate it, if not I gave it to my friends.

164
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,159
She wanted to win my heart because I'm handsome!

165
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,340
- Honey! Are you serious?
- What?

166
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,720
I'm speaking the truth. What's wrong with that? He has to know.

167
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,700
- Everyone, calm down.
- Why would you tell him!?

168
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,739
- It's embarrassing.
- Don't fight over it.

169
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:54,460
- Let's make peace.
- Just calm down.

170
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,320
Anyways, I know you can do it!

171
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,979
But the important thing is you must take care of yourself, too.

172
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:05,840
I will, Pa.

173
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,240
Come, let's eat.

174
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,080
- Oh, I almost forgot about that.
- We got carried away.

175
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,000
Let's eat.

176
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,779
I'll go and help Aunty.

177
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,060
Yes, thank you so much.

178
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,239
Oh, Duean Yi.

179
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:32,039
I think our parents are starting to understand your life better.

180
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:37,260
Both in your work and life.

181
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,040
How about you? How are you doing?

182
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,659
Me? I'm doing fine.

183
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:46,360
Most days I'm busy with Pa and Ma.

184
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,979
But sometimes... I envy you a little.

185
00:09:50,979 --> 00:09:54,040
You get to experience living on your own.

186
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:57,060
Come on, Brother!

187
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,799
I'm just joking.

188
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,119
How's your work going?

189
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:03,659
It's fine,

190
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:07,680
but I'm just out of ideas at the moment.

191
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,819
If you can't think of anything, you can just come back home, too.

192
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:15,000
I think Pa and Ma miss you a whole lot.

193
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,400
By the way, Brother,

194
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,220
it seems the person that I like

195
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,460
doesn't want to be in a relationship at the moment.

196
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,640
Do you think I should keep trying?

197
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,590
Well, do you like him a lot?

198
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,879
I like him a lot!

199
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,660
I liked him since the first time I met him.

200
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,439
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

201
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,200
If you really like him,

202
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,759
then I think you should do your best.

203
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,810
Fight till the end.

204
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,460
Then, what if he doesn't like me in the end?

205
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,840
At least you tried, right?

206
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,180
Here's the thing, Yi.

207
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,639
I think that once we've grown up,

208
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:01,519
the things that we desire or want to do

209
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,880
will become harder to attain.

210
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:12,460
But if you want to get them or do those things, I think you have to keep trying.

211
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,759
Because although you're disappointed in the end,

212
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,620
at least you tried your best.

213
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,380
Aww, you said it so well. Let me hug you!

214
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,679
No, I'm dirty right now.

215
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,719
C'mon, let me hug you!

216
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,440
You're still whiny even though you're grown.

217
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,100
So you really like him?

218
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,579
Yes, a lot!

219
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:41,300
- Thank you, Brother!
- Yes, yes, yes.

220
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,239
Continue washing the dishes now.

221
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,079
- Aren't you going to help?
- No.

222
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,760
- Help me!
- I don't want to get my hands dirty.

223
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,460
[Half Moon | Slow Bar Coffee]

224
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,279
May I have a cup of special coffee for a special person?

225
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,500
Of course, Sir.

226
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,059
- Gene!
- What is it?

227
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:15,720
Come here, come here!

228
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:21,000
I want the most delicious one, as if you are making it for your boyfriend.

229
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,160
You haven't been around here for quite some time.

230
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,180
Have you found a new favorite place?

231
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:31,159
I'm not someone who changes my mind easily.

232
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,119
I don't know what the barista puts into the coffee.

233
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,130
But when I drink at another café, it's not as addicting as this one.

234
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,720
Do you still want to learn how to make coffee?

235
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,620
I'll teach you. I just received a lot of new coffee beans.

236
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:50,880
Do you want me to learn how to make coffee or do you just miss me?

237
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,439
I'll be here tonight then.

238
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,599
Okay, sure. I'll cook for you, all right?

239
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,399
You're taking such good care of me.

240
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:10,400
You must already like me, right?

241
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,299
When you were gone, were you charging energy to come and flirt with me?

242
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:17,799
It's not like that.

243
00:13:17,799 --> 00:13:20,080
Well... I'll see you later then.

244
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,730
Okay.

245
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,940
- I'm going.
- Okay.

246
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,279
I will sleep at the café tonight.

247
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,820
In case someone cooks me some food, too.

248
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,159
- Gene!
- What?

249
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:41,639
I worked here for a year, and never got to eat even a single fried egg.

250
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,879
But what is this? You're making desserts and food

251
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,279
but you say you don't like him. Look at you!

252
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:51,179
- I just...
- Just what?

253

♪ I just want to call you, my lover ♪

254

255

Gosh!

00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,100
May I have green tea, please?

259
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,599
- Do you have it yet?
- Yes!

260
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:15,050
How many more minutes?

261
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,859
Just a moment, please. Just a moment.

262
00:14:17,859 --> 00:14:19,539
- Come here, come here!
- Is mine ready yet?

263
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:22,279
- Just a moment, please.
- Can you check how much longer it'll be?

264
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,479
Is mine ready?

265
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:25,159
Just a moment, please.

266
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,899
Just a moment...

267
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,339
Excuse me. Is my cappuccino ready yet?

268
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:32,360
I've been waiting for a while for my mocha.

269
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,500
Plaeng!

270
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,300
- Let me help you.
- It's okay, I can handle this.

271
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,919
- That tea is mine.
- Is my cappuccino ready?

272
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:51,920
- Here.
- Are you done yet?

273
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,359
- Can I have mine?
- Is anything done yet?

274
00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:00,079
- What would you like?
- Mine is mocha, which I've already ordered.

275
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,639
Okay, mocha.

276
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:03,239
Here's the not-so-sweet mocha.

277
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:05,760
Next please, what would you like?

278
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,280
Here you go.

279
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,920
I didn't order this.

280
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,040
I'm really sorry.

281
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,499
I didn't get a straw, how could I drink this?

282
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:29,839
I will quickly get it for you. Just a second, please.

283
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:30,779
Here's your straw.

284
00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:33,040
- Thank you.
- Is that everything?

285
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,359
This is so fun!

286
00:15:45,359 --> 00:15:47,759
If I wasn't here to help,

287
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,040
the customers would have complained like crazy.

288
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,319
Bro, can I seriously ask you?

289
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,359
If he's working so hard like this,

290
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:57,580
why don't you hire him permanently?

291
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,280
Don't say it like that.

292
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,119
Anyway, I have to go now.

293
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:05,399
Bye, Bro. Bye, Yi.

294
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,000
- See you, Gene.
- See you.

295
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,220
I have to thank you.

296
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,980
I didn't expect there would be so many customers.

297
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,560
It's nothing, don't worry.

298
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,000
To be honest, I missed those times

299
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,420
when I first opened this café.

300
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:55,120
I organized, made coffee, and even served the customers.

301
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,880
But back then there weren't as many customers as now.

302
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,340
At that time, didn't you have anyone to help?

303
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,420
I did.

304
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,300
But I wanted to do everything myself.

305
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,400
So I could understand everything when others came to help me.

306
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,100
Hearing this makes me feel happy for your staff.

307
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,980
To have such a great boss like you.

308
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,000
It's nothing like that.

309
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,200
And I am also happy for myself,

310
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,500
for agreeing to come here with Janjao that day.

311
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,520
Or else, I wouldn't be right here with you.

312
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,770
You're a sweet talker.

313
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,179
Are you hot?

314
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:06,059
Of course. I'm tired, too!

315
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:08,060
I'll fan you.

316
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,200
Thank you.

317
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,359
- Hello? Is anyone there?
- Why am I being interrupted right now?

318
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:30,180
You never open the door right away.

319
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,780
- Hello!
- Yes?

320
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,279
My dear friend's favorite snack!

321
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:38,620
Thank you.

322
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,460
Come in.

323
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,420
So, why are you here?

324
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,280
Why did you ask it like that?

325
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,399
Anyways, how was it going back home?

326
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,639
It's pretty good. Mom asked about you, too.

327
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:57,480
Really?

328
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,199
How is the band, Winter, going?

329
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:06,540
The promotion plan that I came up with, never fails.

330
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:11,480
And all the band members seem to be practicing hard.

331
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,479
I think... it's going pretty well.

332
00:19:15,479 --> 00:19:19,340
Oh, hey. How is Nawa doing?

333
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,340
It seems like he trusts me with this project.

334
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,120
Luckily, he thinks that I can do it.

335
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,799
What kind of person is so handsome and kind like this?

336
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:38,319
If I didn't already have Plaengrak, I'd pursue Nawa myself.

337
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,439
Dude, you act like Plaengrak is already yours.

338
00:19:42,439 --> 00:19:43,959
That's enough.

339
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:46,379
Why are we trying to be such drama queens?

340
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:48,359
Why?

341
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:53,579
Plaengrak invited me to dinner at the café today.

342
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:55,719
Seriously?

343
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,159
It's not like that. I'm just being delusional.

344
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:02,860
But I'm still going to learn how to make coffee with him,

345
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,020
and he said he would cook for me today.

346
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,919
Isn't this considered a date though?

347
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:11,179
Oh! Gosh!

348
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:14,920
He sounds like a male lead in a Korean drama!

349
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:19,159
I think I'm going to surprise him today.

350
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:20,999
What are you going to surprise him with?

351
00:20:20,999 --> 00:20:23,540
I'm not going to tell you.

352
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,500
Fine! Suit yourself.

353
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,300
Whether it's a date or not, I don't know.

354
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:34,000
My friend has to shine and be the best!

355
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,800
I'm excited for you.

356
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,700
Can you help me choose what to wear?

357
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,900
- Which one should it be?
- What do you think is good?

358
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,300
- This one?
- Oh no, no. Wait a minute.

359
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:47,500
- This one?
- No, no, no.

360
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,100
I think this is good. Go and try it on.

361
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,800
Let's go!

362
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,000
Again?

363
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,200
I haven't even gotten to the first verse today.

364
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,400
It's okay. Let's try again.

365
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,700
Sekram, count the beats properly.

366
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,200
Let's go!

367
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,100
That's enough!

368
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,100
If you can't play, I think you should leave the band.

369
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,500
You're wasting other people's time!

370
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,600
Hey! Relax.

371
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm trying, Bro.

372
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,900
You're trying?

373
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,600
If you can only do this much by trying, I think you should stop.

374
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,000
Hey! Dude, calm down.

375
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,800
Come on. Give him some time.

376
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
Give him time?

377
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,500
How many days has it been, you jerk?

378
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,900
You can't even play the first verse, damnit!

379
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,200
If you know you're not suitable,

380
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,000
then don't get in the way of my dreams!

381
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,400
Don't you think you are going too far?

382
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Aren't you being too harsh?

383
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,100
I know that you feel pressured.

384
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,300
But what about others?

385
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,900
You have dreams and so what?

386
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,400
The others don't then?

387
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,100
If you have to hurt other people to reach your dreams,

388
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,400
by not giving them any chances,

389
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,100
I won't be a part of that!

390
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,100
Here.

391
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,500
Are you okay?

392
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,700
Not really.

393
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,100
I... apologize for my friend.

394
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,100
It's okay.

395
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,900
Tanwa is a straightforward person like this.

396
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,000
Don't mind him.

397
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,000
I did try my hardest though.

398
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,900
Maybe I'm not suitable like Tanwa says.

399
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,700
Look! I don't know you all that well,

400
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,700
but I think you're the type of person

401
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,200
who probably doesn't give up that easily.

402
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,200
Thank you, Bro.

403
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,400
And one more thing.

404
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,000
If you will give up on something,

405
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,100
I want you to give up because you have tried your best already.

406
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,800
And it really just didn't work.

407
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,100
Don't give up because of other people.

408
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,800
Okay?

409
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,700
Yes.

410
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,700
Excuse me. Are you Thitnuea and Sekram?

411
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yes, we are.

412
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,600
See? I told you.

413
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:08,400
My name is Tawan. This is Sunny and Artit.

414
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,000
We just became trainees here,

415
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,400
and wanted to say that you guys are our role models.

416
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,100
We were able to form our group because we found your clip on YouTube.

417
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,800
You guys are awesome.

418
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,500
Are you guys exaggerating?

419
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,100
We really mean it.

420
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:25,500
We heard that you guys are close to debuting.

421
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,300
We will be supporting you.

422
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,200
Thank you very much.

423
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,300
We'll excuse ourselves now.

424
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,700
See you around.

425
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,400
Sekram.

426
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,800
- Oh, hey!
- Are you waiting for a ride home?

427
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,400
Yes.

428
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,700
About earlier, I'm sorry for what I said.

429
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,600
Sure.

430
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,600
Want to leave together?

431
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,300
It's okay, my car will arrive soon.

432
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,800
I can give you a lift home.

433
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,700
Really, it's fine. You can go ahead.

434
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,600
I already apologized to you.

435
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,400
We still have to work together for a long time.

436
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,300
Stop being angry with me...

437
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:31,300
It's easy for you to say. You're not me.

438
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,800
And I said I'm sorry.

439
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,600
Anyone can say, "sorry."

440
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,000
I can say, I'm sorry, as well.

441
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,800
But I suck.

442
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,000
I didn't mean to make you feel that way.

443
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,700
But you always say terrible things to me.

444
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,000
Then, what now?

445
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,400
Do you want only positive words,

446
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,200
and praises all the time, is that it?

447
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,100
But why do you have to keep insulting me?

448
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,300
Because I care about you.

449
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,800
I want you to keep up with us.

450
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,700
People who don't care about you,

451
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,500
won't spend time correcting you.

452
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,900
And if you can't understand that,

453
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I think you should stop.

454
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,800
It's a waste of time.

455
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,500
[Half Moon | Slow Bar Coffee]

456
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

457
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,800
- One green tea smoothie, please.
- Okay, got it.

458
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,100
Let's go.

459
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,900
- What would you like?
- I would like one strawberry smoothie, please.

460
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,200
Okay, strawberry.

461
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Nuea!

462
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,300
It's so easy to tease you.

463
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,800
What are you playing at?

464
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:11,200
He said he doesn't like him but he's over there being shy.

465
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,000
I know, right?

466
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,600
Nuea!

467
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,500
Can't I tease you?

468
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,000
It's definitely obvious.

469
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,500
So what?

470
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,900
Nuea! Whatever!

471
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,200
- It's like what happens in novels.
- I know, right?

472
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
- What?
- What? Stop it right there.

473
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,200
And don't tell anyone,

474
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,600
especially Plaengrak. Don't ever!

475
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,800
- Why? I thought you said you didn't like him.
- True!

476
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,700
I don't like him at all. Who said that I like him?

477
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,400
Like what?

478
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,000
It's Thanim and Bai Bua. They like to gossip.

479
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,400
Hey, Gene!

480
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,100
- What do you like?
- There are customers! Let's go.

481
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,000
What is it?

482
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:24,300
For the most part, these are all the changes to the promotional plans.

483
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,000
Also... if there are any other updates,

484
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,700
I will inform everyone again.

485
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,200
I actually want to talk about the argument you guys had.

486
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,000
Tanwa...

487
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,300
I would like you to help take care of Sekram.

488
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,800
If Sekram has any problems,

489
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,500
I want you to help him.

490
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,700
I want him to be able to prove himself.

491
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,400
It's usually like this in the beginning.

492
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,930
How about this?

493
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:03,500
Let this be a new start for you guys.

494
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,800
Today, I will treat you all to a meal!

495
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,100
Yes! I've been waiting to hear these words!

496
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,300
Nao, how did you know this plan would work?

497
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,400
With my expertise,

498
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,900
I never miss a chance for free food.

499
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,239
We actually knew for a while already.

500
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:20,820
But Namnao wanted to pull a prank on you.

501
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,980
So we just played along with his plan.

502
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,919
Then that means, I've been tricked to treat you all?

503
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
That's correct.

504
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:33,639
But I still want to apologize to everyone

505
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:36,120
for the stuff that had happened.

506
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,020
I promise to try harder.

507
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,400
It makes me feel better just hearing you say that.

508
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,599
By the way, is no one going to order anything else?

509
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:48,680
We will.

510
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,079
Excuse me! Check, please!

511
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,780
Excuse me!

512
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,359
- Okay.
- Are you all right?

513
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,640
Here, let me help you carry it.

514
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,700
Why did you bring so much stuff?

515
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,379
Thank you.

516
00:31:36,379 --> 00:31:40,260
Sure. I'll go close the door, all right.

517
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,640
Let me close the door.

518
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,879
How about we go to the counter?

519
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:50,759
Okay.

520
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,660
Just go!

521
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,199
Here's some water.

522
00:31:58,199 --> 00:32:00,100
Thank you.

523
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:05,240
Have you eaten anything yet? Are you hungry?

524
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,680
I haven't eaten anything yet. I'm a little hungry.

525
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,919
Then I'll make a quick bite for you to eat.

526
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:14,239
Okay.

527
00:32:14,239 --> 00:32:16,040
Wait for a bit.

528
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,440
It's done.

529
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:47,260
Thank you.

530
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,880
Why don't you try it and see if it tastes okay?

531
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,080
Let me taste it.

532
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,680
Is it good?

533
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,439
- It's okay, right?
- It's delicious.

534
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:13,320
Okay.

535
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,060
You make delicious food.

536
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,000
Thank you.

537
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,360
Are you ready?

538
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,940
Yes.

539
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,160
You haven't been here for a few days.

540
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,580
Do you still remember what I taught you?

541
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:40,240
I'll go over it again, then.

542
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,580
It hasn't really been that long...

543
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:45,360
We were close not so long ago.

544
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,819
Today, we'll be using coffee beans from Ethiopia.

545
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:55,940
It's lightly roasted to preserve the flavor and natural aroma of the coffee. Okay?

546
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,559
♫ Stealing glances, looking at your eyes every day ♫

547
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:01,290
Yi!

548
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,770
Duean Yi.

549
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,840
Are you still listening to me?

550
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,999
You'll get scolded by the teacher!

551
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:13,479
I'm listening. Teacher, please continue teaching me.

552
00:34:13,479 --> 00:34:17,099
♫ That the two of us should be more than friends ♫

553
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:19,599
Let's see you show me.

554
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:25,439
That way I'll know if the student remembered what I taught.

555
00:34:25,439 --> 00:34:28,240
- Sure.
- Go for it.

556
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,140
♫ Four, we like the same things ♫

♫ And five, I have feelings (for you) ♫

♫ Should we be in love now? ♫

561
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:55,179
♫ Should we be dating now? ♫

562

♫ Are you alone, darling? ♫

563
00:34:57,559 --> 00:35:01,159
Okay. That is really good.

♫ Should we be in love now? ♫

565
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:08,339
Oh, Plaeng, I prepared something for today.

566
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:09,959
What is it?

567
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,379
Well, I noticed you don't really have time to go anywhere.

568
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:18,239
And I wanted to watch a movie with you.

569
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:20,339
So I brought the cinema here instead.

570
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,239
Really?

571
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:26,699
Don't tell me the stuff you have in your bag...

572
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:29,799
Oh, wow! What did you bring?

573
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:33,160
I brought the whole projector.

574
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,559
Duean Yi... are we watching a movie here, then?

575
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:38,559
- Yes.
- Okay.

576
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:40,319
All right, let's hurry up and finish making the coffee.

577
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:42,020
Okay.

578
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,639
- Put in everything, right?
- Yes, all of it.

579
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,620
Okay.

580
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,119
- How about we set the stuff here for now.
- Sure.

581
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:53,519
Can you take this out for me?

582
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:55,299
Sure. Just a moment.

583
00:35:55,299 --> 00:35:58,119
Okay. Why don't I move the table over there?

584
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:00,039
Sure.

585
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,219
Can you do it? Let me help you.

586
00:36:02,219 --> 00:36:04,020
Thank you.

587
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,799
- Can you do it?
- Yes, I can.

588
00:36:06,799 --> 00:36:09,640
Are you sure? Here, try.

589
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,060
I think I better help you.

590
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,479
I'll aim the projector here, okay?

591
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,619
Okay, sure.

592
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:23,560
I'll set up the cloth first.

593
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,199
Is that it?

594
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,340
Okay, let me set it here first.

595
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,400
How is it? Do you like it?

596
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:55,860
I've been thinking about how to make it the whole night.

597
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,080
Of course, I like it.

598
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,380
But I'm still surprised you put this much effort into it.

599
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,999
If we spend a lot of time together,

600
00:37:08,999 --> 00:37:13,240
it'll make us understand and know each other more.

601
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,820
What type of movies do you usually like to watch?

602
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,760
I like watching action movies.

603
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,759
I especially like the ones with shooting, slashing, and stabbing.

604
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,260
Really?

605
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,620
I can't believe you would like those types of movies.

606
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,760
What type of movies do you like?

607
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,250
Me?

608
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,820
I like... romance movies.

609
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:49,280
I like when two people love each other.

610
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:55,319
I also like when... they fight alongside each other.

611
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:57,599
Being beside one another...

612
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,500
Something like that.

613
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:12,260
Then... can I be by your side?
