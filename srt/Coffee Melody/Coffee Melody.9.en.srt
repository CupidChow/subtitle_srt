1
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,920
So, what's up? Now that you can't nag me about work, you have nothing to say?

2
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,120
No, it's not that.

3
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,500
Fine, come in first.

4
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,260
You're so grouchy.

5
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,270
All right, so what's wrong?

6
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,580
You wouldn't even say anything in the chat.

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:46,180
Well...

8
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,540
The headquarters of the music company wants you to work with them.

9
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,780
Isn't it good news?

10
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,980
Why are you making a sad face, then?

11
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,520
Aren't you going to congratulate me?

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,380
Wait...

13
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:08,140
Headquarters of the music company...

14
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,000
In Shanghai.

15
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,320
It's dirty now.

16
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,200
- It's going to get my clothes dirty!
- How about again?

17
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,260
- So what?
- Plaengrak will scold me.

18
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,220
Well, that's his problem.

19
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:30,900
- Oh, no, it's getting messy.
- You think I'm scared of him?

20
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,980
I will definitely tell Plaengrak.

21
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:34,540
- Saying what, huh?
- It's messed up.

22
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,700
- You're such a snitch.
- You're so focused, I see.

23
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,100
If someone from the band, Winter, sees you,

24
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,140
he would be happy to death.

25
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,420
What are you talking about? I don't really want to do it,

26
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,160
but I did because you ordered me to. Right, Tasmin?

27
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,820
Tasmin!

28
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,960
What got into his eye?

29
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,340
Calm down.

30
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,620
You don't know anything.

31
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,250
Being so stubborn like this.

32
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:04,200
I'll wait and see if your heart is stubborn, too.

33
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,800
Who's stubborn? Is it you, Tasmin?

34
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,880
- No one.
- Oh, really?

35
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,200
- No one!
- No one?

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,180
Fine, if you say so.

37
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,760
Get back to work, Plaengrak.

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,660
Okay, Boss. I'll go back to work.

39
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,260
- Very good.
- Yes, sir... Wait.

40
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,060
Okay.

41
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,180
- What the heck, Gene?
- Look, I wrote it wrong now.

42
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,920
Damn it, Plaengrak...

43
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,560
Damn, what?

44
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,320
I didn't quite hear it.

45
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,040
So, what are you going to do next?

46
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,240
You know this is my dream, don't you?

47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,880
I know, that's why I'm also stressed for you.

48
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,080
If it were you, what would you do?

49
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:06,720
You are asking the person who is also looking for their passion and is quitting from their old work place?

50
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,500
Come on, I want to know.

51
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,280
If it were me, I'd choose to go for sure.

52
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,580
At the end of the day, I'll still choose to follow my dream.

53
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,900
Dude!

54
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,080
Did you put sleeping pills in your coffee?

55
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,120
You are spacing out.

56
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,120
I can't decide.

57
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,920
But I didn't mean that you have to go.

58
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,920
Let's just say...

59
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,580
If I ask for more time to make a decision.

60
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,820
How many more months do I have?

61
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,300
Three.

62
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,780
Just three months?

63
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,960
Three weeks!

64
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,820
Put everything upstairs.

65
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,680
- Yes, Sir.
- Organize the books properly.

66
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,200
Okay. Where's the picture? Give it here.
[Half Moon | Slow Bar Coffee]

67
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,220
- Can you take this?
- Sure.

68
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,520
How do I prevent it from falling?

69
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,800
You guys seem busy.

70
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,100
Oh, you are here?

71
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:19,440
It looks like they enjoy doing it.

72
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,600
I think so too, but strangely...

73
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,180
they look more energetic reorganizing the café than making coffee.

74
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,700
No complaints at all.

75
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,460
I heard that.

76
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,700
- Or is it not true?
- It's true, Plaengrak!

77
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,140
- Oh! There is one other thing that Gene is energetic about.
- What is it?

78
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,200
- Fighting with Thitnuea!
- Do you want to fight?

79
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,020
Come on then, or is it not true?

80
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,560
Enough. Enough.

81
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,140
But I think that's true though...

82
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,500
Gosh! I'm not going to talk to you.

83
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll just continue to work.

84
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,400
- Keep on working.
- Yes, yes. I'm doing it.

85
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,780
Here you are.

86
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,360
Janjao sent an invitation to the mini-concert.

87
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,700
She has an appointment to watch the band record today.

88
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,360
Okay, thank you so much.

89
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,100
I made you some coffee. I'll go get it for you.

90
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,160
It's okay.

91
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,560
Actually, I have to go now.

92
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,460
I'll see you later.

93
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,660
Okay, sure. Be safe on your way.

94
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,680
- Are you done yet?
- Got it.

95
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,060
That is still not straight. Make it straight.

96
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,200
Janjao.

97
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,160
Yes?

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,220
You're all here at once.

99
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,200
Please don't quit.

100
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,240
Please don't leave us.

101
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,120
If there is anything we can help with, you can tell us any time.

102
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,900
Or if I did something bad, please tell me.

103
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,940
I am ready to improve myself.

104
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,160
Relax, guys.

105
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,080
It's not because of you guys.

106
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,720
It's because of me.

107
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,140
Then please don't resign.

108
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,180
The reason we're able to get to where we are,

109
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:06,560
it's all because of you.

110
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,020
You cared about us when no one did.

111
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,460
We started from zero together.

112
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,680
I want you to be with us all the way.

113
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,580
You lead us further than we dreamed of going.

114
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,160
We've been through good and bad together.

115
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,600
Please stay here with us.

116
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,540
Thank you all so much.

117
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,920
Thank you, everyone, so very much.

118
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:08,200
But right now, I want you all to focus on your recording.

119
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,980
Do you understand?

120
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,080
Understood?

121
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,160
I'm so damn excited!

122
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,500
Hey! You can do this. Believe me.

123
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,840
Go for it guys.

124
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,800
- You can do this for sure.
- Thank you.

125
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,640
Do you still remember that day?

126
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,420
The day we signed up for a music club, and it turned out to be full.

127
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,660
And then suddenly you decided to open your own club.

128
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:54,720
I can still remember that feeling.

129
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,020
I know you can remember.

130
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:02,400
We came all this way... You can do this!

131
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,080
- Can I hug you guys?
- Come on.

132
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,260
Let's send some positive energy to Thitnuea.

133
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:16,880
Three... two...one... Winter! Winter! Winter!

134
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,660
- Are you ready?
- Lets do it.

135
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,280
Hey! What's wrong?

136
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:30,330
Well, I'm excited. Aren't you excited?

137
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,040

Hey, Duean Yi.

157
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,900
Why are you out here alone?

158
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,000
I see that it's quite busy inside and didn't want to be a bother.

159
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,400
So, what do you think?

160
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,100
Is it as good as you expected?

161
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,600
When I wrote the song, I could only hear myself singing it.

162
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,200
But when listening to you guys,

163
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,800
it's much better than I thought it would be.

164
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,200
Tanwa.

165
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,300
Congratulations to you.

166
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,400
When you become a full-blown artist, don't forget about me.

167
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,100
Come on. How could I ever forget you?

168
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,000
Actually, part of the reason I can come this far is because of you.

169
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,200
Duean Yi.

170
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,100
Well...

171
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,000
- I want to tell you that–
- Oh!

172
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,300
About that night, thank you so much.

173
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:14,600
If you weren't there at that time, I would have felt much worse.

174
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,800
It's fine.

175
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,300
I am willing to do what I can to help.

176
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,100
Well...

177
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,600
If you need any help, you can tell me.

178
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,400
We are like brothers.

179
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,800
If there's anything I can help with, I want to help you.

180
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,800
Tanwa, it's your turn. Please come in.

181
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,400
Please excuse me.

182
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,000
Go for it. You got this!

183
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,700
Oh my gosh!

184
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,200
What is wrong with you?

185
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm happy and so overwhelmed!

186
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,600
All of a sudden,

187
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,300
my boys are already debuting!

188
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,600
Gosh! You shocked me. Are you okay?

189
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,200
I'm fine. I'm fine. Go on.

190
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,000
Okay, then I'll send the plan to our chat group.

191
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,900
So everyone can check it once again.

192
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,600
You're the best, Janjao!

193
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,400
I'm so excited!

194
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,700
I can't wait to see the real event.

195
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,600
Aren't you exaggerating?

196
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,200
Well, it's the first project I got to work on.

197
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,000
Besides, you're more exaggerating than I am.

198
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,700
I am not exaggerating.

199
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,400
I must thank Janjao,

200
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,200
who saw the potential in the boys from the beginning.

201
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,800
And you tried so hard to push this project through until it passed.

202
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,500
That's right, Janjao.

203
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,500
We were able to get through everything because of your preparations

204
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,600
and the very well-planned organization.

205
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,900
Otherwise, we would be in a mess.

206
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,000
I would also like to thank you, Nawa.

207
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,200
You believed in me and trusted this project to me.

208
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
And thanks to everyone, too.

209
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,200
If it wasn't for you all, this project wouldn't have succeeded this much.

210
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,000
Enough, let's not be too dramatic.

211
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,080
Nara, I'm just speaking the truth.

212
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,300
I'm not being dramatic.

213
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,400
Then let's call it a day.

214
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,900
Let's update the rest later.

215
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,600
Okay.

216
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,100
All right, let's gather our things.

217
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,300
Well, well.

218
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:17,600
It's pretty late, why aren't you going home?

219
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,100
You're still making dessert. Who are you making them for?

220
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,700
Gene, you're really something. Aren't you getting tired?

221
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,600
Oh, come on, Plaengrak.

222
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Seeing you happy makes me happy, too.

223
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,800
Did you know ever since you and Duean Yi got back together,

224
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,100
our café turned pink all of sudden.

225
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,300
Go home now!

226
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,600
Otherwise, I'll make you help me with the dessert.

227
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,500
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong?

228
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,100
My arm hurts all of a sudden.

229
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,600
- Oh, really? Your arm hurts so suddenly?
- I don't know what's wrong.

230
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,200
I think I should go home and rest.

231
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,500
- See you.
- Go on.

232
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,100
Gene! I see you're walking fine now!

233
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,700
Come back and help me first!

234
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,200
Bye.

235
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,200
These employees are something else.

236
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,700
Bro, did you wait long?

237
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,000
I've been here a while. How's it going?

238
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:32,500
It's good.

239
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,200
I've been thinking about going to Shanghai.

240
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,600
What about you? How was the recording?

241
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,700
It was good, actually better than I thought.

242
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:50,000
That's good news. I can't wait to hear it!

243
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,600
Sure.

244
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,600
So I heard from Jo that you're going to Shanghai soon,

245
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,300
and you have to give them an answer. Right?

246
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,500
Well... I'm still deciding.

247
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,400
Don't worry about matters at home.

248
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,500
I will take care of Pa and Ma.

249
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,800
Thank you, Brother.

250
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,400
Just focus on your job.

251
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,000
Do you realize that you're super capable?

252
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,600
You can really help me with everything.

253
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,100
I know that just a little bit.

254
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:33,400
Oh, right! Does Plaengrak know about it yet?

255
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,600
You're making this face, that means…

256
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,900
You haven't told him yet?

257
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,500
Brother...

258
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,300
can I ask you something?

259
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:58,800
I feel like everything is going so well between me and Plaeng.

260
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,800
But if there's this situation where I have to go abroad...

261
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,100
I think love is between two people.

262
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,600
The fact that you're going abroad,

263
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,000
doesn't mean you have to end your relationship.

264
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,500
It won't be ruined, will it?

265
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,700
I think love is about two people.

266
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:33,200
Especially when you're following your dreams.

267
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,700
The opportunity has come.

268
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,800
If he really loves you,

269
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,500
he should be the first person to understand you.

270
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,020
Don't overthink it.

271
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,920
By the way, how's the band going?

272
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:57,200
It's all right. There's nothing I can't handle.

273
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:15,840
Gene and the others are not here yet?

274
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,820
Oh, Duean Yi, you're here very early.

275
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,700
Well, last night they had some preparations to do till late,

276
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,660
so I let them come to work late.

277
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,800
By the way, is there anything, since you came so early?

278
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:35,220
I have to go abroad, so I came to tell you.

279
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,320
Oh, really?

280
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,760
How many days are you going? Is Janjao going with you?

281
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,820
Well, the music company wants me to go.

282
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:48,000
What did you say again?

283
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,900
I said Janjao is not going with me.

284
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,020
- Oh.
- Well...

285
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,240
The headquarters of the music company wants me to go.

286
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,160
That's good news, then.

287
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,540
Yes, but...

288
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,300
What country are you going to?

289
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,270
I'm going to Shanghai.

290
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:12,220
That's great!

291
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,220
But... Plaengrak...

292
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,260
Duean Yi, I'm really sorry,

293
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,100
but let me finish organizing and then we can talk. How's that sound?

294
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,980
I have to get this done soon.

295
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,620
Okay?

296
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,460
Hello.

297
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:43,900
Yes, hi.

298
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,760
All right, you can come in.

299
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,100
Yes, of course.

300
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,480
Please park out front, and I'll be there to greet you.

301
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,500
Yes, goodbye.

302
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,180
Duean Yi, I'm in a hurry to go.

303
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,200
Let's talk later.

304
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,040
Is everything prepared, Janjao?

305
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,200
Everything is good.

306
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,280
The band members have arrived and should be able to do a sound check soon.

307
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,920
Uncle Nawa.

308
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:40,680
The past few days that I've been with you at the music company,

309
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:45,020
I feel like I have more interest in music now.

310
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:50,000
Really Meji? I'm glad to hear that you know what you like or dislike.

311
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,460
No matter what, your parents and I will always support you with whatever you want to do.

312
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,880
I will work hard for the things that I like.

313
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,600
And I'll try my best to achieve it.

314
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,180
Very good!

315
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:09,440
Me too. If you like something, try your best to achieve it.

316
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,960
You don't have to worry,

317
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,200
you just have to focus on what you like to do.

318
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,820
Okay.

319
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,580
Why don't we head over there and check it out?

320
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,180
- Sure.
- Let's go.

321
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,160
Tanwa.

322
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,360
Did you come to watch as well?

323
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,260
Of course. Congratulations to you.

324
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,840
You are so cool!

325
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,820
And thank you so much.

326
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,000
Thank me for what?

327
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,160
Well, it's because of you that made me understand. That's why I focused on practicing again.

328
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,660
One day we will be like you guys for sure!

329
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,900
- I will wait for that day.
- Thank you!

330
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,940
Please do your best today!

331
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,120
- You got this!
- Of course.

332
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,700
Are you excited?

333
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,700
Very much! We haven't slept at all.

334
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:09,720
Yes, me too. I'm so damn excited.

335
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,700
Thank you so much.

336
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,400
For always being here for us.

337
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,260
Even though no one ever gave us a chance.

338
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:26,300
And you came along and became the perfect addition to our band, Winter.

339
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:30,620
Not only Sekram but also Janjao.

340
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,120
If you didn't give us the chance that day,

341
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,680
we wouldn't be able to debut.

342
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,700
There are so many people who are better than we are.

343
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,860
And there are plenty of people who make better music.

344
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:45,920
But they see our potential.

345
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,060
Thank you so much.

346
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,880
Thank you to everyone.

347
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,160
Thank you for fighting together all this time.

348
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,100
Thank you for not scolding me or getting angry with me.

349
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,620
Me too.

350
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,420
Thank you, everyone,

351
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,920
for giving me the opportunity to take care of you guys.

352
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:18,340
I never thought that we would come this far.

353
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,360
Do you guys remember when you guys had a fight?

354
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,880
I always thought to myself,

355
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,320
maybe it's because I didn't take care of you guys well enough.

356
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,460
Thank you, everyone, for working hard.

357
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,320
Hey, don't cry.

358
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,680
Please take care of us, bad youngsters, for a long time.

359
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,920
Let's cheer ourselves up. Let's go. One last time.

360
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,380
Let's go, three... two... one...

361
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:51,900
Winter! Winter! Winter!

362
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,380
We got this!

363
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,980
Here we go!

364
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,140
- Thitnuea!
- Hey!

365
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,800
- You guys came, too?
- We won't miss it for anything.

366
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,020
We'd like to congratulate you.

367
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,380
We've followed you since we saw your clip on the internet.

368
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:17,040
Now that you have come so far, we're so proud of you.

369
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:23,320
Whenever you're tired or feeling discouraged, we'll be by your side.

370
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,960
I have to thank you guys, too.

371
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,760
You all are the encouragement and support for me.

372
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,420
Which made me able to have this day.

373
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,160
Please do your best today.

374
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,200
We will be cheering for you at the front of the stage.

375
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,180
I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

376
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,200
Keep fighting! Keep fighting!

377
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,620
Thank you. Thank you.

378
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,160
Thank you. Thanks.

379
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,900
Keep fighting! Keep fighting!

380
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,860
Hey!

381
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,800
Aren't you performing soon?

382
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,040
Are you prepared yet?

383
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,520
Give me some…

384
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,420
What? Give you what?

385
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,340
What are you talking about?

386
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:13,380
Give me some encouragement.

387
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,860
Go on and prepare for the show.

388
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,200
Can't I ask for some encouragement?

389
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,340
Let me think…

390
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,280
Nope.

391
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,600
This is an important day for me.

392
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,280
Please just one time.

393
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,590
I'm nervous.

394
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:40,600
If you don't believe me, you can touch here.

395
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:55,340
All right, okay... Do your best!

396
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,540
I'll be cheering you.

397
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,060
Thank you.

398
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,840
Thitnuea!

399
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,500
Why not?

400
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,760
You can do it!

401
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,200
Do your best, okay?

402
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,840
Hello, everyone.

403
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,780
We are the band Winter.

404
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:32,260
Our band started when no one gave us any interest.

405
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,460
But we never gave up.

406
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:40,480
I believe that, if we try our best to do something,

407
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,560
if not done today then tomorrow will be successful.

408
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,740
Thank you, Duean Yi,

409
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:51,920
for writing this beautiful song for us.

410
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,540
Thank you to the music company for believing in us.

411
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,700
Thank you, Janjao,

412
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,000
for having faith in us

413
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,780
and making our dream come true.

414
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,020
And lastly,

415
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,200
thank you all of my friends...

416
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,880

Thank you.

By the way, now that you finished writing your song,

463
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,120
you won't disappear from my café, will you?

464
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,300
I told you that I am not a person who changes my mind easily.

Are you sure?

475
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,380
Well...

476
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,680

Hello.

485
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,420
Yes, what's up Janjao?

00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:41,960
I know, just stay still.

489
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,000
Why did you raise your feet at me?

490
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,660
- Yi.
- Wash your feet now!

491
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:50,340
Hold on... Duean Yi.

492
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,940
Yi, I'm here now.

493
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,580
Why are you so drunk?

494
00:34:54,580 --> 00:35:00,580
He was upset about you, so he kept drinking nonstop.

495
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:04,660
- Plaengrak, where have you been?
- Are you...

496
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,760
Are you okay?

497
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,200
Can I leave him to you to take him home?

498
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,400
I still have to go back to the office.

499
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Okay, I'll take care of him.

500
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,260
Are you okay? Yi.

501
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,820
Are you okay?

502
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:28,200
Yi, stand up properly.

503
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:33,920
Okay, let's go. Sit here. We are at the sofa.

504
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,940
Get your legs up first.

505
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,040
Why did you let yourself get this drunk?

506
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,360
Are you all right?

507
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,240
Let me move you. One, two, three.

508
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,160
Are you okay?

509
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,240
Hug me.

510
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,900
All right, hug my hand then.

511
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:18,620
My Pleangrak is so adorable.

512
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,540
What is it with you?

513
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,280
- What's wrong?
- Pleangrak...

514
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,460
Yes?

515
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:35,040
I'm sorry, I have to move to Shanghai.

516
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,380
It's okay.

517
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,180
Please don't be mad at me.

518
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:49,220
You know how much I love you, don't you?

519
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:55,240
But I still want to write songs.

520
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,780
Yi.

521
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,700
I love you, too.

522
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,940
Now you start to smile.

523
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,780
Are you okay?

524
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,550
- Sure?
- Yes.

525
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,560
You're smiling now.

526
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,720
You are so drunk.
