[Half Moon | Slow Bar Coffee]

2
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,420
Well. Well. It seems like someone can't stop smiling.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,140
What's up?

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,879
What did you order?

5
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:15,260
Same as usual.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,140
Probably something special.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:19,599
Here is the coffee you ordered.

8
00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:22,300
- Oh.
- Excuse me.

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,099
A special menu for a special person like you.

10
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:30,420
I can make this menu as well.

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,360
As for this, it is the special brownie recipe for Janjao.

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,600
- Just kidding. It's just a normal one.
- Gene!

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,600
Thank you so much, my barista.

14
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,920
No problem.

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,980
Look at you, making Gene and I feel invisible.

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,300
Just drink your coffee.

17
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,580
Oh, are you going to the music studio with Janjao?

18
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,479
No, I think I'm going straight to my place.

19
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,480
Oh...

20
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,839
I noticed that recently Janjao likes to hang out at the café.

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,740
She probably doesn't want to go into the office these days.

22
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,580
It turns out that love has become an obstacle to her dream.

23
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:24,220
It's probably hard for her to make a decision.

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,439
Plaengrak, I'll be going now.

25
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:30,140
Sure. Okay.

26
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,819
Please get home safely.

27
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:35,280
- Got it!
- See you later.

28
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,080
Are you kissing me on the cheek?

29
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,080
May I kiss you back as well?

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,680
No.

31
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,180
I can't?

32
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,980
- I'm going now.
- Okay.

33
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:52,679
Call me when you're home. See you later.

34
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,920
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

35
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,480
Hey, Plaeng, I didn't know you were with a friend.

36
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,880
You should have introduced him to me.

37
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,480
Why are you here, First?

38
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:21,480
I'm your boyfriend. Am I not allowed to be here?

39
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,680
I haven't seen you for so long.

40
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,720
Hey!

41
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,280
Duean Yi.

42
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,019
Let me go, damn it!

43
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:37,240
Yi! Yi!

44
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,960
Yi, listen to me first.

45
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,340
Yi...

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,240
Listen to what, Plaengrak?

47
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,860
- It's not what you think it is.
- That's enough!

48
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,060
I'm telling the truth.

49
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,880
Even if nothing can happen between us,

50
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,160
I'm fine with it.

51
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:05,280
Yi.

52
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,600
I'll be down in a bit, Ma.

53
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,979
Hurry up, let's eat.

54
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:13,760
Come, I made a lot of food today.

55
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,120
Let's eat.

56
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,740
Oh, Yi, how is the song you wrote? Is it going well?

57
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,800
As soon as you're done writing it, let your Ma and I listen to it.

58
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,700
Sure, I will do that.

59
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,420
Yi? Is there something going on?

60
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,860
You can always tell us.

61
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
I'm okay.

62
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,740
It's okay, just let it out.

63
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,060
Why are you crying?

64
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,120
I'm tired, Ma.

65
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,020
It's all right, dear.

66
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,320
Yi, are you okay, dear?

67
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,060
I'm better now.

68
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,600
Now, can you tell me what's wrong?

69
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,400
I'm just upset, Ma.

70
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,460
About what, dear?

71
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:34,980
I fell in love with someone and things were going great.

72
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,240
Until problems started arising.

73
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,280
Yi, listen to me.

74
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,380
Life is a bumpy road, not everything is smooth,

75
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,560
but it's up to us to learn from what happens.

76
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,420
Yes, Ma.

77
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:09,120
I just feel like he has never really liked me.

78
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,900
I have been trying, Ma.

79
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,100
But in the end, I realized

80
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:23,039
that I'm just someone's replacement, and I'm not as good as they are.

81
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,139
Love has nothing to do with whether someone is good or not good.

82
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:33,400
It's about whether or not the person is right for us.

83
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:39,600
If it's not our place, we should just walk away from it.

84
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,660
Then... I should walk away, right?

85
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,960
Ask your heart what you really want.

86
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:58,940
But I don't want you to base your happiness on a person.

87
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,320
Yes, Ma.

88
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,540
Just take some rest and give yourself time.

89
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:13,040
But my advice is, if you are really serious about him,

90
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,560
try to talk and open up to him.

91
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,820
If that is not your place,

92
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,480
this home will always welcome you.

93
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,940
I know...

94
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,380
Thank you, Ma.

95
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,039
Of course. I love you, dear.

96
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:35,740
I know...

97
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,580
- Let's go grab something to eat this evening.
- Sure.

98
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,659
- Let's talk about it later.
- Okay.

99
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:48,560
By the way, did you see Duean Yi by any chance?

100
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,340
No, why?

101
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,999
Well, he and Plaengrak have a misunderstanding right now.

102
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:55,900
And he disappeared completely.

103
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,320
- So, what problems do they have?
- It's nothing, dude.

104
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,079
But if you see him, tell me.

105
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,680
Sure.

106
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,440
Are you all right?

107
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,920
It's nothing. I'm fine.

108
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,340
Nothing? You got burned by water!

109
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,900
I think you should let me take care of the café for a while.

110
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,860
It's okay.

111
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:33,839
Even though I'm not the owner of this place,

112
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,560
I can tell the difference between who can and cannot work.

113
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,460
I don't think you want the customers to drink coffee

114
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,480
that is made by someone who is distracted. Right?

115
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,880
Okay, okay.

116
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,319
All right then, I'll leave it to you. Okay?

117
00:08:49,319 --> 00:08:51,599
Sure, just take some rest.

118
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,479
If there is something, just call me.

119
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:55,180
Yes, I will.

120
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,240
- Gene?
- Yes?

121
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,760
Can I ask you something?

122
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,880
You know what happened between Duean Yi and I. Right?

123
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,940
What do you think I should do?

124
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,560
I think the most important thing is to be clear.

125
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,050
- Make things clear?
- Yes.

126
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,800
When you have problems,

127
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,099
I think you should talk and discuss things.

128
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:37,040
Don't let those matters continue to hurt each other's feelings.

129
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,640
So... I should go to Duean Yi?

130
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,040
You can go to whoever,

131
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,099
but you must be sure that when you go to them,

132
00:09:49,099 --> 00:09:51,599
you won't let that person get hurt again.

133
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:53,960
Do you understand?

134
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,740
Yes. I understand.

135
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,760
Gene.

136
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,820
I really thank you. You know that. Right?

137
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,039
You should get going.

138
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:10,399
Please take care of the café for me.

139
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,679
If there's anything, just call me.

140
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,560
Go and get some rest.

141
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,820
I was wondering where you were.

142
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,700
If Gene didn't tell me,

143
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,840
I wouldn't know you were here.

144
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:43,040
Well, I just wanted some rest. Come on in.

145
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,920
You're in really bad shape.

146
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,940
Just a bit.

147
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,600
I haven't been this stressed in a while.

148
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,120
Did you call Duean Yi, yet?

149
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,260
I did, but he won't answer my calls.

150
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,600
Why the hell did First come back?

151
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,220
Did you ask him?

152
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,600
I didn't.

153
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,040
I don't know what he wants.

154
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,820
I think you should clear up this problem first.

155
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,959
I pity Duean Yi so much.

156
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,520
I no longer have feelings for First.

157
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,400
The only person I care about is Duean Yi.

158
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,000
Go and tell him then.

159
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,160
Make him feel assured.

160
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,720
I will give it a try.

161
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,059
I think you should also tell him

162
00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:57,040
that you actually had a crush on him for a while.

163
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,720
Let him know that it's not one-sided.

164
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,720
Damn, this song is really good.

165
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,980
It's like my life stories in a song.

166
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,380
The person who wrote this song is talented, aren't they?

167
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:27,800
Do you think they understand love more than others?

168
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,960
How should I know?

169
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,780
How is it? Do you like it?

170
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,160
- Let me have a look at it.
- What? No!

171
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,439
Just wait and see, one day I'll be the singer

172
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:51,300
to a song that someone this talented wrote a song for.

173
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:55,740
I'll wait and see.

174
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,539
- Don't forget to ask for my autograph too.
- Oh!

175
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:00,840
- Ask you for an autograph, huh?
- Yes!

176
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,479
- I charge for selfies.
- Oh my!

177
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:05,139
You aren't famous yet, and yet you're asking for a fee already?

178
00:13:05,139 --> 00:13:06,580
Yes, I'm thinking ahead.

179
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,700
- I must pay, too?
- Yes!

180
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,640
You are ridiculous!

181
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,540
But I don't want to bring up this reason to make him feel better.

182
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,120
It's like... I'm pressuring him or something.

183
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,040
It's up to you. In order to love someone,

184
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,299
if you only speak the truth, what do you have to be afraid of?

185
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,020
You're acting really cool today.

186
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:41,641
I don't want my Plaengrak,

187
00:13:41,641 --> 00:13:44,699
- That hurts...
- to be heartbroken again.

188
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:48,379
Beside, Duean Yi

189
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:50,899
seems to be really serious about you.

♫ It's like I'd already forgotten ♫

191
00:13:54,661 --> 00:13:59,239
♫ That someone ever broke my heart ♫

192
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,000
I will give it a try.

193
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:12,600
♫ I found out that I truly never forgot ♫

194
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,559
♫ The past made me realize that you never left ♫

195
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,919
♫ You're buried in my mind ♫

196
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:25,180
♫ I can't move on with anyone else ♫

197
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,039
♫ I'm afraid my heart will be broken once again ♫

198
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,559
♫ I know I've never walked away ♫

199
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:40,380
♫ From the image of you leaving, without
saying farewell. It's so painful ♫

200
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:46,159
♫ It hurts so much, I can't love anyone else ♫

201
00:14:46,159 --> 00:15:00,660
♫ But there will be a day that my heart will be
able to forget you… eventually ♫

Happy birthday to you.

You're a year older now.

Whatever you wish for,

just save money and buy it.

211
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:44,020
Oh, Pa!

212
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,180
Thank you so much, everyone.

213
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,900
I completely forgot about my birthday.

214
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,979
Did you know?

215
00:15:52,979 --> 00:15:57,180
Ma and I tried really hard to give you a surprise.

216
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,299
I wish for my son to work hard,

217
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:06,619
and have a lot of happiness.

218
00:16:06,619 --> 00:16:09,199
Thank you, Ma.

219
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:13,339
All the bad things will go away and pass you by.

220
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,119
Pa and Ma, you two are being emotional again.

221
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:18,979
Don't you know your son is a cry baby?

222
00:16:18,979 --> 00:16:22,380
You are going to make him cry again.

223
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,980
- He already did.
- Hey!

224
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,059
I told you no need to cry, right?

225
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:30,839
- Thank you.
- What do you want this year?

226
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,590
Can I talk to you?

227
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:27,140
Yes.

228
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,580
Well... your mother already told me.

229
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,060
The reason you came back was that someone broke your heart.

230
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,580
It's not that bad, Pa.

231
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,800
So, are you going to stay for a while?

232
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,400
No, Pa. I have to go back and sort out my work.

233
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,039
Okay.

234
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:57,620
So... now you're...

235
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,780
okay, right?

236
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,020
What I mean is, are you really okay?

237
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,199
The reason I asked,

238
00:18:07,199 --> 00:18:11,140
is not because I want to interfere with your privacy.

239
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,980
But I'm just worried about you.

240
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,679
After having some time to think things over,

241
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,490
I feel much better now, Pa.

242
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:29,480
And how about work? Is it going smoothly?

243
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,839
It's good, there are just minor problems to fix,

244
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:36,919
but I can do it.

245
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,440
I'm happy that you were able to do it.

246
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,220
And... I have to apologize for trying to forbid you before.

247
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,819
I understand you.

248
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:56,500
And I also thank you, Pa.

249
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,999
I feel like I'm really lucky.

250
00:19:01,999 --> 00:19:05,940
It turns out that everyone at home eventually supports me.

251
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,920
So... have you talked to Ai yet?

252
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,820
Yes, Pa.

253
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,519
I think you should talk to him, too.

254
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:27,219
Yes.

255
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:29,439
I would feel really sorry

256
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,040
if I let him carry all the burden alone like this.

257
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:41,100
Do you think... he will be able to succeed?

258
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:48,980
I can't answer that either, Pa. But all I can say is that

259
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,500
the chance you gave me that day,

260
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,879
made me who I am today.

261
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:04,240
What can I do? I have two sons and they're both stubborn.

262
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,639
We are stubborn like you and Ma.

263
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:09,440
That struck right back!

264
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,840
I'm not hardheaded anymore. Now I'm just bald-headed.

265
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,980
- Come on! Play something for me.
- All right.

266
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,840
- What are you doing?
- Being your boyfriend.

267
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,960
Gosh! Never mind that!

268
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:03,620
So... are you tired from work today?

269
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,279
Just a little, is there something?

270
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:08,040
Want to leave together?

271
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,960
No, it's fine. I can go alone.

272
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,199
Aren't you scared of ghosts at night when it's dark?

273
00:21:13,199 --> 00:21:17,760
I always leave alone. What ghosts? That's nonsense.

274
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,820
Hey!

275
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,060
What are you playing at?

276
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,639
You're scared with just that.

277
00:21:27,639 --> 00:21:29,460
It would have been fine to just leave together.

278
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:33,239
Fine. Let's go then.

279
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,880
That's all there is to it. Let's go.

280
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,180
What are you playing at?

281
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,820
Hello, Mr. Nawa, you arrived really early today.

282
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,879
You too, Nala, you're here really early.

283
00:21:53,879 --> 00:21:59,319
Yes. Mr. Nawa, I have a question to ask.

284
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:00,820
What is it?

285
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:07,739
You haven't given me any feedback on the promotional video that I sent you.

286
00:22:07,739 --> 00:22:10,699
- I will immediately check on that.
- Yes, sure.

287
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:12,599
Oh, Mr. Nawa?

288
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:18,480
Do you and Janjao have any problems?

289
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,400
Why are you asking?

290
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:29,220
Well, I noticed that she isn't so happy when she's here.

291
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,179
If it were me,

292
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:36,660
I would also want to be where I feel comfortable as well.

293
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,500
What do you mean?

294
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,279
It's nothing, I'm just worried.

295
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,860
If you'll excuse me, I'll go back to work.

296
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,460
All right then.

297
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,670
[Resignation Letter]

298
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,050
I, Janjao, with the title of Artist Manager, would like to resign from my duties for personal reasons that I cannot disclose.

299
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:30,150
Nine!

300
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,720
Come on.

301
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,800
- Ten.
- Hey!

302
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,919
Gene.

303
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:54,520
What?

304
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,419
Tomorrow afternoon, come and take photos for us.

305
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:03,640
Taking what photos? Do you think I don't have work to do?

306
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,879
It can be after work then.

307
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,659
Because when you take photos for us,

308
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:11,740
the number of likes is so damn high. Right, you guys?

309
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,959
- That's right.
- Yes, it's really good.

310
00:24:13,959 --> 00:24:15,779
Please, Gene, help take photos for us.

311
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:17,879
I'll have Thitnuea treat you to some snacks.

312
00:24:17,879 --> 00:24:19,980
Please, Gene?

313
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,100
Fine, I'll go.

314
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,040
What are you guys talking about?

315
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,620
- Do you have to ask?
- What?

316
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,239
Come on. Just play the game.

317
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:38,960
Come on, your turn.

318
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
Doesn't it feel nice?

319
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,380
The weather is really good.

320
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,279
Oh! The reason I'm here is

321
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,940
because Janjao left something for you.

322
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,700
I put it in the cabinet at the back of the café.

323
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,260
"Something"? What is it?

324
00:24:56,260 --> 00:25:01,100
I don't know. It was really busy, so I didn't take a look.

325
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,560
Okay, I'll go check it out later.

326
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,999
I was so busy I forgot it was Duean Yi's birthday.

327
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:10,540
If Janjao didn't tell me, I would have been doomed!

328
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,740
Birthday?

329
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:16,380
Yes. Well... I'll go ahead and take care of the café now.

330
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:36,540
You called for me. Is something the matter?

331
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:42,840
I wanted to ask about your resignation letter.

332
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,840
Oh.

333
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,820
Is it because of me?

334
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,900
Well... it's about a lot of things.

335
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,560
If it's because of me, then I'm really sorry.

336
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:03,739
I want you to think it through carefully and just overlook my matters.

337
00:26:03,739 --> 00:26:09,200
I want you to think about Winter. Everything has been going great.

338
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,060
I know and understand everything as well.

339
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,100
If you are going to quit doing something,

340
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,860
please don't let the reason be because of others.

341
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,960
You should quit only because you no longer want to do it.

342
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,220
Sure.

343
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,460
I want you to think carefully about it,

344
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,959
and talk to the band members.

345
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,140
I will respect your decision no matter what.

346
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,679
I know that I made you feel uncomfortable

347
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:46,879
and I'm really sorry for that.

348
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:51,040
But I don't want that to be the reason for you quitting this job.

349
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,880
Got it.

350
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,440
All right then, may I be excused?

351
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:21,599
Hello, Tanwa. I'm Tawan.

352
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,199
Tawan? Oh, Thitnuea mentioned you.

353
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,839
You can sit down.

354
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,139
Thank you.

355
00:27:28,139 --> 00:27:32,960
I would like some of your advice.

356
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,879
Since you are the band leader,

357
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:38,739
if someone in the group doesn't focus on practicing,

358
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:41,940
and when we give them a warning they become upset,

359
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,760
what should we do?

360
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,640
I think that giving warnings is good.

361
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:58,000
But if that person just disappears. They might feel insulted.

362
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,879
I think the best way is to call everyone to talk and solve it together.

363
00:28:02,879 --> 00:28:07,700
Since you're friends, you'll find a solution. Right?

364
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,619
I will give it a try. Thank you so much, Tanwa.

365
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:13,420
No problem.

366
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,300
- And what are you playing?
- This?

367
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,000
I was testing the chords.

368
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,700
I think this set of chords sounds relaxing.

369
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,600
Yi, I made some food for you.

370
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,200
Take it along to eat, dear.

371
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,700
Thank you, Ma.

372
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,400
Yi, come back home more often. Your mom misses you.

373
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,800
As if you don't miss him, too.

374
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:55,800
Yi, you can call me if there's anything wrong anytime. Okay?

375
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,500
Okay, Brother.

376
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,900
These are my snacks that I'll share with you.

377
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:03,100
Thank you so much.

378
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,400
Yi, you got this!

379
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,100
- I got this!
- Yes!

380
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,200
I'm going now.

381
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,100
- Okay.
- Good luck!

382
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,400
- See you, Brother.
- See you.

383
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,400
When he turns around, do this Ma.

384
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,900
Yi.

385
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,800
How do you feel after visiting home?

386
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:29,200
I feel good. I got to think things over.

387
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,800
So, you are okay now. Right?

388
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
I'm okay.

389
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:45,399
Hey, if you aren't okay, you can just say it.

390
00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:48,900
No matter what, I'm on your side.

391
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,600
I don't know.

392
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,400
I just don't want to be upset anymore.

393
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,500
What about Plaengrak? Have you talked to him yet?

394
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:08,800
Not yet. I'm not ready to talk to him.

395
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,500
What happened to the fighter spirit?

396
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,700
I can't do this anymore.

397
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,600
No one can fight all the time.

398
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,400
That's true. Including me as well.

399
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,800
Why is that?

400
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,500
I decided to resign.

401
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,200
And how are you feeling?

402
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,700
I am pretty upset,

403
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:45,400
but I'm thinking about starting a small music company on my own.

404
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,600
You are so talented, you can do it.

405
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,600
You're talented too, Yi.

406
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Let me tell you something.

407
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,700
No matter what you face or how you're feeling,

408
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:03,500
I will always be by your side.

409
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,000
I will stand by your side, too.

410
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,100
If you really do start your own music company,

411
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,200
let me write the first song for you. All right?

412
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,700
Well, of course.

413
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,700
But I'll charge a fee.

414
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,900
You really had to mention that so quickly, huh?

415
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,100
It's funny though.

416
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:39,100
When we were younger, the most hurtful thing was when our moms wouldn't buy us a toy.

417
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,400
That's right.

418
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:47,500
And we cut up paper into dolls to play with.

419
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,200
Do you remember? When I got bullied as a kid,

420
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,600
you were the only one who made me brave enough to fight against others.

421
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,600
After that, no one dared to bully me again.

422
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:09,700
We've been through a lot together, if I may say.

423
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,800
Let's make a promise.

424
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,400
We will fight and get through this together

425
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,600
and won't leave each other's side.

426
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,300
I won't make promises.

427
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,500
Even though we have never made any,

428
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,900
we've always had each other's backs. Right?

429
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,400
Isn't it cute.

430
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,800
It looks just like you when you nag me about work.

431
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You said it's cute?

432
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,600
Thank you.

433
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,700
Plaeng.

434
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,300
When will you talk to me?

435
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,500
Talk about what?

436
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,500
About us.

437
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,000
Us?

438
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,799
The things between us were done a long time ago.

439
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,700
But…

440
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,400
But what?

441
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,800
But you ruined my life, right?

442
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,200
I didn't mean it if that's what you're referring to!

443
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,180
You didn't mean to?

444
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,200
How can you say that?

445
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,100
I came back because I truly love you.

446
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,600
Love?

447
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,000
The reason you're back is that you have nowhere else to go, actually.

448
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,800
You're like this because of Duean Yi, aren't you?

449
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,900
Don't talk about him nor be a bother.

450
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,900
All right. You love him very much, do you?

451
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,470
I don't know what you're thinking,

452
00:34:25,470 --> 00:34:27,500
but you better stop.

453
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,700
You already ruined my life once.

454
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:36,200
But this time, I won't let that happen.

455
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:40,400
And don't you dare mess with me or my person again!

456
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,700
I don't want to see your face.

457
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,220
Plaeng!

458
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,900
Plaeng!

459
00:34:56,100 --> 00:35:02,600
