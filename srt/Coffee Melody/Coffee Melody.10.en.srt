1
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,200
[I cooked you some food, don't forget to eat.]

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,000
Wow, Plaengrak!

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,400
Did I accidentally do anything embarrassing?

4
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,800
Plaengrak.

5
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,000
Are you free? Can I talk to you?

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,800
Are you feeling better? Are you awake now?

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,400
Sure!

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,200
I'm sorry I got so drunk I was clueless.

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,800
You weren't that drunk.

10
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,000
You just took off your shirt and ran around the room.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Did I?

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm just kidding.

13
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,000
You can't remember anything at all?

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,900
No, why?

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,000
Just that...

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
some boy confessed his love to me.

17
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,900
Me?

18
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,400
Of course, you. Who else can it be?

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,700
Well, now that I'm not drunk,

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,000
should we try talking about that matter?

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,500
The matter about me going to Shanghai.

22
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,020
Oh! It's okay.

23
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,300
I'm fine about it.

24
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,700
I was just a little surprised at that time.

25
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,400
Why are you apologizing? You don't have to.

27
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,700
You are just doing what you love. You know that?

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,900
I was scared that I was hurting your feelings.

29
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,800
It would hurt me more

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,900
if I didn't let the person I love follow his dream, you know?

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,880
Thank you.

32
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,700
Sure.

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,400
Let me clear this up.

34
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,800
Is there something I can help with?

35
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,000
No, there isn't.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,800
Just be yourself by my side.

37
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,400
You are so cute.

38
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,600
You keep nudging me. Are you shy?

39
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,000
Come on.

40
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,600
What are you doing standing here alone?

41
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,800
When I see them like this, I can't help but be proud.

42
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,550
I'm also proud of them.

43
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:17,500
And you, too.

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,080
Thank you.

45
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,100
For giving me the chance.

46
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,200
About the resignation letter that you just sent,

47
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,900
I already saw it.

48
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,800
Yes.

49
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,900
I don't know how I should tell them.

50
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,400
I think you should just tell them directly.

51
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,900
I believe that they will understand.

52
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,500
I also heard that you were going to start your own music company.

53
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,500
If you're going to invite them to join you, I'm fine with it.

54
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,800
Because you created Winter with your own hands.

55
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,600
Really?

56
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,000
You aren't mad about anything?

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,100
I'm more than happy.

58
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,700
I get to see you follow your dream.

59
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,400
You get to do the stuff that you love.

60
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,200
You proved that you're brilliant with Winter.

61
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Then, from now on we are competitors.

62
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Okay. Are you sure you can beat me?

63
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,800
Even if I can't, I still have to try.

64
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,200
As for the things in the past,

65
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:46,700
I'm sorry for trying to force your feelings too much.

66
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:54,500
You once told me we couldn't date because of our work status,

67
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,400
if we're not co-workers anymore, do I have a chance now?

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,200
Please excuse me.

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Hey! Where are you going?

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,920
♪ But it turns out, I'm the one who's delusional ♪

71
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,399
♪ It's just a love song, that you do not love ♪

72
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,800
♪ That you do not accept ♪

73
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,700
♪ You won't feel affected, no matter how much you listen to it ♪

74
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:34,300
♪ It's just a love song, with sweet lyrics ♪

75
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,400
All right, enough. Enough.

76
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,000
Well, there is something I want to tell everyone.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,100
But don't be alarmed.

78
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,100
So, I decided to resign.

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,400
You told us that you won't leave us.

80
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,700
I'm not leaving you.

81
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:09,800
I'm thinking of starting my own small music company.

82
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,800
And also, just because I start up my own company

83
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,100
doesn't mean we have to cut ties.

84
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,000
Music company?

85
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,900
That's right, you guys be careful,

86
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,700
I will discover new artists to compete with you guys.

87
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:35,100
I don't want to be sad, but I can't help it.

88
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,400
Hey, don't be sad.

89
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,900
How about we go eat at a buffet?

90
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,600
It's my treat.

91
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,400
Come on. Stop making those faces.

92
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,200
Let's go. Let's go. Straighten up the room.

93
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,590
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

94
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,500
All right, let's go.

95
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,000
Let's go. Get up.

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,300
Come on, let's go!

97
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,500
I'll meet you all there.

98
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,000
Are you upset about Janjao leaving?

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It makes me think a lot.

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,900
Lately, you have seemed pretty stressed.

101
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,600
I know it's because of Duean Yi.

102
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,000
You know that?

103
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,700
Of course I do.

104
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,600
I've known for a while now that you like him.

105
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,900
Yeah, but as it is...

106
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,400
But I will always be by your side.

107
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,900
Don't think too much.

108
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,300
Thank you so much. Let's go eat.

109
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,100
Hey.

110
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,400
How was it?

111
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Are you done with all of your traveling documents?

112
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,400
All done.

113
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,700
I've completed my resignation.

114
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,300
What?

115
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,700
Why did you just tell me?

116
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,800
It's not a big deal.

117
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,000
And one more thing, I have a surprise for you.

118
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,600
A music company! Shit!

119
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,000
- Really?
- Yes!

120
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,700
Well done.

121
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,800
I never imagined that you would have your own music company.

122
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,100
But this is just the start.

123
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,600
You too.

124
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,400
Who would ever imagine that the person

125
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,900
who likes to fall asleep in class and do nothing all day

126
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:44,000
would be writing songs in Shanghai?

127
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,400
Can I write the first song for your music company?

128
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,900
Yes.

129
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:57,000
But when I think about the fact that you really have to leave,

130
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,600
I'll be very lonely, for sure.

131
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,400
- We can call each other often.
- Okay.

132
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,800
What will you do about Plaengrak?

133
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,100
I want to accept it.

134
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:22,500
Will he be okay with a long-distance relationship?

135
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,800
I believe that he will be okay.

136
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,400
I'm rooting for you.

137
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,700
I want to see you finally being happy.

138
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,300
See? The more we talk about it,

139
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:39,339
the more we are getting into drama queen mode.

140
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:42,940
It's you. I'll give that position to you.

141
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,060
It's you.

142
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,500
You are closing the shop late today?

143
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,300
Yes, there were a lot of customers today.

144
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,140
Hey.

145
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,620
Janjao resigned from the music company.

146
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,040
Oh, really?

147
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,220
We don't know what we should do.

148
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:09,680
Once you're famous, don't forget about me and my café.

149
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,100
So, what about you and Duean Yi?

150
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,900
- Did you guys talk?
- We talked.

151
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,440
So what are you going to do? Close down the café and follow him?

152
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,460
You are exaggerating.

153
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,919
He'll be making music there and I'll be here at the café.

154
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,860
I'll wait for him to come back.

155
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,860
That's so cool.

156
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:35,080
You like teasing me.

157
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,480
Hey!

158
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,960
Are you okay?

159
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,039
I can get up by myself.

160
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,700
What happened, Gene?

161
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,020
- There's nothing?
- Are you sure?

162
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,520
What is wrong?

163
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,380
- No need to bother me.
- Are you sure you got it?

164
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,420
- You're in the way.
- Oh, I am?

165
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,120
Yes, you were.

166
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,139
Duean Yi, do you remember when we first met?

167
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:21,579
I told you that, in order to make the specialty menu,

168
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:25,460
you must get to know and understand that person first.

169
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,180
Today, I'm going to make that menu for you.

170
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,360
That makes me shy.

171
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,540
What do you mean, shy?

172
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,050
Can't wait to try it.

173
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,660
Okay.

174
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,260
Is it beautiful?

175
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,060
It really is.

176
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,420
Give it a try.

177
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,400
It's...

178
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,320
It's what?

179
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,540
It's refreshing.

180
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,780
And has the bitter taste of coffee a little bit.

181
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,940
There's also the aroma of flowers.

182
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,839
So, do you like it?

183
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,700
I do.

184
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:46,660
Then I'll name this menu... Coffee Melody.

185
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,580
Thank you.

186
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:57,359
Once you come back, I'll make it for you every day. Okay?

187
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,160
Okay.

188
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,120
Oh, Plaengrak.

189
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,140
This evening do you want to go and have dinner at my house?

190
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,340
So you can meet my mom and dad, too.

191
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:15,240
Normally, people invite their lovers to visit their houses.

192
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,580
Then,

193
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,220
will you please be my boyfriend?

194
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,620
Yes.

195
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:41,260
Now, you and I are dating.

196
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,920
That means I can invite you to have dinner at my house now.

197
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,920
You are adorable, did you know that?

198
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,900
Let me give you a hug.

199
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,459
- Plaengrak.
- What?

200
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:04,380
Are you afraid someone will walk in and see?

201
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,360
There's no one here and you are my boyfriend.

202
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,600
Can't I show off?

203
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,879
Why are you sitting here alone?

204
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,679
When I'm tired, I would usually come and sit here,

205
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,980
it's just that no one knows.

206
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,899
Are you free tomorrow?

207
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,530
Tomorrow?

208
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:36,340
Yes, why?

209
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,420
- Let's go for a date.
- What? Date?

210
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,520
Yes, a date.

211
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,040
Don't you want to go?

212
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,930
You really don't want to go?

213
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:51,400
Fine, I'll go!

214
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,160
But I don't want to go that much.

215
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,640
You're shy. I can tell.

216
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,820
I'll change my mind then.

217
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,300
- Gene.
- What?

218
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,560
I like you.

219
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,420
What are you playing at?

220
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,799
I asked what are you playing at?

221
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:49,080
- Don't pretend to sleep!
- I wasn't playing.

222
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,799
Don't act like you don't know!

223
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,319
Don't act like you don't know. Do you know what you did?

224
00:16:55,319 --> 00:16:56,600
If you're shy, just say that.

225
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,080
Tomorrow, come to pick me up then.

226
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,280
Whatever. Come pick me up though!

227
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,580

242
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,480
- May I register, too?
- Yes, of course.

243
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,820
Nawa...

244
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,700
May I help you with anything?

245
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:22,160
No, it's all right. You'll get tired.

246
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,360
I really want to help you.

247
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,279
If others see that the owner of a big music company

248
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,680
is helping my music company, it won't look good.

249
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,860
You are still the type to think too much.

250
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,040
Please excuse me. I'm going to continue handing these out.

251
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,840
I'll help you. Here.

252
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,660

Nawa, here's a drink.

256
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,680
Thank you.

257
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,700
How's it going? Are you tired?

258
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,940
It's going fine.

259
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,080
Janjao.

260
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,540
Since we're no longer boss and employee,

261
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,120
may I please pursue you?

262
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,880
What are you talking about?

263
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,159
You once told me we couldn't date because we worked together.

264
00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:45,240
But it's not like that anymore.

265
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,920
Do you really mean it?

266
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,880
Yes.

267
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,740
Or are you trying to steal information from me to give to the marketing team?

268
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,960
You still like to think too much.

269
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,560
I'm just kidding!

270
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,340
And you still remember the drink that I like.

271
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,940
You remember that it's less sweet. I know by tasting it.

272
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,160
I told you that I can remember.

276
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,920
Excuse me, we are recruiting new artists.

277
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,859
Excuse me, we are wondering if we may register?

278
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,000
Of course.

279
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:10,079
Hey! How did you guys get here?

280
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:11,680
We're here to register at your company.

281
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,510
Are you guys crazy?

282
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,540
We already had a discussion.

283
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,620
No matter how close we are to success,

284
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:23,840
but we believe that if we start again with you,

285
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,680
we can do it for sure.

286
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,020
I'm really touched.

287
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,379
What will your music company say?

288
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:35,140
We canceled the contract already.

289
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,560
You can accept us now, right?

290
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,940
Hey! Wait for me, too.

291
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,239
Come on, we'll help hand them out.

292
00:21:49,239 --> 00:21:51,519
Here, register first.

293
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,100
- Thank you so much.
- Do I still need to register?

294
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,280
Of course.

It's good to see you relaxing like this.

302
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:25,559
Usually, I only see you work and complain.

303
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,900
You'll get my complaint!

304

We're waiting so I want to try it first to see if the guest will like it.

328

Oh, really? See if he likes it, is it?

329
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:29,239
Never mind, I don't want to.

330

- Wait a moment.
- Oh, there they are.

331
00:24:32,199 --> 00:24:35,939
- Hello.
- Hello.

332
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:38,620
Everyone, this is Plaengrak.

333
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,380
Oh, come on have a seat. Sit down.

334
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,980
Come.

335
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,460
Last time, my child came home, he was crying a lot.

336
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:56,300
This time he comes back home, he brings a guy.

337
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,479
- Dad! Don't tease me.
- My son is incredible!

338
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:02,700
- Don't tease him.
- Well, it's the truth.

339
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,359
Did you know Plaengrak owns a coffee shop?

340
00:25:08,359 --> 00:25:09,959
- Oh! Really?
- Yes, ma'am.

341
00:25:09,959 --> 00:25:13,479
I want to try your coffee sometime.

342
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:17,419
You look like you can make really good coffee.

343
00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:19,320
Of course.

344
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,060
Now, I know who Duean Yi is like.

345
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:27,350
Ai! Watch it, are you teasing me?

346
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,530
Sorry, mom.

347
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:35,980
Everyone, I wanted to tell you that,

348
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,580
Plaengrak and I are dating now.

349
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:45,400
Bringing him over like this, you didn't have to tell us.

350
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,280
Actually, if you didn't say anything, I wouldn't know. Are you dating?

351
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:54,459
That's good. While Duean Yi is gone, I will have an extra son.

352
00:25:54,459 --> 00:25:56,500
Of course, please take care of me.

353
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,400
We're pleased and you're welcomed here.

354
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,159
I will give my support for your long-distance relationship.

355
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,299
Please take care of him,

356
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:09,659
my son is really stubborn.

357
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:13,140
Ma, that's enough.

358
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,700
Will you be spending the night today?

359
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,759
If so, I'll prepare the room for you.

360
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,320
It's okay Ma, I have to go back and pack my things.

361
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:28,860
Would you like Ai to go help you? That way you won't be tired.

362
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,030
Ma, I don't think your son

363
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,730
wants me to go help.

364
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:40,359
He should probably have someone helping him already.

365
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:42,759
You know nothing.

366
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:45,660
All right, please take care of him Plaengrak.

367
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,720
- Of course.
- Okay.

368
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,539
I'll take care of you.

369
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:55,239
Everyone, I have a song that I want you guys to listen to.

370
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,119
It's the song that I asked you and Pa for permission to work on.

371
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:03,100
- Go on then, let's hear it.
- Do you want to listen to it?

372
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,699
- Sure!
- Hurry up.

373
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:06,440
Hurry up, Brother.

374
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:09,120
Here we go.

375
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:05,840
It's a shame that we just started dating, but now we'll be separated.

376
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,839
Just a little.

377
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:13,040
If you miss me,

378
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:16,000
then just call me often.

379
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,640
I'll probably miss your coffee for sure.

380
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,170
I would also miss the boy...

381
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:28,300
that chased me to pursue me every day.

382
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,519
What? Are you that person?

383
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,300
Please hug me...

384
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,500
Okay, come here.

385
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,760
When you're over there, don't misbehave. Okay?

386
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,979
You too, okay?

387
00:28:46,979 --> 00:28:48,519
What? No.

388
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,540
Most days I'm at the café.

389
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,100
Everywhere I turn, all I can see are Gene and Thitnuea.

390
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,779
Where would I find the time to see people?

391
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:08,019
Woah, looks tasty.

392
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:10,159
- Would you like two?
- Yes.

393
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,739
Okay.

394
00:29:11,739 --> 00:29:14,719
- Be careful with your arms.
- I haven't touched it yet.

395
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,420
Wait a moment.

396
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,319
Are our hand prints similar?

397
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:54,420
This ugly?

398
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,500
I'll hit you...

399
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,570
You're stabbing me.

400
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:03,659
Hello.

401
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:07,979
Gene, I thought you told me you didn't like him?

402
00:30:07,979 --> 00:30:10,030
Of course, people who are dating

403
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,280
would normally be sweet.

404
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,339
- Hey. You guys are dating?
- That's right.

405
00:30:15,339 --> 00:30:18,159
I thought we wouldn't tell others?

406
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,860
What's wrong, Gene?

407
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,940
He's a shy boy.

408
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,800
Okay, enjoy.

409
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,900
- Thank you.
- Sure.

410
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,060
Do you like playing with my facial hair?

411
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,120
It's long.

412
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,700
- Hey.
- What?

413
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:05,860
Did you know? I never thought that my friend would go international.

414
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:09,359
True. I also never imagined that

415
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:12,759
one day you would start your own music company.

416
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:15,120
Yes.

417
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,860
Thinking about the old times...

418
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:21,099
nobody understood us.

419
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:23,100
That's true.

420
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:29,299
When you started your work, you came back crying to me every day.

421
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:31,840
Because I was stressed!

422
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,560
Crybaby.

423
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,740
But speaking of which,

424
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:43,039
I never thought that we would come this far.

425
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:47,960
When you are there, you won't have me nagging you about work.

426
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,960
Or wake you up and bring you food anymore.

427
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,100
Same to you.

428
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:00,020
There won't be anyone making your life difficult anymore.

429
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,240
Shouldn't I be happy, then?

430
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,880
Hey.

431
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,400
Please take care of Pa and Ma for me.

432
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,380
You don't have to worry.

433
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:21,140
When you're there, just focus and work hard.

434
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,620
So, how are you and Nawa?

435
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,080
We're going on a date tomorrow.

436
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,319
You sure got it!

437
00:32:35,319 --> 00:32:38,780
I have to give it a try.

438
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:45,380
Let me see. My friend has found love.

439
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,779
Gosh, you! Hurry up and pack.

440
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:52,480
Okay, please help me.

441
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,420
This is all you're taking?

442
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,039
- Walk carefully, okay?
- Where are you taking me?

443
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,140
We're almost there.

444
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,679
Stand here and turn around.

445
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,180
Okay.

446
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,830
Just a second.

447
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,420
You can look now.

448
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,060
Do you like it?

449
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,960
I like it.

450
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:42,000
I really wanted to do this for you. I wanted to repay you.

451
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,760
I want to make you happy.

452
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,440
Thank you so much.

453
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,420
Of course.

454
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,820
When you're over there, focus and work hard.

455
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:02,600
Focus on doing what you dreamed of.

456
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,250
Okay?

457
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,520
Yes.

458
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,800
You are so adorable.

459
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,200
And I will wait for you.

460
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,960

461
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:25,140

Do you like it when

I do.
