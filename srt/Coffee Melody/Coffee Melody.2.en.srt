1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:06,900
Is it good?

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,400
It's really good.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,400
Then, may I make it for you every morning?

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,600
Yes, of course.

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,400
You are writing a love song, right?

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,000
Yes.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,000
Can I be your love song?

8
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,200
Damnit, what's going on?!

9
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,800
Why not come open the door tomorrow?

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,900
Why did you come so early in the morning?

11
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:11,900
Early? Nevermind that!

12
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:13,800
Don't forget that you have to submit your work.

13
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:18,200
Yes, I know. Come in first. You're always nagging.

14
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,000
- Have you eaten yet?
- Nope.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,700
I bought this for you, just eat first…

16
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,200
- It's a bit messy.
- It's so damn messy!

17
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,000
What is this?

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,400
Just try it.

19
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,200
How is it?

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,000
It's good.

21
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,600
How's the song going?

22
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,200
The producer wants to take a look at it.

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,400
It's coming along.

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
I'm almost done with the song.

25
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,400
Let me check it one more time, though.

26
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,700
Sure...

27
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,600
As soon as you meet a guy, your work gets completed.

28
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,000
But I think it's still missing something.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,700
I think it can be better than this.

30
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,400
Maybe it's because I wrote the song from my perspective of one-sided love.

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,800
It's not from two people who love each other.

32
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,400
Sure...

33
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,100
You are such a drama queen.

34
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,100
Stop talking about me, what about you?

35
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,300
How are things going with Nawa?

36
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,800
- Well, there's nothing going on.
- Oh, really?

37
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,900
When we were in university, you were literally obsessed with him.

38
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,600
Well, that's in the past.

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,400
Plus, I don't have time to do anything like that anymore.

40
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,400
And besides managing the band

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,900
is already really tiring.

42
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,100
And I also have to keep tabs on your work.

43
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,600
Hey, are you low-key trying to scold me?

44
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,200
Nonsense. It's all in your head.

45
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,400
Don't let me find out...

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, hey! Are you going to the café today?

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,400
I wanted to but…

48
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,700
I don't want to meet that Thitnuea guy.

49
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,400
What did he do to you?

50
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,200
It's nothing, but I like Plaengrak...

51
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,700
and people are shipping them together.

52
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,900
Dude!

53
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,300
Maybe it's just people shipping them for fun.

54
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,600
But think about it though.

55
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,100
If I suddenly get in between them, won't the fans kill me?

56
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,700
Oh, come on!

57
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,600
If you like him, just continue to pursue him.

58
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,300
And if they are really dating,

59
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,600
all you have to do is not get involved. Okay?

60
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,100
That's true.

61
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:39,600
Oh, and Plaengrak makes really delicious desserts.

62
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,800
- Shit, he makes both coffee and desserts...
- Wait...

63
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,900
- He's the man of my dreams!
- Wait, wait, wait!

64
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,600
When did you eat what?

65
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,800
Well, yesterday...

66
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,800
I left my wallet at the cafe, and I went back to get it.

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,600
So he then invited me to try the desserts he made.

68
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,700
Don't tell me that you purposely left it?

69
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,300
Are you crazy?

70
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,000
Your friend here isn't Cinderella.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,200
Who forgets their glass slipper and has a prince falling for them?

72
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,000
- Sure...
- But..

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,100
If he really falls for me, I have no problem with it!

74
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,100
Such a beauty!

75
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,800
Of course.

76
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,500
Anyways... Can I have a look at your lyrics?

77
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,800
Not yet, just wait…

78
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:24,200
Gosh, darn you! You're always like this. Did you lie about finishing it?

79
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,600
You're always nagging!

80
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,000
- Let's go to the coffee shop.
- Hey!

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,500
If you haven't finished yet, you'll be answering to me.

82
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,900
Work must be done but I also need love.

83
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,000
We can't just choose one, you know?

84
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:42,200
Okay fine.

85
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,200
Go for it!

86
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,300
Make him know that you are a fighter.

87
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,300
That's for sure.

88
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,600
Are you going to attend a meeting this morning?

89
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,200
Of course!

90
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:57,600
If I don't, who's going to summarize the meeting for Mr. Nawa?

91
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,000
Mr. Nawa is attending as well?

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
Why didn't you tell me?

93
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,000
How's my face?

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,600
Can I borrow your lipstick?

95
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,700
Is it necessary?

96
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,300
Of course!

97
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,500
I might be able to catch Mr. Nawa's eyes.

98
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,800
If anyone is catching Mr. Nawa's eyes,

99
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,400
it's going to be me, Ms. Mermaid.

100
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,300
So, what are you all gossiping about?

101
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,100
Don't you have work to do?

102
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
Let me join the gossip, too.

103
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,000
You're just going to gossip and not get any work done?

104
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Speaking of which, let's gossip about Mr. Nawa.

105
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,500
Are you gossiping about Mr. Nawa?

106
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,000
But wait!

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,600
Will Janjao be joining the meeting?

108
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,500
I didn't see her at the office.

109
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,500
I saw a Post-it Note she left saying she's meeting with the band, Winter.

110
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,700
She'll probably be in around the afternoon time.

111
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,800
Let's leave out Janjao for now.

112
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,500
Come on, let's gossip about Mr. Nawa. Quickly.

113
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,300
Yes! I'm ready, let's talk!

114
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,800
Who are you all gossiping about?

115
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,800
- Oh!
- We're gossiping about Mr. Nawa!

116
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,200
Mr. Nawa, you entered so quietly without a sound. It surprised me.

117
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,600
Why are you surprised?

118
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,600
As if you were gossiping about me and got caught.

119
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,400
Mr. Nawa, the meeting is starting soon.

120
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,000
Do you want a cup of coffee?

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,700
I will make one for you.

122
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,300
As for me, I have to attend the meeting, too.

123
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,600
Ms. Mermaid and Lee Jia, let's prepare our presentation.

124
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,100
I'm very energetic this morning. Let's get to work!

125
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,400
- That's right! Let's go do the job we all love!
- Let's go!

126
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,200
- Please excuse us.
- Please excuse us.

127
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,000
Let's go.

128
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,199
Hello, Uncle Nawa.

129
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,200
Hello, Meiji. What are you doing? Let me take a look.

130
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,900
I'm drawing. Is it pretty?

131
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,800
Wow! It's really beautiful. You are extraordinary!

132
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,100
- Milk and dessert, Mr. Nawa.
- Thank you.

133
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,800
Let's put them here.

134
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,600
Oh, Pim, do you know my niece yet? This is Meiji.

135
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,200
She'll be at our office for half the day.

136
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,000
Hello, Pim.

137
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,500
Hello.

138
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,400
May I be excused?

139
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,100
Okay.

140
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,700
Are you hungry? Want some snacks? Here.

141
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,200
[Half Moon | Slow Bar Coffee]

142
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,400
What should we eat today?

143
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,000
Hi, Yi and Jan!

144
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,200
Hello!

145
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,800
- Yes, hi!
- Hi!

146
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,900
- Yes, hello!
- Hey!

147
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,700
Gene, are these your seniors from university?

148
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:46,100
That's right. This is Janjao, my beautiful senior mentor.

149
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,500
And this is Duean Yi, he's Janjao's bestfriend.

150
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,000
- And they are...
- My name is Thanim!

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,500
- I'm Bai Bua.
- I'm Bai Toei.

152
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,300
Oh, wow!

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,800
If you need anything else, feel free to tell us.

154
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,900
We are right at your service!

155
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,200
By the way, did you guys come because you missed me?

156
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,100
Or... have you fallen for someone's barista skills?

157
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,700
You said it as if you know already!

158
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:22,300
How wonderful. You leave your friend as soon as you see a guy.

159
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,900
Bye for now.

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,900
The seniors from Gene's university are pretty funny.

161
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,900
Yeah, I agree. I think so, too.

162
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,100
You came early today.

163
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:38,600
As soon as I woke up, I thought about the coffee flavor from yesterday.

164
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,400
So, can you please make the same special coffee recipe for me?

165
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,700
Of course.

166
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:46,600
I just got new coffee beans from Mae Chan Tai.

167
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,300
It's a medium roast yellow honey processed type of beans.

168
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,300
Although it's Thai coffee, the flavor is very nice.

169
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,300
It's a cold brew. Would you like to try it?

170
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,700
Oh...

171
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,600
Hey, you... hey.

172
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,800
When you said, "oh" did you understand?

173
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,599
Not really.

174
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,500
But I have to pretend I do.

175
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,600
That's good.

176
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,600
I'll go sit over there. All right?

177
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,700
Yeah. Just go. You are ruining my chance.

178
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,400
Geez, you guys got close quite fast.

179
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,300
- Please try it.
- Okay.

180
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,100
It's so freaking delicious!

181
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,600
There's a sweet and aromatic scent, and it's really refreshing.

182
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,700
It's a honey-yellow cold brew.

183
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,500
It's considered today's welcoming drink.

184
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,400
Since you're so good at brewing coffee,

185
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,200
you probably have a lot of loyal customers. Right?

186
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,800
Well, I have some.

187
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,300
I'm not surprised.

188
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,400
Even I like it when

189
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,700
I see you brewing coffee.

190
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,400
So, do you like today's welcoming drink?

191
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,500
You're the first person to try this recipe.

192
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,000
Of course, I like it.

193
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,100
I feel like it's kind of special.

194
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,800
It is, because a specialty coffee takes time to make.

195
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
We make one cup at a time with effort.

196
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,300
Because when we make it for someone, we must make it as delicious as possible.

197
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:37,100
And... it must match their preference to the fullest.

198
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,800
It means that your coffee is a success,

199
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,000
because it really matches me.

200
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,400
You're really good at sweet talking.

201
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,600
I wasn't just sweet talking, I really mean it!

202
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,700
I really like it.

203
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:01,200
- You like... the coffee?
- Yes.

204
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,000
And... I also like you.

205
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,639
If you really mean it, then thank you.

206
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:14,600
But from day to day, I only have time for this café.

207
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,459
I don't really have time for anyone.

208
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:19,940
I'm already overwhelmed with just the café alone.

209
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,980
Oh, if you say it like that,

210
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:27,220
then what should I do?

211
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,199
I don't mind if you come to hang out at the café.

212
00:11:30,199 --> 00:11:32,420
I welcome you here, you know.

213
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,340
Then…

214
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,880
May I come and pursue the café owner, please?

215
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,620
Well, you can try.

216
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,840
But it's not going to be easy, I'm telling you.

217
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,879
That will do.

218
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:51,980
I like a difficult challenge.

219
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,300
I can get shy too, you know...

220
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,040
- Is it delicious?
- Very much.

221
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,090
I think this one smells really good.

222
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,679
It does smell really nice.

223
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,480
I should try it, too.

224
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,360
How was it? Did you succeed in flirting?

225
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,199
Not today.

226
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,399
But tomorrow maybe.

227
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,980
Oh, geez! My friend is quite delusional!

228
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,460
I'm not though.

229
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:33,860
I didn't leave with you yesterday because I was here eating cake with him.

230
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,739
Oh, wow! Tell me about it.

231
00:12:37,739 --> 00:12:40,440
It's nothing much, but...

232
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,220
I can feel that he's still single.

233
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,780
If that is so…

234
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:48,580
You won't have any issues with Thitnuea, right?

235
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,340
I'll wait and see.

236
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,980
But...

237
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,759
he did say that he doesn't want to date yet.

238
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,840
Well, keep on trying.

239
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,040
You said you're a fighter.

240
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,919
I know. Of course. I'll fight.

241
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,120
Because I like him.

242
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,640
I won't give up that easily.

243
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,360
I do sense that he also likes me.

244
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,240
Hold on! What's with the confidence?

245
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,300
He smiles when he looks at me.

246
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,120
Dude!

247
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,280
It's his job. Do you want him to have a grumpy face?

248
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,540
You like to shatter my dreams!

249
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,340
Fine, I won't say anything.

250
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:45,780
Here's your coffee.

251
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,000
Excuse me.

252
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
- This is your Cappuccino.
- Thank you.

253
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,020
This is the special menu for today.

254
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,880
Thank you.

255
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,320
Feel free to give me your opinion about it.

256
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,200
Since we know each other better,

257
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:06,680
this cup of coffee must be much more intense. Right?

258
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,660
You can give it a try.

259
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,379
In that case, let's grab something to eat together when you're free.

260
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:16,800
So we can get to know each other better.

261
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,760
Sure, but recently I haven't got a lot of free time.

262
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,919
If you are free, you can come to the café when it's closed.

263
00:14:22,919 --> 00:14:24,339
I'll cook for you.

264
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:25,900
Oh my.

265
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,459
Not only do you make amazing coffee,

266
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:31,279
Duean Yi also told me that you make good cakes

267
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,920
and you can cook, too?

268
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,820
He's perfect, isn't he?

269
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,820
Oh, that's too much.

270
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,520
Just let me know later. Please excuse me.

271
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,239
- I'm going now.
- Okay.

272
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,640
You should stop smiling.

273
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,639
Excuse me. Don't you two have work to do?

274
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:03,339
- Gene!
- Yes?

275
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:05,620
Relax, it's just us.

276
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,660
Sorry, I got a bit envious.

277
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,820
A guy will be cooking for you. It feels like a date.

278
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,579
It's giving a warm feeling like sitting by a fireplace.

279
00:15:15,579 --> 00:15:21,039
See? I told you he likes me.

280
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:23,699
Woah! Keep going! Don't give up!

281
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,239
- Woah!
- Gene!

282
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,340
I'm just kidding...

283
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,959
- Oh, Gene...
- Yes?

284
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,460
Can you help me find out

285
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:37,640
what's going on between Thitnuea and Plaengrak?

286
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,059
Wait! What's with that expression?

287
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:43,060
I don't know what's going on between those two,

288
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,879
but I really don't like Thitnuea.

289
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,879
Why? Why?

290
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:51,580
He likes to tease me, and bully me!

291
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:53,680
Bully?

292
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,339
If a guy teases you,

293
00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:57,700
- maybe he likes you?
- Right.

294
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,440
Yeah, right. We bicker every time we see each other.

295
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,000
Anyway, I'm going back to work.

296
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,740
And about those two,

297
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:10,160
I'll be Detective Conan and investigate it for you.

298
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
Very good.

299
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,280
You guys, I wish you guys were this interested in work, too!

300
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,740
Do you have anywhere else to go?

301
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,340
I'll have to get to the office. Do you wanna come with me?

302
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:32,900
It's okay. You go ahead.

303
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,340
Don't forget to submit your work.

304
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,620
Yeah, I know…

305
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,940
He's adorable, isn't he?

306
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,919
I told you that he likes me.

307
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:50,400
Yeah. Whatever you say.

308
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,660
Hello, Janjao, where are you?

309
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,280
I am right behind you.

310
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,240
I'm here.

311
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,959
I went to prepare the contract for the boys in the band, Winter, to sign today.

312
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:19,840
How was it? Is it done?

313
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,380
Yes, all done.

314
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:26,020
After signing the contract, would you like to go have dinner with me?

315
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,639
No, thank you. I still have plenty of work to do.

316
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,380
Well… tell me when you are free.

317
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,430
Okay. Next time, I will eat a lot.

318
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,139
Don't forget to summarize the meeting today, for me.

319
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:41,840
I have a meeting on marketing to go to.

320
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,180
Sure. I'll get it done for you.

321
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,000
As for the band, Winter, I'm waiting to see them.

322
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,080
Seeing how you've put so much effort into them,

323
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,880
I believe that it should turn out well.

324
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,960
It's not that it should but it will turn out well.

325
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,820
Okay, I trust you.

326
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,360
If you need any advice, feel free to talk to me.

327
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,039
I will.

328
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,200
Then, how about we head to the meeting. Right?

329
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,790
- Okay.
- Please.

330
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,899
Okay. Let's begin.

331
00:18:14,899 --> 00:18:17,260
First things first, let me make introductions.

332
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:20,720
He is the owner of this record label. His name is Mr. Nawa.

333
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

334
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,919
You might recognize all of them already.

335
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,479
It's a pleasure to work with all of you.

336
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,520
If you have any problems with the contract, please tell me.

337
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,059
Since I am the band leader,

338
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:43,800
I would like to say thank you for giving us the chance.

339
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:49,240
Most importantly, we must thank Janjao for inviting us to join your label.

340
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,740
And for understanding what our band means.

341
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:57,319
I couldn't imagine that there will be someone interested in our band.

342
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:01,799
I'm the one who's thankful to you all for letting me take care of you.

343
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,920
And I have something important to say to you guys, too.

344
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,119
I would like to have one of my trainees

345
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,359
joining the band for the course of a month.

346
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,060
A month?

347
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,180
What I mean is, I'd like the band Winter

348
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,560
to decide whether or not you will let him join.

349
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,500
However, I want him to prove himself first.

350
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,160
Can you please introduce yourself?

351
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,359
Hello, my name is Srikram.

352
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:35,700
Tell them what your age is and your position capability.

353
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,520
I'm 25 and I'm a drummer.

354
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,620
Sorry, but our band has a drummer already.

355
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,020
Oh! It's fine. Let him practice and give it a try.

356
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,560
Yeah, it's fine. I can play the keyboard.

357
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,579
I understand you guys.

358
00:19:52,579 --> 00:19:55,460
But I wanted you to be open-minded.

359
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,460
I'm sure you understand the word opportunity, right?

360
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,060
Possible or not. Let's try and see it play out first.

361
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,380
Yes.

362
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,880
I think we should give it a try.

363
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,839
After this, Janjao will be the one in charge.

364
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,759
Let her know if you need anything.

365
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,660
That's right. Don't be shy.

366
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,100
But if she seems a little too nice,

367
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,840
I might have to be the one who takes care of you guys.

368
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,720
Just wait and see, I'll discipline them myself.

369
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:27,020
All right then. Let's sign the contract.

370
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,940
Gosh! What is it this time?

371
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,120
What is it?

372
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,639
Why are you so mad just opening the door?

373
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:13,130
Well, I'm tired.

374
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:15,660
Tired of what?

375
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,560
Step inside first.

376
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,079
Oh, damn! What's all of this?

377
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,259
I wanted to try making coffee for Plaengrak to taste.

378
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:33,440
Are you crazy? Is a barista ghost possessing you?

379
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,240
I'm serious.

380
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,760
I want to impress him.

381
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,320
How do I use this thing?

382
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,919
Hey, dude! Before impressing him,

383
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,199
shouldn't you finish your work first?

384
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,550
Geez, about that, I know!

385
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,199
Seriously, what has gotten into you?

386
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,480
What would you do if there was a fire or something?

387
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,340
You're always exaggerating.

388
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,860
Dude! There's smoke rising!

389
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,981
- What should I do?
- Why are you asking me?

390
00:22:07,981 --> 00:22:09,659
Put out the fire!

391
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:12,519
Can you keep an eye on it? I'll be back.

392
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,980
You want me to watch over it?

393
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,220
Duean Yi! Duean Yi!

394
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,660
[BOOM]

395
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,999
I'm here!

396
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,760
Relax, don't panic I'm here to help you.

397
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,640
Oh, damn!

398
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,920
It's a mess.

399
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,600
You're okay, right?

400
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,679
Okay? Me? I'm okay.

401
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,159
Let's go eat shabu shabu.

402
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,599
Fine!

403
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,400
Are you okay?

404
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,199
Just go!

405
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,999
Hey!

406
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,580
I hope the pot won't explode again.

407
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,399
Geez! You are always exaggerating.

408
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,140
Yeah, right. Don't even let me start.

409
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,280
Fine. What's wrong today?

410
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,220
The contract was unsuccessful or something?

411
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,400
No, not that.

412
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,479
Didn't you say it wouldn't explode?

413
00:23:16,479 --> 00:23:18,820
It's good to be careful.

414
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,100
I just feel pressured.

415
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:28,200
After this, I have to really focus on the band.

416
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,060
And I have to make it successful, too.

417
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:35,679
Yes, I know you can do this!

418
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,839
You are talented and you are able to achieve this very easily.

419
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,079
You too.

420
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,200
We both must achieve our dream goals.

421
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,819
Yeah. Stop being so stressed.

422
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:56,199
Start eating. The pork is getting burned.

423
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,500
You eat it, too.

424
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,900
Oh! By the way, are you free tomorrow?

425
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,859
I wanted to invite you to see the location

426
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:09,359
for Winter's debut event.

427
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,960
Well... I'm sorry, but I have an appointment.

428
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,840
What appointment?

429
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,760
It's with Plaengrak...

430
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,160
Plaengrak?

431
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,610
He asked you on a date?

432
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,180
It would be great if it was a date.

433
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,700
It's just an appointment to see him at the café.

434
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,519
Did he ask you to go?

435
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:37,839
Nope, I'm going myself.

436
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,340
I made the appointment in my mind. All right?

437
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,800
Sure.

438
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,499
So you are not free tomorrow

439
00:24:45,499 --> 00:24:48,399
because you have to pursue a guy.

440
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,080
And you're being delusional by thinking he asked you on a date.

441
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,359
That's correct. Well done my friend.

442
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,920
But tomorrow, I can't go with you,

443
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,960
I have work to do.

444
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,839
It's okay. Just go do your job.

445
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,519
I can go alone,

446
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,719
now that we are close.

447
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,800
You are close with him?

448
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,999
Shit. Is it going to explode?

449
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,820
You're worried that I will get between you two, right?

450
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,779
You know me so well.

451
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:26,620
- Sure.
- Just eat!

452
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,179
Dude, it's burned now.

453
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:32,219
It's okay, just eat it.

454
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,460
You seem to really love me.

455

[Half Moon | Slow Bar Coffee]

456
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,040
- Hi, Plaeng.
- Oh! Duean Yi.

457
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,639
You're here early today.

458
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,719
Today, I made something special for you.

459
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,160
Really? What is it?

460
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,619
Have a try, I made it myself.

461
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,140
It smells good.

462
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,280
Try it.

463
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:32,200
Is it that bad?

464
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,700
It's okay.

465
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,079
How about this? Would you like to make delicious coffee?

466
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:43,080
Yes, I do.

467
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,500
Maybe one day I can make a customized cup for you.

468
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,260
Sure! How about I teach you then?

469
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,860
But... I'm a slow learner.

470
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,400
Don't be too strict on me.

471
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,240
I won't. Just think of it as practicing slowly.

472
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,539
Any day you are free, just tell me.

473
00:27:05,539 --> 00:27:07,439
Okay.

474
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,290
But today, I have a new recipe for you to try.

475
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,639
I'll make it for you. Okay?

476
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:23,840
As retribution for making me this super delicious coffee.

477
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,140
- Okay?
- Okay.

478
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,780
Okay, I'll make it. Wait a moment.

479
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:30,159
Like I told you before.

480
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,919
Every cup of coffee you make, I can see you put a lot of effort

481
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,839
and there's a story behind it.

482
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,820
Which makes me happy every single time I drink it.

Thank you.

484

Hello?

I'm at the café.

487
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,780
I know. I did it already.

488
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,360
I'll have to go to work.

489

00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,940
do you want to come and taste test some cakes?

491
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,640
Sure.

492
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,199
Be safe, okay?

493
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,020
Okay, I'm going.

494
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,819
I think it's very basic.

495
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:48,319
Really?

496
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,020
The lyrics seemed really generic.

497
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,480
Compared to your previous work,

498
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,520
I think it can be better.

499
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,560
Okay.

500
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,180
Try and think about how this song

501
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,860
is a song for our new artist's debut.

502
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,740
There should be a little more something than this.

503
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,520
Okay, got it.

504
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,040
What's going on?

505
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,220
Are you upset by my comment?

506
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,560
It's not that, well…

507
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,540
I understand you.

508
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,260
But I don't know what is going on with myself,

509
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,480
I haven't been able to think of any ideas.

510
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,540
Then try asking yourself,

511
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:37,320
whether you really want to work on this project.

512
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,779
If you really want to, then find some new ideas out there.

513
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,280
Try to overcome your writer's block.

514
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,320
Because there's a lot of people who really want this job.

515
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:02,700
I really want to work on this. I will try once again.

516
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:09,640
I think just "trying" isn't enough, Yi.

517
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,040
Anyone can say that word.

518
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,240
I'm sorry.

519
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,979
You don't have to apologize to me. Say that to yourself!

520
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:23,080
For not pursuing your dreams hard enough.

521
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:30,380
If you can't handle it, you can let other people do it.

522
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,620
Hey.

523
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,260
I already heard the news from Joe.

524
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,580
How was it?

525
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,480
Hey...

526
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,520
Maybe I'm not really fit for this?

527
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,020
Come on... Do you remember

528
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,500
how hard you worked to be able to get here?

529
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,799
Maybe you're just tired nowadays.

530
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,120
That's why you can't think of any ideas.

531
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,080
Yeah.

532
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,860
Hey! Don't let other people's words ruin your focus.

533
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,600
I'll try.

534
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,479
If it was about something else, I wouldn't let it bother me.

535
00:32:30,479 --> 00:32:32,119
But when it's about composing music,

536
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:35,020
I feel like it's everything about me.

537
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,720
When I get bad feedback,

538
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,720
I start thinking maybe I'm not suitable for it.

539
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,160
Come on!

540
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,260
I know you can do this,

541
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,160
but it might take some time.

542
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:59,400

654
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,220
Let me help you open it.

655
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:40,340
Oh, you're good. You knew.

656
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,839
How do I use this thing?

657
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,020
Usually, we put the coffee into the top

658
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,479
- and wind it to blend.
- Okay.

659
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,599
It requires some strength.

660
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,899
Okay, got it.

661
00:40:52,899 --> 00:40:53,839
What is this?

662
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,939
This is used to let the coffee drip

663
00:40:55,939 --> 00:41:00,819
when we pour water in, it'll squeeze the coffee down.

664
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:04,479
All right. Put it in the middle... get hot water.

665
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:06,100
- This is hot water?
- Yes.

666
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,799
Be careful.

667
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:10,319
Hold it here, Yi.

668
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,060
- Hold it here, I'm sorry.
- Okay.

669
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,359
And then slowly...

670
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,299
- Is it hot?
- A little bit.

671
00:41:17,299 --> 00:41:19,319
Try not to touch this part. Okay.

672
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,139
Pour it in circular motions.

673
00:41:21,139 --> 00:41:25,760
That's good! You have basic knowledge, right?

674
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,880
- It's halfway.
- I'll help you pour.

675
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,680
Grab with your hands.

676
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,180
Gradually...

677
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,500
Try taking a whiff of it. Does it smell good?

678
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,739
It does.

679
00:41:59,739 --> 00:42:01,920
Be careful, it's hot.

680
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,360
Hey! What are you guys doing?

681
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,359
I'm teaching Duean Yi to make coffee.

682
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,360
Hello, Duean Yi.

683
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,340
I'm here to ask if you are free this evening.

684
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,199
Let's go run errands together.

685
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,719
This evening? Sure. Wait after I close first.

686
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,400
No problem, I'll wait here.

687
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:24,239
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

688
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,860
Plaengrak? Thitnuea?

689
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,140
- Yes?
- Yes?

690
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,879
Can we take a photo of you two?

691
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,859
- Oh? Can they?
- Sure.

692
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:33,559
Okay.

693
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,639
I'll go and take some photos, all right?

694
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,440
- Let's go.
- Okay.

695
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,919
- Hey. Tie it for me.
- Is this okay?

696
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,520
Help me out.

697
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,300
Hold on a moment.

698
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,520
- You okay?
- Yes.

699
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,299
Can you guys get a bit closer?

700
00:42:58,299 --> 00:43:00,500
Oh, sure.

701
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,380
Umm... excuse me.

702
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:07,599
You at the back...

703
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,800
can you please move away? You're in the frame.

704
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,719
Can I please take a photo with you both?

705
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:27,540
- Sure.
- Go over girl, I'll take it for you.

706
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:30,559
- Don't play a prank on me.
- I won't.

707
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:32,460
Don't pull a prank.

708
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,699
Nuea, can I ask you something?

709
00:43:36,699 --> 00:43:39,799
- What is it?
- What do you think is wrong with Duean Yi?

710
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,900
I think he's sulking.

711
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:46,320
Sulking? About what?

712
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,500
I don't know either.

713
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:52,760
Maybe... it's about us.

714
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,400
But there's nothing between us.

715
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:03,220
I think it's about the fans asking for our pictures.

716
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,680
Really?

717
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,860
He probably likes you.

718
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,960
I think he got jealous.

719
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,040
You think so?

720
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:18,000
But what about you? Are you serious with him?

721
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:21,319
This time you won't be crying

722
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:23,440
and stop working for the whole year. Right?

723
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,660
I'm just going with the flow.

724
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,280
It's all up to you.

725
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,720
I will help you as much as I can.

726
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,920
And if you are going to be serious with him,

727
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:45,480
I can back off and stop the shipping between us.

728
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,780
Yes, okay.

729
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,040
But let me give you some advice.

730
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,760
If you aren't going to be serious with them,

731
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,240
don't play with their feelings.

732
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,680
Try to think about what happened to you.

733
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,820
You know it well, right? It's not fun at all.
