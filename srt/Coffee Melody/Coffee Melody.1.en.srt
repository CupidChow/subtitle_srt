Hello, Ai.

2
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,419
What is it? You're calling so early.

3
00:01:00,419 --> 00:01:03,579
What do you mean early? It's afternoon already.

4
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:05,719
Don't tell me that you are still sleeping!

5
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,639
I only slept for a little bit.

6
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,719
I'm still so sleepy.

7
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,379
Get up and look at the time.

8
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:14,759
It's past 10:00 already.

9
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,120
Can you stop nagging me?

10
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,879
You can't keep on acting like a child.

11
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,559
I've been telling Ma and Pa

12
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,719
that you can take care of yourself.

13
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:33,559
Okay, that's enough. You can stop being sarcastic.

14
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,819
You never change.

15
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:38,559
Anyways, don't forget.

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,199
Next week is our parent's wedding anniversary.

17
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,459
You must join us for dinner, understand?

18
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:50,400
Yes, I remember.

19
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,279
I won't miss dinner with them and my beloved brother, for sure.

20
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,079
All right, it's great that you remember. Make sure you're free that day.

21
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:04,139
If you don't come this time, I have no excuse to tell our parents.

22
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:07,920
Yes, I promise.

23
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,999
I have to go now.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,799
I have to work on my song.

25

That's all for now, bye.

Are you done composing the song yet?

47
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,519
Janjao, my dear friend,

48
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,999
aren't you going to discuss other topics with me?

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,639
Well, well, well!

50
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,600
The company told me to follow up on your work.

51
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,139
So, how's it going? I haven't heard from you for several days.

52
00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:20,460
It's still nowhere close.

that the song you're composing will be promoting the band "Winter."

56
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,039
The band that I saw on Youtube.

57
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,380
And now, I'm going to bring them into the company with Nawa.

58
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,179
All right...

59
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:43,359
I've watched videos of them practicing, too.

60
00:04:43,359 --> 00:04:45,920
But I still haven't thought of anything.

61

Well, today I have an appointment with them.

Do you want to tag along?

Perhaps, you will get some ideas for the song.

No, it's fine.

Why are you stingy?

Tawan, please don't tell Nara that I skipped class.

Yes, he's the lead singer.

Hello? They gave you three months to compose the song,

00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,239
but you said you had no idea what to write.

121

Now, you want to compose a "love song."

Whatever makes you feel better.

Yes. When I don't have class, I work here.

132
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:34,560
By the way, did you drink anything yet? What would you like?

133
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,600
Can I have the person standing behind the counter over there?

134
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:41,960
Wait a moment.

135
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,940
He asked what you wanted to drink.

136
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,720
I told you that he will be my future boyfriend.

137
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,040
So, is he dating someone?

138
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,320
Dating? I'm not sure.

139
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,360
But there are countless people pursuing him.

140
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,580
Is it true that people are shipping Plaengrak and Thitnuea?

141
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,320
I don't know! I don't know!

142
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,899
So, what do you want to drink? My legs are getting tired.

143
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:12,180
What do you want?

144
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,879
Fine, I'll have a cappuccino. How about you?

145
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:22,320
Then I'll have whatever Plaengrak makes that tastes the best.

146
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,920
Got it. I'll get right to it.

147
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,140
Yi... and Chan.

148
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,300
How spectacular, my dear friend.

149
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,840
Good!

Sure.

Boss.

153
00:10:44,119 --> 00:10:46,140
The customer ordered Nicaragua medium roast.

154
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:47,760
This is the Ethiopian light roast.

155
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,260
Oh, really? I'll change it for you.

156
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,659
You seem a little distracted. What are you thinking about?

157
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:56,540
Are you interested in someone around here,

158
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,200
and that's why you're daydreaming, Boss?

159
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,480
What are you talking about? Nonsense!

160
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,300
Oh, right. Here's an order.

161
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,900
There is one iced cappuccino and the other...

162
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,820
He wants anything that Plaengrak makes the best.

163
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,680
Really?

164
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,800
So, they are your seniors?

165
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,880
Yes, my seniors from university.

166
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,640
Then, I'll go serve it myself when I'm done.

167
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,920
Of course.

168
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,859
What?

169
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:33,460
Oh!

170
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,880
What is this "Late" thing?

171
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,200
- It's pronounced, "latte."
- Oh, really?

172
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,460
- Yes!
- Hello.

173
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,380
The coffee you ordered is here.

174
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,880
Who ordered the iced cappuccino?

175
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,880
Here?

176
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,360
- There you go.
- Thank you.

177
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,439
So the specialty one is yours, right?

178
00:12:35,439 --> 00:12:37,200
It's mine.

179
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,840
I told Gene to order me whatever the barista can make the best.

180
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:47,220
This is the cafe's Specialty Coffee.

181
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,180
Can you elaborate more about it?

182
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,000
I don't usually drink coffee.

183
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,199
Sure. Our café has two kinds of specialties.

184
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:00,899
The first is that we choose the coffee beans that the customers want to try.

185
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:03,059
The second type is customizing the coffee,

186
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:07,700
to get the taste that will express the customer as a person.

187
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,140
But it usually takes longer because...

188
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,420
I need to get to know more about that person first.

189
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,699
But today, I chose a really special type of coffee bean for you.

190
00:13:19,699 --> 00:13:22,039
It's from Honduras and...

191
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:28,420
the beans are processed using the semi-wash method and aged in a brandy barrel.

192
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:34,399
It has tasting notes of vanilla, butterscotch, and maple syrup.

193
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,120
You may have a taste.

194
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:45,180
Oh, thank you.

195
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,680
Next time, if I'd like to drink the customized coffee,

196
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,980
I would need you to get to know me first. Right?

197
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:58,900
Just a little bit. At least we would have to be acquainted.

198
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,020
And we'll have to talk about what kind of coffee you like.

199
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:04,660
Such as taste and smell, something like that.

200
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,460
So I can choose the best coffee bean.

201
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,260
Then... shall we get to know each other better?

202
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,740
In case I get a chance to try the special coffee from...

203
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,800
Plaengrak.

204
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,480
- I'm Duean Yi.
- Sure.

205
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,240
So does this mean we know each other more now?

206
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,920
Boss Plaeng! There's an order!

207
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,960
Oh, okay. I'm done.

208
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,560
Please excuse me.

209
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,180
You are so brave!

210
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,659
What do you mean? I was pretty low-key.

211
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,859
I was afraid someone around here would be super disappointed

212
00:14:46,859 --> 00:14:50,680
from shipping PlaengNuea to shipping PlaengYi instead.

213
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,700
Calm down, please.

214
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,620
Hello, are you Janjao from the music company?

215
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,240
- Yes, I am.
- My name is Thitnuea.

216
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,479
- Oh. Please have a seat.
- Okay.

217
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,940
Right. I'm very glad that the band, Winter,

218
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,360
showed interest the last time we contacted you guys.

219
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,600
Actually, the band is thankful that you contacted us.

220
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,539
Okay. These are the preliminary documents. Please take a look.

221
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,120
[Half Moon | Slow Bar Coffee]

222
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,700
Would you like to order more? Are you thirsty?

223
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,380
So what?

224
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,940
I have read the proposal you gave us.

225
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:56,200
I want to tell you...

226
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,200
thank you so much for your interest in us.

227
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
So...

228
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,799
- I accept everything in the proposal.
- Really?

229
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,340
We are very pleased to work with the band Winter.

230
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:21,380
I'll set an appointment on the day everyone's available to sign the contract.

231
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,559
As for the documents, I will arrange another day

232
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:25,940
to bring it to you guys before you enter the company.

233
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,800
Sure.

234
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,260
And... this is Duean Yi. He's my friend.

235
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,520
Nice to meet you.

236
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,820
Nice to meet you too.

237
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,480
He's the one who will be composing the songs for you guys.

238
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,400
In fact, most of the songs that he wrote are really famous.

239
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,740
Are you the… Duean Yi...

240
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,380
Duean Yi, "Moon Only"?

241
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,560
Yes, he's Duean Yi, "Moon Only."

242
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,880
"Moon Only," comes from his name.

243
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,059
Duean means "Moon" and Wei Yi means "Only".

244
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:03,600
I really like your song, "The voice that no one can hear."

245
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,120
It's one of my favorite songs!

246
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,120
I'm so glad that we met.

247
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,419
Thank you. I'm glad that we met, too.

248
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:14,500
Well, that's great then!

249
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,560
I believe that the songs he composes will make the band, Winter, famous for sure!

250
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,079
It should be... a million views within a day, for sure.

251
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:26,379
You are exaggerating, I haven't started to write it yet.

252
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,620
Why are you telling that in front of him?

253
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,820
You can update me at any time.

254
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:34,020
Okay, will do.

255
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,300
Want to wipe your sweat first?

256
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:43,280
Dude, did he forget the contract?

257
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,840
That pink head, where did he come from?

258
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,080
Come on!

259
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,260
Hello... Hello?

260
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,160
Have you picked up the phone yet?

261
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,180
I picked it up, but…

262
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:00,619
I don't want to talk to anyone right now, except Plaengrak.

263
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:04,059
Sure... Since you have time to miss someone,

264
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,920
that means the song is finished. Right?

265
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,560
Not yet.

266
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,920
Oh, hey!

267
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,960
It's so strange. When I came home yesterday evening,

268
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,780
I was able to compose the song till morning as if there were special magic.

269
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,580
Hmmm, you're exaggerating.

270
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,260
What happened? Did your heart expand abnormally?

271
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,560
Want to see a doctor?

272
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,360
Isn't it good?

273
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,820
I was thinking of going back to the same café to write.

274
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,420
To see if I can get some inspiration.

275
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,440
That way you can stop demanding me for it.

276
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,840
Can you come with me, please?

277
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,340
Okay, whatever gets the job done.

278
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,720
That's all.

279
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,060
Okay, bye.

280
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,440
Would you like the same coffee today, Duean Yi?

281
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,820
Anything is fine by me,

282
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,560
if it's made by the same barista.

283
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,800
And you don't have to call me "Khun" anymore.

284
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,840
It sounds a little too distant.

285
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,040
Then… I'll call you Nong Duean Yi.
(T/N: "Nong" is referring to someone younger)

286
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,360
Sure, Plaengrak

287
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,520
So today, I'll let you try the Brazilian beans.

288
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,640
It's well known for its

289
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,600
caramel and like a burned sugary scent.

290
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,240
Do you want to have a try?

291
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,400
So many details.

292
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:52,000
Do you remember the details of every customer's preferences?

293
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,080
Well, I... remember yours.

294
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,160
But no one usually orders this flavor.

295
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,150
It makes me feel better when you say that.

296
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,800
By the way, where is everyone?

297
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,460
Oh, they are probably at the back of the café.

298
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,880
There aren't that many customers today.

299
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,400
Actually... I meant the other person.... from yesterday...

300
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Hey, Plaeng, you're here?

301
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,560
The customer has been waiting for a while now.

302
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,080
- Well...
- Oh, hello, Yi.

303
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,360
Do you know each other?

304
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,260
Yes, this is Duean Yi.

305
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,440
He's a famous songwriter.

306
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,800
He's also composing a song for my band, Winter.

307
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,480
Woah! You are really talented.

308
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,060
Well, then, please choose your menu, and I'll come to take your order.

309
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,120
Okay.

310
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,620
Let's go.

311
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,920
(Shit.)

312
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,940
What's wrong? You look really grumpy.

313
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,940
You're finally here.

314
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,800
Just now, I was trying to flirt with Plaengrak,

315
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,920
and that Thitnuea or whatever suddenly just appeared out of nowhere

316
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,900
and stole Plaeng from me.

317
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,160
That's enough!

318
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,720
Are you going to watch Winter practice this evening?

319
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,860
To see if it helps with your song.

320
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:33,820
Sorry, but I already have something that helps me...

321
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,680
Are you coming or what?

322
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,700
Fine, I'll go.

323
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,440
Gosh, I had to complain.

324
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,540
- Look at him!
- What?

325
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,620
Why does he have to be like that?

326
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,480
Calm down. Calm down.

327
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,000
Your coffee is here.

328
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,900
This is the cappuccino for Janjao.

329
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,540
Thank you.

330
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,160
And this is the specialty for Duean Yi.

331
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,500
Thank you.

332
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,120
This time, I used special beans from Ethiopia.

333
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,600
It gives an aromatic floral scent.

334
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,880
Plaeng, you're very talented.

335
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,920
You even know that I like to drink coffee that has a nice aroma.

336
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:31,920
This means you're very knowledgeable about coffee, right?

337
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,460
Then, may I have your contact info?

338
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,680
In case I want to drink special coffee again.

339
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,340
I can then text you about it.

340
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,640
Stop it. Stop.

341
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,600
Can't you see that I'm sitting right here?

342
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,120
Sure.

343
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,960
I've known you for over ten years,

344
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,920
I just found out you like coffee with a nice aroma today.

345
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,540
Shush!

346
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,240
Here.

347
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,940
Thank you.

348
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:05,799
If you'll excuse me...

349
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:07,360
Let's talk later.

350
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,220
Sure. See you later.

351
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:14,600
You're being too much!

352
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,740
What?

353
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:19,600
I just want to drink delicious coffee.

354
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,420
You want to drink delicious coffee?

355
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,140
"How did you know that I like aromatic coffee."

356
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,520
- Got me confused!
- Stop it!

357
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,820
You don't usually drink any.

358
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,880
Oh, it's Plaengrak's LINE contact.

359
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,360
Sure. Sure. Drink it!

360
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,860
"So special."

361
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,620
Look! There's a flower, too.

362
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,920
It's just decorations.

363
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,140
Okay.

364
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,280
- Is everyone ready? Okay?
- Yes.

365
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,100
Let's do it!

366
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,980
Calm down.

367
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,340
If we're going to record a song to send to the company,

368
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,300
it should sound better than this.

369
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,060
We haven't started yet.

370
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:16,160
Okay, one more time.

371
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,840
Everyone is ready, right?

372
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,540
Go.

373
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:37,620
Let's do it again. Go, go…

374
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,020
Stop for now.

375
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,040
Hello, everyone.

376
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,380
- Hello.
- Hello.

377
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:48,680
Guys, this is Janjao from the music company that contacted us the other day.

378
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,560
You should already know our names, right?

379
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,240
Yes, hold on.

380
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,400
- This is Thunwa.
- Yes.

381
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,920
Leader of the band, right?

382
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,820
And that is Namnao and Khualoke.

383
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,780
- Right?
- Yes, ma'am.

384
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:10,560
And this is my friend, Duean Yi.

385
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,800
Hello.

386
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,080
He will be the one composing the song for you guys.

387
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,880
Okay. It seems like you are practicing hard.

388
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,960
I won't bother you guys anymore, I will be sitting right there.

389
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,520
Let's try again. Ready?

390
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,790
All right!

391
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,740
Let's go!

392
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,160
I'm excited.

393
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,920
Yes!

394
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:49,020
How is it? The band I found.

395
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,760
They're good.

396
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,020
Of course, they are good.

397
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,680
Did you want to talk to me?

398
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,280
Oh, yes!

399
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,180
These are the documents you must prepare for me.

400
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:04,240
If there are any changes you would like to make, please let me know.

401
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,820
Okay.

402
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,820
Excuse me.

403
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,940
Can I join you?

404
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,920
You sing really well.

405
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,720
All your friends are good, too.

406
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:37,040
Actually, not that well yet.

407
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,400
Everyone practiced really hard for it.

408
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,700
We want a good result.

409
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,800
We don't want to disappoint anyone.

410
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,580
Janjao can be at ease then.

411
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,180
Another thing.

412
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:59,480
All your and Plaeng's fans, are probably waiting to listen.

413
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,900
By the way, why do you and Plaeng have so many fans?

414
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,800
It might be because, when we are both together,

415
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,900
it looks cute.

416
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:24,100
Besides, we are always near each other.

417
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,600
And also we like similar stuff.

418
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:33,200
It seems really uncomfortable.

419
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,800
Anywhere you go, there are always people watching.

420
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,300
That happens sometimes.

421
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,600
But when I'm near him,

422
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,600
I feel much more comfortable.

423
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,500
But you're just guys that people ship together, right?

424
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:59,600
You are not really together, right?

425
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,800
I'm not so sure either.

426
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,600
Something came up. Please excuse me.

427
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:24,200
And about Plaeng, thank you for telling me.

428
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
I guess I haven't told you yet,

429
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,100
but I like him.

430
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,800
I have to go.

431
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,600
Hey! Where are you going?

432
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,200
I'm leaving!

433
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,800
What's with him?

434
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:23,300
[Plaengrak: You forgot your wallet.]

435
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,800
[Duean Yi: Shit!]

436
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,500
[Duean Yi: Are you still at the café?]

437
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,100
[Duean Yi: I'll stop by to pick it up.]

438
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,500
[Plaengrak: Okay]

439
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,500
Plaengrak.

440
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,900
Oh, hey, Duean Yi.

441
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,200
Why didn't you tell me you were here?

442
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,800
If I called you,

443
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:24,300
I wouldn't get to see how cute you are when you make desserts.

444
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,800
I just learned how to make them recently.

445
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,300
No one knows about it yet.

446
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,400
Don't tell anyone, all right?

447
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,600
Oh!

448
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,600
Thank you.

449
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,300
It would have been bad if I lost it.

450
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,100
It's okay.

451
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,900
Do you want to try my cake?

452
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,000
- Can I?
- Of course.

453
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,400
Have a seat first.

454
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,700
- Can you help me hold this?
- Yes.

455
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,700
- Okay.
- Oh!

456
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,300
It's quite a big piece.

457
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,100
I'll try it now.

458
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,700
Go ahead.

459
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,500
Um.

460
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,400
If you eat it like that,

461
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,900
it will make the baker really happy.

462
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:06,600
It's messy.

463
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,700
Oh, I was going to ask you.

464
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,900
Are you composing songs for the band Winter?

465
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,570
How was it?

466
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,600
It's pretty good,

467
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:23,239
but right now I'm having writer's block.

468
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:25,040
Oh...

469
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,500
Actually, I'm looking for some inspiration.

470
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,300
Well, the company asked me to compose a love song.

471
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,200
I just came back from Winter's practice room.

472
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,400
But I don't really have new ideas.

473
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,500
Maybe it's because...

474
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,200
I'm not in love right now.

475
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,700
That's why I can't write a love song.

476
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,700
There's a saying that, if you're stressed or can't think of ideas,

477
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,400
eating delicious food will help.

478
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,500
Maybe it's true.

479
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,700
I thought this would be my worst day.

480
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,300
But... when I ate your cake,

481
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,900
it turned out to be the best day.

482
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,800
♫ I have one song, but I don't know if it's meaningful ♫

483
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,800
You are a sweet talker.

484
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,300
Plaeng, can I ask you something?

485
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,200
Sure.

486
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,700
When you told me that the second specialty of the café

487
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,400
would require time to get to know that person,

488
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,800
and it would be a special coffee for only that person.

489
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,500
Now that we got to know each other,

490
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:50,000
it'll make my special coffee taste better. Right?

491
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,100
♫ And that person is you ♫

492
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:56,200
We'll have to keep trying.

493
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,200
Good stuff takes time.

494
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,800
It's really delicious.

495
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,700
Is it really good or you're just hungry?

496
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,200
It's really good.

497
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,800
You haven't had anything for sure.

498
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,700
Do you want to try?

499
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,000
Just one bite.

500
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,600
Sure.

501
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,400
Here.

502
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,900
I will feed you, here.

503
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:26,000
- Really?
- Yes.

504
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,800
Are you awake, Duean Yi?

505
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,700
This is your coffee.

506
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,200
I would like to name it "Coffee Melody."

507
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,100
Why do you have to name it?

508
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Because it will belong only to you.

509
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Thank you.

510
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,900
Want to try it?

511
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,100
Is it good?

512
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,400
It's really good.

513
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,800
Then, may I make it for you every morning?

514
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,900
Yes, of course.

515
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,700
You are writing a love song, right?

516
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,400
Yes.

517
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,300
Can I be your love song?
