1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The story is fiction.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
And so, most of the things in this world are fiction.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's a story that's been exaggerated and exaggerated.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000

It's a story that's been exaggerated and exaggerated.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
If it's the same lie, it's a very good lie.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's what an idol fan is.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
In this world, lies are weapons.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The absolute ace of idol group Bcomache.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,280

Put your mics in one hand and start the whole thing.

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I don't know what you're worried about.

18

Thank you.

60
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:50,420
It's all right.

61
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,420
Good morning, Osamiya.

62
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,420
Good morning, teacher.

63
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,420
The vital is stable.

64
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,420
How are you?

65
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,420
I'm fine.

66
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,420
You're fine.

67
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,420
I was waiting for you.

68
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,420
What's this?

69
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,420
This is a poster.

70
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,420
I want you to put it on the wall.

71
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:22,420
Who?

72
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,420
Aya from Biko-machi.

73
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,420
She's my teacher.

74
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,420
I got all the things from the Tokyo house.

75
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,420
I can't go back to that house.

76
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,420
Don't say that.

77
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,420
Get better soon and retire.

78
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,420
Teacher, look.

79
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,420
Cute.

80
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,420
Lai is so cute.

81
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,420
She sings and dances so well.

82
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,420
She's so cute.

83
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:17,420
I'll be reborn like her in the next life.

84
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,420
Reborn?

85
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,420
That's ridiculous.

86
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,420
You don't have a dream.

87
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:28,420
I don't need to be reborn.

88
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,420
You're still cute.

89
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,420
Really?

90
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,420
You can be an idol.

91
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,420
I'll be your teacher.

92
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,420
I love you.

93
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,420
Please forgive me.

94
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,420
I'm not interested in idols.

95
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,420
I'm not interested in idols.

96
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,420
It's not downstairs.

97
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,420
Teacher.

98
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,420
Is this what you were looking for?

99
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,420
Where is it?

100
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,420
In the hallway.

101
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,420
Thank goodness.

102
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,420
Thank you, teacher.

103
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,420
Don't mention it.

104
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,420
This is the first pair of shoes I bought.

105
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,420
I promised this to you.

106
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,420
When Ai is on the stage of Tokyo Dome,

107
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,420
we'll go together.

108
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,420
So cute.

109
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,420
Why isn't your mother showing her face?

110
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,420
She's busy with her parents.

111
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,420
Busy?

112
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,420
She hasn't been here in six months.

113
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,420
She has a mother like that.

114
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:49,420
She's so good at throwing things away.

115
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:54,420
She's very fond of you.

116
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,420
You should be by her side.

117
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,420
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,420
How are you?

119
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,420
I'm fine.

120
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,420
I'm fine.

121
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,420
It's your birthday.

122
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,420
Is there anything you want?

123
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:47,420
To the other side of the Tokyo Dome.

124
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,420
Until that day...

125
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,420
I'll give you my life.

126
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,420
Teacher.

127
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,420
I'll give you this.

128
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,420
I'll give it to you.

129
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,420
I'll give it to you.

130
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,420
Think of me as yourself.

131
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,420
Take good care of me.

132
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,420
I understand.

133
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,420
I'll take good care of you.

134
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,420
Teacher.

135
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,420
I love you.

136
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,420
I love you.

137
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,420
I love you.

138
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,420
Without celebrating her 13th birthday...

139
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,420
she left this world.

140
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,420
Something seemed right.

141
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,420
She was tight.

142
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,420
She didn't admit it and she told me she couldn't blame me forPLG.

143
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,420
Time's up.

144
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,420
How are you feeling?

145
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,420
I'm okay.

146
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,420
Is itания свою?

147
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,420
I feel it.

148
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:19,440
He met the앤

149
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,000
Thank you.

150
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,140
The head sedan

151
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,520
The house

152
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,860
We take everyone as love

153
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,200
react

154
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
Stop working?

155
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,200
What do you mean by that?

156
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,200
I don't mean to stop working.

157
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
I know that.

158
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Please stand in front of the patient.

159
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,200
Yes.

160
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Next patient.

161
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Yes.

162
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Excuse me.

163
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
Please.

164
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
What happened today?

165
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
Yes.

166
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Thank you.

167
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Actually,

168
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,200
he hasn't been in a good condition for more than three months.

169
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
I see.

170
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
Excuse me.

171
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
Is he your guardian?

172
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
Yes.

173
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,200
He was a patient at the hospital.

174
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
I see.

175
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
Let's check him first.

176
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,200
I'll be ready. Please wait a moment.

177
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Doctor.

178
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
I'm ready.

179
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
I'm sorry.

180
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
You're kidding.

181
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,200
He's a twin.

182
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,200
Twin?

183
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,200
Doctor,

184
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,200
he's been in a bad condition since he was pregnant.

185
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
He's a twin baby.

186
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
What should I do?

187
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
It's so lively when you're born.

188
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
Is it heavy?

189
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,200
What do you think?

190
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,200
You have the final decision.

191
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:55,200
The doctor's opinion is that you should think carefully.

192
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
But...

193
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
But what?

194
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Ai,

195
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:09,200
whether you have a man you like or have a baby,

196
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:14,200
I'll keep pushing you with all my might.

197
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,200
But if you have a baby,

198
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,200
you'll never stand on a bright stage again.

199
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
I'm sorry.

200
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:43,200
Fans are so selfish.

201
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
Doctor.

202
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Oshiro.

203
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
The sky is so wide.

204
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,200
I can see many houses.

205
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,200
I can't go to Tokyo.

206
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
The air is so fresh.

207
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,200
It's a good place.

208
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,200
I chose it because the president recommended it.

209
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,200
I came to the countryside because I want to see Tokyo.

210
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,200
Did I tell you about my job?

211
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,200
I had your fans during the training period.

212
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,200
I thought I'd find out eventually.

213
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,200
But I can't hide my overflowing aura.

214
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,200
Are you...

215
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
...going to quit being an idol?

216
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Why? I won't.

217
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:49,200
I'll have children and continue being an idol.

218
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
That's all.

219
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
That means?

220
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Yes.

221
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
I won't tell anyone.

222
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Only one or two children are good idols.

223
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,200
An idol shines with a magic called a lie.

224
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,200
It's a lie that makes you look good,

225
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,200
but it hides the bad parts.

226
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,200
No matter how hard it is,

227
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,200
you have to be happy and happy.

228
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,200
You have to sing and dance on stage.

229
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,200
You have to lie to lie.

230
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,200
A lie is a love that's beyond your control.

231
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
I'm going to be an idol.

232
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:50,200
I'll get both the happiness as an idol

233
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,200
and the happiness as a mother.

234
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
I'm greedy for love.

235
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,200
An idol called love is more sharp and cruel than I think.

236
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,200
Strong and bright like the first star.

237
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,200
Then I'll give birth to...

238
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,200
...safety...

239
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,200
...and healthy children.

240
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,200
If that's what you want,

241
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,200
then I'll give birth to a child.

242
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,200
Who's your father?

243
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
That's a secret.

244
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Why didn't you tell me?

245
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,200
You'd be against it if I told you.

246
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Are you sure?

247
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Of course.

248
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,200
If you're born in 2000,

249
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,200
and you're a single,

250
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,200
then you and my agency are over.

251
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,200
I don't know your father's face.

252
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,200
My mother was always upset.

253
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,200
I told you to be quiet!

254
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Why are you laughing?

255
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,200
It's all your fault!

256
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,200
I'm sorry.

257
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
I'm sorry.

258
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
I'm sorry.

259
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
I'm sorry.

260
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
I'm sorry.

261
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
I'm sorry.

262
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,200
I'm sorry.

263
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
I'm sorry.

264
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
I'm sorry.

265
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
I'm sorry.

266
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,200
I'm sorry.

267
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,200
I'm sorry.

268
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
I'm sorry.

269
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
I'm sorry.

270
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
I'm sorry.

271
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,200
I'm sorry.

272
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
It's Aichi, right?

273
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Your mother couldn't come home for a while.

274
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Let's wait for her until she comes back.

275
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Let's go!

276
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
Wow!

277
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,200
Let's go!

278
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Let's go!

279
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
What's wrong?

280
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Don't you want to play?

281
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Mom, when did you become a unicorn?

282
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,200
Mom is busy with work.

283
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,200
Aichi, smile.

284
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:51,200
Your smile is so beautiful.

285
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,200
I want to see your smile more.

286
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
Let's play over there.

287
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,200
As I lived in the facility, I learned little by little.

288
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,200
Aichi, you're a little bit of a back-up.

289
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,200
How to behave to be loved by people.

290
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,200
How to laugh to be forgiven by people.

291
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
You can't laugh here.

292
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,200
I'm sorry.

293
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:35,200
Every time I played the love of the stars that the other person wanted, my lies got better.

294
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Idol? Me?

295
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
I can do it.

296
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,200
You can definitely aim for the center. I'll guarantee it.

297
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,200
I think you should stop.

298
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,200
I'm a student.

299
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,200
I was in a house with a housekeeper.

300
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,200
My mother was caught in a threesome and was thrown away.

301
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,200
She was thrown away.

302
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,200
It's too much for an idol to be a snake.

303
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
I think it's okay.

304
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,200
An idol is not a person who is good at it.

305
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,200
It's better to be good at it.

306
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,200
But I don't remember loving people or being loved.

307
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Do you think such a person can be an idol loved by everyone?

308
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,200
You can't love fans.

309
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:39,200
I can hear you saying that you really want to love someone.

310
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,200
While everyone is singing and dancing,

311
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,200
that lie may come true one day.

312
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,200
I heard that the lie would come true and decided to become an idol.

313
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,200
But I was like a waste and eventually lost my motivation.

314
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,200
One, two, three, four.

315
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,200
Why don't you leave it to the outside world?

316
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Outside?

317
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:29,200
A Chilean troupe is doing a workshop.

318
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
I'll introduce you.

319
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
I'll do it.

320
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,200
I told you I'd take you all over the country.

321
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,200
You said you'd take us all over the country.

322
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
I don't care.

323
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
Okay.

324
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
Next.

325
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Hikaru.

326
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,200
Do it like this.

327
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
Yes?

328
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,200
Mr. Goron, I'm counting on you.

329
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,200
Love was perfect even in private.

330
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,200
It was the ultimate idol.

331
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,200
One, two, three, four.

332
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,200
Goron, Shin-chan.

333
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,200
Three, two, one.

334
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,200
I haven't eaten.

335
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,200
I saw it.

336
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,200
Be careful not to take too much salt and caffeine.

337
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
Are you listening?

338
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,200
I'm sorry.

339
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,200
I ate too much sweets.

340
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Want some?

341
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,200
I can see your face.

342
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,200
This is your mouth.

343
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
And this is your nose.

344
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,200
No matter how close you get,

345
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,200
love never showed who the father of twins was.

346
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
Just like love,

347
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,200
it's bad to have kids.

348
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Listen, Mr. Goron.

349
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,200
I named my kids.

350
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
Aquamarine and...

351
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Wait.

352
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Aquamarine?

353
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
Yes.

354
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
And Ruby.

355
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Isn't she cute?

356
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,200
You're so cute.

357
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,200
I've decided.

358
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,200
One more week.

359
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,200
I'm looking forward to it.

360
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
Did you hear?

361
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
What?

362
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,200
There's a suspicious person around the hospital.

363
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
A suspicious person?

364
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,200
Yes.

365
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
I'll be right back.

366
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,200
Don't forget to breathe.

367
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
It hurts.

368
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
Let's start preparing for the operation.

369
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Yes.

370
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,200
Sato, I'll be on my way.

371
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
Take your time.

372
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
Don't worry, Ai.

373
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,200
I'll make sure you have a healthy baby.

374
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Excuse me.

375
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,200
Yes?

376
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,200
What did you say about Hoshino?

377
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
Hoshino?

378
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,200
Hoshino?

379
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
What can I do for you?

380
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
What can I do for you?

381
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Ms. Amamiya.

382
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
Please relax.

383
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
That's right.

384
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Where's Mr. Goron?

385
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
He'll be right back.

386
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Why did you come here?

387
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,200
Why did you come here?

388
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,200
Tomowarai!

389
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,200
We're ready to start the operation.

390
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Please raise your back.

391
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
Tomowarai!

392
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,200
Hey!

393
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Wait!

394
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Hey!

395
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
Raise your back.

396
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Please look at the camera.

397
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Raise your back.

398
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
I'm sorry.

399
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
Damn it.

400
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
Where are we?

401
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
Here?

402
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,200
We have to go to Ai's place.

403
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,200
Ai.

404
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:28,200
I'll make sure you have a healthy baby.

405
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Ai.

406
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,200
Ms. Kamara.

407
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
I'm sorry.

408
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Let's go to your mom's place.

409
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
Mom?

410
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Ms. Kamara.

411
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,200
A healthy boy and a girl.

412
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,200
Akua.

413
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
Akua?

414
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Ruby.

415
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Ruby?

416
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,200
I'm counting on you.

417
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
You're kidding.

418
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Did you really kill him?

419
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
And the doctor?

420
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
What should I do?

421
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
What should I do?

422
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
It's okay.

423
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
I'll do as I say.

424
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,200
I'll save you.

425
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Isn't it amazing that we can see the sunset?

426
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Yeah, it's never going to be autumn.

427
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
We're perfect idols.

428
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
We're just the best.

429
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,200
Live music, album recording, we're all great.

430
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,200
I don't know why or how.

431
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
But we are.

432
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,200
It's time for lunch.

433
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,200
We have the memories of our past.

434
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,200
We were born as a child of an idol.

435
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,200
This is also someone's birth.

436
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,200
But we don't talk about our past.

437
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:10,200
We're all calm about enjoying our present.

438
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,200
Ruby.

439
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,200
Let's drink milk.

440
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
What's wrong?

441
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,200
That's Akua.

442
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,200
She's wearing light blue.

443
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,200
She's your mother.

444
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
Whatever.

445
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,200
Let's drink milk.

446
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
Don't you drink at home?

447
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Love is like a few months after birth.

448
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,200
I'm a co-worker with the president.

449
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,200
I'm writing a two-step story called an idol.

450
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,200
I'm writing a story about a star.

451
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
I'm writing a story about a star.

452
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
We're perfect idols.

453
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,200
We're just the best.

454
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,200
Cut.

455
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,200
Cut.

456
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
Okay.

457
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
That's it for today.

458
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,200
Thank you.

459
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Thank you.

460
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,200
Let's take a picture.

461
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Let's take a picture.

462
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Let's take a picture.

463
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Let's take a picture.

464
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
You're cute.

465
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
Thank you.

466
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
Thank you.

467
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
Thank you.

468
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,200
Love is like a few months after birth.

469
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,200
You're cute.

470
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Thank you.

471
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
Thank you.

472
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Hey.

473
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,200
Did you watch the drama?

474
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
No.

475
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
What?

476
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
I don't have time to remember.

477
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
What's the schedule tomorrow?

478
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,200
I'm going to the studio at 6.30 a.m.

479
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
I'm going to shoot the solo.

480
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,200
I'm going to record the radio at 4.30 a.m.

481
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,200
I'm going to record the radio at 4.30 a.m.

482
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
I'm going to record the radio at 4.30 a.m.

483
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:17,200
I'm going to record the radio at 4.30 a.m.

484
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,200
I'll remember it in the middle of the day.

485
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
I'm going to record it.

486
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
I'm back.

487
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,200
I'm back.

488
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,200
Welcome back.

489
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
How are the kids?

490
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
They're sleeping well.

491
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
Where's the bath?

492
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,200
I'm going to take a bath in the morning.

493
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
Good night.

494
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,200
Good night.

495
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Be quiet.

496
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Your love is going to be broken.

497
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Let me sleep.

498
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
What's wrong?

499
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
What's wrong?

500
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
What's wrong?

501
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,200
What's wrong?

502
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Don't cry.

503
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
Don't cry.

504
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
What's wrong?

505
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
I don't understand.

506
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
Be quiet.

507
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
I told you to be quiet.

508
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,200
I'm sorry.

509
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,200
What's wrong?

510
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
What's wrong?

511
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
He's got a fever.

512
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
I'm going to call an ambulance.

513
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,200
Calm down.

514
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Bring me a thermometer.

515
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
I'm sorry.

516
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,200
I'm sorry.

517
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,200
I'll call you.

518
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Please take care of Aqua.

519
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
God.

520
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,200
I'll do anything.

521
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Please help me.

522
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,200
Please protect her.

523
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,200
Please protect her.

524
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
Ruby.

525
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,200
I'm back home.

526
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
I'm back home.

527
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,200
You're sleeping well.

528
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,200
Aqua is also sleeping.

529
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
I'm going to sleep.

530
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,200
I think it's good to leave this.

531
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
Please grow up well.

532
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,200
That's all I want.

533
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:18,200
I've never told my children that I love them.

534
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,200
If I say that word,

535
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,200
what if they realize it's a lie?

536
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,200
The End

537
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,200
Amazing.

538
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,200
It's great.

539
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,200
It's so great.

540
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
The horse is small.

541
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,200
You're right.

542
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
The first-class of the city.

543
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:16,200
120 square meters of station building.

544
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,200
The population of the residents is not a problem.

545
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,200
Where do you remember that?

546
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,200
Is it okay to rent such a great house?

547
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,200
It's a celebration.

548
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
What?

549
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
Beak Machine.

550
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,200
Tokyo Dome Park has been decided.

551
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,200
I'm sorry.

552
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,200
You should have been more surprised.

553
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
I'm sorry.

554
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:56,200
I'm happy that we have a family home now.

555
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,200
The second floor is also very spacious.

556
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,200
I'm going.

557
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,200
Aqua, come here.

558
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,200
Come on.

559
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,200
Come on.

560
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
Documentary?

561
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,200
Yes.

562
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,200
I want you to keep the record of the Beak Machine.

563
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
Me?

564
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,200
With a strong hope of love.

565
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,200
I was attracted to the director's personality without a lie.

566
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
I'm sorry.

567
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
Cute.

568
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,200
It's a little like Alia.

569
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,200
Where?

570
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,200
It's the first time I've taken a documentary.

571
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
Sit here.

572
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:47,200
If you don't show your usual attitude, I'll stop the camera.

573
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,200
I want to take a real picture.

574
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:59,200
I'm sure you can't use me without a lie.

575
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:05,200
If that's okay with you.

576
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,200
Please take a real picture of me.

577
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,200
How have you been?

578
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:22,200
I've decided to go to the dome.

579
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,200
The children have grown up.

580
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,200
Would you like to meet?

581
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,200
I'm moving soon.

582
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,200
The new address is...

583
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:49,200
We were completely invincible idols in the Beak Town.

584
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,200
I'm looking forward to the performance tomorrow.

585
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,200
I worked hard to get a ticket.

586
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,200
Members are coming in.

587
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,200
Thank you.

588
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,200
I'm going in.

589
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,200
Where is it?

590
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,200
Director, please keep this.

591
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,200
What's this?

592
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,200
Video letter.

593
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:34,200
I want you to give it to me when you turn 18.

594
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,200
I can give it to myself.

595
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:39,200
I'll definitely lose it if I have it.

596
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,200
You're smart.

597
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,200
Four tickets.

598
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:52,200
Don't look inside.

599
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:17,200
I hope I can say it someday.

600
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,200
Miyako?

601
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,200
Happy dome performance.

602
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,200
How are you?

603
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,200
What's wrong?

604
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,200
What?

605
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,200
Don't come.

606
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,200
No, Raku.

607
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:42,200
It hurts.

608
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,200
I wanted to be more painful.

609
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,200
You...

610
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,200
I experienced it.

611
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,200
I was an idol.

612
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:56,200
I made a fool of myself.

613
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,200
I made a fool of myself.

614
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,200
I laughed at the back.

615
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,200
You liar.

616
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,200
I'm sorry.

617
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,200
I'm sorry.

618
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,200
You lied to me.

619
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,200
For me...

620
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:20,200
Lies are love.

621
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:28,200
I wanted to say I love you from the bottom of my heart.

622
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:32,200
I kept lying.

623
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,200
I believed that lie would come true.

624
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,200
And...

625
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,200
I met him.

626
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,200
I got Akua and Ruby.

627
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:55,200
I got my family.

628
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,200
I'm sorry, Raku.

629
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:03,200
This is probably a bad guy.

630
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,200
Apologize to the director.

631
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:10,200
It's going to be a bad documentary.

632
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,200
I don't care.

633
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:25,200
I got both the happiness as an idol and as a mother.

634
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:28,200
Mom, Akua.

635
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,200
What's going on?

636
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,200
Ruby.

637
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,200
Mom.

638
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,200
I have to say this.

639
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,200
Akua.

640
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,200
Akua.

641
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:02,200
Ruby.

642
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,200
I love you.

643
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:19,200
I finally said it.

644
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,200
I'm sorry.

645
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:31,200
It took so long to say it.

646
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,200
I'm sorry.

647
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:43,200
I'm not lying.

648
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:51,200
I didn't want to die.

649
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:56,200
I didn't want to die.

650
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,200
I'm sorry.

651
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,200
I'm sorry.

652
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:11,200
I'm sorry.

653
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,200
Akua's father

654
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:48,200
I met your father.

655
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:55,200
I'm going to tell him about your father.

656
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:59,200
I'm sorry.

657
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:05,200
The stalker who came to visit the love in the pregnancy and the murderer who killed the love were the same person.

658
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,200
There is definitely an informant.

659
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,200
We are the real father.

660
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,200
It's revenge.

661
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,200
I'm going to be an idol like my mother.

662
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,200
The new B-boy is small.

663
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:24,200
In the end, I couldn't be an idol.

664
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:28,200
He was a middle school student.

665
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:33,200
I think the only person who can save Kana now is Akutan.

666
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:38,200
The other man who was with you is not caught.

667
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:41,200
What are you going to do in the game world?

668
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,200
I can imagine.

669
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,200
Kill him.

670
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,200
The one who made love for you.

671
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:51,200
As expected of you and my child.

672
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:59,200
I'm sorry.

673
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:03,200
It's all over.

674
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,200
I'm sorry.

675
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,200
I'm sorry.

676
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:14,200
I'm sorry.

677
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:18,200
I'm sorry.

678
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:23,200
I'm sorry.

679
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:28,200
According to the news, the incident that happened 12 years ago,

680
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:34,200
was caused by a fan who found out that Ai-san had a child.

681
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,200
The news was reported by a member of the idol group Beatmachi,

682
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:46,200
Hoshino Ruby, who is the host of the event.

683
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,200
Is it true that it was a hidden murder?

684
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,200
Is it true that it was a hidden murder?

685
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,200
Is it true that it was a hidden murder?

686
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:58,200
It is true that it was a hidden murder.

687
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:02,200
Since we brothers are active in the entertainment industry,

688
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,200
there is a high possibility that this will be revealed in the future.

689
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,200
As a result,

690
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:17,200
I chose to publicize it myself because I expected my mother's honor to be hurt by various crimes.

691
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,200
What was the secret that you were hiding until now?

692
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:21,200
Ruby-san, Ruby-san.

693
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,200
Is the revival of Beatmachi because of your mother's will?

694
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:32,200
My dream is to stand on the Tokyo Dome that my mother couldn't stand.

695
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,200
What do you mean?

696
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:43,200
How can you tell a lie that your mother has been through as an idol for the rest of her life?

697
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:51,200
My mother has always been the most important person to me.

698
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,200
She has always been the most important person to me.

699
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,200
But for my mother,

700
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,200
she is nothing more than a tool.

701
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,200
That's not true.

702
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:06,200
Liar!

703
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:08,200
Ruby, listen to me.

704
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,200
Don't touch me!

705
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,200
I don't think you're my family anymore.

706
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,200
Goodbye, big brother.

707
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,200
What is that evil guy thinking?

708
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,200
Ruby, what's wrong?

709
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,200
I'm at home.

710
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:46,200
I don't want to breathe the same air as him.

711
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,200
You're good at showing your face in front of me.

712
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:55,200
You're pretending to be a grave of love.

713
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,200
What's your purpose?

714
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,200
I'm going to kill you.

715
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,200
I'm going to kill you.

716
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,200
I'm going to kill you.

717
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,200
I'm going to kill you.

718
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,200
I'm going to kill you.

719
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,200
I'm going to kill you.

720
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,200
I'm the same as you.

721
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,200
What?

722
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:19,200
I've been asking for revenge since Ai died.

723
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:30,200
I entered the entertainment world to find the real culprit who killed Ai.

724
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,200
I finally found it.

725
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:40,200
The person who gave the stoker the address and ordered him to kill Ai.

726
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:44,200
Why don't we meet?

727
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,200
Yes, I'm moving soon.

728
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,200
Oh, the new address.

729
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,200
Our father.

730
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,200
Who is it?

731
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,200
You're going to kill him right now.

732
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,200
Of course.

733
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,200
I can't forgive the person who killed Ai.

734
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:12,200
I don't want to just kill him.

735
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,200
I have all the cards.

736
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,200
He's the most painful person.

737
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,200
I'm going to get him.

738
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,200
What are you planning?

739
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:35,200
I want you to cooperate.

740
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,200
What time is it?

741
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,200
Yes.

742
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,200
I'll show you the most brilliant scenery in the world.

743
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,200
You're the one who said that.

744
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,200
Give up on yourself.

745
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,200
Where have you been walking with me?

746
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,200
I'm sorry.

747
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:22,200
I'm sorry.

748
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,200
I'm sorry.

749
00:56:24,200 --> 00:56:26,200
I'm sorry.

750
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:28,200
I'm sorry.

751
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,200
I'm sorry.

752
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:36,200
I haven't given up yet.

753
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:53,200
Please take the real me.

754
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:55,200
Finally.

755
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,200
It's time to fulfill my promise to you.

756
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,200
Honestly, it's hard.

757
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,200
Why?

758
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,200
I'm too busy talking about the case.

759
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,200
If I'm not good, I can't tell you.

760
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,200
I'm not good at it.

761
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:28,200
But what's written in this script is the truth.

762
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:32,200
It's the truth from Ai's mouth.

763
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:36,200
What do you mean?

764
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,200
I met your father the other day.

765
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:51,200
I'm going to tell you about your father.

766
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,200
I'm going to tell you about your father.

767
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,200
Your father is...

768
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,200
There are two DVDs that Ai left.

769
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,200
This is one for me.

770
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:11,200
The name is not clear.

771
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:15,200
But there is evidence of the real culprit.

772
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:21,200
And the one who wrote this script...

773
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,200
was the only one who knew about our existence.

774
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,200
The director and the son of Ai...

775
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:33,200
are the only ones who know about our existence.

776
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,200
It's me.

777
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:40,200
I'm sorry.

778
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:49,200
I don't think you're dancing with me.

779
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:58,200
I'll take this film.

780
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,200
Thank you.

781
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:04,200
The film is going to be hard to collect funds.

782
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:09,200
I need to make a popular cast.

783
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:15,200
How about Yura Katayose?

784
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,200
I want to play the role of Ai...

785
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,200
in the movie, Ruby.

786
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,200
Are you serious?

787
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,200
You can't let Ruby experience the death of Ai.

788
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:37,200
She has nothing to do with this.

789
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:46,200
I want to portray the true love of the stars in this film.

790
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,200
I hope you want that too.

791
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:59,200
You're going to play Ai...

792
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,200
in the movie?

793
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,200
How much longer will you hurt her?

794
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:12,200
I'm the president of Ichigo Pro.

795
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:15,200
I'm your substitute.

796
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:19,200
I can't let you do this.

797
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:24,200
I agree with Miyako.

798
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,200
Don't involve Ruby.

799
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,200
Don't worry.

800
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:37,200
I won't involve her.

801
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:44,200
I can do it myself.

802
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,200
I'll do my duty.

803
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,200
Please watch over me.

804
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:57,200
I've asked the cast for help.

805
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,200
Yura Katayose, Furu Shiranui, Kurokawa,

806
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:04,200
and the others.

807
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,200
I've asked the cast for help.

808
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,200
I've asked the cast for help.

809
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,200
I can't do it myself.

810
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,200
Ruby is not allowed to play the star.

811
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,200
I'll play the role of the judge.

812
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:31,200
Of course.

813
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:36,200
Yura Katayose is a very motivated person.

814
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:43,200
She hasn't been in touch with him since yesterday.

815
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,200
I can't do it myself.

816
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,200
I'll do my duty.

817
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,200
I'm sorry.

818
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:03,200
I'll do my duty.

819
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:08,200
I'm sorry.

820
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,200
I'm sorry.

821
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:16,200
It's my fault.

822
01:02:17,740 --> 01:02:23,080
Your life was worth so much.

823
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,160
Did you take it?

824
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:41,300
I feel the weight of my life.

825
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,200
What?

826
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,200
Wait, Kana.

827
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,600
What do you mean by stop?

828
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:59,800
I mean, I quit being an idol.

829
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,200
Why?

830
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,200
I've caused trouble for both of you.

831
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,600
I don't care.

832
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:13,600
I wanted to perform more.

833
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:22,600
I want to be on the stage, not the spotlight.

834
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:30,600
I'm really grateful to you.

835
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:35,600
I'm going to graduate from Bicomachi.

836
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:40,600
I'm going to graduate from Bicomachi.

837
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:02,600
Ruby, it's time to go home.

838
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:06,600
Sorry, I'll be here a little longer.

839
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:12,600
I see. See you later.

840
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,600
Hey.

841
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,600
Who?

842
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:40,600
Gotanda.

843
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,600
Oh, the movie director?

844
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,600
I read the script.

845
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,600
The script?

846
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:03,600
I'm sorry.

847
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,600
Akane.

848
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:25,600
Sorry to keep you busy.

849
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:30,600
What do you want?

850
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:33,600
I want you to help me make the movie.

851
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:37,600
Will you watch my play?

852
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:42,600
So, you were always a woman?

853
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,600
You couldn't be a mother?

854
01:05:48,600 --> 01:05:52,600
You liked men and hated women?

855
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:59,600
Is that why you came to pick me up?

856
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,600
I didn't know you liked men.

857
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:09,600
I think it's a little different.

858
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:13,600
How?

859
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:20,600
No matter how happy my mother is,

860
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,600
children who were abandoned by their mother will be trapped in the truth forever.

861
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:32,600
That's why I think you were acting like nothing happened.

862
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,600
To protect your heart.

863
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,600
Show me.

864
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:59,600
Well, you were always a woman, right?

865
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,600
You couldn't be a mother.

866
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,600
I like men.

867
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:07,600
I hate women.

868
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:14,600
Is that why you came to pick me up?

869
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,600
My mom's so pretty.

870
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:40,600
I got both the happiness as an idol and as a parent.

871
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:52,600
I don't want to die.

872
01:07:52,600 --> 01:08:01,600
It's all because of him.

873
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:11,600
I thought I shouldn't make a movie like this when I first read the script.

874
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:20,600
But if this movie is released, I can definitely catch the murderer who killed Ai.

875
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:30,600
I think Akua-kun started this project with the intention of doing so from the beginning.

876
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:36,600
That's why I want to play this role perfectly.

877
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,600
That's impossible.

878
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:49,600
I can't understand my mother's pain and sadness.

879
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,600
I think I should play this role.

880
01:08:53,600 --> 01:09:00,600
Do you think Ruby can play better than me?

881
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:04,600
I don't think so.

882
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:12,600
But I have to take revenge for my mother and my teacher.

883
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:17,600
I have to take revenge.

884
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:52,600
I will make a movie about the actual incident.

885
01:09:52,600 --> 01:09:55,600
I will focus on the reality.

886
01:09:55,600 --> 01:10:03,600
First, I will collect the stars.

887
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,600
Please check the documents.

888
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,600
This is the opening scene.

889
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:29,600
I'm sorry to call you at this time.

890
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:34,600
I told you I would never do it again.

891
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:38,600
I met Ruby.

892
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:42,600
I said I should play this role.

893
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:46,600
I don't want to involve her.

894
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,600
I got a call from you.

895
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,600
I have a very bad future.

896
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:58,600
If the movie fails, you will ruin your own hand.

897
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,600
If that happens, Ruby will be eliminated.

898
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:09,600
Then she will be a murderer's sister.

899
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:14,600
You can't make Ruby feel so sad.

900
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,600
So I have to make this movie a success.

901
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:23,600
I will stop you from doing it.

902
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:30,600
Goodbye.

903
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:41,600
I can't stop.

904
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,600
Is it okay?

905
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,600
Please take a picture.

906
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,600
Thank you.

907
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:02,600
I got a call from the manager.

908
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:07,600
Akane Kurokawa will quit the role.

909
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:16,600
Ruby said she wanted to play this role.

910
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:20,600
What about the role of love?

911
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:25,600
I'm going to play Ruby.

912
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,600
I'm looking forward to it.

913
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:34,600
I'm looking forward to it.

914
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:48,600
I'm looking forward to it.

915
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,600
Thank you.

916
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:55,600
Thank you.

917
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,600
Thank you.

918
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:03,600
I'm nervous.

919
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:06,600
Are you?

920
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:09,600
Thank you.

921
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,600
You are.

922
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:13,600
Thank you.

923
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,600
Everyone, please join us for the 15th anniversary of the lie.

924
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,600
Thank you.

925
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:41,600
Let's get started.

926
01:13:42,600 --> 01:13:43,600
Yes.

927
01:13:46,600 --> 01:13:47,600
Ready...

928
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:49,600
Go!

929
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:54,600
An idol? Me?

930
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,600
Ruki-eru.

931
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,600
You'll definitely be the center. I guarantee it.

932
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:03,600
You'd better not.

933
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,600
I'm a girl from the facility.

934
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,600
Well, there's one personality for those kind of guys.

935
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,600
Being an idol isn't a job for a decent person.

936
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,600
It's more suitable for you.

937
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:20,600
But I don't remember loving anyone or being loved.

938
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,600
Do you think you can be an idol loved by everyone?

939
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,600
You can't love your fans, can you?

940
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:35,600
I hear you want to love someone.

941
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,600
You said you'd be the center.

942
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:39,600
I don't care.

943
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:41,600
Yes.

944
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:43,600
Next.

945
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,600
Yes.

946
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:51,600
Hikaru.

947
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:53,600
Yes.

948
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:54,600
Try it.

949
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,600
I'm sorry.

950
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:08,600
I'm sorry.

951
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,600
I'm sorry.

952
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:12,600
I'm sorry.

953
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,600
I'm sorry.

954
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,600
I'm sorry.

955
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:18,600
I'm sorry.

956
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,600
I'm sorry.

957
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,600
I'm sorry.

958
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,600
I'm sorry.

959
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,600
I'm sorry.

960
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:28,600
I'm sorry.

961
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:30,600
I'm sorry.

962
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,600
I'm sorry.

963
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,600
I'm sorry.

964
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,600
I'm sorry.

965
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:41,600
Are you not eating?

966
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,600
I didn't bring any.

967
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:50,600
I'll give you some.

968
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:57,600
Are you not eating?

969
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,600
No.

970
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,600
The president's wife made me eat.

971
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,600
You're not good with rice.

972
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:07,600
Why?

973
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,600
Rice is soft.

974
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:16,600
So if it's mixed with sand or glass,

975
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,600
it's scary.

976
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:21,600
Really?

977
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:29,600
What?

978
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:31,600
Thank you.

979
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,600
Is that the last task?

980
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,600
Then I'll leave you to it.

981
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,600
I'll pray for you to go to heaven.

982
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:53,600
Thank you.

983
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:54,600
Thank you.

984
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,600
Don't get too worried.

985
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,600
Thank you.

986
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,600
If it's about acting,

987
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,600
ask me anything.

988
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:30,600
Hey.

989
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,600
Hey.

990
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:37,600
I'll be fine.

991
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,600
Okay?

992
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:45,600
Hey.

993
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,600
I'll be fine.

994
01:17:52,600 --> 01:17:53,600
I'll be fine.

995
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:57,600
Hey.

996
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,600
What?

997
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:22,600
Have you ever loved someone?

998
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,600
Not even once.

999
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:32,600
Same.

1000
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,600
We are empty.

1001
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:59,600
Maybe this is the only way to get along.

1002
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,600
Hello? I just came back from the hospital.

1003
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,600
Baby, you were a twin.

1004
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:41,600
I thought a lot about it.

1005
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,600
I can raise you alone.

1006
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:49,600
I'm fine.

1007
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,600
Bye.

1008
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,600
Why?

1009
01:20:05,600 --> 01:20:09,600
I want you to meet the kids.

1010
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,600
Why?

1011
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:22,600
I want you to feel the emotions I felt for the kids.

1012
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:24,600
Emotions?

1013
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:29,600
I can't say it well.

1014
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:40,600
Maybe I don't need it.

1015
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:46,600
Maybe I don't need it.

1016
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:55,600
I see.

1017
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:05,600
I haven't seen you in a long time.

1018
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,600
Yes.

1019
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:15,600
The woman who trampled your heart.

1020
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:20,600
Cut!

1021
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,600
The show is about to start.

1022
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:45,600
Rina.

1023
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:51,600
The power to make people believe a lie is the truth.

1024
01:21:52,600 --> 01:21:56,600
You are the one who controls others.

1025
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:01,600
You are the one who destroys others' lives.

1026
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:06,600
You are the one who destroys others' lives.

1027
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:11,600
Are you ready?

1028
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,600
Yes.

1029
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,600
Ready?

1030
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,600
Yes.

1031
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,600
Love.

1032
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,600
I was laughing.

1033
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:33,600
I got both the happiness as an idol and as a mother.

1034
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,600
I got both.

1035
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:48,600
Love betrayed many fans and hurt your heart.

1036
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:50,600
He hurt you.

1037
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:57,600
He killed you and ruined your life.

1038
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:08,600
You can't be happy.

1039
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:17,600
Love should be punished.

1040
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,600
You should lose everything.

1041
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:34,600
You have the right to love and the silver.

1042
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,600
Cut!

1043
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:04,600
I didn't expect you to be a film director.

1044
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:07,600
I'm grateful for your budget.

1045
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:13,600
But you know what this film is about.

1046
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:20,600
It's about you as a criminal.

1047
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,600
Do you understand?

1048
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,600
What?

1049
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:27,600
Of course.

1050
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:39,600
The reason why my mother didn't come to pick me up...

1051
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,600
My mother...

1052
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:46,600
My mother...

1053
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,600
My mother...

1054
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:53,600
My mother...

1055
01:24:53,600 --> 01:24:56,600
You're sweating a lot.

1056
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:00,600
Are you resting?

1057
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:03,600
It's hard to film and perform.

1058
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,600
You have to practice every morning.

1059
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,600
I'm fine.

1060
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:16,600
I had to work hard to raise my mother.

1061
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:20,600
I have to work hard.

1062
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:28,600
Don't work too hard.

1063
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:31,600
Close your eyes while you're moving.

1064
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,600
It's different.

1065
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:38,600
It's advice from a good old man.

1066
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,600
Thank you.

1067
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:48,600
I'll see you tomorrow.

1068
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:53,600
Good night.

1069
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,600
Good night.

1070
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:08,600
The next day

1071
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:18,600
I was abandoned by my mother.

1072
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,600
I was abandoned by my mother.

1073
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:34,600
Why didn't you come to see me?

1074
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,600
You're being chased.

1075
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:41,600
Take care of him.

1076
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,600
He's your brother.

1077
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:51,600
I don't think you're my family anymore.

1078
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,600
What are you talking about?

1079
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,600
You were in the same room with Totsuki.

1080
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,600
Ruby!

1081
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:31,600
The next day

1082
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,600
Are you okay?

1083
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,600
Don't push yourself too hard.

1084
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:59,600
I have to go back to the shooting.

1085
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,600
Don't touch me!

1086
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:09,600
Do I have to play my mother perfectly?

1087
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:16,600
Do I have to play her perfectly and take revenge on my mother and my teacher?

1088
01:28:17,600 --> 01:28:20,600
I'll find you even if I have to spend my life.

1089
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:22,600
I'll definitely take revenge on you.

1090
01:28:22,600 --> 01:28:24,600
Stop it!

1091
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:30,600
I'm just unhappy to be trapped in revenge.

1092
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,600
Shut up!

1093
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:35,600
You don't have the right to be an accomplice!

1094
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:40,600
We were born in the same place.

1095
01:28:40,600 --> 01:28:43,600
We're red strangers who have nothing to do with each other.

1096
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,600
Please!

1097
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,600
Sarina.

1098
01:28:54,600 --> 01:29:00,600
You didn't become an idol to do that, did you?

1099
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:07,600
You jumped out of that room and became an idol.

1100
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,600
Leave the revenge to me.

1101
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:22,600
You can live as Ruby and an idol.

1102
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:29,600
Why do you know I'm Sarina?

1103
01:29:30,600 --> 01:29:35,600
Why do you know about the hospital?

1104
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:40,600
You took care of me.

1105
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:48,600
Are you a teacher?

1106
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,600
I told you.

1107
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:56,600
I'm not a teacher.

1108
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,600
I'm a teacher.

1109
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:02,600
I told you.

1110
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:08,600
I'll live as an idol forever.

1111
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,600
I'll live as an idol forever.

1112
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:34,600
You were always by my side.

1113
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:45,600
I love you.

1114
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:14,600
I'm sorry I left you.

1115
01:31:18,600 --> 01:31:22,600
I'm sorry I was selfish.

1116
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:30,600
I was in a difficult situation.

1117
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,600
But...

1118
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:42,600
I had a lot of fun.

1119
01:31:46,600 --> 01:31:48,600
So now...

1120
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,600
Now...

1121
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,600
Please smile and send me off.

1122
01:32:08,600 --> 01:32:10,600
Thank you.

1123
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:22,600
Next is the last song.

1124
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,600
Let's start.

1125
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:45,600
This is the future.

1126
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:52,600
It's a shiny song.

1127
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:56,600
The world is beautiful.

1128
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:05,600
It's a world where beautiful lies become reality.

1129
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:15,600
What should I do to find the real answer?

1130
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:20,600
If I fall in love, will I be able to find it?

1131
01:33:21,600 --> 01:33:38,600
I don't know if it's fate, but I'll try one last time.

1132
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:41,600
I can do this moment.

1133
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:45,600
The light shines wherever I am.

1134
01:33:46,600 --> 01:33:48,600
It's the best stage.

1135
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:55,600
The first star will always guide me.

1136
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:59,600
Let's go to the future.

1137
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:05,600
Love is going forward.

1138
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:13,600
Let's walk our own lives.

1139
01:34:14,600 --> 01:34:19,600
Let's go.

1140
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:32,600
There are times when it's hard to lose something big.

1141
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:42,600
When I look up at the sky, I feel like a star will always save me.

1142
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:59,600
If I could be reborn, I believe I could see you again.

1143
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:10,600
If I finally understand, if the end comes someday, I'll smile.

1144
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:17,600
Let's sing a happy ending with all our might.

1145
01:35:18,600 --> 01:35:21,600
Let's go to the future.

1146
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:27,600
I'll accept everyone's feelings.

1147
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:35,600
So from now on, look at me.

1148
01:35:57,600 --> 01:35:59,600
Thank you.

1149
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,600
Thank you.

1150
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:05,600
Thank you.

1151
01:36:06,600 --> 01:36:08,600
Thank you.

1152
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,600
Thank you.

1153
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,600
Thank you.

1154
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:17,600
Thank you.

1155
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:20,600
Thank you.

1156
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:23,600
Thank you.

1157
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:26,600
Thank you.

1158
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:29,600
Let's go.

1159
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:32,600
Let's take a picture.

1160
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,600
Thank you.

1161
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:42,600
I don't want to die.

1162
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:50,600
Ruby, how do you play Ai?

1163
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:53,600
I don't know yet.

1164
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:00,600
I'm sorry.

1165
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,600
Ruby, please.

1166
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:09,600
Yes.

1167
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:14,600
Let's start the real show.

1168
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:17,600
Please.

1169
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:19,600
Please.

1170
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,600
Good morning.

1171
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:24,600
Good evening.

1172
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,600
Ready.

1173
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,600
Action.

1174
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:33,600
Congratulations on your performance.

1175
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:36,600
How are you?

1176
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,600
I'm sorry.

1177
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:54,600
I'm sorry.

1178
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:57,600
I'm sorry.

1179
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:00,600
I'm sorry.

1180
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:03,600
I'm sorry.

1181
01:38:04,600 --> 01:38:06,600
I'm sorry.

1182
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,600
I'm sorry.

1183
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:12,600
I'm sorry.

1184
01:38:13,600 --> 01:38:15,600
I'm sorry.

1185
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:20,600
I didn't think I wouldn't die.

1186
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:29,600
It's all his fault.

1187
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,600
Cut.

1188
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:50,600
Okay.

1189
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:57,600
Why did you do that?

1190
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,600
I've been thinking.

1191
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:12,600
What did I think at that time?

1192
01:39:12,600 --> 01:39:14,600
I don't know.

1193
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:20,600
I don't know how much I thought about it.

1194
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:30,600
But I thought I had to forgive my mother.

1195
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:40,600
I wanted to save him.

1196
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:47,600
I think he shouldn't be forgiven.

1197
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:53,600
I think he should be forgiven.

1198
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:06,600
But I don't want revenge.

1199
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:11,600
My mother's biggest wish is...

1200
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:18,600
I think we should live our own lives.

1201
01:40:36,600 --> 01:40:41,600
What do you want?

1202
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:45,600
I'm just asking.

1203
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:49,600
I made you a mistake.

1204
01:40:50,600 --> 01:40:54,600
I told you I would forgive you.

1205
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:58,600
I newspapers didn't work.

1206
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,600
I got really angry in front of you.

1207
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:05,600
I quit the internet...

1208
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,840
March

1209
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:17,560
Good morning.

1210
01:41:18,260 --> 01:41:19,960
I'm tired.

1211
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:25,980
What happened?

1212
01:41:28,140 --> 01:41:29,620
The 하지 a category

1213
01:41:30,580 --> 01:41:33,300
for this week has already come up

1214
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:35,260
with an還 from the Бы Brock.

1215
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:37,320
Nervous, resting...

1216
01:41:52,300 --> 01:41:55,140
I've never wanted to make someone sunands...

1217
01:41:58,440 --> 01:41:59,820
by acting.

1218
01:41:59,820 --> 01:42:01,820
I've never felt this way.

1219
01:42:03,820 --> 01:42:05,820
I play for myself.

1220
01:42:06,820 --> 01:42:09,820
And what I feel is the freedom of the viewer.

1221
01:42:12,820 --> 01:42:14,820
To me, acting is...

1222
01:42:17,820 --> 01:42:19,820
revenge.

1223
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:32,820
That is...

1224
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:40,820
revenge for me?

1225
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:45,820
I enjoyed the movie.

1226
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:52,820
I felt like I was turning my old album.

1227
01:42:53,820 --> 01:42:55,820
You admit that what's being shown is the truth?

1228
01:42:55,820 --> 01:42:58,820
No, I'm not that kind of a reporter.

1229
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:06,820
But I didn't think that the doctor would be the one to draw it.

1230
01:43:07,820 --> 01:43:09,820
How did you find out?

1231
01:43:14,820 --> 01:43:18,820
I remember everything that happened to me.

1232
01:43:18,820 --> 01:43:20,820
I remember everything.

1233
01:43:24,820 --> 01:43:29,820
When the movie is released, the search for the culprit begins.

1234
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:33,820
It's a matter of time before you're taken away.

1235
01:43:34,820 --> 01:43:36,820
You should go ahead and confess.

1236
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:42,820
If that's what you, my son, want...

1237
01:43:43,820 --> 01:43:46,820
then maybe that's what you should do.

1238
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:52,820
Even now that the movie is complete...

1239
01:43:55,820 --> 01:43:57,820
there's one thing I don't understand.

1240
01:43:58,820 --> 01:44:00,820
What?

1241
01:44:05,820 --> 01:44:07,820
Why did you kill Ai?

1242
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:11,820
I mean...

1243
01:44:11,820 --> 01:44:13,820
I mean...

1244
01:44:15,820 --> 01:44:18,820
he was killed.

1245
01:44:20,820 --> 01:44:22,820
You planned all this.

1246
01:44:23,820 --> 01:44:25,820
Tell me why you killed him.

1247
01:44:26,820 --> 01:44:30,820
But you might kill someone too.

1248
01:44:38,820 --> 01:44:40,820
Why did you kill him?

1249
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:44,820
I guess...

1250
01:44:45,820 --> 01:44:50,820
I wanted to feel the weight of my life.

1251
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:55,820
Look at that.

1252
01:45:03,820 --> 01:45:05,820
I've been acting all this time.

1253
01:45:07,820 --> 01:45:09,820
I'm looking for the adults around me.

1254
01:45:11,820 --> 01:45:13,820
I should be like that.

1255
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:17,820
That's...

1256
01:45:22,820 --> 01:45:24,820
the right thing to do.

1257
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:30,820
But Ai...

1258
01:45:31,820 --> 01:45:33,820
says that I'm the same.

1259
01:45:36,820 --> 01:45:38,820
It's a little different.

1260
01:45:39,820 --> 01:45:41,820
I've always been...

1261
01:45:42,820 --> 01:45:44,820
telling the right lies.

1262
01:45:45,820 --> 01:45:47,820
Have you ever lied?

1263
01:45:49,820 --> 01:45:51,820
Was everything true?

1264
01:46:04,820 --> 01:46:06,820
When the movie is released...

1265
01:46:07,820 --> 01:46:09,820
I'll go to the police.

1266
01:46:10,820 --> 01:46:12,820
Thank you.

1267
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:27,820
I was born like this...

1268
01:46:28,820 --> 01:46:30,820
only for revenge.

1269
01:46:32,820 --> 01:46:34,820
I found the murderer who killed Ai.

1270
01:46:36,820 --> 01:46:38,820
I didn't believe...

1271
01:46:39,820 --> 01:46:41,820
that killing someone...

1272
01:46:42,820 --> 01:46:44,820
was my duty.

1273
01:46:47,820 --> 01:46:49,820
But...

1274
01:46:50,820 --> 01:46:52,820
the man I was chasing...

1275
01:46:53,820 --> 01:46:55,820
was a poor man...

1276
01:46:56,820 --> 01:46:58,820
who couldn't understand the meaning of love.

1277
01:47:00,820 --> 01:47:02,820
Right, Ai?

1278
01:47:03,820 --> 01:47:05,820
Why...

1279
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:08,820
did I change my mind?

1280
01:47:10,820 --> 01:47:12,820
Why?

1281
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:15,820
What for?

1282
01:47:17,820 --> 01:47:19,820
Aqua!

1283
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:34,820
I love you.

1284
01:47:36,820 --> 01:47:38,820
This is not a lie.

1285
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:43,820
Please grow up well.

1286
01:47:45,820 --> 01:47:47,820
That's all I want.

1287
01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:51,820
I love you.

1288
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:55,820
I love you.

1289
01:47:57,820 --> 01:47:59,820
I love you.

1290
01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:04,820
I love you.

1291
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:40,820
THE BOYD

1292
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:48,820
It's okay.

1293
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:51,820
Thank you.

1294
01:48:52,820 --> 01:48:54,820
Sorry. Thank you very much.

1295
01:48:55,820 --> 01:48:57,820
It must have...

1296
01:48:58,820 --> 01:49:00,820
happened.

1297
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:02,320
I thought so too.

1298
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:04,320
You're so talkative.

1299
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,320
I'm always a good boy.

1300
01:49:07,820 --> 01:49:10,820
By the way, did you choose that costume yourself?

1301
01:49:11,320 --> 01:49:12,320
Yes, but...

1302
01:49:12,820 --> 01:49:15,820
You're so obvious even though you're the third one.

1303
01:49:16,320 --> 01:49:19,820
Kana, you should stop being so cute.

1304
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:21,820
What?

1305
01:49:21,820 --> 01:49:24,820
I'm so nervous.

1306
01:49:24,820 --> 01:49:28,320
You said that and you ate two of them.

1307
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:29,320
What?

1308
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:31,820
Ruby, you have a half-back.

1309
01:49:31,820 --> 01:49:32,820
No way!

1310
01:49:32,820 --> 01:49:35,820
What kind of lunch are you eating?

1311
01:49:35,820 --> 01:49:37,820
Turn around.

1312
01:49:37,820 --> 01:49:39,820
Why are you so close?

1313
01:49:39,820 --> 01:49:43,820
Akawa, write a script for me someday.

1314
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:46,820
If you feel like it.

1315
01:49:46,820 --> 01:49:50,820
Anyway, you should play with me.

1316
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:51,820
In the meantime...

1317
01:49:51,820 --> 01:49:54,820
I'm so nervous.

1318
01:49:56,320 --> 01:49:58,320
See you later.

1319
01:49:58,320 --> 01:49:59,820
Bye.

1320
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:07,820
You look like you've got your luck.

1321
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:14,820
I've got my luck.

1322
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:16,820
I see.

1323
01:50:19,820 --> 01:50:21,820
I'm finally ready.

1324
01:50:22,820 --> 01:50:24,820
I'll do it again.

1325
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:28,320
I'll live my life.

1326
01:50:31,320 --> 01:50:33,320
That's good.

1327
01:50:35,320 --> 01:50:37,320
Is the button-like clothes okay?

1328
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:39,320
Yes.

1329
01:50:55,320 --> 01:50:57,320
I'm sorry.

1330
01:51:16,320 --> 01:51:20,320
The guests will be here shortly.

1331
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:24,320
Before we start, I have a few requests.

1332
01:51:24,820 --> 01:51:26,820
Ruby.

1333
01:51:28,820 --> 01:51:30,820
What's wrong?

1334
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:33,820
I'm nervous.

1335
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:37,820
No.

1336
01:51:37,820 --> 01:51:42,820
Please welcome them with a big round of applause.

1337
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:45,320
Thank you.

1338
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:50,820
They are the cast of the film,

1339
01:51:50,820 --> 01:51:54,820
which has been in the works for over a decade.

1340
01:52:02,320 --> 01:52:04,320
First of all,

1341
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:07,320
Akawa Hoshino, the director of the film,

1342
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:09,320
the co-writer of the film,

1343
01:52:09,320 --> 01:52:13,320
Akawa Hoshino, please say a few words.

1344
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:18,320
Hello, I'm Akawa Hoshino.

1345
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:22,320
Thank you for coming here today.

1346
01:52:25,820 --> 01:52:29,820
Please calm down.

1347
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:31,820
Please calm down.

1348
01:52:31,820 --> 01:52:34,820
Please stay calm.

1349
01:52:34,820 --> 01:52:36,820
Please calm down.

1350
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:39,320
Please stay calm.

1351
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:41,320
Please stay calm.

1352
01:52:41,320 --> 01:52:43,320
Please stay calm.

1353
01:52:52,320 --> 01:52:55,320
Please calm down and run away.

1354
01:52:55,320 --> 01:52:57,320
The exit is at the back.

1355
01:52:57,320 --> 01:52:59,320
Are you okay?

1356
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:01,320
Don't push it.

1357
01:53:01,320 --> 01:53:03,320
Don't push it.

1358
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:05,320
Ruby!

1359
01:53:05,820 --> 01:53:07,820
Damn it.

1360
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:08,820
Hey!

1361
01:53:08,820 --> 01:53:10,820
Be careful!

1362
01:53:35,320 --> 01:53:37,820
Ruby!

1363
01:54:35,820 --> 01:54:37,820
Ruby!

1364
01:54:58,820 --> 01:55:00,820
Hey.

1365
01:55:01,820 --> 01:55:02,820
Ruby!

1366
01:55:02,820 --> 01:55:04,820
Wait, wait.

1367
01:55:05,820 --> 01:55:07,820
I was just sleeping.

1368
01:55:08,820 --> 01:55:11,820
What the hell is your purpose?

1369
01:55:14,820 --> 01:55:20,820
I think I can only live a life of a living ghost.

1370
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:24,820
No,

1371
01:55:24,820 --> 01:55:30,820
I just want to see the moment when everything is destroyed.

1372
01:55:35,820 --> 01:55:39,820
I don't know what to do.

1373
01:55:49,820 --> 01:55:51,820
Don't touch Ruby.

1374
01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:53,820
If you want to kill me, kill me.

1375
01:55:55,820 --> 01:55:59,820
You don't have to touch me directly.

1376
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:05,320
My beloved mother and sister were killed in front of me.

1377
01:56:05,320 --> 01:56:07,320
I couldn't do anything.

1378
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:09,320
I could only watch.

1379
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:11,320
I couldn't save them.

1380
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:17,320
I can't live with such a guilt and despair.

1381
01:56:21,320 --> 01:56:27,320
Ruby and Aima are really nice people.

1382
01:56:27,820 --> 01:56:31,820
Ruby tried to forgive you.

1383
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:39,820
Ai tried to save you.

1384
01:56:41,820 --> 01:56:44,820
You are worthless.

1385
01:56:51,820 --> 01:56:53,820
Then, should I kill you?

1386
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:58,320
You are worthless.

1387
01:57:07,320 --> 01:57:10,320
You became a murderer and lost your life.

1388
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:14,320
She became a murderer's sister and lost her life.

1389
01:57:14,320 --> 01:57:18,320
Why did you come to this world?

1390
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:26,320
It's all my fault.

1391
01:57:40,320 --> 01:57:42,320
No.

1392
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:48,320
I finally met the one who had a dream.

1393
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:52,320
I didn't want to see her like that.

1394
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:56,320
I didn't want to leave her.

1395
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,320
This is an accident.

1396
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:06,820
I'm sorry.

1397
01:58:19,820 --> 01:58:24,820
I was born for revenge.

1398
01:58:25,320 --> 01:58:33,320
I believed that if I died, I wouldn't have any regrets.

1399
01:58:37,320 --> 01:58:39,320
But...

1400
01:58:39,320 --> 01:58:45,320
The day will come when I don't want to die.

1401
01:58:55,320 --> 01:58:57,320
I'm sorry.

1402
01:59:19,320 --> 01:59:21,320
Ruby!

1403
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:27,320
I'm fine now.

1404
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:35,320
Where is Akio?

1405
01:59:55,320 --> 01:59:57,320
I'm sorry.

1406
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:19,320
I didn't die like I was in a hidden place.

1407
02:00:19,820 --> 02:00:25,820
From the scene, Kamiki and I were judged as dead.

1408
02:00:25,820 --> 02:00:29,820
We had to go through many hardships.

1409
02:00:30,820 --> 02:00:36,820
But the world will forget about it soon.

1410
02:00:37,320 --> 02:00:39,320
Akio!

1411
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:50,320
Miyako.

1412
02:00:50,320 --> 02:00:52,320
Ichigo.

1413
02:00:54,320 --> 02:00:58,320
I'm counting on you.

1414
02:00:58,820 --> 02:01:00,820
I'm sorry.

1415
02:01:01,820 --> 02:01:04,820
I know he's going to keep it a secret for a while.

1416
02:01:04,820 --> 02:01:09,820
But he's not the kind of guy to be crushed here.

1417
02:01:13,820 --> 02:01:15,820
Anyway,

1418
02:01:15,820 --> 02:01:18,820
Daily life will definitely come back.

1419
02:01:18,820 --> 02:01:21,820
I'm announcing the big news!

1420
02:01:21,820 --> 02:01:26,820
I'm finally getting married!

1421
02:01:27,320 --> 02:01:29,320
My husband is...

1422
02:01:29,320 --> 02:01:31,320
Ryuuichi!

1423
02:01:32,320 --> 02:01:34,320
Hi, I'm Ryuuichi!

1424
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:39,320
No matter how much people suffer,

1425
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:43,320
No matter how much sadness they are in,

1426
02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:50,320
They can stand up again and again.

1427
02:01:50,820 --> 02:01:52,820
Cut!

1428
02:01:54,820 --> 02:01:58,820
If there is hope beyond the needle,

1429
02:01:58,820 --> 02:02:04,820
People can live somehow.

1430
02:02:08,820 --> 02:02:10,820
Please,

1431
02:02:10,820 --> 02:02:14,820
Don't lose that little hope.

1432
02:02:14,820 --> 02:02:18,820
I want you to lead a good life.

1433
02:02:20,820 --> 02:02:22,820
I'm sorry.

1434
02:02:39,820 --> 02:02:42,820
I'm going, Mom.

1435
02:02:42,820 --> 02:02:44,820
Onii-chan.

1436
02:02:50,820 --> 02:02:52,820
I'm sorry.

1437
02:02:56,820 --> 02:02:58,820
I'm coming to the house.

1438
02:02:58,820 --> 02:03:00,820
I'm coming to the house.

1439
02:03:02,820 --> 02:03:04,820
Thank you for your hard work.

1440
02:03:15,820 --> 02:03:17,820
I'm Tomomi Sataishi.

1441
02:03:20,820 --> 02:03:22,820
Please.

1442
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:31,820
Don't expect a rebirth.

1443
02:03:32,820 --> 02:03:34,820
Live in the moment.

1444
02:03:44,820 --> 02:03:48,820
I will keep pushing you.

1445
02:03:50,820 --> 02:03:54,820
Now, let's start.

1446
02:03:54,820 --> 02:03:57,820
This is the future.

1447
02:03:57,820 --> 02:04:00,820
We'll continue.

1448
02:04:00,820 --> 02:04:04,820
Shining Heart

1449
02:04:04,820 --> 02:04:09,320
Shining Heart

1450
02:04:34,820 --> 02:04:37,320
Shining Heart

1451
02:05:04,820 --> 02:05:07,320
Shining Heart

1452
02:05:34,820 --> 02:05:37,320
Shining Heart

1453
02:06:04,820 --> 02:06:07,320
Shining Heart

1454
02:06:34,820 --> 02:06:37,320
Shining Heart

1455
02:07:04,820 --> 02:07:07,320
Shining Heart

1456
02:07:34,820 --> 02:07:37,320
Shining Heart

1457
02:08:04,820 --> 02:08:07,320
Shining Heart

1458
02:08:34,820 --> 02:08:37,320
Shining Heart
