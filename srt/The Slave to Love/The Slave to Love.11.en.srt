1
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,759
The consort is dead

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,759
Mingyu, what do you think?

3
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,599
Naturally, we need to find out the cause of death

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,199
The eldest prince has found out

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,919
The prince-in-law took poison and committed suicide because he was afraid of the crime.

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,319
No further checking is allowed

7
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,719
I'm asking you

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,639
Have you ever reflected on your inappropriate behavior?

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,198
I reflect

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,279
What does it have to do with your son?

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:37,999
Mingyu

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,919
Have you ever thought about it

13
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,719
If you don't want to divorce your husband

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,519
Why did the prince-in-law make such a big mistake?

15
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,159
Not to mention dying in hell

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,639
Even if he doesn't want to be divorced

17
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,199
It's not like killing people and setting fires, right?

18
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,799
Mingyu, why don’t you understand?

19
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,159
There is no reason for a woman to divorce her husband

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,239
It's really not

21
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,239
Or are you not allowed?

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,839
Governing the country and bringing peace to the world

23
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,559
Without men working outside, where can women rely on?

24
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,319
You still want to divorce your husband?

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,599
It really chills the world’s princes

26
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,999
Death is a big deal

27
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,518
It was you who was at fault again

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,959
Haven't you realized it yet?

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,599
The father kept the girl in captivity at home

30
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,599
It's like blinding a normal person's eyes and binding his hands and feet

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,879
Make it unable to act and to achieve its goals

32
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,119
On the other hand, it is useless to say that women are short-sighted.

33
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,599
Isn't this gangster logic?

34
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,399
Robber, your words are too unpleasant.

35
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,199
From now on, you no longer have to be responsible for disaster relief.

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:29,558
father emperor

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,399
Don't say any more, huh?

38
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,679
I disagree

39
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,519
If that Lantern Festival dinner that day

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,999
I did not write a poem to Yuan Mingyu

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,719
The emperor will not listen to her greedy words and separate you and me.

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,999
Obviously you and I are the two

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,359
most suitable

44
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,999
let go

45
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,639
at this point

46
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,559
If you miss it, you miss it.

47
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,479
remember your identity

48
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,839
Just wait for me

49
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,679
I don't want to be your brother-in-law

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,439
I just want to be your husband

51
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,519
If I hadn't given up at the beginning

52
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,959
Will our ending be different?

53
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,239
Father, this is unclear

54
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,158
Just let me bear the charge of murder

55
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,799
If the emperor doesn't punish you, I'm afraid it won't stop.

56
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,559
I think the emperor is still facing you

57
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,879
I didn't do anything wrong

58
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,319
If you want to participate, feel free to participate

59
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,079
The third princess is here

60
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,119
snort

61
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,159
What are you here for?

62
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,519
It was you who killed the consort

63
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,159
You don’t want to follow me like the Three Obediences and Four Virtues, do you?

64
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,439
Stop pretending to be confused

65
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,679
Check the documents

66
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,959
The prince-in-law died by taking poison

67
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,279
Where did that poison come from?

68
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,759
It is said that you were the only one he saw that day

69
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,439
I was the last one to see him

70
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,919
I was the one who administered the poison

71
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,639
Why didn't you say that I ate the last fruit?

72
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,319
I ate the whole plate

73
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,679
Who else in this world would want to kill him besides you?

74
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,439
how could I know

75
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,879
If you have the ability, ask your father to investigate.

76
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,279
Just give me a clean slate

77
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,959
When did you care about the three obediences and four virtues?

78
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,479
The innocence I am talking about is not the same kind of innocence you are talking about.

79
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,319
Only those who behave upright are worthy of talking about innocence

80
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,159
No matter who kills the consort now

81
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,799
It's all my fault for divorcing my husband

82
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,359
The princess just wanted to get out of an unhappy marriage

83
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,759
What's wrong

84
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,119
Have you made any progress in your thinking?

85
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,639
Can be a pair for life

86
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,159
is the happiest

87
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,239
Hey, Doctor Cong is here

88
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,919
Met the fourth princess

89
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,119
Forcibly restore internal strength

90
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,399
No wonder he vomits blood

91
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,879
It seems that you are determined to fight for Yuan Mingyu

92
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,559
Give up the restoration of the country

93
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,639
Except the fish charm

94
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,919
Is there no other way to restore the country?

95
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,559
What can be done to benefit the restoration of the country?

96
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,999
Don’t you know it yourself?

97
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,039
You are reluctant to take the fish charm today

98
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,879
I will give up the restoration of the country tomorrow

99
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,839
Are you worthy of your father, queen and mother?

100
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,679
Are you worthy of me?

101
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,479
Is it worthy of so many people’s hard work over so many years?

102
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,879
you look at me look at me

103
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,159
This is the last chance

104
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,759
your Highness

105
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,999
I just promoted blood circulation and removed blood stasis for Ye Weiwei.

106
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,999
I believe it will be restored soon

107
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,879
How soon is it?

108
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,478
Three days at the fastest and five days at the most

109
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,479
It will definitely be good

110
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,839
It will take so long

111
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,719
Princess

112
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,198
Um

113
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,719
I'll go out with you these days

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,839
The doctor said I need to go out more often

115
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,119
The injury will heal faster

116
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,079
Yeah

117
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,999
That's right, princess

118
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,319
Ye Weiwei had been injured repeatedly before

119
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,358
It's because he stays in the room every day

120
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:17,839
due to lack of exercise

121
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,159
Since Dr. Cong said so,

122
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,559
Then I have to take care of Ye Weiwei

123
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,719
Don’t worry and do it in a serious manner

124
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:31,359
It’s time for Miss Sun to take a rest.

125
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:33,599
Princess despite her orders

126
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,839
I'll make medicine for you

127
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,559
Miss Sun, come and sit down quickly

128
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,318
No need, I'm afraid I'll see things I shouldn't see

129
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,519
We don't eat people

130
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,079
Come on, I have something to ask you

131
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,999
If you have something to say, say it quickly

132
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,119
Miss Sun

133
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,839
Do you know the laws on dissolution of engagement in your country?

134
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,439
According to the rules of Suye country

135
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,159
There are three types of couples who want to divorce

136
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,359
He Li Qi comes out of He Yi Jue

137
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,319
Only in the case of absolute justice

138
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,959
Only women can forcefully end a marriage through the government

139
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,519
And the conditions for Yi Jue are very harsh.

140
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,039
Unless they beat and kill each other's parents

141
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,879
Or commit adultery with a close relative of the other party

142
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,279
That is to say

143
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,519
As long as the other person doesn't hurt his parents

144
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,479
Otherwise, even if the other party kills people and steals goods,

145
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,919
Women cannot escape from marriage

146
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,039
Why do you ask this?

147
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,399
Passed by the Prince Consort

148
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,799
I want to change the law that women cannot divorce their husbands

149
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,719
You are a princess and you are favored by the emperor

150
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,279
Even though I couldn't get divorced, I still wanted to change the law.

151
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:08,319
The emperor's favor is unpredictable

152
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,239
It’s not like you are well-educated and good at martial arts.

153
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,079
These two things will never leave you

154
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,999
Seriously, even a girl like you

155
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,079
What if you marry someone you don't like?

156
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,999
you also want

157
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,879
I can tolerate it as long as you don't bother me

158
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,639
What if after being forced to get married?

159
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,079
Have you met someone you really like again?

160
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,519
Isn’t this just me and the princess?

161
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,759
That would be too painful, right?

162
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,559
That's why I want to change the law

163
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,479
Let women also divorce their husbands

164
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,759
You can also reconcile

165
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,919
It's easy for you to say

166
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,159
How to change

167
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,999
You'll know in a few days

168
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,319
Oops, the medicine has gone cold

169
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,279
Slow down

170
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,519
Sure enough, I still saw something I shouldn’t have seen.

171
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,519
I'd better do it myself. You drink quickly.

172
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,839
It’s so bitter. Do you have any candied fruits?

173
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,039
I've never heard you complain before

174
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,439
You take it and I'll get it for you

175
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,319
Hard

176
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,359
I think when you first met us

177
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,199
It’s different

178
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,519
Some things are not Miss Sun's

179
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,119
See and imagine

180
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,519
some words

181
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,839
It's not convenient to tell Miss Sun clearly.

182
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,679
You are not a hidden person

183
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,599
I don't understand the relationship between you and Dr. Cong

184
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,879
What's the secret?

185
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:54,679
I hope you are still the respected Ye Shao

186
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,479
otherwise

187
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,759
I don’t know why I promised you to help Yuan Mingyu

188
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,718
One day I will tell you the whole story

189
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,839
I told you and the princess

190
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,279
But please invite Miss Sun

191
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,279
Don’t tell the princess what you saw today

192
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,719
Today you are the darling of power

193
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,399
Tomorrow will be the outcast of power

194
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,279
Some of what the prince consort said is right.
