1
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,319
We won't go home until we get drunk tonight

2
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,239
you sure

3
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,519
Mingyu

4
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,079
This is our last night

5
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,719
You have no chance to say no now

6
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,839
I do

7
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,039
princess sorry

8
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,399
You will know everything when you see this letter

9
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,199
What happened?

10
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,399
I will definitely come back and make it up to you

11
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,639
sorry

12
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,239
This has nothing to do with you

13
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,199
It's already past midnight

14
00:03:00,839 --> 00:03:02,679
It's a pity that I am the prince of the former dynasty

15
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,638
You and I are destined to miss each other

16
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,479
In the beginning, I stayed with you because of the fish charm.

17
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,159
Then what if he won't be sorry to me and you?

18
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,759
I do not know either

19
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,079
do not look

20
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,399
I've already watched

21
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,999
Where is my fish charm?

22
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,519
Former prince

23
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,919
Why did you come back after you took my fish charm?

24
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,519
Who did you give the fish charm to?

25
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,519
What's the meaning

26
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,599
The person who wanted the fish charm didn't come

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,239
Don't lie to me

28
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,039
You are the former prince

29
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,759
I have to do things for others

30
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,239
I did not lie to you

31
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,119
The person who asked for the fish charm really didn’t come

32
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,079
so what

33
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,919
You need the fish charm now

34
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,279
Return it to me without anyone noticing

35
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,519
keep cheating on me

36
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,039
I did approach you for the fish charm in the first place

37
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,959
But I really didn't expect that I would fall in love with you

38
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,279
Stop doing this

39
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,279
really

40
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,279
Even if it were me, I wouldn’t believe it

41
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,439
You go

42
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,198
I won't tell my father

43
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,999
I'm afraid I can't leave yet

44
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,919
I want to stay in the house

45
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,919
Stay with you and find the person with the fish charm.

46
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,679
You still want to use me

47
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,279
You can also use me

48
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,719
Why should I trust you?

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,359
I will show my sincerity

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,159
Ye Shao is actually the prince of the former dynasty

51
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,359
It turns out that he has always had a purpose by my side.

52
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,559
I'm so sentimental

53
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,999
Mistakenly thinking that we are in love with each other

54
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,159
But why are you so angry with him?

55
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,439
Didn’t I also hide my identity from him?

56
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,039
This relationship can never last forever

57
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,639
I'd better ascend the throne and become the empress as soon as possible

58
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,798
Complete the mission and return to modern times

59
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,719
So as not to sink deeper and deeper

60
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,039
Hard to extricate myself

61
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,798
You might as well find a chance to read out the question tomorrow.

62
00:05:38,799 --> 00:05:39,839
Just write it down

63
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,479
Be sure to let Miss Sun notice

64
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,559
Princess

65
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,759
This is tantamount to directly leaking the topic to Miss Sun.

66
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,719
With Miss Sun’s personality, she won’t accept it.

67
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:52,239
The date of the competition is coming soon. I can’t take care of that much anymore.

68
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:52,959
go ahead

69
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,079
It's a princess

70
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,919
Miss Sun, please listen carefully.

71
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,639
Five people share six oranges

72
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,159
How can we divide it fairly?

73
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,519
It's fair to squeeze it into juice

74
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,119
Miss Sun, do you know the crystal pills in the Jiangsha bag?

75
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,679
What fruit do you mean?

76
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,959
It’s lychee, lychee, lychee

77
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,719
Miss Sun

78
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,679
if the head is injured

79
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,359
How should I sleep?

80
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,559
Just sleep with your eyes closed

81
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,519
I think your brains were injured?

82
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,479
Miss Sun still has it

83
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,919
Write a five unique poem

84
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,519
Five cents per word

85
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,239
How much does it cost?

86
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,279
Hey, isn’t it the first round today?

87
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,039
Why did Miss Sun come to me first?

88
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,879
I have Jinlan whispering in my ears every day

89
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,439
You really took the trouble

90
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,639
So sure

91
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,199
Just wait and see

92
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,439
The first round of competition is over

93
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,639
According to grades

94
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,359
All qualified contestants enter the bamboo forest from different entrances

95
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,799
Start the second round

96
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,439
Pass the corresponding level

97
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,959
The three people who finally got the token

98
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,799
to advance to the final round

99
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,479
Report to Father

100
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,839
After two rounds of competition

101
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,039
The winners were Sun Xiang, Zheng Jian and Zhou Wu

102
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,359
Yeah

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,679
I really didn't expect that

104
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,719
A woman really advanced in this competition

105
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,879
Mingyu, you are really capable.

106
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,399
I made a last-minute decision

107
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,519
In this third round, the three of them will play against me at the same time.

108
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,119
The winner is the leader of this competition

109
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,559
Play chess with the emperor

110
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,799
Winning or losing is a matter of

111
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,638
Why

112
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,119
you lose

113
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,439
In the hands of the emperor's daughter

114
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,599
besides

115
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,039
Miss Sun defeated me

116
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,758
this competition

117
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,599
She is the leader

118
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,159
Thank you, Your Majesty

119
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,839
Miss Sun has outstanding appearance

120
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,479
All-rounder in civil and military affairs

121
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:09,599
I decide

122
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,999
The eldest prince in marriage
