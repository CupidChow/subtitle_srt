1
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,399
My daughter was wrongly accused

2
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,598
She is wronged

3
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,919
bad guy

4
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,438
you are all bad people

5
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,799
What's wrong

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,519
Princess

7
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:47,679
This person is a famous crazy woman in the neighborhood

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,319
She will spit at people when they come near her

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,519
crazy woman

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,399
Why is she crazy?

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,799
you are all bad people

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,399
She is also a poor person

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,039
Husband died young

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,159
Daughter is in jail for murder

15
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,079
It has become like this now

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,479
Jinlan, come over and take a look

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:07,719
yes

18
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,919
As soon as the girl sees you, you are a sensible person.

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,399
you help me

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,079
it's okay no problem

21
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,119
My daughter was wronged

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,519
That man came into our family as a bride-in-law.

23
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,079
Just started

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,479
It's pretty good to us two.

25
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,879
But later he

26
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,719
give me money

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,519
give you money

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,199
Go and drink again and again

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,759
I'd better go gambling again.

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,919
Your family's money has been ruined by you

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,639
No

32
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,239
Does your mother have no money?

33
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,679
Why should I give it to you?

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,999
Our family still owes you

35
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,039
You fight, you fight

36
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,519
I won't hit you

37
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,479
Every time I beat you, go to the government and make a fuss

38
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,199
It made the neighbors laugh so hard at me

39
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,679
Said I married a shrew

40
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,359
Huh, not a single male in your family is gone.

41
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,639
I'm the one who calls the shots

42
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,119
You are the one who married into the family

43
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,879
Why should you be the head of our family?

44
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,439
Even if you are a bride-in-law

45
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,399
I am also your husband

46
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:35,319
Mom, he always asks me for money.

47
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,759
He often beats me

48
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,238
I really don't want to be with him

49
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,999
Then my mother will help you to persuade him.

50
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,959
Don’t let him hit you again in the future.

51
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,839
daughter

52
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,479
I really don't want to be with him

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,759
oops

54
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,559
Marry a chicken and follow the chicken; marry a dog and follow the dog.

55
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:57,159
Which house doesn’t have a hard-to-recite scripture?

56
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,279
Just bear with it a little longer

57
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:02,399
In the future he

58
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,799
I will know how good you are

59
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,159
Do not cry

60
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,679
What do you mean by divorce letter?

61
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,319
Hum, you have no choice if you want me to divorce you

62
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,759
Is your skin itchy again?

63
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,999
What will it take for you to let me go?

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,959
Money, as long as you give me money honestly

65
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,719
I won't hit you

66
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,679
The family really has no money anymore

67
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,999
Hum no money

68
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,759
That evening

69
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,479
He drank too much again

70
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,359
arrive home

71
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,519
Asking my daughter for money again

72
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,959
But where is the money at home?

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,959
He gambled everything away

74
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,439
He started beating my daughter

75
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,599
My daughter protects herself

76
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,239
I just took a pair of scissors.

77
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,839
he drank too much

78
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,078
I accidentally fell down

79
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,039
I happened to fall on that pair of scissors.

80
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,079
It ended in life.

81
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,919
My daughter really didn't kill him and was wronged

82
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,999
I must change the unfair fate of these women

83
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,318
Princess

84
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,359
The woman had already bitten her tongue and committed suicide in prison.

85
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,639
Biting one's tongue and committing suicide

86
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,358
Um

87
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,239
Why is she so stupid?

88
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,639
This is the fate of women

89
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,519
When I was a child, I was my daughter.

90
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,919
Obey your parents and obey your father

91
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,799
Get married when you grow up

92
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,518
Marry a chicken and follow the chicken; marry a dog and follow the dog.

93
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:58,559
Follow your husband

94
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,039
Give birth to a child and become a mother

95
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,599
care about children

96
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,599
Taking care of family members

97
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,119
Women have to live dependent on others

98
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,559
Wrong step

99
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,999
That is the end of the world

100
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,199
Why do women have to live dependent on others?

101
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,679
Why can't women decide their own destiny?

102
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,198
Girls' school

103
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,159
right

104
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,799
I want you to run the school

105
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,758
This way they meet someone they don't like

106
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,679
Wen can sue the officials and the military can escape from marriage.

107
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,198
In short, you can have more freedom to decide your own destiny

108
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,839
But marriage is the order of parents

109
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,279
Even if a woman studies, she can't change this.

110
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,679
I just want to break this mental prison

111
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,399
A girl's destiny must be in her own hands

112
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,679
If it really doesn't work

113
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,959
You can also learn some martial arts to protect yourself.

114
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:42,959
Um

115
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,159
This makes some sense

116
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,198
But what does this have to do with changing the law?

117
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,238
one day

118
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,559
I must make peace with my consort in accordance with the law

119
00:05:54,239 --> 00:05:55,798
Isn’t the Prince Consort dead?

120
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,039
Even if I die, I have to make peace with you

121
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,479
I want all women to see it

122
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:03,479
They have the freedom to escape from marriage

123
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,079
What is written on this

124
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,279
The place where girls study

125
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,479
The fourth princess is really full and has nothing to do.

126
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,599
Enrollment is open for school

127
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,999
Women’s schools now offer free classes

128
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,679
Everyone, come and take a look.

129
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,959
Let’s take a look at the girls’ school

130
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,599
Girls' school is now recruiting students

131
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,159
uncle

132
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,559
Sign up for your lady

133
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,599
Girls' school

134
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,439
Princess

135
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,759
Not a single person signed up

136
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,039
There hasn’t been one for so many days.

137
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,799
Do you like reading very much?

138
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,719
Whether you like it or not is one thing

139
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,159
Increasing knowledge is the most important thing

140
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,199
The original intention of building a girls' school was good.

141
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,359
But this is something unheard of

142
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,519
You said you have never heard of it

143
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,199
Then why do your parents let you study and practice martial arts?

144
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,599
at our place

145
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,399
It is easier to marry well if you have read a book

146
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,839
As for martial arts

147
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,239
It's a friend who is pestering my brother.

148
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,559
I learned it from him

149
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,559
Marry high

150
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,199
I see

151
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,599
Ladies and Gentlemen

152
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,559
Hundred Liang Brain Competition

153
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,159
Participants are not limited to age, gender, place of origin and status

154
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,759
Bonus one hundred taels

155
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,359
Do you want to sign up?

156
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,959
Come on, come on, come on and get the registration form

157
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,639
Don't grab it, don't grab it

158
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,759
Admissions Secret Questions

159
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,359
Well you have to win

160
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,399
But this is done

161
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:36,279
What's the point of winning?

162
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,559
No one believes that women can read

163
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,999
If you lose again

164
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,839
Everything in the girls' school is in vain

165
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,439
If you don’t believe in women’s abilities

166
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,479
Why go to the trouble of building a girls' school?

167
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,439
Miss Sun, this is just a temporary change.

168
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,799
Everyone is here for the school

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,999
Ye Weiwei is really a woman singing and following her husband.

170
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,519
Anyway, no matter what, I have to be upright.

171
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,719
You think I don’t want to be upright?

172
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,599
Miss Sun, I have already seen you

173
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,999
The most outstanding girl

174
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,799
You're not even sure you'll win

175
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,599
nasuyeguo

176
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,839
How many women have read like you?

177
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,719
Have practiced martial arts

178
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,199
Those men and women are not on the same starting line at all.

179
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,039
If the starting lines are different, then how can we talk about fairness?

180
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,039
Cheating is not allowed anyway

181
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,239
If you must let me do it

182
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,199
Then I'll quit

183
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,879
You are a moral freak

184
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,359
Obviously a good thing

185
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,959
Do you have to make a mess?

186
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:29,959
That

187
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,279
am I wrong

188
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,638
Miss Sun is sticking to her principles

189
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,439
Now is not the time to talk about principles

190
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,679
Don’t worry about people like Miss Sun.

191
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:46,119
She won't do anything sorry for you behind your back

192
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,119
Why do you say it as if you are very familiar with her?

193
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,359
No

194
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,999
Then if she won't be sorry for me

195
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,919
And you

196
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,439
I do not know either

197
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,839
That's pretty much it

198
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,919
By the way, I met the eldest prince near the school today.

199
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,239
You all should sign up for that competition.

200
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,159
Women must not be allowed to win

201
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,919
To prevent Yuan Mingyu from being too arrogant

202
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:18,279
This eldest prince is too stingy

203
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,239
Even a game has to be intervened

204
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,119
The eldest prince has a close personal relationship with his consort

205
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:28,079
I suspect that the death of the consort is related to the eldest prince

206
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,718
you sure

207
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:31,919
I'm just guessing

208
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,159
No evidence found yet

209
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,199
It's better to be careful

210
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,879
Inform Yuan Mingyu about the eldest prince and consort

211
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,959
When the time comes, throw away the fish charm

212
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,839
Yuan Mingyu was naturally the first to suspect the eldest prince.

213
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,759
Why

214
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,479
This fratricide

215
00:10:00,719 --> 00:10:04,518
Always the most classic drama among the royal family
