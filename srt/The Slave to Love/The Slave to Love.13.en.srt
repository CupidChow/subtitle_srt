1
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,879
What's wrong

2
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,438
Just listen to my arrangements today

3
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,239
ah

4
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,839
You did all this

5
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,919
yes

6
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,599
Let me tell you

7
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,919
These dishes are all specialties of my hometown

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,399
This bacon

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,399
It's only found in my home

10
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,039
And then there is this pastry

11
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,239
You can only eat it during this season

12
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,119
And this egg yolk cake

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,159
I tell you

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,839
This is super delicious

15
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,519
And this chicken leg

16
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,959
Spiced chicken drumsticks for you

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:09,918
Ah, wait

18
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,719
It’s too much and you eat it too

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,799
Excuse me

20
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,799
I don't blame you, I mean

21
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,599
Well, we have plenty of time today anyway.

22
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:25,079
But I have a lot of things planned today

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,399
That's all right

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,558
Anyway, there is plenty of time

25
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,119
If you can't finish it today, I'll do it tomorrow.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,119
no tomorrow

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,959
Okay, I'll do as you say today.

28
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,479
Then tell me your plan

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,719
Is this the time when the time has come?

30
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,799
Deal with the school competition with the princess

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,319
Then we get to noon

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,639
I spent the morning doing business

33
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,519
yes

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,639
Of course, it’s mainly about the princess

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,799
Don't worry about it today

36
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,079
Okay, then we'll go shopping as soon as we finish our meal.

37
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,919
After shopping, go to the theater

38
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,199
After watching the play

39
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,279
Let’s go eat Babao Tofu at Zuixianlou

40
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,799
OK

41
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,359
My favorite is Zuixianlou’s Babao Tofu

42
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,639
Go as soon as you can

43
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,199
Eat quickly

44
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,519
good

45
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,639
Driving at the Fourth Princess's Mansion

46
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,679
yes

47
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,359
Dr. Hei Cong

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,879
Meet Her Royal Highness the Princess

49
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,519
I'm here to give Ye Weiwei a follow-up consultation.

50
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,999
Are the princess and Guard Ye going out?

51
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,558
Doctor Cong, I want to talk to the princess

52
00:02:47,559 --> 00:02:49,599
Forget it, follow-up consultation is more important

53
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,039
Then there is Dr. Laocong

54
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,159
OK

55
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,439
please

56
00:02:56,119 --> 00:02:57,519
Go and wait for you

57
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,199
I finally understand

58
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,239
That Yuan Mingyu has been tossing

59
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,239
I'm afraid you'll never get a chance to get the fish charm again.

60
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,919
Today is the last night

61
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,319
I will definitely get the fish charm

62
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,439
uncle

63
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:39,079
Do you think I would be a good emperor?

64
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,919
If you are not a good emperor

65
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,039
That's because your uncle didn't educate you well since childhood.

66
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,399
Then after I die, I won’t be able to see your father, emperor, and empress again.

67
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,679
See you at the same place tonight

68
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,999
Common people meet the emperor

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,159
Long live the emperor

70
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,479
Um

71
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,439
who is he

72
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:13,839
Report to the Emperor

73
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,479
Why did the father come suddenly?

74
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,919
Oh, where am I?

75
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,959
I'm afraid you'll be angry with your father.

76
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,199
I don't dare

77
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,759
I heard

78
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,839
This is the hidden guard you specially asked the doctor to treat.

79
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,719
yes

80
00:04:44,239 --> 00:04:46,559
It is all his credit that this disappearance case was solved.

81
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,758
I didn't take a closer look before

82
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,479
You look like one

83
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,159
deceased

84
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,519
What is he going to say to the princess?

85
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,159
Princess

86
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,559
What are you thinking about?

87
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,639
Father just now

88
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,919
It's so strange

89
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,839
It seems that the emperor does not doubt me

90
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,758
what does it mean

91
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,679
Um

92
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,758
It's a good thing that the emperor can come

93
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,159
Too

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,679
If the father attends the game

95
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,198
Next, we just need to ensure that our people can win.

96
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,959
Everything fell into place

97
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,399
But when the emperor comes like this

98
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,679
Sun Xiang's chances of winning are even smaller.

99
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,199
Did you hear what I said?

100
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,879
After hearing this, I really need to think of a solution

101
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:12,999
What's wrong

102
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,039
Princess

103
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,839
Miss Sun is not willing to read the questions you gave her at all.

104
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,479
Miss Sun, I just got the news

105
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,399
My father will also attend the game

106
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,559
This way your probability of winning is even smaller.

107
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,959
Please adapt

108
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,279
I already said that

109
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:31,719
You want me to compete and you want me to win

110
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,199
I want to win the fair and aboveboard

111
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,999
If you insist on letting me read these books

112
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,279
Then I won’t participate

113
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,759
You really don't look at it

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,039
Jinlan locks the door

115
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,559
yes

116
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,439
Why

117
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,199
let me out

118
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,639
Former Mingyu

119
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,959
Really convinced

120
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,399
Princess

121
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,119
How is Miss Sun?

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,159
Still not persuaded

123
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,399
Originally we were going to go shopping today

124
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,599
Go eat Babao Tofu

125
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,799
Yes, my father delayed me until now

126
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,679
Then let's do it tonight

127
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,279
Have a few drinks

128
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,839
as compensation

129
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,319
It's him

130
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,159
He actually sneaked into the palace

131
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,799
leave you alive

132
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,999
But you want to throw yourself into a trap

133
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,479
Someone coming

134
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,239
exist

135
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,039
Go and bring Dr. Cong to me.

136
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,679
yes

137
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,519
Wait a moment

138
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,599
Keep an eye on that guard

139
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,079
The slave will do it now

140
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,959
Why

141
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,879
Still have to get to this point?

142
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,999
Common people meet His Majesty

143
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,079
Hum, we finally meet

144
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,519
The common people don’t know what your majesty means

145
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,239
Don't know what it means

146
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:22,839
Someone is coming

147
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,479
exist

148
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,559
Take him out and chop him

149
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,279
yes

150
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,519
Dog thief

151
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,079
You remember it, brother Feng

152
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,999
Haven’t seen each other for more than ten years

153
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,279
we finally meet

154
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,799
I was blind at first

155
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,559
How could I be with a treacherous thief like you?

156
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,479
be brothers

157
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,599
OK then

158
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,679
I asked directly

159
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,759
then

160
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,119
Where is the little prince you took away from the palace now?

161
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,039
snort

162
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,239
You're not stupid enough to think I'm going to tell you, are you?

163
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,839
don't tell me

164
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,758
You are already in my hands

165
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:05,598
I believe

166
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,479
The little prince will always appear

167
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,559
Do you believe it?

168
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,878
what to believe

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,199
It has nothing to do with me

170
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,399
Hao Lai Ren

171
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,319
exist

172
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,079
Keep him in the palace

173
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,159
No information should be leaked about this matter

174
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,799
yes

175
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,399
After tonight we will say goodbye

176
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,199
Princess

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,959
do not blame me

178
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,239
