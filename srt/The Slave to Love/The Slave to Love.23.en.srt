1
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,559
From now on

2
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,919
Suye Kingdom abolishes kneeling

3
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,279
There is no need for officials or ordinary people to kneel down

4
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,199
everyone is equal

5
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,159
Men and women enjoy equal status

6
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,039
Learn to do business and participate in politics

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,999
No restrictions on gender, age or identity are allowed

8
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,799
freedom of marriage

9
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,479
Everyone can propose a divorce

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,039
Mingyu, Mingyu

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,518
Success in becoming emperor means returning to modern times

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,319
But can you still let go of Ye Shao?

13
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,159
I'm thinking

14
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,279
You helped me realize my wish to become emperor

15
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,879
do you have anything

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,919
You want me to help you realize your wish

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,119
My wish is to fulfill the princess's wish

18
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,039
How can this work?

19
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,159
You should let me do something for you

20
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,839
when I was young

21
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,119
Listen to my uncle talking about my father, emperor and mother

22
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,839
The harmony of their emotions

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,038
when they got married

24
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,598
Together they planted a red bean tree in the imperial garden

25
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,359
This red bean tree

26
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,279
It means that their feelings will remain unchanged throughout the seasons.

27
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,639
We will still miss each other all the time

28
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,078
So I also want to plant one with you

29
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,039
good

30
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,639
Then we will plant red bean trees in the imperial garden

31
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,399
Just one pill is enough

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,599
No, how can one pill be enough?

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,239
good

34
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,799
Plant as much as you want

35
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,279
Mingyu, what's wrong with you?

36
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,319
Mingyu

37
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,519
How is Mingyu doing?

38
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,759
Time is running out

39
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,479
Is there any secret between you and her?

40
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,999
Secrets cannot be revealed

41
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,719
So is Mingyu’s matter related to this secret?

42
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,879
Sure enough, smart

43
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,639
Why

44
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,119
if

45
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,239
If you just want to keep the eldest prince and your father,

46
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,159
You can be the emperor yourself

47
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,119
Not everyone is interested in that position

48
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,239
Besides, even if I wanted to, I have no chance of winning.

49
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,639
I know no matter what happens

50
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,399
You will always stand by Mingyu's side

51
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,679
You really never thought about becoming an emperor yourself

52
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,239
In fact, before his father decided to make Mingyu the crown princess,

53
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,519
did think about it

54
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,839
Well, it seems that I have chosen the distance instead of the near.

55
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,799
what does it mean

56
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,079
ascended the throne

57
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,719
Should I go back?

58
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,719
You have three days left

59
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,879
Can I not go back?

60
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,719
no

61
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,719
You don't belong here

62
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,799
Besides, it's not up to me to decide.

63
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,959
Can't you change your destiny?

64
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,238
I can change

65
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:55,839
Just some details of fate

66
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,879
The reason why I appear here as the crown prince

67
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,479
That's also because

68
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,919
The original crown prince would have intervened among you

69
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,079
I told you already

70
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,399
To think clearly about what you want

71
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,959
Who should let go

72
00:05:08,239 --> 00:05:09,319
You don't listen at all

73
00:05:13,239 --> 00:05:14,319
what i want

74
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,599
Only Ye Shao

75
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,079
Okay, I'll give you two options

76
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,599
Return to modern times in three days and continue living

77
00:05:28,359 --> 00:05:30,039
The exit is at the city gate tower on the east side

78
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,879
When the time comes, all you have to do is jump

79
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,319
We can return to modern times

80
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,159
What about the second option?

81
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,039
you can stay here

82
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,798
But only ten days

83
00:05:44,359 --> 00:05:48,199
In ten days, people in both worlds will disappear forever

84
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,439
Think about it yourself

85
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,599
three days

86
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,799
father emperor father emperor

87
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,839
Now this Mingyu is fake

88
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,439
I heard her say that she came through time

89
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,119
She's resurrected through a dead body

90
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,519
You, you rebellious child

91
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,599
It's good for you to be alive

92
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,079
How dare you talk nonsense in front of me

93
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,799
father emperor

94
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,439
you

95
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,399
It's true. I heard what she said with my own ears.

96
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,279
besides

97
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,199
And that prince

98
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,559
he

99
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,639
he disappeared

100
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,479
That prince disappeared

101
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,599
shut up

102
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,359
father emperor

103
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,959
I don't want to see you anymore

104
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,279
roll

105
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:58,839
Really

106
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,199
father emperor

107
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,799
It's all true, Father

108
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,279
father emperor

109
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,919
all fake
