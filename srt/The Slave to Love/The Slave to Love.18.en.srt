1
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,999
Then do you want to be emperor?

2
00:00:21,159 --> 00:00:22,158
I haven't thought about it

3
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,119
What if I want to do it?

4
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,999
You want to be emperor

5
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,959
From the death of the consort to Sun Xiang to the eldest prince

6
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:37,198
All I see is a confused father.

7
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,039
I don't want to lose anyone anymore

8
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:42,438
This throne

9
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:44,359
I want to order

10
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,279
I will definitely support you

11
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,519
You don't care if I'm emperor material

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,559
I believe you will be a good emperor

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,799
I don’t know if he will be a good emperor or not.

14
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,999
but i can be sure

15
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,279
I will be a different emperor

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,999
If I could ascend the throne

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,759
Women no longer have to be subordinate to men

18
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,599
Reading and doing business

19
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,039
They can be just like men

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,359
do whatever they want

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,679
This is a good emperor

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,239
Third sister calm down

23
00:01:25,559 --> 00:01:27,879
The royal brother also thinks that the prince is a good match

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,399
Only then will I help you plan it?

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,639
I think the emperor has many plans for himself.

26
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,359
The third sister lives in the palace

27
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,199
Do you know how my father is doing these days?

28
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,599
Brother Huang still has something to say directly.

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,799
I am in the palace today

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,959
Met a guest who was once in my house

31
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,639
He said he was treating his father.

32
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,599
But when this person is in my house

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,399
Never said he knew medicine

34
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,399
Not to mention that he and Mingyu knew each other

35
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,199
just in case

36
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,199
I will help the emperor to find out

37
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,639
Third Sister, Brother Huang, it all depends on you.

38
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,839
If the emperor does nothing,

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,359
There won’t be so much trouble

40
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,519
uncle

41
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,279
My uncle has been missing for many days

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,639
As expected, he was captured and imprisoned by the emperor.

43
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,399
who

44
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,879
Uncle, let’s go, let’s go

45
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,759
Go quickly, go quickly

46
00:03:02,839 --> 00:03:03,639
stop

47
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,999
What's wrong

48
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,479
Why are you injured?

49
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,199
I'm fine, it doesn't matter if I'm injured

50
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,599
My uncle is still with the emperor

51
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,999
It seems that my uncle has fallen into the emperor's hands

52
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,559
There's no way the emperor doesn't know my identity

53
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,199
But if you knew my identity, why would you let me go?

54
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,719
Strange indeed

55
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,119
Father should directly pursue Yu Qing

56
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,999
Why would you leave your uncle in the palace?

57
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,279
But if I raise an army now to save my uncle

58
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,839
even so

59
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,479
You still have to save him

60
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,199
I must save him

61
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,239
Qi Yun is a good candidate

62
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,599
What does it have to do with him?

63
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,759
He is the prince of Zhenbei Hou and has military power.

64
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,759
Plus you and me

65
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,959
Maybe we can successfully force the palace

66
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,999
Princess

67
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,199
this is my business

68
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,159
I shouldn't have brought you into this

69
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,439
I'm not doing it for you

70
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,639
it's for myself

71
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,479
If the father knew that you were the prince of the previous dynasty

72
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,799
How could you let me go?

73
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,559
In fact, no matter forced uterus or other

74
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,199
Always have a good reputation

75
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,118
I definitely can't

76
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,318
My status as the former prince will only be a drag on you

77
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,319
Since you want to be emperor

78
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,279
Then it's up to you to take care of this head

79
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,199
Sun Xiang's matter is just a matter of common people's talk.

80
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,999
It’s not my turn to force me into the palace

81
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,279
Since ancient times, the winner has been the king and the loser has been the loser.

82
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,199
as long as we succeed

83
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:52,559
There will be reasons

84
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,239
We want the prince to send troops for us

85
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,319
I can only try playing hard to get first.

86
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,279
fourth princess

87
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,399
What are you here for?

88
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,719
I'm coming to find you

89
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,759
What are you looking for me for?

90
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,359
I just want to ask the princess

91
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,919
What are our plans today

92
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,919
No arrangements

93
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,639
But I believe one day

94
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,719
You and I will make arrangements

95
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,519
Thinking too much

96
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,399
Don't talk so early

97
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,799
After all, there is such a thing as fate

98
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,319
Who can tell?

99
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,159
Am I right

100
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,238
Then I'll take my leave first.

101
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,519
Guard Ye, I'll see you some other time.

102
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,799
What is this prince planning?

103
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,719
Met the eldest prince

104
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,559
I knew it

105
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,279
can find you here
