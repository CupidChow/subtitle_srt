1
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,358
Miss Sun has outstanding appearance

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,998
All-rounder in civil and military affairs

3
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:19,119
I decide

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,519
The eldest prince in marriage

5
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,959
Named concubine

6
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,559
Can't

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,839
Don't worry, everyone

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,279
All have all have all

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,078
To the ladies and brothers and sisters at home

10
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,119
Take a look at them all

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,879
Come, come, come

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,559
You can take classes for free

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,279
Take it well

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,039
sorry

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,439
Still couldn't get my father to cancel the marriage.

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,079
So many people came to register in the school

17
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,759
Isn't this the result we want?

18
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,319
And we won the honorable

19
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,199
But you want to marry the eldest prince?

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,399
I don't want to

21
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,679
But what can be done

22
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:15,799
I've already thought about it

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,719
If he insists on forcing

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,439
I will die with him

25
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,439
Miss Sun

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,959
Do you remember what I said when I first met you?

27
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,518
I said you are a princess

28
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,878
Why do you care about the life and death of us ants?

29
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,839
But later you not only let me go

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,279
Ye Shao is just a hidden guard

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,399
You are also willing to put yourself at risk for him

32
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,719
You care about the lives of us despised people

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,279
So I really want to help you complete your career

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,279
I must ask my father again to cancel the marriage.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,959
Worrying blindly

36
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,959
It is a great honor to marry a prince

37
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,799
How do you know Miss Sun is not willing?

38
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,879
Miss Sun is not a power-hungry person

39
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,119
How can someone who is not greedy for power be by your side?

40
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,879
As long as you have tasted the sweetness of power

41
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,319
no one will refuse

42
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,199
Father has already taken the lead

43
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,638
Anyway, Miss Sun doesn't like the eldest prince.

44
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,918
like

45
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,039
I have already told the world about the marriage.

46
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,159
I will never take my life back

47
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,319
father emperor

48
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,759
This matter is related to Miss Sun’s life-long event

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,479
I hope my father will think twice

50
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,119
If the father does not agree

51
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,279
I will kneel down until my father agrees.

52
00:02:33,559 --> 00:02:35,159
Hum, how dare you threaten me?

53
00:02:36,839 --> 00:02:37,799
Are you willing to kneel

54
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,799
Just kneel down

55
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,679
snort

56
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,599
you're awake

57
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,919
How did I come back?

58
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,599
The third princess asked someone to send you back

59
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,039
Miss Sun is here

60
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,519
I have something to tell her

61
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,599
Okay, I'll help you up

62
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,399
Miss Sun

63
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,599
You've done your best in conferring marriage.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,119
But it is impossible for the emperor to take back his life

65
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,119
Faking death is the best way

66
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,079
suspended animation

67
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,239
This is the fake death drug

68
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,679
If you eat it, you will lose your breath within an hour.

69
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,239
He won't wake up until three days later

70
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,399
This might help Miss Sun escape.

71
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,479
But Miss Sun

72
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,799
You have to think about it yourself

73
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:12,959
Then she will

74
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,399
Isn’t it possible that we can only live a life of anonymity?

75
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:18,279
I was originally unknown

76
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,599
Even if I am anonymous, I am still me.

77
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,559
This bottle of fake death medicine

78
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,599
On the contrary, it allows me to return to my old life

79
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,239
Not bad

80
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:28,479
But what if it doesn’t work?

81
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,159
What if you can't wake up?

82
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,879
When you first built the school, you said

83
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,799
Allow women to file lawsuits against officials

84
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,039
Wu Ke escapes from marriage

85
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,039
I didn't expect it to hit the target

86
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,519
It’s just that now we have met the biggest official in the world

87
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,559
Wen and Wu are useless

88
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,519
I thought I had to accept my fate

89
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,599
Now I have this bottle of fake death potion

90
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,999
I won't accept my fate anymore

91
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,079
Miss Sun

92
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,119
Princess

93
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,559
My parents also ask you to intercede more with the emperor

94
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,358
don't blame them

95
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,879
I don't deserve you at all

96
00:05:10,679 --> 00:05:13,119
I provide disaster relief to win the support of the people

97
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,599
I built a school and changed the law

98
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,999
It's because I myself have been wronged

99
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,399
I do it all for myself

100
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,999
Don't blame yourself, princess

101
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:22,839
Everyone is selfish

102
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,758
Guard Ye gave me the fake death medicine

103
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,879
I am also afraid that you will ruin the father-daughter relationship between you and the Emperor.

104
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,798
Don't blame him

105
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,758
Yuan Mingyu is finally losing power

106
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,679
If my father had never been willing to let her kneel before,

107
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,679
If you ask me, you shouldn't have sent someone to take her back.

108
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,919
You said how am I worse than her?

109
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,039
She just defended her father from assassins when she was a child.

110
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,439
Her father actually indulged her for so many years

111
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,519
I advise the emperor to stop making sarcastic remarks.

112
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,199
Just because others lose power doesn't mean you will gain power.

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,039
Not always

114
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,559
That Miss Sun

115
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,999
father emperor

116
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,759
Won't you also give me the title of concubine?

117
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,319
father emperor

118
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,119
Sun Xiang is dead

119
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,879
Um

120
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,919
Sun Xiang is dead

121
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,479
what happened

122
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,359
She felt guilty that she had caused her sons and ministers to quarrel with her father.

123
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,919
Committed suicide by taking poison

124
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,879
oops

125
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,999
Ordinary women just don’t understand the general situation

126
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,999
Forget it, just bury her as a concubine.

127
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,279
People here really die like ants

128
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,559
Thank you father

129
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,799
Hey, I won’t mention Sun Xiang’s death anymore.

130
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,079
Soon the prince of Zhenbeihou came to pay homage

131
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,279
It's up to you to handle the reception.

132
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,199
He's a good candidate for horse attachment.

133
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,399
After I become emperor

134
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,719
all this will end

135
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,599
Go check Sun Xiang’s residence record

136
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,199
died so suddenly

137
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,639
I feel something is wrong

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,919
It's the emperor

139
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,279
This Sun Xiang actually committed suicide by taking poison

140
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,719
Even she refuses to be my concubine

141
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,879
I still want to be buried in peace

142
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,719
There is no door at all

143
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,679
Why don't you open the coffin quickly?

144
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,279
It wouldn't be good if there were no people, right?

145
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,919
not good

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,839
Dare to disobey His Highness’s orders

147
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,799
I made your whole family miserable

148
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:08,999
yes
