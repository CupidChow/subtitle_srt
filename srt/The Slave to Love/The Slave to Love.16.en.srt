1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:20,879
People are gone

2
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,599
If you die, you will be gone.

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,479
Are you afraid of a ghost?

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,319
There's nothing in this coffin

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,039
Nothing at all

6
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,479
He won't turn into a ghost, right?

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,919
When you are a human being, you have to take poison and commit suicide.

8
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,078
Even if he becomes a ghost, he is also a useless ghost.

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,879
What are you afraid of

10
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:44,279
But Miss Sun died because of His Highness

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,639
There are no ghosts in this world

12
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,679
Even if there is

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,719
Humph, it was her Yuan Mingyu who did it too

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,039
Miss Sun

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,038
Your brother died because of me

16
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,959
Now you die again because of me

17
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,039
From disaster relief to girls’ school

18
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,519
You really helped me so much

19
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,479
You and I met because of a murder

20
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,399
When you let me go

21
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,119
I thought

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,238
You are just a person who talks about benevolence, justice and morality.

23
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,839
Later I saw you providing disaster relief

24
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:33,599
Build a girls' school for girls to have social status

25
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,559
I find

26
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,799
I couldn't do this if it weren't for you

27
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,639
There is no need to say more about who helps whom among us.

28
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,239
Take good care of yourself

29
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,039
hereafter

30
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,679
Live only for yourself

31
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,199
Goodbye

32
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,719
Take care

33
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,279
Miss Sun

34
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,159
You are the most special woman I have met here

35
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,279
It was you who made me understand

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,479
No matter what era or background

37
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,199
There are a group of lively women

38
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,399
Struggling to live the life they want

39
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,959
do not worry

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,519
I won't let you hide forever

41
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,679
Take care of yourself

42
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,598
It was indeed a fake death

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,799
Princess

44
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,559
The emperor ordered the eldest prince and Miss Sun to continue their marriage

45
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,279
What

46
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,759
How can we consummate the marriage if Miss Sun is dead?

47
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,239
I heard that the eldest prince came to the palace specifically to ask for help from the emperor.

48
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,519
It's said that he fell in love with Miss Sun at first sight and would not marry her unless she

49
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,319
fart

50
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,199
Princess

51
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,839
Jinlan, you go down first

52
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,158
I'll discuss it with the princess

53
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:54,799
yes

54
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,118
If married

55
00:02:58,119 --> 00:03:00,119
Miss Sun's fake death will definitely be exposed

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,439
Father will definitely be furious

57
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,079
the first to doubt

58
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:06,839
It’s me, the fourth princess who is most familiar with Sun Xiang.

59
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,199
Princess, do you still remember what I told you?

60
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,079
The death of the consort is related to the eldest prince.,

61
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,919
If you can strike first to gain the upper hand

62
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,639
Strike first to be stronger

63
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:20,879
3

64
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,319
The eldest prince’s subordinates don’t understand

65
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,879
Since you already know that Sun Xiang is not dead,

66
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,839
Why don't you just complain to the emperor?

67
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,839
Do you still have to ask for permission to get married?

68
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,759
you say

69
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,359
The person who is most afraid of people finding out that Sun Xiang is not dead

70
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,079
who is it

71
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,599
Of course I helped her

72
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,519
This is called luring a snake out of its hole

73
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,479
eldest prince eldest prince

74
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,919
impossible

75
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:34,519
It can't be true

76
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,999
I must be dreaming

77
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,719
Prince Consort

78
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,758
why are you here

79
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,039
Aren't you dead?

80
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,919
This witch has paid the price for her mistakes

81
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,439
Now it is your turn

82
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,759
what would you like

83
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,358
I can give you whatever you want

84
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,678
I beg you to let me go

85
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,679
I'm so loyal to you

86
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,479
But you hurt me so miserably

87
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,999
Even if I die, my innocent soul will not be able to escape from this hellish place.

88
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,439
I want you to accompany me

89
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,719
I beg you

90
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,799
For the sake of Third Sister, please let me go.

91
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,119
I will go to worship you every year on your anniversary

92
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,199
let me go

93
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,879
I want you to write clearly word for word

94
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,559
how did you kill me

95
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,559
Write clearly how tragic my death is

96
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,599
I want to take it to the underworld to redress my grievances

97
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,159
I write, write, I write

98
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,039
Written

99
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,999
His Royal Highness’s wedding hall has been properly decorated

100
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,679
why am i here

101
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,439
last night

102
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,479
Brother, why didn't you sleep well last night?

103
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,679
Just don’t mention it

104
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,239
correct

105
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,239
Tomorrow is my wedding banquet

106
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,959
Because she is married to a deceased person

107
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,959
Not suitable for big events

108
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,799
So today I specially invited my father

109
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,079
Came here with my two sisters

110
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,599
Let’s take this happy occasion to get together as a family

111
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,559
Your Majesty is worried about Sun Xiang's fake death.

112
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,479
Why

113
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,359
death of ants

114
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,919
Why bother?

115
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,639
The eldest prince is my only son

116
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,279
But Mingyu has the talent of an emperor

117
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,319
Clams fighting with each other

118
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,679
Why

119
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,519
Congratulations to the great emperor brother

120
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,799
Fourth sister is here

121
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,039
If Fourth Sister really congratulates me

122
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,679
You might as well hand over Miss Sun's household head.
