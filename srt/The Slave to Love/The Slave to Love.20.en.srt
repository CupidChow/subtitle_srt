1
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:15,479
What are you here for?

2
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,559
I'm here to help you

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,959
The eldest prince wants more than just you and Ye Shao

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,879
And the throne

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,479
He wants to rebel

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,679
You should seize this opportunity well

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,759
Whether we can return to modern times depends on this

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:35,839
why did you get up

9
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:39,878
Why did you go out?

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,799
The eldest prince is about to take action

11
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,639
eldest prince

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,479
Um

13
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:46,839
Not the crown prince

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,439
The eldest prince knows that you are the prince of the previous dynasty

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,359
How could he know my identity?

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,039
He has been planning for the throne for a long time

17
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,639
I'm afraid there are already many eye spies in the palace.

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,679
Last time you visited the palace at night

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,199
It must have caught his attention

20
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,519
The emperor used me before

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,679
Let me bring out all the forces from the previous dynasty

22
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:10,559
So I deliberately kept my uncle and me here

23
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,039
give us time to prepare

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,599
But if the eldest prince is determined to force the palace now,

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,479
Here comes the opportunity to make the forced uterus famous

26
00:01:21,279 --> 00:01:22,918
We can use the eldest prince

27
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,359
Let the father abdicate the throne

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,279
I know what you are worried about

29
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,799
If we don't seize this opportunity

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,359
If the eldest prince succeeds

31
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,079
Your father will not abdicate as simple as that.

32
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,799
The prince still has some soldiers and horses plus my imperial army.

33
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,839
Should be able to handle the big emperor brother

34
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,239
Why does this prince help you so much?

35
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,399
Does he like you?

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,439
You are really a love brain.

37
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,479
Don't say things I don't understand

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,119
As good as me

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,878
Isn’t it normal for everyone to like me?

40
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,838
Look, you just admit that he likes you

41
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:13,118
That's why he helps you like this

42
00:02:13,119 --> 00:02:14,399
He comes to you every day

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,319
He doesn't like me

44
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,679
He and I have a purely cooperative relationship

45
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,079
cooperate

46
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,919
Don't believe it

47
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:27,959
Do you believe it?

48
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,479
do not worry

49
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,919
After going through so much

50
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,239
between the two of us

51
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,719
There is no one to replace

52
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,199
I said I would be responsible for you

53
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,319
I will definitely be responsible to the end

54
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,839
good

55
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,999
Crown Prince

56
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:05,199
You already told her everything

57
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,999
yes

58
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,999
why do you want to help her

59
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,999
It's considered revenge for the consort.

60
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,119
Then you can tell her personally

61
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,279
My relationship with her is not that good.

62
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,119
What about me? I've already tipped you off.

63
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,239
At least it's close

64
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,599
You are just a messenger

65
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,959
There is no relationship between us

66
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,199
Since you know that the emperor may pass the throne to the fourth princess,

67
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,639
Aren't you moved?

68
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,479
I just hope that my father will be fine

69
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,239
Brother, don’t make any more mistakes

70
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,319
Sister, three sisters and one

71
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,479
That being the case

72
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,319
Don't blame me for not caring about brother and sister.

73
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,079
Imperial brother

74
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,919
I really need to trouble my third sister to win over the prince for me.

75
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,159
Brother, you're welcome

76
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,879
I will have to rely on my royal brother from now on.

77
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,759
The third sister saw someone else

78
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,119
From now on, we, brother and sister, will be blessed together

79
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,239
If there is a problem, the emperor will take charge

80
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,359
Yuan Mingyu holds the Forbidden Fish Talisman

81
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,119
I feel really uneasy for my brother

82
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,439
This is the defense map of the capital.

83
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,318
You give it to the prince for me

84
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,439
Ask him to send troops to the north of the city as soon as possible

85
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,919
Danfeng Valley twenty miles away

86
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,199
Always be prepared to overwhelm the Imperial Army

87
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,519
ASAP

88
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,759
That's right

89
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,399
It is really difficult to conceal the fact of troop deployment

90
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,719
To avoid long nights and many dreams

91
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,079
we act as quickly as possible

92
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,198
When ready

93
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,279
I will naturally inform you and the Crown Prince

94
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,079
The Crown Prince's Zhenbei Army will inform me immediately as soon as they arrive at Danfeng Valley.

95
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,239
Then we will rush into the palace in one fell swoop

96
00:04:42,359 --> 00:04:43,559
Encourage my father to take the throne

97
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,438
Whether it is the prince or Yuan Mingyu

98
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,439
Get them all for me

99
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,119
I want to clear your side

100
00:04:48,359 --> 00:04:49,159
yes

101
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,559
Why did the eldest prince's troops appear here?

102
00:04:58,479 --> 00:04:59,279
Could it be

103
00:05:01,239 --> 00:05:02,399
The eldest prince’s plan has changed

104
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,479
he has ordered me

105
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,519
Arrange the Zhenbei Army in Danfeng Valley outside the city.

106
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,599
Troops may be sent to surround the princess mansion at any time

107
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,198
Didn’t I say seven days before?

108
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,439
Why did it change at any time?

109
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,719
But don't worry

110
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,879
After my observation

111
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,679
The reason why he would let the Zhenbei Army be placed in Danfeng Valley

112
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,238
It must be for an ambush

113
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,399
The Imperial Guard will pass through here tomorrow.

114
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,599
So you have to use the fish charm quickly

115
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,678
Ordered the Forbidden Army to join the Zhenbei Army

116
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,519
Capture the eldest prince in one move

117
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,999
The terrain of Danfeng Valley is dangerous

118
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,279
If we are the fish the prince wants to catch

119
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,439
I'm afraid the Imperial Guard will be completely wiped out.

120
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,999
You actually doubt me

121
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,279
Why should I not doubt you?

122
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,959
The news about Crown Prince Ye Shao is unmistakable

123
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,079
Don't be deceived by the eldest prince

124
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,279
As soon as the Zhenbei Army arrived at Danfeng Valley,

125
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,839
The eldest prince will force the palace immediately

126
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,999
If the Forbidden Army joins the Zhenbei Army,

127
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,839
It will only end up with the princess and the Marquis of Zhenbei colluding.

128
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,879
The stigma of rebellion

129
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,878
Walk

130
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,679
I'm going to summon the imperial army to the palace to rescue him.

131
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,199
I think it's better for you to go

132
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,199
no need to worry

133
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,399
Ye Shao's feet are faster than mine

134
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,199
Sun Xiang and I went to the palace to protect our father.

135
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:16,999
That's not OK

136
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,079
I have to be with you

137
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:18,999
What are you going to do?

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,439
I beat him again and again, but still aroused suspicion.

139
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,879
After all, I am the prince of Zhenbei.

140
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,079
He even thinks I'm a bit mean-spirited

141
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,399
He is about to rebel and he still cares about your face

142
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,159
That's not okay, I have to

143
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,039
it's good now

144
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,239
Don't waste time

145
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,439
Sons and ministers pay homage to their father

146
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,319
what are you going to do

147
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,039
As long as the father takes the initiative to take the Zen position

148
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,239
I wish you a long and healthy life.

149
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,519
You want to force the palace

150
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,479
Yi Yangtian died at the end of his life

151
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,159
I

152
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,999
Now I'm almost pissed off by you, this rebellious son.

153
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,079
If my father is in poor health,

154
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,879
It's totally possible to let your son-in-law

155
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,239
Come and take care of this country for you

156
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,519
I

157
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,319
What if I don’t give up my seat?

158
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,559
The Supreme Emperor is also an emperor, right?

159
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,679
I hope my father will consider it carefully.

160
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,519
The crime of patricide

161
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,519
can you afford it

162
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,559
The one who killed his father

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,959
She will only be my father’s precious daughter

164
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,479
And I just killed my relatives out of justice

165
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:35,999
you

166
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,839
What are you going to do to Mingyu?
