1
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:09,080
Yeah, I want to know why you two chose to study Engineering here.

2
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,680
It’s close to my home.

3
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,280
That’s a very interesting reason.

4
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,800
What about you, Kongpob?

5
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,520
Don’t tell me that it’s close to your home too.

6
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,800
No, it’s not

7
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,440
Actually, I want to study economics.

8
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,960
But my mother wants me to study engineering.

9
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,920
So I enrolled to this uni.

10
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,400
Why don’t you study what you like.

11
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,800
You know what?

12
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,120
To study something that you don’t like for 4 years…

13
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,400
is really painful.

14
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,400
Another thing is,

15
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
you are wasting your time and opportunity.

16
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,320
Someone used to tell me that too.

17
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,760
But if you feel like Engineering is not you after a year,

18
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,000
you can go back to square one at other faculties next year.

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,840
But this year, I still consider you my engineering junior,

20
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,120
and I’ll treat and take care of you as best as I can.

21
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,440
You don’t need to worry about this.

22
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,960
Thank you.

23
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,840
Don’t worry.

24
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,960
Thank you.

25
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,760
Sawasdee krup.

26
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,200
You bought a painkiller?

27
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,600
Yes.

28
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,600
Go to the doctor if you don’t get better.

29
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,840
All right.

30
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,320
What about…

31
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,960
How is your condition?

32
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,280
I’m okay. Nothing serious.

33
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,200
Well, excuse me then.

34
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:42,520
there will be a flag capturing event soon.

35
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,200
Don’t forget to join it.

36
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,120
I will.

37
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,560
Sawasdee krup.

38
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,960
Sawasdee krup.

39
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,440
How do you get home, P’Arthit?

40
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,080
It’s none of your business.

41
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,680
Are you mad at me or something?

42
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
Why do I have to be mad at you?

43
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,680
Huh?

44
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,080
We are nothing to each other.

45
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,920
I don’t officially accept your year class as my junior.

46
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,120
And I doubt if you really want to study in this faculty.

47
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,960
But I’m an engineering student now.

48
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,160
Are you sure you want to become one?

49
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
If you don’t want to study here from the first place

50
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,760
you shouldn’t keep this student spot to yourself.

51
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,520
Don’t you know how many people are struggling to get in here?

52
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,120
You think you can keep it to yourself for a year

53
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,600
and leave to study something else just like that?

54
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,400
You are so damn selfish.

55
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,320
I have my own reasons.

56
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,920
I don’t study here just for fun

57
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,240
I attend all activities of engineering.

58
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,840
And I determine to capture the flag without fail.

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,440
Don’t talk the talk but walk the walk.

60
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,280
Capturing the flag is not as easy as you think

61
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,520
I will definitely get it.

62
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,520
Where the hell have you been? What took you so damn long?

63
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,600
I needed to buy something.

64
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,800
Never mind. Let’s get going.

65
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,440
P’Knot, sawasdee krup.

66
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,640
How does this junior go home?

67
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,240
He’s old enough to know how to get home himself

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,120
Go.

69
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,480
Listen, call everyone in for a meeting tomorrow.

70
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,880
I think I change the plan we have for the flag capturing.

71
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,360
Let’s make it harder for them to get the flag.

72
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,520
What did that first year do to you?

73
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,520
You know what?

74
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,840
That 0062 bloke,

75
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,760
he wants to study economics.

76
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,680
But he enrolled here because his mother told him to.

77
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,400
So what?

78
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,640
He said he would leave the faculty

79
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,040
Come on. It’s the right thing to do if he doesn’t like engineering.

80
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,480
Remember our friend, Win?

81
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,000
He changed to study Communication Art too.

82
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,440
And what’s wrong with you?

83
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,680
Why do you have to be this upset?

84
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,640
Don’t tell me it’s because of this?

85
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,520
No.

86
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,720
It could be the grilled pork I had.

87
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,920
I’m going up now.

88
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,360
See you. Thanks, man.

89
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,520
What?

90
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,400
I’m nervous.

91
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,440
I don’t know what they have up their sleeves.

92
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,120
But from what I see here…

93
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,200
It looks like the Donkey Kong game.

94
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,880
What game are you talking about?

95
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,960
I don’t know it.

96
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,360
You don’t?

97
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,680
The Donkey Kong has a king kong on the top as a big boss

98
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,880
We must climb up the ladders to get to it.

99
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,040
The boss will throw buckets and we must dodge.

100
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,440
Who would know the game that old

101
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,560
only the game freak like you knows.

102
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,720
You called me the game freak?

103
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,000
But picture this,

104
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,960
if this is the Donkey Kong game.

105
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,880
And there are steps

106
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,680
who do you think is the king kong boss  ?

107
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,280
It can’t be any one but P’Arthit!

108
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,720
Hey, do you want me to share this to P’Arthit?

109
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,480
Tew, you jackass. I’m kidding.

110
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,080
Don’t take it seriously

111
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,480
I’m not part of this.

112
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,120
Freshmen

113
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,920
Fall in!

114
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,120
Freshmen!

115
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:00,960
Attention!

116
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,000
Today!

117
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,240
is an important day of yours.

118
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,880
You all

119
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,880
must prove yourself to make us accept…

120
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,720
…that you are fit in

121
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:15,440
as engineering students in this university!

122
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,880
Do you see the flag?

123
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,200
Your duty is to capture it.

124
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,080
I won’t tell you how.

125
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,960
You must use all I have taught you

126
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,200
and your own abilities to figure it out.

127
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,920
The deadline is…

128
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,840
7 pm sharp today!

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,200
If you fail to capture it.

130
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,240
all of you, the freshmen,

131
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
are not our official engineering juniors!

132
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,880
If you are ready,

133
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,200
let’s get started!

134
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,680
Come and get the flag!

135
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:12,920
What?

136
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,800
We can just go up there and get it. That’s all?

137
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,400
I don’t think it’s that easy.

138
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,120
What should we do then?

139
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,440
No one gives us a clue.

140
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,680
Tew,

141
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,400
you go get it for us.

142
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,080
Tew, go there.

143
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,640
Do you best, man.

144
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,720
I’ve got your back

145
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,240
First year, what are you doing here?

146
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,240
I’m the representative of all the first years…

147
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,160
to ask for permission to get our flag.

148
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,680
You don’t get the permission.

149
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,080
Please go back.

150
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,360
Can you tell me what we should do to get it?

151
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,840
It’s not my duty to help you.

152
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,560
You all must figure it out yourselves.

153
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,720
He didn’t give me any clue.

154
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,000
What to do now?

155
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,400
Damn it.

156
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,680
They don’t give us any hint.

157
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
How are we supposed to know?

158
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,680
There are 5 steps there.

159
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,440
And each step has different colors.

160
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,800
I think it looks like…

161
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,920
…the layered dessert sold in front of the campus.

162
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,960
It’s really yum. Go get it for me.

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,200
Screw you, M.

164
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,080
Is this the time to joke around?

165
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,600
We are being serious here.

166
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,840
In fact,

167
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,920
I think they may have already given us the clues

168
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,520
Let’s think about it carefully.

169
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,680
We are wondering why they have 5 colored fabrics on each step, right?

170
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,360
Could it be like each stage of a game?

171
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,800
Each step has 5 colored fabrics, right?

172
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,120
There are also a hazing senior standing on each step.

173
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,280
It means there are 5 stages we must get through

174
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,480
But I don’t know how to clear each stage.

175
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Could it mean SOTUS?

176
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,240
What?

177
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,280
It could mean SOTUS which they’ve always been teaching us.

178
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,720
SOTUS?

179
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,440
S-O-T-U-S

180
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,680
There are exact 5 letters.

181
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,360
Kong, you are so damn smart.

182
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,120
If it’s like what Kong said,

183
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,080
then we must show those seniors

184
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,640
the meaning of each letter.

185
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,760
and that how much we understand the meaning underlying those letters.

186
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,280
Then the first letter is “S.”

187
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,000
What does it mean?

188
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,440
The first “S” represents “SENIORITY.”

189
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,560
It means we must pay respect to the older.

190
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,080
“O”

191
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,000
“ORDER”

192
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,200
We must comply with the orders.

193
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,760
“T”

194
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,480
“TRADITION”

195
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,640
which means traditions from generation to generation

196
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,640
“U”

197
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,440
“UNITY”

198
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,520
which means being united as a whole.

199
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,960
And the final “S”

200
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,080
“SPIRIT”

201
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,040
The enthusiasm and mind spirit.

202
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,760
That’s right, Wad.

203
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,280
How do you guys know all this?

204
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,800
You can find its meaning on Google, actually.

205
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,320
The first word “Seniority.”

206
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,480
The persons who are older than the third year seniors

207
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,880
are the fourth year seniors, right?

208
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,240
Do you remember when P’Deer came to the gathering?

209
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,400
All third year seniors were so afraid of him.

210
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,320
let’s find the former hazing team leader, P’Deer’s phone number.

211
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,160
Anyone knows his number?

212
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,080
Guys, anyone knows P’Deer’s phone number?

213
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,840
No one.

214
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,680
Then, let’s find all hazing team leaders and ask them to be here.

215
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,360
We will show them how much we respect and want to become their juniors.

216
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,560
What if this is not the right way?

217
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,360
we are wasting our time for nothing.

218
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,560
Do you have other ideas to suggest?

219
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,920
I think…

220
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,480
this is way better than your layered dessert idea.

221
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,200
Let’s do this.

222
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,080
Let’s find those former hazing team leaders.

223
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,320
Let’s get started.

224
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,400
Anyone gets anything?

225
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
No

226
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,440
We could not get hold of 2nd year and 4th year hazing leaders.

227
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,960
They don’t pick up their phones.

228
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,200
Don’t worry.

229
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,600
Why don’t we go to their dorm now?

230
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:09,640
Hey,

231
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,320
isn’t this an invasion of privacy?

232
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,320
We have nothing to lose now.

233
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,400
Let’s get going.

234
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,600
Can I get the flag?

235
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,960
Isn’t it too easy?

236
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,560
I don’t let you.

237
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,560
Can you please stand right here for a minute?

238
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,960
All first years, are you ready?

239
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,400
We are!

240
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,560
3…4!

241
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,080
P’Deer and P’Cream, can you let us be your junior students?

242
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,160
Absolutely

243
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,040
It’s not a problem at all.

244
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,960
But…

245
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,080
for those hazing seniors up there,

246
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,600
I don’t know if they are okay with this.

247
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,360
May I have your permission to get the flag?

248
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,720
You may.

249
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,200
May I have your permission to get the flag?

250
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,200
You may not.

251
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,320
Guys,

252
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,960
now is the second stage.

253
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,960
“O - Order”

254
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,080
Let’s brainstorm and get a solution for this one.

255
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:29,680
Order means to comply with the orders given.

256
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,040
That means there must be orders for us to follow.

257
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,960
But they have not given us any orders.

258
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,280
Does this mean we must make them up?

259
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,880
Then there is nothing to prove because we comply with our own orders.

260
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,480
Yeah. You’ve got the point.

261
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,600
Should we dress properly instead?

262
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,080
Or…we must go up there on the grandstand

263
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,360
Why do we get up there?

264
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,280
To follow the orders.

265
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,240
Those seniors are following the orders

266
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,400
Then we must follow the orders.

267
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,280
We just go up there and follow the orders.

268
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,120
See? This is it.

269
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,920
What is he talking about?

270
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,800
What the hell are you talking?

271
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,640
It doesn’t make any sense.

272
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,560
Guys, let’s think about this one carefully.

273
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,080
This stage is guarded by P’Prem

274
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,440
If we upset him in anyway,

275
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,360
he probably punishes us till our legs break.

276
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,640
Could it be just standing in the line like them?

277
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,880
I don’t think it is.

278
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,240
It’s too easy.

279
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,840
Does it have to be this hard to get the damn flag?

280
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,800
Anyone has any other ideas? Say it.

281
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,600
Do you still want to get the flag?

282
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,000
Shoot! What should we do now?

283
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,480
Let’s form the line like May has suggested.

284
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,360
Fine.

285
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,320
Let’s do it.

286
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,680
All first years!

287
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,080
Fall into line!

288
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,080
Can I get the flag?

289
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,760
Isn’t it too easy?

290
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,200
I don’t let you.

291
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,840
What I have taught you that you failed to finish them…

292
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,280
Go think about it.

293
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,640
What did we fail to do?

294
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,840
Almost everything, actually.

295
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,920
We couldn’t complete the signature task.

296
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,360
We failed to form the line properly.

297
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,000
It’s too late to hunt for senior signatures now

298
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,080
How about we try to form the line within 3 minutes like they used to order us?

299
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,360
What do you reckon?

300
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,400
Let’s give it a try.

301
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,760
Let’s get started.

302
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,400
Everyone,

303
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,760
go line up at the other side of the field within 3 minutes.

304
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,600
Go!

305
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,800
All first years!

306
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,360
Fall in!

307
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,200
All first years!

308
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,400
Fall in!

309
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,600
Faster. We need to be faster.

310
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,480
Form the line.

311
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,960
May, are you okay?

312
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,840
Yes, I’m still okay.

313
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,200
What is this?

314
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,320
A hankie

315
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,400
You sweat a lot.

316
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,800
This is a new one.

317
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,920
It’s never been used.

318
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,000
No, it’s not that.

319
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,680
I don’t want to impose on you.

320
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,040
Take it.

321
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,920
You still have to run around a lot.

322
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,080
Thank you.

323
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,800
I’ll wash it and give it back later on.

324
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,320
It’s all right. It’s just a hankie.

325
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,480
No

326
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,280
They say it’s bad luck to give hankies to others

327
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,240
Give me your palm.

328
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,360
Here you are. I have a 1-baht coin.

329
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
Let me buy this from you.

330
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,000
I never know that you believe in this kind of thing.

331
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,280
I think we should have men run at the back.

332
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,800
Let all women run first.

333
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,240
They look all drained out.

334
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,600
Men, go run at the back.

335
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,080
Let women lead at the front.

336
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,640
Go line up at the other side of the field.

337
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,840
Go!

338
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,920
Enough!

339
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,320
“Order”

340
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,360
means to comply with orders

341
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,400
But the leader can’t just verbally order.

342
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,640
He must also help his team members.

343
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,760
You all are through!

344
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,640
Before 7 pm.

345
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,920
Can we make it?

346
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,840
Don’t be too stress.

347
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,840
We can make it.

348
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,400
I think the first 2 stages we passed are because of luck.

349
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,760
We may not be lucky from now on.

350
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,400
Yeah, it’s not as easy as we thought.

351
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,200
Why don’t we think about the rest letters one by one?

352
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,560
Let’s figure it out now.

353
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,240
We may save a great deal of time.

354
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,720
We have “T - Tradition” left.

355
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,640
To follow traditions.

356
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:12,000
“U - Unity” can be the chant or something we can do together as a whole

357
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,240
But for the “S - Spirit”

358
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,680
I still have no idea what we should do.

359
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,760
I think we should start with the “T” now.

360
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,040
Let’s ask our seniors

361
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,160
if they have traditions that we should follow

362
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,280
Guys, hand these lunchboxes around.

363
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,120
P’Yatch.

364
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:32,640
Yes?

365
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,000
In our engineering faculty,

366
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,200
Do we have the traditions that we should follow from generation to generation?

367
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:41,000
Um…it’s the same as other faculties.

368
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,880
We have chanting, workshop coats.

369
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,600
for other thing else…

370
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,360
I don’t know either.

371
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,640
I see. Thank you.

372
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,600
Even P’Yatch doesn’t know.

373
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,480
What should we do now?

374
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,040
Let’s reach out to the oldest seniors.

375
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,600
Look, P’Deer is sitting over there.

376
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,880
What’s the matter?

377
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,520
Well, we would like to know if we have the traditions we should maintain here

378
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,720
Why do you like to know?

379
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,920
If you want to know just to pass the stage,

380
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,160
I don’t think I should tell you.

381
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,640
We want to study in this faculty so we want to know.

382
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,840
We would like to carry on the traditions from the seniors.

383
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,680
Me too.

384
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,640
Me too.

385
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,200
Only a handful of people…

386
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,160
know about this tradition.

387
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,640
Why?

388
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,120
You may find it funny if you hear about it.

389
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,240
It’s the Garbage Bin Parade

390
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,600
Garbage Bin Parade?

391
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,480
Why do we have the parade for it?

392
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,360
It sounds dirty already just by hearing the name of it, right?

393
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,600
Yes.

394
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:02,040
Engineers like us, sometimes, have to go to dirty areas

395
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,240
or do something that is disgusting, right?

396
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,200
When we carry garbage bins,

397
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,160
it helps make us less egoism.

398
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,360
And also keep the campus clean.

399
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,160
How do we do?

400
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,720
Just carry a bin around in an orderly manner.

401
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,960
Collect any garbage you find. That’s all.

402
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,640
It’s that simple.

403
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,120
They didn’t do this last year, by the way.

404
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,600
Is this how you choose to perform?

405
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,080
Fine, you are through!

406
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,520
See, we did it!

407
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,720
If it weren’t for P’Deer, we would be in a lot of trouble.

408
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,200
Guys,

409
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,000
next is “U”

410
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,640
Are you ready?

411
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,720
We are!

412
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,560
Then, let’s roll!

413
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,960
♪Engineering is like a boat.

414
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:56,440
♪If we think about it, we are in this same boat…

415
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,400
♪heading to the same destination that we all dream of.

416
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:06,000
♪We will never row back and our dream will eventually come true.

417
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:10,920
♪An engineer…We proudly say that we are an engineer.

418
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:15,400
♪Good times or bad times, we will reach the goal together.

419
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,640
♪The big dream we have in engineering.

420
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,360
What on earth are you chanting?

421
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,440
I’ve got goosebumps, you know?

422
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,560
All right. Come up here.

423
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,320
How are you guys holding up?

424
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,600
Are you still okay?

425
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,560
Let’s keep this going.

426
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,360
We are okay.

427
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,320
What about you?

428
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,640
I’m good.

429
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,760
Now comes to the biggest challenge “S”

430
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,240
It’s the last letter. “Spirit”

431
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,960
Is it the enthusiasm?

432
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,880
But we just chanted the anthem.

433
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,840
We must find another way.

434
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,520
Could it mean the spirit of the faculty of engineering?

435
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,880
It’s the ‘gears’ that work together harmoniously.

436
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,760
Yeah, this is a great idea.

437
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,920
So we must do something that shows our unity.

438
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,480
Something that shows we are united in one mind.

439
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,480
What should we do?

440
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,840
What about we line up and form a symbol of a gear shape.

441
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,440
That’s brilliant.

442
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,480
Well, let’s do this now.

443
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,960
Everyone, we will line up and form a gear shape.

444
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,760
Listen,

445
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
someone must stand on a higher ground

446
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,280
to check if our formation is good.

447
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,160
Who wants to do this?

448
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:37,480
Well then. I and M volunteer.

449
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,840
Have you asked me if I want to do it?

450
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:39,560
Come on. Let’s do it.

451
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,480
But I’m going with you.

452
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,000
Guys, let’s form the line.

453
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,600
Is it okay yet?

454
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,400
May I have permission to get our year class flag?

455
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,120
No…You…May…Not

456
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,560
This doesn’t do?

457
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,560
I and M are so dead tired yelling out from there.

458
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,920
My throat hurts.

459
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:25,520
Guys, I apologize for the time that has wasted.

460
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,480
Come on. It’s not your fault.

461
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,040
It’s better than nothing.

462
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,280
Yes, no one knows whether it’s what they want from us.

463
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,000
What to do now?

464
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,200
Hey, what should we do next? It’s passed 6 o’clock.

465
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,320
Oh dear god. What should we do?

466
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,200
Guys, hear me out.

467
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,640
I have a plan.

468
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,840
What are you here for?

469
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,160
I’m the representative of the first years.

470
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,680
I would like to ask you to come down into the field with me.

471
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,920
Why do I have to go there with you?

472
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,760
So that all of us can show our spirit to you.

473
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,320
Show your spirit to me, you say?

474
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,840
You should ask yourself that first

475
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:32,240
whether all of you out there have enough spirit.

476
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,200
I told you.

477
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,040
If it doesn’t come from your true heart,

478
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,480
you don’t deserve to get acknowledged from us.

479
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,360
P’Arthit…

480
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,240
I admit that it wasn’t my intention to study here at the first place.

481
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,640
But I never regret to choose this faculty.

482
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,840
I’m proud to study here

483
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,400
and meet those friends

484
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,320
and good seniors.

485
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,960
If you think I don’t love this faculty,

486
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,240
you are wrong.

487
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,880
I want to be an engineering student.

488
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,240
I want to be your junior student from the bottom of my heart.

489
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,240
And my friends too.

490
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,600
Otherwise, we don’t desperately try this hard to get acceptance from you.

491
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,760
If you want to know if what I said is true…

492
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,440
come down into the field with me.

493
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,280
Fine.

494
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,400
Please stand here.

495
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,360
Well?

496
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,280
What is the spirit you want to show to me?

497
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,960
The spirit from us today…

498
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,480
cannot happen without the spirit of you, our seniors.

499
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,680
If it weren’t for you,

500
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,840
we would not have it.

501
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,600
We would like to return this favor of yours from the bottom of our heart.

502
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,840
First years, line up!

503
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,080
First years, show your spirit.

504
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,240
Thank you, P’Arthit.

505
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,040
Thank you, P’Arthit.

506
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,880
Thank you, P’Arthit.

507
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,720
Thank you, P’Arthit.

508
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,040
Thank you, P’Arthit.

509
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,560
Thank you, P’Arthit.

510
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,440
Thank you, P’Arthit.

511
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,840
Thank you, P’Arthit.

512
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,200
Thank you, P’Arthit.

513
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,040
Thank you, P’Arthit.

514
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,640
Thank you, P’Arthit.

515
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,400
Thank you, P’Arthit.

516
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,920
Thank you, P’Arthit.

517
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,400
Thank you, P’Arthit.

518
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,680
First years,

519
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,920
chant to thank you the hazing team leader.

520
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,800
Go!

521
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,760
E N G I N E E R

522
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,160
WE ARE ENGINEER. ENGINEER. HEY!

523
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,600
Do you think this little effort of yours

524
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,960
can get a yes from me?

525
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,760
Sorry.

526
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,040
It doesn’t work!

527
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,560
First years,

528
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,440
Get in the line

529
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,520
Your time is up!

530
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,320
Put your hands on your friends’ shoulders.

531
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,760
Get down!

532
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:33,680
Who said you could raise your head and look at the flag?

533
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,440
You have no right to look at it.

534
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,200
Get your head down.

535
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,240
You cannot raise your head until I say so.

536
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,800
First years, raise your head.

537
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,600
Send a representative up here.

538
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,840
Hey, Nong Kongpob.

539
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,960
P’Fang, sawasdee krup.

540
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,800
What are you doing out here?

541
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,640
Why don’t you get in the line for the wrist tying ceremony?

542
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,480
Well, there are too many people lining up.

543
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,160
So I want to wait out here.

544
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,800
Then, give me your hand

545
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,640
Let me be the first senior to tie a thread for you.

546
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,400
I wish you all the best throughout the next 4 years here…

547
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,680
both academic and love.

548
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:38,960
Thank you.

549
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,000
You’re welcome.

550
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,280
Hurry up and get in the line.

551
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,760
The seniors are waiting for you.

552
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,880
All right

553
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,760
Wait, P’Fang.

554
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,480
Have you seen P’Arthit?

555
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,600
Arthit?

556
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,960
I saw him at the back of the grandstand.

557
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,720
Thank you.

558
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,720
Hold on

559
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,800
If you meet Arthit,

560
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,520
Give him this for me.

561
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,960
I bet he doesn’t take them with him.

562
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,600
Thank you, P’Fang

563
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,600
See you later.

564
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,640
P’Arthit.

565
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,920
Are you okay?

566
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,800
I’m okay. The weather is hot.

567
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,680
I’m out here to wash my face.

568
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,000
Why? What’s the problem?

569
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,800
No, nothing.

570
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,640
Well then, get back in.

571
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,920
You are supposed to be at the wrist tying ceremony, aren’t you?

572
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,480
How could you leave it in the middle like this?

573
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,560
Hold on a sec.

574
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,280
Before you go,

575
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,680
can you give me a wrist tying?

576
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,880
Please tie this hand.

577
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,080
You are so picky.

578
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,520
Take care of the flag for me.

579
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,600
I will take care of it with my heart.

580
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,720
Okay, it’s done.

581
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,800
Thank you.

582
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,840
Hold on.

583
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,440
What now?

584
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,800
In the future, if you want to cry.

585
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,240
Tell me.

586
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,960
I’ll wipe away those tears for you.

587
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,240
Kongpob!
