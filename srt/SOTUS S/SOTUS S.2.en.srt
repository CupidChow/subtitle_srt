1
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,680
I just want to take a photo of you going to work on your first day.

2
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,080
When you use this pen, you have me right beside you all the time

3
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,480
Sawasdee krap, all of you.

4
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,880
My name is Arthit

5
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,320
I got transferred to take a position here from the Production Department

6
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
How was your first day in the Procurement Department?

7
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,840
No one cares to talk to me.

8
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,360
May I know what is your…

9
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,800
P’Earth, P’Danai is asking for you.

10
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,800
I don’t have all day to wait for you.

11
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,840
Don’t you know this basic manner?

12
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,480
I feel like I’m a freshman once again and got scolded by seniors

13
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,040
N’Arthit, have you had someone to cook for you yet?

14
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
You.

15
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,320
Get up.

16
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,520
Where is your name tag?

17
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,960
I forgot to bring it.

18
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,840
What is her name?

19
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,240
No one here knows what her name is?

20
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,440
I know her

21
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,000
What is her name?

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,880
What is her favorite activity?

23
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,520
Her name is Khaofang.

24
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,600
She likes to watch movies.

25
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,560
Who else in here like to watch movies?

26
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,240
I asked “who else in here like to watch movies?”

27
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,080
I like to watch movies too.

28
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,920
I want you to know that

29
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,560
your name tag may give only information about your name and your student ID.

30
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,160
But it doesn’t say what you like to do

31
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,280
where you like to go

32
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,240
or what you like to eat.

33
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,920
But it helps your friends

34
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,400
and all of the seniors

35
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,240
to remember you better.

36
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,560
And what is more important is that…

37
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,040
I want you all

38
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,880
talk and join in communication

39
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,440
and know one another

40
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,440
who knows you may get to know someone who shares common interests with you

41
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,920
like today.

42
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,000
I’ll give you a new nametag

43
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,600
Don’t forget to bring it again.

44
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,440
And go know your new friends

45
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,080
You may sit down.

46
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,440
Here you are, Kong.

47
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,480
The lists of freshmen who joined the recent gathering

48
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,680
And they gave us full cooperation.

49
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,040
But there’s one guy who seems to be a loose cannon.

50
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,920
That’s not strange.

51
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,520
When we were first year

52
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,000
there were problems too

53
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,600
How about we go and lift up their spirit while they are in classes?

54
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,240
I’ll ask permission from the professors

55
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,800
That sounds interesting.

56
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,640
We have to plan carefully

57
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,080
If something bad happens,

58
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,040
we could be in serious trouble.

59
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,360
I talked to a professor yesterday.

60
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,000
He said the university executive board is closely watching the initiation activities

61
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,680
And a faculty was told to cancelled all of their initiation activities immediately

62
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,240
because they adopted activities that were too harsh.

63
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,120
Then we have to make it even more transparent

64
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,640
of what we are doing

65
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,040
For examples

66
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,360
we can ask some professors to join our activities.

67
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,480
And we submit a report to them every time

68
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,640
So they know our initiation activities have zero violence

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,520
and focus on constructive activities.

70
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,880
P’Som-O, sawasdee krap.

71
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,640
Sawasdee.

72
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,160
Hey, Arthit.

73
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,560
Help me choose which shoes are prettier

74
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,680
Well, P’Som-O.

75
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,920
Women shoes are not my thing.

76
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,240
Please excuse me.

77
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,240
But…

78
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,080
P’Earth, sawasdee krap.

79
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,760
When did you get here?

80
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,800
Arthit,

81
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,280
come here.

82
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,800
Have P’Danai arrived?

83
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,320
I haven’t seen him.

84
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,520
Can you do me a favor?

85
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,440
Take this stock list document to P’Yong at the Production Department

86
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,400
Sure. You want me to go now?

87
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,040
Yes.

88
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,680
Thank you.

89
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,920
Nong Khaofang

90
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,920
This is your new name tag.

91
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,440
Thank you.

92
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,160
Is everything all right?

93
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,240
Yes.

94
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,440
Don’t forget it next time.

95
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Got it.

96
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,640
See you later.

97
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,600
Are you going home now?

98
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,560
Yes.

99
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,520
Let’s go together.

100
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,040
Kong

101
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,800
your junior mentor is cute

102
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,960
Get the hell away from her, Oak.

103
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,360
By the way, Wad’s father has been released from the hospital

104
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,400
Is Wad coming back to study?

105
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,640
I don’t think he’s coming anytime soon

106
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,760
He has to look after his father

107
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,680
Do you miss him?

108
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,000
I do.

109
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,440
Didn’t we just visit him?

110
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,760
I miss him really much

111
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,760
Sawasdee krap.

112
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,240
Sawasdee, Nong Arthit

113
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,000
How have you been doing?

114
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,320
Did you get transferred back to here?

115
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,080
No, I’m just here to drop this document.

116
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,800
Good good. Work hard

117
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,640
See you later.

118
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,760
Sawasdee krap.

119
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,560
Work hard, bro!

120
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,200
Sawasdee krap, P’Yong.

121
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,800
Hey, Arthit.

122
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,280
How are you?

123
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,520
Well, not bad.

124
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,200
P’Yong krap.

125
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,840
P’John wants me to give this document to you.

126
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,360
He always submits late.

127
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,520
Forget it. I have finished it.

128
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,120
Give this to John.

129
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,640
Got it.

130
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,400
So? How are you doing?

131
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,760
Are you bored sitting at your desk all day?

132
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,880
I’m not.

133
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,120
I think I’m still new to office jobs.

134
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,280
Don’t worry. You’ll get used to it soon

135
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,240
Procurement tasks are more on document base

136
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,120
You may feel out of place at first

137
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,240
But you are a fast learner.

138
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,200
I’m sure you pick up things fast.

139
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,640
Okay, I’ll try.

140
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,920
Nong Arthit.

141
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,640
Do you know how much I miss you?

142
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:42,720
Okay.

143
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,320
Cherry, get off him.

144
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,840
Have you done your job yet?

145
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,680
Come on, P’Yong.

146
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,040
I miss him.

147
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,440
And you, Arthit.

148
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,080
Since you got transferred to that department

149
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,480
you don’t come to see me here at all.

150
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,360
I’m busy there

151
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
Will you let him go back to work now?

152
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,840
Seriously, P’Yong.

153
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,360
I haven’t had a chit chat with him yet.

154
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,040
Give me time to ask how he is doing

155
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,240
Really?

156
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
Didn’t you just ask?

157
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,760
Go back to your work.

158
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,240
You are so mean.

159
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,080
It’s okay.

160
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,760
When your jobs are done, come see me again

161
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,880
Well, please excuse me.

162
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,240
See you later

163
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,840
That’s a wrap for today.

164
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,800
Take care of yourself when you go home in the rain.

165
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,200
See you.

166
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,840
Oh, please stay here for a moment.

167
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,080
Your seniors want to talk to you.

168
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,240
Sawasdee krap, all first years.

169
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,880
Since I’m the head of the hazing staff

170
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,760
I have 2 things to tell you here

171
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,320
Firstly,

172
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:00,240
I want you all to participate in the gathering activity

173
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,360
on the scheduled time and date

174
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,160
If you are late

175
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,880
it will affect on the finishing time before you could go home

176
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,800
Secondly

177
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,080
I want you to ask all of your friends

178
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:15,640
who are yet to join any sessions of the gathering activity

179
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,760
to come join us

180
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,360
So they can introduce themselves to the seniors and everyone of you

181
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,080
All first years,

182
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,400
do you understand?

183
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,360
Yes.

184
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,880
Do you understand?

185
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,880
Yes.

186
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,680
Do you have a problem?

187
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,280
I don’t have a problem.

188
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,000
But I have a question.

189
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,560
I want to know

190
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,320
what are the purposes of the activities you are holding?

191
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,880
And why do you require us all to join?

192
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,280
The gathering activity

193
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,520
is a traditional activity that has long been held in this university

194
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,760
And it’s the activity that can create unity

195
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:09,400
and cooperation between seniors and juniors.

196
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,520
But to me

197
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,480
we come to the university to study

198
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,520
not to carry on the activities set up by a certain group of seniors

199
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,240
who force juniors to join against their will.

200
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,200
Like this gathering activity

201
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,840
that you claim that it’s for introducing and get to know seniors and friends.

202
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,520
You force us to join it everyday after class.

203
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,360
I think you misunderstand it.

204
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,720
We hold this event so you have the chance to interact with others

205
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,520
to know the seniors in this faculty

206
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,800
and your fellow students in your year

207
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,000
And if you open your heart,

208
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,120
you may like this activity.

209
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,200
Then, please excuse me.

210
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,920
I don’t like to be told what to do.

211
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,320
John, help me collect contacts of these international suppliers

212
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,200
Okay.

213
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,040
Uh…P’John

214
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,600
here you are.

215
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,120
This is the detail of stock checking.

216
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,960
I asked Arthit to get it from the Procurement Department.

217
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,800
Okay, good job, John.

218
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,080
I have Arthit here to help

219
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,240
Many tasks are done faster.

220
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,400
Arthit picks up things very fast, you know?

221
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,840
Well then, please excuse me.

222
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,440
Wait a minute, Arthit.

223
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,440
Do me a favor

224
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,200
This is a purchase order. Can you fax it for me?

225
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,880
The contact details are on the note in the front

226
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,120
Okay krap.

227
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,160
Let’s get going.

228
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Okay,

229
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,680
I hurry and send this document and the purchase order via fax now.

230
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,160
Please wait a bit

231
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,800
Are you done? I want to use it now

232
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,720
Go ahead.

233
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,720
Okay.

234
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,360
You can wait to pick it up at your fax machine now.

235
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,280
You have never faxed before?

236
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,640
No.

237
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,880
Do you have the recipient’s fax number and the document you want to fax ready?

238
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,040
Fill in all the required info and watch me

239
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,280
Uh, P’Earth

240
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,680
Why does this company still use faxes?

241
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,000
Don’t people nowadays send documents via email instead?

242
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,440
P’Earth!

243
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,680
Your pen.

244
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,040
Throw it away. The ink doesn’t come out.

245
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,520
Wait but it still looks new.

246
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,040
Do you want to try dipping it in hot water?

247
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,640
The ink may come out.

248
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,320
It’s easier to find a new one.

249
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,920
Don’t you have a fax to send?

250
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,880
Your report looks okay.

251
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,800
But I want to warn you anyway

252
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,400
Young people these days may not be like you.

253
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,160
I adjust the activities to fit junior students more

254
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,960
That’s right.

255
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,560
We guarantee that there will be no problems at all.

256
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,240
Excuse me.

257
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,040
Well, I can come back later.

258
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,840
You can finish what you are talking.

259
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,040
It’s okay

260
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,440
Your seniors have just finished.

261
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,400
Excuse me

262
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,840
You are here to discuss about your credits, right?

263
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,080
Yes.

264
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,120
Hey, Kong.

265
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,840
You can go without me. I’ll be there later

266
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,080
Why?

267
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,640
I want to stay back and talk to him

268
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,080
Hurry up then.

269
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,120
0058

270
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,320
Well…

271
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,320
What do you want from me?

272
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,360
Did you transfer to study here?

273
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,520
I don’t have to answer you.

274
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,680
Yes

275
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,960
I don’t know what you have been through.

276
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,400
But now you are my junior.

277
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,440
I want you to open your heart and join the gathering activity

278
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,000
I told you clearly when I was in my classroom, didn’t I?

279
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,960
I won’t take part in the gathering activity

280
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,200
Yes.

281
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,640
But this is not an order.

282
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:49,320
I just asked you to open your heart and come to the gathering

283
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,560
I think there are many things you learn after taking part in this activity.

284
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,440
Okay, Nong Pao. See you soon

285
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,360
Som-O.

286
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:05,840
Yes?

287
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,800
Turn my computer off for me.

288
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,000
Arthit,

289
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,160
can you turn off P’John’s computer?

290
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
Okay.

291
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,520
Kongpob, are you free…

292
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,680
P’Arthit krap, are you free this evening?

293
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,720
Yes,

294
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,280
I’m about to text you.

295
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,640
I will text you again after the gathering activity here.

296
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,560
Hey, Kong.

297
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,520
Ready?

298
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,520
Let’s go.

299
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,280
Guys, Let’s go.

300
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,400
♪We are not turning back and our dream will come true.♪

301
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,640
You all can sing it.

302
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,760
I’m glad.

303
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,880
May I ask you to sing again as one?

304
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,080
Yes.

305
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,360
Look.

306
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,560
He still dares to come

307
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,160
I want to smack him.

308
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,600
why are you so fierce lately?

309
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,160
Take it easy.

310
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,600
He comes here.

311
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,880
It could be that Kong had talked to him

312
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,120
Or else, he doesn’t come join us.

313
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,200
I hope you all sing wholeheartedly

315
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,000
One more.

316
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,480
♪Engineering, this name must resound. Engineering…♪

317
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,320
One more time.

318
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,760
The last time you sang,

319
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,560
I found it’s okay.

320
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,120
But I think it can be better.

321
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,240
I know you can do better

322
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,000
Can you?

323
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,840
Yes.

324
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,160
0058

325
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,080
Where are you going?

326
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,040
I have tried to open my heart.

327
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,080
I came to this gathering like you asked me to.

328
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,880
I find that this activity you are doing

329
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,800
doesn’t make me learn anything

330
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,320
It’s like where I have been to

331
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,240
I find this a waste of time

332
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,000
And my throat starts to hurt.

333
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,320
0058

334
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,240
Thank you very much for today

335
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,600
Even though something didn’t go according to our plan.

336
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,640
But we could still finish today’s gathering

337
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,640
with full attention from the rest of juniors.

338
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,720
I think we should do something with that boy

339
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,040
I’m afraid others will follow and skip the gathering

340
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,840
You guys, listen.

341
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,000
I have found out the reason.

342
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,840
What are you talking about?

343
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,720
That boy, 0058, who had a trouble in the gathering hall.

344
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,240
He transferred from another university

345
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,120
So he opposes the initiation system.

346
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,960
What is his name?

347
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,000
His name is Day.

348
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,080
Yes. How do you know?

349
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,600
I and Kong overheard him talking to professor Ky.

350
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,640
So we heard he transferred from another university.

351
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,360
I think the problem for us is how to stop other juniors not to follow that boy

352
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,480
Or they may not come to the gathering now.

353
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,640
Yeah. And the Flag Capturing Day is around the corner

354
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,720
I think we should ignore this junior.

355
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,080
Let him be.

356
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,520
We can’t.

357
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,400
Why?

358
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,720
I think I can talk him in.

359
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,400
It’s up to you then.

360
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,840
I just don’t want him to create more troubles.

361
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,080
Like he said,

362
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,880
the Flag Capturing Day is drawing near.

363
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,360
I will talk to him.

364
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,560
I’m also the person who questioned about the gathering event before.

365
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,520
Come on, you guys

366
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,080
Take a break from your serious meeting and eat first

367
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,800
We have a lot of things.

368
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,400
I’m hungry now. Thank you so much

369
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,720
M, this is yours

370
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,400
You don’t eat spicy food, right?

371
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,680
Yes, May.

372
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,760
Thank you.

373
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,120
Kong, what do you like to eat?

374
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,320
We have fermented pork omelet and stir fried pork in chili paste

375
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,360
I’m good, May.

376
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,080
I have a plan this evening

377
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,160
Really?

378
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,080
Then, take this.

379
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,640
Kong, you are not eating it, right?

380
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,120
Then I take two boxes.

381
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,080
Hand off, glasses boy.

382
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,480
See you soon.

383
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,240
How long have you been here?

384
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,880
Kongpob, what did you do?

385
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,720
You are scaring me.

386
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,640
Sorry, the meeting ended late

387
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,520
It’s okay.

388
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,600
Have you eaten?

389
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,680
I just got here.

390
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,560
Do you want to grab something to eat?

391
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,480
I’m hungry.

392
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,160
How about that noodle house?

393
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,880
It’s been a while since we went there.

394
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,920
Sounds good.

395
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,920
But after we eat, can you go to a bookshop with me?

396
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,920
Sure.

397
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,800
What are you looking at?

398
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,080
Can’t I look at you?

399
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:00,800
You cannot.

400
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,280
My face is expensive.

401
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,120
What the hell?

402
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,080
How come it got turned into this?

403
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,000
They could have moved.

404
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,800
How come?

405
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,960
I was here last time and people were crowded

406
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,160
What a bummer.

407
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,320
You know what?

408
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,160
The area where I work

409
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,880
no noodle shop sells delicious stewed pork in spicy soup.

410
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,360
I want to have it here

411
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,920
But look, it’s gone.

412
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,760
That place looks okay.

413
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,280
Should we try?

414
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,320
What else can we do?

415
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,000
This is a real bummer.

416
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,040
What if that place doesn’t have noodles as good as this place?

417
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:47,880
What are you going to do?

418
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,480
You must be responsible for it.

419
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,440
I told you

420
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,400
No noodle house is as good as that one

421
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,520
Try this one.

422
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
No, you can have it.

423
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,240
Try this meatball.

424
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,560
No, you eat it.

425
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,800
Hey, the meatballs here are so damn good.

426
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,200
Have you been here before?

427
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,320
Yes, once.

428
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,920
You can have this bowl.

429
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,680
Nah, it’s okay. You go ahead.

430
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,280
I want to have spicy soup

431
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,280
Excuse me.

432
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,000
Can I have one dish of meatballs?

433
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,680
Here

434
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,200
If you like meatballs, help me finish this.

435
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,800
You are still the same.

436
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,480
What do you mean?

437
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,880
You can still make me fall in love with you every time

438
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,160
Hurry and finish it.

439
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,560
It’s getting cold.

440
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,560
I know

441
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,040
What books are you looking for?

442
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,280
Well,

443
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,400
the books that relate to my work.

444
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,120
I understand about the books relating to procurement

445
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,520
But this

446
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,440
it’s essential too?

447
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,320
It is.

448
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,120
What’s wrong?

449
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,880
Is there anyone hitting on you at work?

450
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,520
No one.

451
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,760
That’s good to know.

452
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,680
Because I am a very possessive boyfriend.

453
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,960
And I’m also a head hazer.

454
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,720
What are you doing?

455
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,240
Why?

456
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,680
We are in a bookshop.

457
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,560
No one is looking.

458
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,200
But it’s a public place.

459
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,560
If you want to hold my hand,

460
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,560
do it when we are back home.

461
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,080
Then, let’s hurry and go home.

462
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,160
You can go to bed first

463
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,480
It was a long day for you.

464
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:42,800
No.

465
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,360
I want to continue reading this book.

466
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,240
What are you doing?

467
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,360
I make a report of today’s gathering to submit to the professor

468
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,080
Do you need to do that?

469
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,880
Ah, it’s almost the Flag Capturing Day, right?

470
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,400
Yes.

471
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,960
We are still thinking of the way to use this year.

472
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,720
The way?

473
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,640
I think the gathering activity of the initiation depends on how we adapt it

474
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,240
We must adapt it to fit the people in this generation

475
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,840
Look at me.

476
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,680
I go to work already but I still have to learn to adapt

477
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,400
At the end of the day

478
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,440
whatever way we use

479
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,640
we must know whom this activity is for.

480
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,360
and how they get benefits from what we offer.

481
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,760
Look back at your year.

482
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:34,800
Did you remember what I wanted you to get?

483
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,400
By the way, are you free this Friday?

484
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,760
I want to come to…

485
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,960
P’John,

486
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,560
this is the purchase order document.

487
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,520
Can you help review it for me?

488
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,840
Arthit,

489
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,880
it’s very well made

490
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,840
You have just been here not long ago

491
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,840
You have a good progress

492
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,000
Thank you.

493
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,960
How about this?

494
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,720
Come with me this afternoon.

495
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,400
I’m taking you to meet a sales executive

496
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,320
Don’t worry.

497
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
P’Danai?

498
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,520
I can talk to him.

499
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,440
I’ll tell him that I take you out to coach

500
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,560
It’s good to meet sales people, you know?

501
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,560
Really?

502
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
Thank you so much, P’John.

503
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,880
No worries.

504
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,840
Working with me

505
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,040
is great.

506
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,880
What are you looking at?=

507
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,880
Can I sit here?

508
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,520
Yes.

509
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,720
Do you read this kind of book too?

510
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,840
The writer of this book

511
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,240
I like when he analyzes Thai economics in the newspaper.

512
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,720
Have you read it?

513
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,440
I just read this to gain knowledge.

514
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,400
If you are interested in economics,

515
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,880
why do you study engineering?

516
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,720
I also like engineering.

517
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,680
But for economics,

518
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,160
I want to study it for my master degree

519
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,640
Well,

520
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,000
is there anything you want from me?

521
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,320
It’s about the gathering activity

522
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,320
If it’s about this activity.

523
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,400
May I express my opinion from my point of view?

524
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,680
The activity you are doing

525
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,120
It’s not that I don’t see any good in it.

526
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,200
I can see some good points

527
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,320
that you and your friends are trying to point it out to me

528
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,480
and to other freshmen.

529
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,400
But the fact that I don’t want to take part in it

530
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,960
is about the right

531
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:22,400
I just express my right I’m entitled to

532
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,040
that I have the option to choose

533
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,320
either to go with the system

534
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,720
or to turn it down.

535
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,440
I understand what you mean.

536
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,880
I understand that we have different thoughts.

537
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,800
Though, we thing differently,

538
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,040
we can still stay together

539
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,080
How?

540
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,880
With respect.

541
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,400
I respect your thoughts.

542
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,000
And you might have already seen the intentions I have for the freshmen.

543
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,280
We don’t do this to satisfy our own needs.

544
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,680
We do this to make them learn

545
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,720
how to live in this campus community

546
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,960
They all come from different backgrounds

547
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,520
and have different thoughts.

548
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,920
I just want them to live together in this community as fast as possible

549
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,720
by mean of the thing called gathering activity

550
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,880
I understand.

551
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,960
However

552
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,960
it may not be effective to everyone like you think it would

553
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,520
Like I told you

554
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,160
about the respect

555
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,600
I respect everyone’s thoughts

556
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,760
I do hope

557
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,520
you respect my thoughts as well.

558
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,800
Please think about it.

559
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,280
I want to see you take part in the flag capturing event with your friends.

560
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,640
I’m at a coffee shop now.

561
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,960
I have a business meeting with people from a procurement department.

562
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,280
Here they are

563
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,000
This is Khun John.

564
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,640
And that person is…

565
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,720
Khun Arthit.

566
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,840
He is good looking, right?

567
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,000
I dress up today for work.

568
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,120
Well, I have to go offline now to work.

569
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,840
Bye bye.

570
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,640
It’s been a while.

571
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,120
You are still pretty the same.

572
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,880
Khun John. You are still a sweet talker too.

573
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,640
And Khun Arthit is a new hire?

574
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,760
Yes.

575
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,960
Arthit is a new employee in my department.

576
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,480
He is good looking

577
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,360
and also working effectively.

578
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,360
It’s nice to meet you.

579
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,040
Nice to meet you too.

580
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,440
P’Lyla is a sales executive providing materials for our company for a very long time

581
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,680
If our company doesn’t get good quality materials with good price from P’Lyla,

582
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,440
it would probably go out of business

583
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,320
Look, I brought this for you.

584
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,120
Thank you.

585
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,760
This is a catalogue and products from my company

586
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,360
I have to meet my target

587
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,240
Please help me, Khun John.

588
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,920
No problem.

589
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,280
You can leave it to me.

590
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,720
Hey, P’Lyla.

591
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,360
You’ve got a new watch?

592
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,520
Yes,

593
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,080
you are quite observant.

594
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,160
I am.

595
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,520
The gold color is catching my eyes

596
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,520
Is it pretty?

597
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,200
And it’s rose gold, right?

598
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,400
Yes.

599
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,320
It’s the latest edition.

600
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,320
Let me have the honor to touch it.

601
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,520
There

602
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,360
It’s pretty, right?

603
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:42,960
Arthit.

604
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,080
Look.

605
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,520
This is rose gold.

606
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,640
You know what?

607
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,160
this watch is more expensive than your father’s car

608
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,360
Take a close look.

609
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,320
You can touch it.

610
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,520
Don’t worry. She’s kind.

611
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,280
And this is for your colleagues at the office

612
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,320
Thank you.

613
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,880
I have to excuse myself.

614
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,120
See you again later.

615
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,440
I’ll contact back shortly.

616
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,520
Okay. See you

617
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,480
Bye bye. See you later.

618
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,080
Arthit,

619
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,840
hold these

620
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,760
Yes, let’s get going.

621
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,640
Nong Day.

622
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,400
0058

623
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,120
Is there anything you want from me?

624
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,720
If it’s about that flag capturing event,

625
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,760
Khun Khongpob already talked to me.

626
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,680
no.

627
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,040
That’s not what I’m here for.

628
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,240
I have another thing to talk to you.

629
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,040
I’m curious

630
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,480
why you have to go against the activity

631
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,080
and isolate yourself to be here alone.

632
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,920
I told you, right?

633
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,520
If the activity you want me to do

634
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,800
doesn’t have any benefits for me,

635
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,800
I won’t do it.

636
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,880
But you don’t have to oppose it

637
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,760
I don’t think that’s the real problem

638
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,640
Did you have problems with your old university?

639
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,720
What do you mean?

640
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,960
That’s why you transfer to study here

641
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,080
Am I right?

642
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,520
That’s none of your business.

643
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,800
Even I had problems with my old university

644
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,840
It doesn’t concern you at all.

645
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,120
It does

646
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,360
How?

647
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,600
You are now my junior

648
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,760
I’m your junior?

649
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,040
That doesn’t mean I have to do everything you tell me to.

650
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,360
Another thing is…

651
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,160
I never respect you as my senior anyway.

652
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,360
Leave me alone already.

653
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,480
You indeed had problems with your old university

654
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,840
And here

655
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,360
you want to have problems with me.

656
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,840
Directed by
Padung Smajarn / Pongpisit Botsri

657
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,080
P’Arthit krap,

658
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,000
do you know there is meteor shower tonight?

659
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,800
Really?

660
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,080
What time?

661
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,240
Around 8 pm to midnight

662
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,400
But…

663
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,320
we may not see them in Bangkok.

664
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,760
Really? Why?

665
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,920
You know what?

666
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,680
I have never seen meteor shower before

667
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,760
I have never seen them too

668
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,520
Well then…

669
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:12,120
let’s go on a trip and stargaze together when we are free?

670
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,560
Really?

671
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,240
I take this as you are asking me out on a date

672
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,800
I want to stargaze really really much.

673
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,360
Really really much?

674
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,400
Now you are talking.

675
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,560
You are as happy as a child.

676
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,240
I really want to see meteors

677
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,960
Do you think

678
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,120
at the beach we are going for the initiation ritual…

679
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,120
can we get to see the meteors there?

680
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,440
If you are lucky, you will see them.

681
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,040
Seriously,

682
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,040
If you want to see them that much

683
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:41,280
I can just take you to the planetarium now

684
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,760
I want to see the stars in the sky

685
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,960
But I want to see Arthit (the sun) more.

686
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,480
Stop it.

687
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,280
You are not going to see the meteors

688
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,880
Why?

689
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,640
As long as you are with the sun (Arthit).

690
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:17,360

691
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,440
It’s not SOTUS.

692
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,600
if we can find another red box, we may be able to solve it.

693
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,440
The most important thing in Procurement work…

694
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,560
what is it?

695
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,880
I don’t know.

696
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,200
You know something?

697
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,360
When I get to see the atmosphere like this again

698
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,880
My tiredness is gone

699
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,360
I have strength to go back to my work now

700
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:39,520
I’m happy that your tiredness is gone.

701
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,320
and you can smile
