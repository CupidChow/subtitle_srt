1
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,480
All of the smokeless grillers we made have been rejected.

2
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,120
Tod, did you find the supplier yourself?

3
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,400
P’John did.

4
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,000
The old plastic frames we have left in the stock

5
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,680
can replace the new ones.

6
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,320
We just need to replace with these plastic frames, right?

7
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,800
No. the old frames we have are not that many

8
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,240
The documents have been forged.

9
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,520
Where are the real documents, then?

10
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:45,160
At P’John.

11
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,080
Excuse me.

12
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,640
I can contact a supplier who can help us on this issue

13
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,960
There’s a problem here

14
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,360
Please hold the line.

15
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,520
P’Danai krap.

16
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,080
You can go to this company now.

17
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,240
Thank you so much, Kongpob.

18
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,480
Hello.

19
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,360
You have gathered all the details of this product, right?

20
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,080
Here you are.

21
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,080
The thing is

22
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,880
the supplier Kongpob has contacted for us

23
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,080
agrees to produce the rest order we require

24
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,600
and deliver to us within the deadline.

25
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,600
But we need to take this detailed requirement

26
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,800
to this supplier right away.

27
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,040
I can take it to the supplier

28
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,720
I initiated this project

29
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,040
I would like to take responsibility and solve it myself

30
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
All right.

31
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,680
Go to Siam Polimer Company now.

32
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,880
There’s someone waiting to receive you there

33
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,720
Got it.

34
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,840
Uh, P’Danai.

35
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,600
Can I go with Tod too?

36
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,600
I used to contact this supplier.

37
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,960
Fine. You two must hurry and go there now.

38
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,120
And Earth,

39
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,720
you go downstairs

40
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,160
and recheck the amount of the products

41
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,880
We cannot afford to have any mistakes again

42
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,400
Got it.

43
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,840
P’Arthit krap.

44
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,920
How did it go?

45
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,080
I need to go to Siam Polimer office now.

46
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,920
This supplier asked to see the details right away

47
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,600
I see

48
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,240
Anyway, Kongpob.

49
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,600
How do you know this company?

50
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:04,720
What did you say to this supplier? Why does he agree to help us?

51
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,600
I called Khun Kerkkrai before,

52
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,080
he said the producing line at his company had been fully booked

53
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,400
Well,

54
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,120
I have been wanting to tell you…

55
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,280
Mr. Sun, let’s go.

56
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,280
Okay, let’s talk about that later.

57
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,680
Hold on, P’Arthit.

58
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,960
When you talk to Khun Kerkkrai, please be nice.

59
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,320
He likes a hard-working person.

60
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,960
And he has a soft spot for someone who pleads with him.

61
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,560
Mr. Sun!

62
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,040
Mr. Sun.

63
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,560
I apologize

64
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,720
for my earlier behav…

65
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,000
Look, Tod.

66
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,240
Don’t mention it.

67
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,760
I don’t really mind about it

68
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,400
I understand you.

69
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,120
You were like that because you love the company

70
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,360
I’m like you

71
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,760
Thank you.

72
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,920
We are one team, right?

73
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,760
Okay

74
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,400
Let’s get inside

75
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,000
Sawasdee krap.

76
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,120
Are you the guests Khun Kerkkrai is expecting?

77
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,400
Yes, my name is Arthit.

78
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,720
And this is Thanaphat.

79
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,840
We are from the Procurement department of Ocean Electric

80
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,880
Please come this way. He is waiting for you at the back.

81
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,800
Please come inside.

82
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:14,960
Excuse me.

83
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,640
Your guests are here, sir

84
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,600
Sawasdee krap, Khun Kerkkrai.

85
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,400
Sawasdee krap.

86
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,640
We meet again, Khun Arthit

87
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,760
Please have a seat.

88
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,720
What can I do for you today?

89
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,920
Uh…we are sorry to bother you.

90
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,840
But first, let me introduce this person.

91
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,840
This is Thanapat

92
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,960
My name is Thanapat Kengpaisarnpanich

93
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,560
I’m the man in charge of this project.

94
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,240
I would like to say Thank you again for helping us out

95
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,840
It’s okay.

96
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,680
Please let me see the details.

97
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,240
The problem is the quality of the plastic frame we use.

98
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,680
By the way,

99
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:11,880
the purchasing order and contract will be sent to you again tomorrow morning.

100
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,000
It’s all right, Khun Arthit.

101
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,240
In the morning, I’ll ask the production to start producing this order right away.

102
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
And I’ll go to your office in the afternoon

103
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,120
to sign the contract.

104
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,880
Well then, we should leave now.

105
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,000
Thank you so much, Khun Kerkkrai.

106
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,800
You’re welcome.

107
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,400
Please.

108
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,440
Please come this way.

109
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,240
Khun Arthit

110
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
Yes?

111
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,920
You all are earnest and hard working

112
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,440
Please hang in there

113
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,360
Thank you

114
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
Hold on, P’Arthit.

115
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,840
When you talk to Khun Kerkkrai, please be nice.

116
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,720
He likes a hard-working person.

117
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,480
And he has a soft spot for someone who pleads with him.

118
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,440
Thank you so much, Tod

119
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,160
It’s my pleasure.

120
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,120
We are one team, right?

121
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,360
Go have a rest.

122
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,120
Okay,

123
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,560
drive safely.

124
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Hello, Kongpob.

125
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,440
Hello, P’Arthit.

126
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,400
Have you woken up yet?

127
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,640
I have left

128
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,520
Really?

129
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,960
About yesterday…

130
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,080
Look, I need to take a motorcycle taxi now.

131
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,040
Talk to you later.

132
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,240
To Ocean Electric, please.

133
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,520
Check this out.

134
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,600
P’Chai from the Production department

135
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,840
He has such a hot body. Look

136
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,440
So what?

137
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,400
Check this out too.

138
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
I bet it’s the good one yet.

139
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,280
P’Danai from the Procurement department

140
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,640
Look.

141
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,920
Look at his tummy.

142
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,560
I’m fully awake now.

143
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,080
Hey, Durian.

144
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,280
Why do you show me P’Danai’s photo?

145
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,800
You look so sleepy, aren’t you?

146
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,800
I want to wake you guys up.

147
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,440
By the way,

148
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,760
this year’s company outing is really fun, don’t you think?

149
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,560
So much fun.

150
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,720
I and Som-O had to solve the problem all night.

151
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,840
We barely slept last night.

152
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,640
Really?

153
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,960
How is it going now?

154
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,480
It should be okay.

155
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,040
Well, I should go.

156
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,080
P’Danai may need me to do something

157
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
I go too

158
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,440
Hey, both of you?

159
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,960
Come back and talk to me.

160
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
P’Arthit krap.

161
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,600
P’Yong wants me to hand you this document.

162
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,560
Thank you very much

163
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,680
And here are Chinese doughnuts.

164
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,040
I bought them for you.

165
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,040
I put them here.

166
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,840
Kongpob, go back to your work now.

167
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,320
Kongpob,

168
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,440
may I see the report from the Production department?

169
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
Here you are.

170
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,840
Thank you, bro.

171
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,840
You’re welcome

172
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,520
I go back to my work now.

173
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,600
P’Yong krap

174
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,400
I have delivered the document for you.

175
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,120
Thank you

176
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,000
Well then, may I go to help P’Cherry?

177
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,440
P’Cherry?

178
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,200
Yes.

179
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,680
I go with you.

180
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,680
I want to see him now

181
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,880
Let’s go.

182
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
How is it going, Cherry?

183
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,320
I think it should be working well now.

184
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,240
But let the QC department check it again.

185
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,640
I can take it to the QC office.

186
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,600
It’s all right.

187
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,000
I can take it here myself

188
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,520
Why do you have to do this yourself?

189
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,240
Well,

190
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,000
I’m feeling drowsy.

191
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,920
I should walk.

192
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,360
Is this the one?

193
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
P’Somrak krap.

194
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,440
Hi, Yong

195
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,800
Is this the griller that has been fixed?

196
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,560
Yes.

197
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,440
Cherry has run an initial check.

198
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,600
But we want you to check again.

199
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,240
I see.

200
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,400
Well, you must be really tired from last night.

201
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,240
He told me

202
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,000
you stayed up all night to fix them up.

203
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:43,960
Yes.

204
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,000
But it’s not much.

205
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,440
Everybody helped.

206
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,000
Nai and Kongpob also stayed and helped us

207
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,960
So we completed it faster.

208
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,960
Good. Good

209
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,600
The interns we have this time are really pro-active

210
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,960
I want to ask Durian

211
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,880
to ask these kids if they want to work here after they graduate

212
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,120
Yes.

213
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,360
I also thought about this too.

214
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,160
Let them decide when the time comes.

215
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
Thank you very much.

216
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,640
See you around.

217
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,480
See you.

218
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
Here you are.

219
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,640
I really appreciate your help on this, Khun Kerkkrai.

220
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,560
If there’s any problem

221
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,440
please let me know.

222
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
I’m glad to work with you all.

223
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,640
Sawasdee krap.

224
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,400
Sawasdee krap.

225
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,000
I would like to officially thank you once again

226
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:21,680
You’re welcome.

227
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,720
I just do what I can.

228
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,800
Please accept my apologies on behalf of my nephew

229
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,160
He has put you out on this matter.

230
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,080
No, don’t put it like that.

231
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,360
We have been a good partnership.

232
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,640
Another thing is…

233
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,480
my son is currently doing an internship here at your company.

234
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,480
Your son?

235
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,560
Yes, Khun Kerkkrai’s son is an intern here.

236
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,880
His name is Kongpob.

237
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,560
May I ask where he is working now?

238
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,680
He’s in the Production department.

239
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:55,600
If you don’t mind,

240
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,920
can I go see him now?

241
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,120
Of course. We don’t mind at all.

242
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,640
Let me walk you there.

243
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,800
You don’t need to.

244
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,120
I can go there with Khun Arthit.

245
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,280
Uh…

246
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,560
Now I know!!!

247
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,080
I know how Kongpob could save our company

248
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,480
Did he borrow money from a loan shark to save our skin?

249
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,840
No

250
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,960
Is he dating the CEO of Siam Polimer?

251
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,480
Are you crazy?

252
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,120
He’s not dating the CEO. He is his son

253
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,000
Nong Kongpob is Khun Kerkkrai’s son?

254
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,440
Yes.

255
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,360
Damn! If I had known, I would come on to him from the first day

256
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,880
I might have hit the jackpot

257
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,560
You don’t stand a chance.

258
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,880
He’s already seeing someone.

259
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,360
How do you know?

260
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,360
Watch it yourself.

261
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,160
How long have you been working here?

262
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,960
Almost a year now.

263
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,840
So you are a new grad.

264
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,880
Where did you study?

265
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,760
I graduated from SSU.

266
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,960
My son also studies there.

267
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,760
What faculty?

268
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,800
Engineering, sir.

269
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,000
Really?

270
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,960
My son is also studying engineering.

271
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Did you meet him when you studied there?

272
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,000
Yes.

273
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,520
I met him when I was there

274
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,640
Do you like that?

275
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,600
I mean what you studied that made you work here

276
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,840
Yes, I do.

277
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,320
Thank you very much

278
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,880
for walking me to here.

279
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,640
It’s my pleasure.

280
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,360
Would you believe me if I tell you that he is a stubborn son?

281
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,320
How?

282
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,920
The truth is

283
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,960
I wanted him to complete the internship under my company.

284
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,880
But he insisted that he wouldn’t do the internship there

285
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,200
So I sent him to this company.

286
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,200
After I see him here,

287
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,960
I think he has grown up a lot.

288
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,720
If he works at my company,

289
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,040
he may not work as hard as he does here

290
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,320
Have you worked with him?

291
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,160
With me?

292
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,320
Yes, when he was assigned to work in your department

293
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,760
I want to know how he was doing

294
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,160
He was doing quite well.

295
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,120
He worked very hard

296
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,160
And he was a big help to us.

297
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,040
Wait a minute.

298
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,600
Don’t you want to go inside and meet him?

299
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,120
I’d rather not.

300
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,560
I don’t want to interrupt his work

301
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,400
Thank you so much.

302
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,160
Please take care of him for me.

303
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,920
Yes.

304
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,440
One pink milk, please.

305
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Make it two.

306
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,760
Two, right?

307
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,880
You know? I’m super shocked…

308
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,440
when Khun Kerkkrai said

309
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,680
Nong Kong was his son.

310
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,360
Why haven’t you told me before?

311
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,600
actually I just knew this yesterday

312
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,960
Really?

313
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,560
He never told me.

314
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,120
And I never asked.

315
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,480
Your drinks are ready

316
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,040
Here you are.

317
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,960
Hey, Earth. Arthit.

318
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,640
Would you like to sit with us?

319
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Sure.

320
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,200
Pink milk, again?

321
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,160
How is it going in the Production department?

322
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,640
Busy as hell

323
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,200
We are speeding up the production process

324
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
Hey, Nong Kong.

325
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,520
I never knew that you are Khun Kerkkrai’s son.

326
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,920
I don’t really want to tell anyone about that.

327
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,200
Anyway, I’m really thankful to you

328
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,880
for asking your father to help us.

329
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,160
I only want to do what I can do.

330
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,560
Do you want anything else, P’Arthit.

331
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,520
No.

332
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:41,520
Kongpob, can you get me an Americano?

333
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,880
Thanks. Please also get what you like to drink.

334
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,280
Okay

335
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,160
P’Yong krap,

336
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:54,280
where is P’Cherry?

337
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,880
He told me he was going to have lunch with Khun Somchai

338
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,440
Khun Somchai from the Design department?

339
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,640
Yes, Somchai who is an older brother of Somrak.

340
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,520
Ni Hao.

341
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,960
♬ Da cuo te cuo bu yao lai wu ru wo de mei. ♬

342
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,560
You guys are quiet.

343
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,120
You must be too young to know this song.

344
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,640
I’m sorry, though.

345
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,720
My flight got delayed

346
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,520
so I could only come to work now.

347
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,520
Look.

348
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,560
I brought these snacks from China for you all.

349
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,400
And you are the first to have as always, Som-O.

350
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,120
You want to have it?

351
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,560
Look, dear.

352
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,240
This brand is really popular.

353
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,520
I let you have two packs since you are my favorite

354
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,160
No, thanks.

355
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,520
P’John ka.

356
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,320
P’Danai wants to see you.

357
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,240
Are you kidding me?

358
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,120
I’m not.

359
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,120
Here.

360
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,480
My souvenirs for you.

361
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,880
This brand is really delicious.

362
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,760
Thanks.

363
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,200
John,

364
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,320
do you know…

365
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,280
while you were away

366
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,360
there was a problem

367
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,960
that could cause a serious damage to our company?

368
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,040
Really?

369
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,600
I don’t know about it.

370
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,040
The city I went has poor signal.

371
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,280
John, give it to me straight.

372
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,760
You swapped the purchasing orders, didn’t you?

373
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,520
Why did you say that?

374
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,160
Just know that I’ve found it out.

375
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,680
And now the Accounting department is chasing after the documents from you

376
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,320
You have been suspended from work.

377
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:01,200
The legal team will contact you again

378
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,040
P’Danai, krap.

379
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,160
I have been working here for a long time

380
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,600
You should know me well.

381
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,480
Because I know you well,

382
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,680
something like this happened!

383
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,440
Just go home today.

384
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,600
Som-O,

385
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,040
I have informed the Legal team

386
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,600
that you also involved and caused damages to the company

387
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,320
I understand, P’Danai.

388
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,360
You know what?

389
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,960
The company won’t press charges against you

390
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,440
because you confessed to your wrongdoing

391
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,480
and gave useful information

392
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,840
that could lead to the culprit.

393
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
But…

394
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,880
you will not be eligible to receive the bonus

395
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,680
and your salary will be cut by 15%

396
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,680
for 6 months.

397
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,920
I got it.

398
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:24,360
Anyway, I must apologize to you again.

399
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,000
It’s okay.

400
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,760
Sawasdee ka, Khun Winai.

401
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:56,440
We would like you to assess the price of our products

402
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,120
Yes.

403
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,480
Unknown

404
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,480
Please hold on the line. Just a moment.

405
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,720
Hello, yes?

406
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,560
Okay

407
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,080
Are you here already?

408
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,400
Okay, I ask someone to get it right now

409
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,240
Please wait a moment.

410
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,760
Arthit

411
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,560
Yes?

412
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,160
Are you busy?

413
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,160
No

414
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,600
There’s a messenger waiting downstairs.What’s the matter?

415
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,080
There’s a messenger waiting downstairs.

416
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,120
Can you go there and get the document for me

417
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,480
Sure.

418
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,880
He’s in the front of the building

419
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,560
Okay, Khun Winai.

420
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,200
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

421
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,840
Yes, I need you to assess the price.

422
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,600
And is it worth to pay for it?

423
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,600
Yes. Yes.

424
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,720
Yes, there are many of things we need the price assessment.

425
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,080
Uh, Khun Winai

426
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,040
Please hold on the line again. Sorry

427
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Are you okay, P’Arthit?

428
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,960
I’m sorry.

429
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,320
If you are mad at me because I asked my father to help us

430
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,800
It was not my intention to keep it from you

431
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,280
I just wanted to help you

432
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,480
P’Arthit.

433
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,200
P’Arthit krap.

434
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,000
P’Arthit.

435
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,760
P’Arthit krap!

Padung Smajarn / Pongpisit Botsri

437
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,280
Hey, P’Arthit.

438
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,320
Don’t you have a job interview today?

439
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,040
Well, I have to get my transcript.

440
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,760
And I need to print my resume again.

441
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,160
The previous one has an error

442
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,640
I see

443
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,320
You have a class to attend, right?

444
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,520
The afternoon class got cancelled.

445
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,040
My next class is in the evening

446
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,720
Do you need a ride?

447
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,040
It’s okay. I’m good.

448
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,680
You should rather spend this time on studying

449
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,840
And hang out with your friends too.

450
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,560
They might think you are too clingy to me

451
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,280
I only want to take care of the man I love

452
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,800
If there is something I could do, I’m happy to do it

453
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,360
How about this?

454
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,880
If you want to help me,

455
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,000
you can help me rehearse for the interview.

456
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,840
So I have more confident to do it.

457
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,800
Shall we start?

458
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,600
Tell me about yourself.

459
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,960
My name is Arthit Rojanapat.

460
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,280
I graduated in engineering,

461
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,040
major in industrial engineering from SSU

462
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,800
You used to be a head hazer too?

463
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,720
Yes,

464
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,920
when I was in college,

465
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,560
I like to work, study and also do activities

466
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:47,080
Do you think doing activities has benefits to your career?

467
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,760
Yes, it has.

468
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,360
I believe that…

469
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,000
it taught me how to work

470
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,680
to have patient

471
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,840
to work under pressure

472
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,520
and to adapt myself to be with other people.

473
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,280
Khun Arthit krap.

474
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
Yes?

475
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,880
Are you seeing someone?

476
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,120
Don’t mess around.

477
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,520
I don’t.

478
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,880
Usually, people are asked about this in an interview

479
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,040
Are you single?

480
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,760
Are you seeing someone?

481
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,920
So, are you dating someone now?

482
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,800
I…

483
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,760
I’m dating someone.

484
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
Really?

485
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,400
Is your date cute?

486
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,760
I should go now.

487
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,520
Come on, P’Arthit.

488
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,080
I’m just joking.

489
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,440
Wait for me, P’Arthit.

490
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,840
What now?

491
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,200
Let me walk you to the taxi

492
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,240
Suit yourself.

493
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,040
Wait a minute, P’Arthit.

494
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,240
You haven’t answered me yet.

495
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,600
I want to know

496
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,320
if your date is cute.

I just wanted to help you.” - Kongpob

498
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,960
It’s always me who has been running after you all this time…

499
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,040
What am I supposed to be to you?

500
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,600
Your lover…

501
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,880
a junior

502
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,880
or just an acquaintance?

503
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,720
P’Arthit krap,

504
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,560
Do you still want me to walk by your side…

505
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,160
or want me to stop right here?
