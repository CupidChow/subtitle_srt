1
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,840
It’s always me who has been running after you all this time…

2
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,280
What am I supposed to be to you?

3
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,080
If you can’t answer this to yourself,

4
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,400
Let me return this gear to you for now.

5
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,760
Lastly,

6
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,000
I would like to say…

7
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,040
Nong Arthit ka.

8
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,720
Kongpob and I

9
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,760
are dating.

10
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,760
Nai.

11
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,720
When I saw those pictures

12
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,960
I didn’t believe it.

13
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,080
I thought they are joking.

14
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,520
No joking now, they came out to the public.

15
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,760
My taxi is here.

16
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,240
I have to go now.

17
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,120
Good luck, P’Yong.

18
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,520
Thank you for the good experiences.

19
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,160
Hey,

20
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,520
are you still here?

21
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,200
I’m about to leave.

22
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,120
Where did you park?

23
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,440
Well, I parked at the back of the building

24
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,600
Let me walk you there.

25
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,560
I have to prepare the yearly report soon

26
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,520
You are always busy.

27
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
Yes.

28
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I wonder why everyone else looks so chilled.

29
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,320
Where did you park?

30
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,080
I parked at the front of the building.

31
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Really?

32
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,800
I thought you parked here too

33
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,160
You had to walk this far.

34
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,880
Okay, see you later.

35
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,120
Thank you.

36
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,600
Thank you for walking me here

37
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,000
Drive safely.

38
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,080
I’m not staying in the same dorm as yours anymore

39
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,480
Why are you still following me?

40
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
What makes you think I’m following you

41
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,360
I want to walk along with you

42
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,720
Kongpob and I…

43
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,520
are dating.

44
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,440
Many people had various comments on those pictures of me and Kongpob.

45
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,880
I admit that

46
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,680
before this, I feared

47
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,120
so I rejected my own feelings.

48
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,200
I feared…

49
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,960
that everyone would look at me strangely

50
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,200
Unknowingly,

51
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,560
the fear I had

52
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,880
has hurt the feeling of the person I love.

53
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,240
But now I have no fear.

54
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,200
I have the courage to stand up here,

55
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,840
to be in front of everyone

56
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,480
and I have the courage to say

57
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,320
I love Kongpob.

58
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,600
Smile for me.

59
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
Kongpob.

60
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,920
Why do you take my picture?

61
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,120
Give me your phone.

62
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,760
Are you checking my phone?

63
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,720
What are you talking about?

64
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,840
Give me your hand.

65
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
This side.

66
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
What?

67
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,160
What are you looking at?

68
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,920
Here, take it back.

69
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,400
Whenever you look at your phone,

70
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,400
you see the picture I took.

71
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,640
You are this lovely to me…

72
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,840
Do you want anything from me specially?

73
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,240
I don’t want anything.

74
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Let’s go.

75
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,160
You look tired today.

76
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,160
Yeah.

77
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,160
It’s my last day as an intern

78
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,680
I had so many things to take care of.

79
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,720
Do you want me to carry that for you?

80
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,280
It’s heavy.

81
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,560
Are you sure you can carry it?

82
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,840
You are tiny.

83
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,960
P’Tew!

84
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,200
I’m kidding.

85
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,800
Would you like to have it?

86
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,960
I don’t think you should. It’s really heavy

87
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,800
By the way, what time do you have to visit

88
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,080
The same time as before.

89
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,080
You have completed your internship

90
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,880
So, you don’t have to…

91
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,920
Isn’t it great.

92
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,000
Now I can take you to visit your grandmother every day

93
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
Yes.

94
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,760
So, do you want me to help?

95
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,520
Yes, please.

96
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
Hey, listen.

97
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,240
Do you want to go see the third-year students hazing the freshmen?

98
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,560
Sawasdee, you guys.

99
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,800
Sweetie, look.

100
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,120
Day can get along with other students.

101
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,000
Wow, you are right.

102
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,000
I never saw him walking with friends before

103
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,360
Well, Tew.

104
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,320
Did you get to talk to him?

105
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,320
Well…

106
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,640
Well what?

107
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,640
He did.

108
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,080
Everyone, look at this.

109
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,760
I ordered Minced Pork Basil, right?

110
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,520
But I also got carrots, long beans

111
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,640
and baby corns.

112
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,400
I can’t believe this. It’s like Veggies Basil

113
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,440
You can have this omelet

114
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
Prae, you don’t order food?

115
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,560
Nah. I have already eaten.

116
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,960
Can I try it?

117
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,160
You geek

118
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,840
How could you be so greedy?

119
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,720
You have food in front of you here.

120
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,960
I just want to try it.

121
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,040
Give it back to Prae.

122
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,640
This reminds me of when we are first years

123
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,200
Um.

124
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,320
Look,

125
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,480
It’s been 4 months since we get together like this.

126
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,120
How was your internship experience?

127
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,160
It was okay for me.

128
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,160
But there was one guy in the office that always asked me to do things for him

129
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,600
I still learned so many things from there, though

130
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,200
Mine was easy and chilled.

131
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,160
I got to send faxes.

132
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,440
Wait, do they still send fax nowadays.

133
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,960
They do.

134
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,200
Mine was really great.

135
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,960
Why?

136
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,720
There was a young intern who is so cute

137
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:46,760
A male intern?

138
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,720
Sure is!

139
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,240
I was so happy during the past 4 months there

140
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,520
How about you two?

141
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,640
Well, not bad.

142
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,320
No matter where we went to.

143
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,800
Because you were together, right?

144
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,600
Hey, Kong.

145
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,920
How was your internship?

146
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,760
Sorry,

147
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,120
it’s a secret.

148
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,960
Look at his face. It’s all red.

149
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,880
You realize that there are CCTV cameras everywhere, right?

150
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,800
A secret or a love matter

151
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,280
Bonus, this is Durian.

152
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,480
Sawasdee, Bonus

153
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,400
Do you want to have a wife?

154
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,400
Wait a minute.

155
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,200
No?

156
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,120
Bye-bye, Bonus

157
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
See you.

158
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,760
Hi, P’Durian. Sawasdee krap.

159
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,800
Sawasdee ja.

160
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,720
Is everything okay? You come all the way here

161
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,280
Well,

162
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,240
I don’t have the chance to speak to you

163
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,040
about Nong Kongpob.

164
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,560
Well I…

165
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,640
P’Durian krap.

166
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,200
Please forget about it.

167
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,720
I’m not taking it personally.

168
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,440
Thank you, Arthit.

169
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,320
Tod.

170
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,680
Here.

171
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,080
The list of suppliers.

172
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,760
Thank you.

173
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,080
Wait, Mr. Sun.

174
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,280
Yesterday,

175
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,680
you were amazing.

176
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,760
Nai.

177
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,920
Hi, P’Yong.

178
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,080
May I sit with you?

179
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
Why are you eating alone today?

180
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,840
Where’s P’Cherry?

181
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,520
What about you?

182
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,480
Why are you here alone?

183
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,800
Where are Earth and Tod?

184
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,840
they want to eat outside.

185
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,200
What about Kongpob?

186
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,800
How is he doing?

187
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,960
He’s finding a topic for his Special Problem Research

188
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,440
And you?

189
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,840
How are you doing?

190
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,560
Me?

191
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,960
I’m fine.

192
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,000
Is everything all right?

193
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,360
You seem to have many questions today.

194
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,080
Did I ask too many questions?

195
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,240
Well, more than usual.

196
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,000
Is everything okay?

197
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
Yes.

198
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,880
Our company is doing a new project.

199
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,680
But this is the product we have never made before.

200
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,080
So, we may have to work harder

201
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,560
May I as what project it is about?

202
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,240
It’s a solar power griller.

203
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,000
What?

204
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,760
Really?

205
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,960
It sounds hard already by the name of it

206
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,280
Yes.

207
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,560
And the executive board members are really interested in this project

208
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,280
Do you know

209
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,920
what is the hardest part of this project?

210
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,840
It is that we don’t know any suppliers

211
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,400
And the specifications of solar cells

212
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,840
we never have them before.

213
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,920
So I rely on you all to do some research

214
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,760
Don’t worry, P’Danai.

215
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,200
If we work together,

216
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,920
we can finish it in a short time

217
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,360
Yes

218
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,000
All right.

219
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,440
I leave it all to you.

220
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,360
Khun Earth,

221
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,040
please stay. I need to discuss something.

222
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,080
Yes

223
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,280
Well,

224
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,360
My son is coming to the office.

225
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,920
He’s a second-year student.

226
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,400
He wants to learn some work before he graduates.

227
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,200
So I want you to help guide him some tasks to do.

228
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,640
No problem.

229
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,480
There he is

230
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,960
Come in, son.

231
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,440
This is my son

232
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,280
His name is Day.

233
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,240
Say hi to P’Earth, P’Tod, P’Som-O and P’Arthit

234
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,120
Sawasdee krap, Khun Earth

235
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,000
Khun Tod

236
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,880
Khun Som-O

237
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,720
and Khun Arthit.

238
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,040
You address us so polite and formal

239
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,760
It’s his nature to talk like that.

240
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,040
Good, I don’t have to feel so old when someone calls me P’.

241
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,320
it sounds nice too addressing people like that

242
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,920
I believe that everyone is equal, Khung Tod

243
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,160
He is truly your son.

244
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,240
He’s different.

245
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:35,920
Okay.

246
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,920
I leave him to you, Earth.

247
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,520
Sawasdee krap

248
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,960
Tod, have a seat

249
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,360
I call you here

250
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,800
as we have more work in the company.

251
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,040
So I think of adding more head counts in the Production department

252
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,480
Do you still want to work in the Production department

253
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,720
like you wished to do in the beginning?

254
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,160
No, I’d rather not.

255
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,960
I need to learn more in the Procurement department for now

256
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,040
Okay. I let you do what you want to do.

257
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,120
Uncle Piroj.

258
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,400
I think there’s someone who is a good fit for this position.

259
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Excuse me.

260
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,440
Come in.

261
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,320
The executive board member has notified me

262
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,200
that there’s an open position in the Production department

263
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,240
If you want to work in the Production department like your original intention

264
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,920
You can do it now.

265
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,680
Uh…

266
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,080
I want to keep working here.

267
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,600
P’John has just left.

268
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,120
I think we should have a new staff first

269
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,720
Thanks a lot.

270
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,320
Irasshaimase. Shabushi sawasdee ka.

271
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,600
This way, please.

272
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,840
One person, right?

273
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,440
What type of soup would you like?

274
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,280
Clear, thick soup or Tomyum soup?

275
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,120
A clear soup please.

276
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,760
The beverage is right there

277
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,960
and there are fried menus available in the front counter

278
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,320
Please let us know if you need anything else.

279
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,040
It’s a big match tonight.

280
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,440
Chelsea vs. Liverpool.

281
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,360
Are you going to watch it?

282
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,200
Whose favorite team loses the match,

283
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,360
that person must pay for a meal.

284
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,080
Deal?

285
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,480
Deal.

286
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,080
We’ll see.

287
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,560
Nai.

288
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,200
Sorry, the number you are calling…

289
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,560
P’Earth krap.

290
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,480
I have a drink for you.

291
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,720
I walked pass the beverage stall so I bought it.

292
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,640
I just walked pass the beverage stall too.

293
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,840
Okay

294
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,320
Here you go.

295
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,680
Thank you.

296
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,040
We will be full by these.

297
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,960
We have two of this.

298
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,520
Put it on my desk, Cherry.

299
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,200
I’ll sign it later.

300
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,480
I have been looking for you.

301
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,080
Where have you been?

302
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,600
I’m here to get your signature for my document

303
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,840
Well, I have been to…

304
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,440
find something to eat.

305
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,560
You want me to sign your document?

306
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,920
Give it to me.

307
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,080
Here.

308
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,760
Thank you.

309
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,120
Now that you get the document

310
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,520
what’s your plan?

311
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,320
Well, I think I go home.

312
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,920
Can I give you a lift?

313
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,000
My home is in Chiangmai.

314
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
Well I’m taking off first.

315
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,560
Sawasdee krap.

316
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,560
See you, Tod.

317
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,480
P’Durian krap!

318
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,640
Nong Arthit?

319
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,440
What are you doing?

320
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,640
You scared the life out of me.

321
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,720
I’m here to get the document for Kongpob

322
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,160
Okay, give me a sec.

323
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,480
What’s the rush?

324
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,320
It’s a secret.

325
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,160
Always a secret.

326
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,800
Here you are.

327
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
Thank you

328
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,280
You’re welcome.

329
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,360
Seeing this reminds me of us in the first year

330
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
Yes.

331
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,080
Very much.

332
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,520
Hey, where are you going?

333
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,680
Watch them.

334
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,640
Though we are the fourth-year seniors.

335
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,640
They are our juniors.

336
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,080
It’s our duty to looking out for them.

337
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,160
Who wants to come with me?

338
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
Great.

339
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,560
No wonder why you were the head hazer

340
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,000
Let’s go.

341
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,720
No.

342
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,480
I have an appointment

343
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,880
See you later.

344
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,680
Ah, you are coming with me?

345
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,960
I know you want to.

346
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,600
May, come on.

347
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,840
Let’s get going, May.

348
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,560
Well, we are going to have dinner with May’s family.

349
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,320
See you later.

350
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,760
Really?

351
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,920
Okay, Maprang.

352
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,160
You are coming with me.

353
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,160
Let’s go.

354
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,200
Are you crazy?

355
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,360
We are not hazers anymore

356
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,000
You go there alone.

357
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,040
See you.

358
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,200
Prae, come with me.

359
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,080
Honey.

360
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,920
I have her answer.

361
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,120
Miss you so much.

362
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,440
All right, Tew

363
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
You are the only one left.

364
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,680
Let’s go.

365
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,160
So sorry.

366
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,720
I have a date.

367
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,080
I go with you next time.

368
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,320
See you.

369
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,760
You all are gone?

370
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,680
Fine!

371
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,440
Everyone,

372
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,160
raise your drink.

373
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,920
Cheers to the freedom of me.

374
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,920
Let me introduce

375
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,680
my girlfriend.

376
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,200
Her name is Tob.

377
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,400
Tob, nice to meet you.

378
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,240
Nice to meet you too.

379
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,560
Guys, I need to go now.

380
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,760
Wait.

381
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,480
I just got out of the military service.

382
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,320
Why are you rushing?

383
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,320
I really have to go.

384
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,880
Where are you going?

385
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,720
Tell us.

386
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,200
It’s a secret.

387
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,920
What secret?

388
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,800
You can look at his picture. I put it right here

389
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,280
Where’s the stuff I ordered?

390
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,320
Wonderful.

391
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,160
What did you just give him?

392
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,920
What is it?

393
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,000
It’s not ectasy!

394
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:39,720
I’m going.

395
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,760
Bye

396
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,640
Nice to meet you, Tob.

397
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,880
Let me help.

398
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,920
Water for you.

399
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,360
Thanks.

400
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,760
What about these snacks?

401
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,440
Do you want to put them here or on the front?

402
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,160
Let’s put them on the front.

403
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,840
The football match is about to start.

404
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,280
Trust me.

405
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,320
Liverpool will win tonight.

406
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
P’Yong.

407
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,240
Last time

408
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,120
you still owe me a meal.

409
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,040
If Liverpool loses again,

410
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,840
you will have to stay in Chiangmai and buy me

411
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,400
If Liverpool wins,

412
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,720
we are even.

413
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,200
No, we are not.

414
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,600
We both owe each other a meal.

415
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,600
You really want me to buy you a meal, Right?

416
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
Well,

417
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,240
you break the agreement of a meal bet.

418
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,760
I don’t even ask for penalty fee of that yet.

419
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,840
You want to charge me the penalty fee too?

420
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,480
How can you be so bloody canny?

421
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,960
You don’t have to pay for the fare.

422
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,080
You don’t have to pay for the fuel even.

423
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,760
Also these snacks.

424
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,480
Well, I take you to a good place of Khao Soi in Chiangmai then

425
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,760
Okay?

426
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,080
Fine.

427
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,040
I hope it’s good like you said

428
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,280
Khao Soi in Chiangmai is definitely good

429
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,480
Let’s go

430
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,640
You talk like you are the driver.

431
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,000
Please give us a sec

432
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,440
Kongpob.

433
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,120
Have I kept you waiting for so long?

434
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,360
No.

435
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,640
I have just got here

436
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,640
Why do you want to see me here?

437
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,720
I have something for you

438
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,000
Here.

439
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Thank you

440
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,840
for getting the internship certification for me

441
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,640
The thing I actually want to give you

442
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,040
is this

443
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,640
Excited, right?

444
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,160
From now on,

445
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,720
These gears don’t just represent us each anymore

446
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,120
Our hearts are now merged together in each of them

447
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,000
Kongpob,

448
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,560
I want to ask you one thing.

449
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,560
Are you ready for our future?

450
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,600
What about you, P’Arthit?

451
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,160
Are you ready for it?

452
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,920
The weather is hot, right?

453
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,880
Kongpob,

454
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,040
the pen you gave me,

455
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,760
the ink doesn’t come off.

456
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,360
I dipped it in the hot water

457
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,800
It’s still not working

458
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,320
Let me see

459
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,080
It’s impossible for the ink to come out.

460
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,120
The ink is empty.

461
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,560
Really?

462
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,040
It’s empty?

463
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,880
So you use it a lot.

464
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,320
Well, I make the most out of everything I use

465
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,080
Do you make the most out of me too?

466
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,280
Very funny.

467
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,040
Shall we go back now?

468
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,320
Can I enjoy the atmosphere here for a little longer?

469
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,880
Directed by
Padung Smajarn / Pongpisit Botsri

470
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,840
Sorry, P’Arthit.

471
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,280
It’s your day off.

472
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,600
But I bother you to help get my stuff

473
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,040
and take pictures in the campus.

474
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,200
It’s okay.

475
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,000
It’s been a while since I came back here.

476
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:20,360
But it still makes me feel the same.

477
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:23,040
It’s still the place I feel good

478
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,960
when I have you around. I guess.

479
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,280
I guess so.

480
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,240
Shall we go now?

481
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,960
We still have to get back here to get your stuff.

482
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,600
Okay.

483
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,080
♬ How good has this been ♬

484
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,800
♬ …that we love and care ♬

485
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,840
♬ and have been through many things together? ♬

486
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,240
♬ This is love ♬

487
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,680
♬ The love I do not expect anyone to understand ♬

488
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,520
♬ Just you and me ♬

489
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,560
Sorry.

490
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,000
Hi, P’Kongpob. P’Arthit.

491
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,120
Sawasdee krap.

492
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,440
want to join ?

493
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,160
It's okay.

494
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,400
We are here to take some pictures.

495
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,400
Hey, guys.

496
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,400
P’Kong has graduated.

497
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,720
Let’s take a picture with him.

498
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,480
Well,

499
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,600
excuse me, then.

500
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,480
Who are you looking for?

501
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,640
P’Arthit,

502
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,600
I’m sorry.

503
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,440
For what?

504
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,800
You just took a picture with them.

505
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,680
Here.

506
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,400
I have this ice cream for you.

507
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,600
2 flavors,

508
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,600
Chocolate or strawberry

509
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,800
Can I choose that flavor?

510
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,880
No?

511
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,680
I have Chocolate, then.

512
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,280
It’s good, right?

513
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,000
What are you doing?

514
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,280
Just stay still.

515
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,240
It’s sweet

516
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,920
and soft.

517
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,400
It’s just chocolate.

518
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,880
Not that sweet and soft

519
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,800
I mean...

520
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,720
your lips.

521
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,960
It’s so sweet that I almost melt.

522
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,720
Can I taste them?

523
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,960
What are you talking about?

524
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,880
Let’s go now.

525
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,320
You still have to get your stuff, don’t you?

526
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,720
Sorry, Kongpob.

527
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,440
Let me get them.

528
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,560
Hey, Kongpob.

529
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,280
Do you still keep these things?

530
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,000
I keep everything

531
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,720
They are all my memories of you and me

532
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,840
Always over the top.

533
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,600
Why?

534
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,880
You also keep my cards and gifts in your room

535
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,720
Finally.

536
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,120
What are you doing next?

537
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,360
I’m waiting to hear the result of my interview

538
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,560
But I’m not sure if I really want to go there yet

539
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,080
You have to promise me.

540
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,720
If you pass the interview,

541
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,200
you wouldn’t let this opportunity go.

542
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,320
Are you sure

543
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,280
that you can be alone.

544
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,280
Remember that time?

545
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,280
I went to Japan with my family 2 weeks

546
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,720
You were so lonely that you wanted me to stay over at your place

547
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,480
Don’t be ridiculous

548
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,200
It was you who asked for staying over

549
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,520
P’Arthit krap.

550
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,960
If you are lonely,

551
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,440
you can say it to me directly.

552
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,840
How about

553
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,520
we do something tonight

554
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,640
so you won’t get lonely?

555
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,160
Kongpob!

556
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,000
Pull this up.

557
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Wrong side.

558
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:06,040
“What makes you think I’m following you.
I want to walk along with you.” – Arthit
