1
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,440
On the last Saturday of this month,

2
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,360
we have the initiation activity

3
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,520
I’m sorry but I have to go to the office that day.

4
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,520
Behind me are the gear badges made for your year.

5
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,440
I want to be your boyfriend.

6
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,640
Can you take care of it for me?

7
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,840
But I have already had someone else’s gear in my care.

8
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,600
So where is…the reward you promise to give me?

9
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,680
That’s your reward.

10
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,400
Arthit,

11
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,200
I have an urgent task that needs your help

12
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,920
Can you check the price of transformer devices?

13
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,280
Please summarize them in a price list for me

14
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,240
Got it.

15
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,040
Let’s get going, Earth.

16
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,600
All set?

17
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,320
Yes.

18
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
Arthit,

19
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,880
Yes?

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,400
I have an important matter that needs your favor

21
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,920
Well, we have a trouble with one supplier

22
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,240
They suddenly cancel their supplies for us.

23
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,200
I want you to find a new supplier

24
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,160
that can manufacture the plastic spoons like this for me.

25
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,560
I can do that

26
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,080
but I need to complete Khun Danai’s assignment first.

27
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,880
Arthit,

28
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,480
this is very urgent matter.

29
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,560
Right now,

30
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,800
the Production Department has made the blenders

31
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,240
that are supposed to have this kind of spoons as freebies

32
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,360
If we fail to get a new supplier

33
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,360
we are going to have trouble with the Production Department

34
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,320
Okay.

35
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,400
I leave it to you

36
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,720
Hello, Sawasdee krap.

37
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,280
Yes,

38
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,520
is this Muang Man Plastic company?

39
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,120
I’m calling from Ocean Electrics.

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,640
It’s too late, right?

41
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,760
Arthit,

42
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,760
what are you doing?

43
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,000
I’m trying to find a manufacturer

44
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,880
that can make the plastic spoons like this.

45
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,120
Haven’t we ordered these spoons already?

46
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,040
Yes,

47
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,960
but P’John said the supplier we dealt

48
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,920
has just cancelled all of our orders.

49
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,720
Again?

50
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,840
Do you happen to know

51
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,600
who made the call and had these spoons made?

52
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:35,440
It’s Siam Polimer Group.

53
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,640
I think it should be Win

54
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,480
But we haven’t ordered from this company for quite some time

55
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,480
Get the contact number of Win

56
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,200
or the company number from Earth

57
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,520
Got it

58
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,520
Good luck.

59
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,880
What’s up, Arthit?

60
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,400
Aha?

61
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,720
Win?

62
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,160
I’ll find you his number.

63
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,240
What’s the matter, Earth?

64
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,880
Arthit is asking for Win’s number

65
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,920
He wants to get Siam Polimer Group’s contact

66
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,400
to produce plastic spoons for the blenders we are making.

67
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,360
What?

68
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,840
I signed off last week to John to make the order.

69
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,240
Why do we need to find a new manufacturer?

70
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,520
Let me find the contact number for Arthit.

71
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,600
"Win"

72
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,680
Sales Department, Siam Polimer Group.

73
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,360
Are you going to the office now?

74
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,080
I’m not going back there today.

75
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,120
I have an errand to run for my family.

76
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,680
If you don’t have anything to clear you can go home as well

77
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,040
If you get back to the office from here,

78
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,560
it would be around the end of business day anyway.

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,160
Okay ka.

80
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
How is it going, Arthit?

81
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,200
Any update?

82
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,040
I still cannot reach them

83
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,560
Well then, let’s go to their company now

84
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,960
I go with you.

85
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,080
If we drive, we should catch them before they getting off from work

86
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,160
Okay.

87
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,240
Let’s go.

88
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,400
Sawasdee ka.

89
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,880
What are you guys doing?

90
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,240
Oh, we are searching for a company to apply our internships.

91
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,560
You just finish your class?

92
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,560
Yes.

93
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,720
Do you happen to see Day?

94
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,320
The teacher is asking for him.

95
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,400
Oh, that young man?

96
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,160
We are here for a while.

97
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,400
We haven’t seen them.

98
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,400
Is he causing any trouble?

99
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,360
Not at all, P’Tew

100
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,360
He has been absent for days.

101
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,440
Well, since we got back from the off-campus initiation

102
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,320
We should leave you guys now.

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,240
Sawasdee ka

104
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,520
P’Yong,

105
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,480
I wonder why we don’t order supplies from Siam Polimer?

106
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,440
I don’t know either.

107
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,640
But in the past,

108
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,720
we ordered from them very often.

109
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,920
It could be that Win has left our company

110
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,800
and no one keeps contact with Siam Polimer

111
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,080
What kind of person P’Win is?

112
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,680
Win is a very talented person.

113
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,480
He’s the top performer of the Procurement Department

114
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,640
Come to think of it,

115
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,920
he’s like you.

116
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,560
Starting at the Production

117
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,400
and got transferred to the Procurement.

118
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,320
Earth didn’t tell you anything?

119
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,720
No.

120
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,600
Why?

121
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,720
Well, Earth and Win…

122
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Forget it.

123
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,840
We make a turn here and we are there

124
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,440
Wait a sec.

125
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,920
What’s up, Cherry?

126
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,320
P’Yong,

127
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,560
May I go in there first?

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,240
Sure, I’ll go there soon.

129
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,400
Look at the shelf.

130
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Sawasdee krap.

131
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,760
What can I do for you?

132
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,400
I’m here to see the Sales Department.

133
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,160
Have you made an appointment?

134
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,760
No, I haven’t.

135
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,280
I think you better come here again tomorrow in the morning

136
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,440
Right now,

137
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,960
all of the employees have left the office

138
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,960
Well, I’m so sorry.

139
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,960
This is very urgent.

140
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,360
Can you help check if there’s anyone can come and get my request?

141
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,400
I have to follow the rules here.

142
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,200
The business hours here are over.

143
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,800
I’m really sorry

144
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,160
Prayat.

145
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,600
Yes, sir?

146
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,920
What’s going on?

147
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,840
This young man said he wanted to meet someone in the Sales

148
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,080
I told him that we are closed for today

149
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,760
Let him in.

150
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,000
I can take his request.

151
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,600
Yes, sir.

152
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,760
This way, please.

153
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,800
Thank you so much.

154
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,920
The last minute order like this

155
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,360
has a very high cost of production than normal lead time.

156
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,560
Are you okay?

157
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,720
You haven’t come to class for many days.

158
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,000
This is my family matter.

159
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,800
I can handle it.

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,320
For this kind of problem,

161
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,160
you should not handle it alone.

162
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,560
You like to do things complicatedly

163
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,200
like the former guy who sat here

164
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,360
The owner of Bonus.

165
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
My name is Arthit

166
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,560
from Ocean Electrics.

167
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,080
What’s the urgent matter

168
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,840
you want the Sales Department here to help you with?

169
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,480
Well,

170
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,080
our company made an error in one of the supplies we had ordered

171
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,920
So I need to find a new supplier

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,120
that can manufacture this product with this specification

173
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,720
Look here, Khun Kerkkrai.

174
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,880
We need this product within this week.

175
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,960
I do understand that the short notice like this

176
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,880
means I may cut in the line of productions.

177
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,600
And interfere the production of your company.

178
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,720
Since I’m from the Procurement of my company

179
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,640
this is the problem I have to solve

180
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,520
it’s my responsibility.

181
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,440
Please help consider this request, Khun Kerkkrai

182
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
You know, right?

183
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,120
The last minute order like this

184
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,680
has a very high cost of production than normal lead time

185
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,320
Yes, I know.

186
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,720
I will give you the best price I can.

187
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
But you don’t have the power to make such decision

188
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,560
You can do what you just said, right?

189
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,200
I’ll do my best

190
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,360
Good.

191
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,000
I will authorize this line of production for you.

192
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,680
Thank you so much, Khun Kerkkrai.

193
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,040
Actually, my company has long been a supplier for your company.

194
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,840
But our contract was terminated.

195
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,520
In the past, there’s a guy from your company

196
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,160
come to our company every now and then.

197
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,720
Your name is Arthit, right?

198
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,080
Yes, sir.

199
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,680
Good, I haven’t seen a person who is as hardworking as you in a while

200
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:55,080
I help take care of this.

201
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,640
Thank you so much, Khun Kerkkrai.

202
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,200
Here’s for you.

203
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:04,200
Enough, M.

204
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,320
I normally don’t eat this much.

205
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,000
You will get fat.

206
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,960
Many make juniors like to come to you.

207
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,400
Eat a lot and get fat.

208
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,720
What are you talking about?

209
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,080
What are you having in your mind?

210
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,960
By the way, where did you apply for your internship?

211
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,120
I and Pray just submitted our application to Unit All

212
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,240
It’s the food industrial company.

213
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,880
Really? We have the same mind.

214
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,760
Are you kidding?

215
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,280
Have you submitted your application?

216
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,840
The teacher said this company gave our university 2 spots

217
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,800
If you haven’t submitted it, you must hurry or it’ll be too late

218
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,080
Hey, that’s Tew, right?

219
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,760
Focus on your study.

220
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,440
Don’t worry about your granny.

221
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,320
She’s under doctor’s care.

222
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
Day!

223
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,920
It’s a pity you didn’t go to the beach with us.

224
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,720
I was busy

225
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,760
Well, are you okay?

226
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,720
You haven’t come to class for many days.

227
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
I’m okay

228
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,920
Please excuse me.

229
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,120
Hey, Day.

230
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,080
Is there anything that is troubling your mind?

231
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,800
No, there is not.

232
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,280
Another thing is,

233
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
this is my family matter.

234
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,200
I can handle it.

235
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,800
Hey, Day.

236
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,760
I don’t know if you can handle it alone or not.

237
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,760
For this kind of problem,

238
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,320
you should not handle it alone

239
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
Hey,

240
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,120
why do you like to butt in my personal life?

241
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,720
Let me make it clear right here.

242
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,880
Stop messing with me

243
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,440
I want to be alone.

244
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,680
Hey.

245
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,520
M, don’t.

246
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,560
Don’t.

247
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,080
Why?

248
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,720
Leave them alone.

249
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,800
Mom.

250
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,680
I have to answer this call of my mother.

251
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,440
you are still here, Arthit?

252
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,440
Well, I just got back from the factory.

253
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,600
and I just completed with the plastic spoons case.

254
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,160
What about you, P’Earth?

255
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,160
Ah,

256
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
I come back here to get some document

257
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,240
I saw that the water in Bonus’ bowl is dirty so I changed.

258
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,640
I’m about to leave, though.

259
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,080
Do you want to come with me?

260
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,800
Nah,

261
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,360
I still haven’t done the transformer price list that Khun Danai assigned to me

262
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,760
You can go without me.

263
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,480
It’s okay

264
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,160
Let me help. It will be done faster

265
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,280
We can go home together

266
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,040
It’s pretty late

267
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,680
Yes.

268
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,200
How far have you done?

269
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,240
Well…

270
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,560
If I know the date, I’ll call and let you know again.

271
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,040
I have to go.

272
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,800
Lady first.

273
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,880
Hey, Kong.

274
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,000
I will walk May home first.

275
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,160
Are you sure you are okay?

276
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,200
I am.

277
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,320
Are you going now?

278
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,880
Yes.

279
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,680
What about the internship?

280
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,840
Don’t worry.

281
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,560
If I can’t find a place to do my internship,

282
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
I can do it with my family’s company.

283
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,880
That’s true.

284
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,000
Well then, I have to take off first.

285
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,080
See you around.

286
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,160
I forgot that he’s a rich kid.

287
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,240
I know, right?

288
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,680
He has many options.

289
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,400
Nong Kong, P’Tum wants to have dinner with all of his line mentors

290
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,960
Can you help me spread the invitations?

291
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,600
P’Earth,

292
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,160
your pen is not working again?

293
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,360
You can use mine here.

294
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,600
Are you done?

295
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,160
Clear your desk. I’ll drive you home.

296
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,960
P’Earth,

297
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,720
may I have the pen that is not working?

298
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,520
P’Earth,

299
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,720
try again

300
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,320
it should work now.

301
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,240
Why do you waste your time on this?

302
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,840
I told you if it’s not working

303
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,480
just throw it away.

304
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,680
But…

305
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,120
It’s a shame.

306
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,600
You like to do things complicatedly

307
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,640
like the former guy who sat here.

308
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,600
The former guy who sat here?

309
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
Well…

310
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,400
the owner of Bonus

311
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,800
His name is Win.

312
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
The guy you asked for his phone number earlier today

313
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,120
Ah, I see.

314
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,360
You are done, right?

315
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,920
Pack up your things.

316
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,960
I’ll give you a lift.

317
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,160
Here are yours.

318
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,320
You can go first.

319
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,200
I’ll be there in a sec.

320
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,000
What’s up?

321
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,800
Are you in your room yet?

322
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,600
I’m still at the office.

323
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,800
Woah.

324
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,520
Do you normally get home this everyday?

325
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,360
No.

326
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,240
There’s an urgent incident today.

327
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,240
So, I go home late today

328
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,880
You don’t have to worry.

329
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,440
Is everything all right?

330
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,920
P’Ple asked to have dinner among our line mentors at a shabu place

331
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,080
I will have to finish my work first and go there later.

332
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,080
Well, Kongpob.

333
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,840
I have to go now.

334
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,360
A senior colleague is asking me to go home together.

335
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,920
All right.

336
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,200
Bye.

337
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,920
In the file,

338
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,880
it’s a P.O. of the plastic spoons

339
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:35,680
which the previous supplier failed to make them within the agreed date.

340
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,600
So I found another supplier

341
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,360
and the price is even cheaper than the original supplier

342
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,800
This is very well prepared.

343
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,040
The price is cheaper too.

344
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,880
P’John,

345
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,040
for this matter,

346
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,960
I saw Arthit working on this file last night

347
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:58,080
I asked Arthit to check the quality of the manufacturer

348
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,480
Really?

349
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,240
Then, I guess I misunderstood it.

350
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,680
Please accept my apologies

351
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,840
All right.

352
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,960
I don’t care who did what

353
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,360
I consider this as a teamwork that we must help together

354
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,600
If the outcome is good,

355
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,720
then, I’m happy with it.

356
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yes.

357
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,160
All right, Arthit

358
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,880
Have you prepared the comparison info of the old transformers’ specifications

359
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,480
that our company has made?

360
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,240
It’s all done, sir.

361
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,320
Then, put it on the screen.

362
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,640
If everything is all right,

363
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,840
I’ll do the presentation to the executive board.

364
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,880
Well, this is the chart…

365
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,240
P’Piroj.

366
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,800
Are you in a meeting?

367
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,080
I’m sorry for interrupting you.

368
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,960
It’s okay, P’Piroj.

369
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,080
Please go ahead.

370
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:53,280
I once told you that I wanted my nephew to work in the Procurement Department

371
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,160
This is Tod, my nephew.

372
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,520
He has just got back from abroad

373
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,080
All right, everyone.

374
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,080
This is Tod. He will work with us from now on.

375
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,800
Sawasdee krap

376
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,120
I’m Tod, Tanaphat.

377
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,680
Nice to meet you all.

378
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,080
Please give me advice and guidances

379
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,240
Help take care of him, Khun Danai.

380
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,080
Oh,

381
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,600
I believe in your team.

382
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,720
Thank you, sir.

383
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,760
All right, Khun Tod

384
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,120
Let me officially welcome you to our Procurement team

385
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,400
Yes.

386
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,320
The price of the transformers you have calculated here are pretty cheap

387
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,160
But if we include the wages and the delivery fee

388
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,960
the price is as high as other manufacturers.

389
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,560
Well, this is an old product.

390
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,720
If the presentation gets the green light,

391
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,120
we will add more details later.

392
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,960
Sorry for being rude.

393
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,400
You are…

394
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,280
Arthit krap.

395
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,040
My name is Som-O.

396
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,240
I’m the secretary of…

397
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,240
All right. All right.

398
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
You can introduce yourself back at the department.

399
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,440
Thank you, sir.

400
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,080
Hey, Kong.

401
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,320
How is your internship application going?

402
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,640
I have submitted the application to many companies

403
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,240
What about you?

404
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:31,960
Any plan tonight?

405
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,640
I have to practice the interview with May

406
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,440
The internship interview.

407
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,000
Where are you going today?

408
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,320
I have to prepare too

409
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,480
I have to prepare myself to have dinner with my line mentors

410
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,360
Yeah, don’t be late. Be there on time.

411
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
Tew,

412
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,960
let’s get going.

413
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,320
Okay.

414
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,400
You look zoning out, man.

415
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,400
Nothing, I’m just thinking about something

416
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,640
P’On, Sawasdee krap.

417
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,160
Your class is next?

418
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,720
Yes.

419
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,520
Hey, Tew.

420
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,320
Try to bring your junior line mentor to see us.

421
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,440
All right, see you.

422
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,520
Sawasdee krap, P’Tum, P’Ple.

423
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,400
Sawasdee krap.

424
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,560
Hi, Lin.

425
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,600
Sit here.

426
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,720
Take a seat first.

427
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,200
Why are you late?

428
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,960
We are almost full

429
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,560
Where’s P’Arthit, by the way?

430
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,760
I thought you would be here together.

431
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,280
I was busy handling my internship applications

432
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,280
So I’m late.

433
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,240
And P’Arthit

434
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,080
I think he’s showing up soon.

435
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,080
P’Tum,

436
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,840
P’Fon is not here with you?

437
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,840
Well, Fon has to take care of our son at home

438
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,200
My son was crying so she could not come.

439
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,240
You mentioned about the internship.

440
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,880
Have you submitted the applications yet?

441
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,480
Well, I have submitted to many companies.

442
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,640
MCG just contacted back earlier.

443
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,080
This company is good.

444
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,320
I heard that the students who do the internship there

445
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,720
can get accepted to work there right away.

446
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,480
Yes

447
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,320
Take your shot.

448
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,800
That place is good.

449
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,480
Knock yourself out.

450
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,640
Before they are gone.

451
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,920
Yes, you are late

452
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,200
Sawasdee krap.

453
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,000
P’Arthit, Sawasdee ka.

454
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,280
Sorry, bro.

455
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,720
I just finished my work. So I’m late

456
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,920
It’s okay.

457
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,480
Well then, I go get more meat

458
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,920
Please eat a lot, P’Arthit.

459
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,920
Now that we are all here.

460
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,280
Let me say something to officially open this feast

461
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,000
First of all,

462
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,920
welcome all of new freshmen here.

463
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,960
And thank you so much for joining us here today

464
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,920
we are line mentors of 0062 and 0206

465
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,320
How about the seniors introduce themselves first?

466
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,840
So the juniors know who we are.

467
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,480
Hey, Lin.

468
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,680
Where have you submitted your internship applications?

469
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,200
Send my regard to P’Fon.

470
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,120
Sure.

471
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,520
I’ll tell her.

472
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,800
Take care, bro

473
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,840
Sawasdee krap

474
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,440
How are you going home?

475
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,880
Do you want to share a cab with me?

476
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,960
It’s okay.

477
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,360
I’m going to my own home today.

478
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,640
I have given my mother my word

479
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,880
I see.

480
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:10,880
By the way

481
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,880
how’s your internship going?

482
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,280
I submitted my applications to many companies

483
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,280
But MCG just called me this evening to get an interview.

484
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,160
That’s good.

485
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,640
So I…

486
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,600
don’t have to be worried.

487
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,240
Well, P’…

488
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,080
Hold on.

489
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,480
Yes, P’Earth?

490
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,320
Sure, I’ll send the details by email.

491
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,960
I’m out to eat.

492
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,080
I hurry and go back there.

493
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,160
Do you urgently need it?

494
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,440
P’Arthit,

495
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,000
(I’m going now.)

496
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,640
I’ll call you when I’m home.

497
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,680
(Okay)

498
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
Hello, yes?

499
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,880
Yes, and…

500
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,760
Sawasdee krap, mom.

501
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,080
You are home so late.

502
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,200
Have you eaten yet?

503
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,120
I have.

504
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,040
I had a dinner party with my line mentors.

505
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,080
So I’m here this late.

506
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,560
Has Dad gone to bed already?

507
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,640
How could I go to bed?

508
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,960
Your mother said you would come home today

509
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
So I was working while waiting for you.

510
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,320
I’m sorry.

511
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,360
I had a dinner party with my line mentors.

512
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,160
So I came here this late.

513
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,240
Look,

514
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,480
Your mother told me that you would be home today

515
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,680
and she prepared a lot of food for you since early in the morning

516
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,280
Oh my dear mom.

517
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,000
I’m so sorry.

518
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,760
Next time, I’ll make a call and let you know.

519
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,360
Okay.

520
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,200
You are home this late.

521
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,360
Did you actually just go out with your girlfriend?

522
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,080
What are you talking about?

523
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,120
I have only you, you know?

524
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,120
Look at him.

525
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,520
Is your school on a break yet?

526
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,200
It is.

527
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,000
But this break, I have to do an internship.

528
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,280
It’s time to do the internship now?

529
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
Yes, dad

530
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,120
You can be an intern here in our company

531
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,360
Take it as the chance to learn about our company.

532
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,960
But...

533
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,800
I want to be an intern somewhere else.

534
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,880
I can get to learn new things and apply them to our company.

535
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,800
Have you made your decision

536
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,720
where to do the internship?

537
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,640
I’m still choosing

538
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,040
But I have submitted my applications to many companies

539
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,280
Look,

540
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,200
the other day,

541
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,120
there’s a guy from Ocean Electrics.

542
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,320
He asked to get help from our company.

543
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,360
I found him to be a good guy

544
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,840
So I helped him

545
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,480
If you haven’t made the decision yet.

546
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,760
This company is a good place to do the internship

547
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,640
I consider it

548
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,880
Have you stored all of the food yet?

549
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,720
Don’t mention about it. I’m still mad.

550
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,440
Don’t be mad.

551
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,080
P’Arthit.

552
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,720
Hello, P’Arthit.

553
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,440
You are at your room now?

554
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,240
Yes.

555
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,640
I just got here

556
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,400
What about you?

557
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,320
Are you home yet?

558
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,240
I’m here for a while now.

559
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,080
What are you doing next?

560
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,440
I have to clear up my work further a bit.

561
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,680
You’re going to go to bed very late, then

562
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,480
Please hold on a sec, P’Arthit.

563
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,520
Are you going to bed yet?

564
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,440
Here’s a hot cocoa for you.

565
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,680
Thank you.

566
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,440
I just got a reply from a company about the internship

567
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,480
So you have to be up for it.

568
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,240
Yes.

569
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
For how long?

570
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,080
A while, I guess.

571
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,760
Don’t go to bed too late, son.

572
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,240
I know

573
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,600
I’m going, then.

574
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,680
Thank you.

575
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,320
Hello, P’Arthit.

576
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,880
P’Arthit krap.

577
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,280
Hello.

578
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,800
Hello.

579
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,520
Hey,

580
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,360
Mr. Sun.

581
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,800
Hey, Sawasdee krap, Khun Tod.

582
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,520
You can call me just Tod.

583
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,440
Okay.

584
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,520
Wait for me.

585
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,320
Sawasdee krap, P’Earth.

586
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,680
What’s the rush?

587
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,120
I have to talk to Khun Danai

588
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,160
He called for an urgent meeting.

589
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,640
He has to rush to the hospital.

590
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,960
I have to deliver this document too.

591
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,480
What document?

592
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,240
Do you want me to deliver it for you?

593
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,240
It’s for Khun Paga

594
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,240
I can deliver it to her

595
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,760
Do you know Khun Paga at the Accounting Department?

596
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,680
Mr. Son can accompany me, right?

597
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,040
Yes, I can.

598
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,280
Okay.

599
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,000
Then, I leave it to you. Thank you so much

600
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:07,800
No problem.

601
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,800
It’s all my pleasure

602
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,000
It’s all my pleasure too

603
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,000
What’s the matter?

604
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,480
Well, Khun Paga...we

605
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,520
have document to give it to you from the Procurement Dept

606
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,760
You are a new guy, right?

607
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,440
When you talk to a senior,

608
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,840
you must introduce who you are first.

609
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,000
It’s not that I want to be nitpicking about these manners.

610
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,600
Sawasdee krap.

611
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,640
I’m Tod, Thanaphat Kengpaisarnpanich.

612
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I’m from the Procurement Department.

613
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,240
It’s nice to meet you.

614
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,800
Hey, what are you doing?

615
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,560
What’s wrong with kids these days.

616
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,960
Who taught you to introduce yourself to a senior like that!!!

617
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,480
“Kentpaisarnpanich”

618
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,680
What relationship do you have with P’Piroj.

619
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,720
He’s my uncle.

620
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,040
You are his nephew.

621
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,840
How could you be like this?

622
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,200
How could you oversee anyone in the future?

623
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,560
Yes.

624
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,040
Put down the document

625
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,040
Put it here.

626
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,160
Please excuse us, Khun Paga

627
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,760
Mr. Son.

628
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,840
What did I do wrong in there?

629
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,320
I gave her a shakehand.

630
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,760
That’s common, right?

631
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,800
Guys.

632
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,520
There’s a new guy. His name is Nong Tod

633
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,840
He’s the nephew of Khun Piroj!!!!

634
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,320
SMH, I knew that already.

635
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,880
Som-O, you must get yourself close to him now

636
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,080
You could have a good future with him.

637
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,360
He is so gorgeous like a roman god.

638
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,560
Wait. Nong Tod, Sawasdee ka

639
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:15,320
My name is Som-O. I’m the secretary in this department

640
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,760
Do you understand Thai?

641
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,360
My name is P’Som-O like an orange O.

642
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
You mean “orange.”

643
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,080
Yes.

644
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,640
My seat is right here, Nong Tod.

645
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,080
And your seat is here.

646
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,800
Come to me if you need helps.

647
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,840
Got it.

648
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,720
Hey, Tod

649
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,680
I have assigns your tasks to Arthit.

650
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,600
You can check with him. He’s been here for 4 months now

651
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,120
Thank you, P’Danai.

652
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,640
Everyone, please take care of Tod.

653
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,440
If you have anything, just ask them.

654
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,200
Okay, right?

655
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,840
Hey, bro

656
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,880
Nice to meet you.

657
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,680
Nice to meet you too.

658
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,800
Here it is.

659
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,080
Microwaves….

660
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:10,880
so it’s today

661
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:11,520
in the afternoon

662
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,160
and again tomorrow.

663
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,840
I got it.

664
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,240
Arthit.

665
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,120
Yes?

666
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,400
Are you busy this afternoon?

667
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,520
This afternoon?

668
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,360
I have to key in some info into the system.

669
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,400
Here’s the thing

670
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,080
P’Danai wants me to review the quality of products from the supplier.

671
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,680
I will go today and again tomorrow.

672
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,560
I see that you came from the Production Department

673
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,560
So you can be helpful to this process.

674
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,240
I’m available tomorrow in the afternoon.

675
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,040
But today, I have to…

676
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,840
You can go with her.

677
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,160
You want me to put in all of this info, right?

678
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,440
Yes

679
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:49,840
Okay.

680
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Leave it to me.

681
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:52,920
Are you sure?

682
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,440
Yes, I’m sure.

683
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,120
Okay.

684
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,320
Well then,

685
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,400
I put in all info in the first file before I go with her.

686
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,480
Okay.

687
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,120
Okay.

688
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,840
Hello, Kongpob.

689
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,040
I can’t hear you.

690
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,400
I just finished an interview for my internship

691
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,640
Where are you?

692
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,560
Kongpob,

693
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,280
I’m out to review products in a factory

694
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,440
Let’s talk via Line Messenger.

695
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,040
What did you say earlier?

696
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,240
I just finished an interview for my internship

697
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,080
Are you free today?

698
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:41,800
I’m sorry.

699
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,680
It’s okay.

700
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,440
I didn’t look carefully either

701
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,040
I will get off my work late today.

702
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,760
I have to go to a factory in another area

703
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,880
What’s the matter?

704
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,800
Can I go with you tomorrow?

705
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,960
I want to see you when you are working

706
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,440
I can use it for my internship.

707
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,120
Here.

708
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,080
Kongpob,

709
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,200
how long have you been here?

710
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,040
I’m sorry.

711
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,680
I got back home very late last night

712
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,840
It’s okay.

713
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,440
I just got here too

714
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,320
P’Eart, Sawasdee krap.

715
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,080
I’m sorry.

716
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,080
Have I kept you waiting for me too long?

717
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,440
No, I just got here too.

718
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,160
Well, this is Kongpob.

719
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,080
The junior I told you that he wanted to see how we work

720
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,000
Sawasdee krap.

721
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,040
Sawasdee ja.

722
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,120
I’m P’Earth.

723
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,040
If you have questions, you can ask me

724
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,720
Thank you, P’Earth.

725
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,760
All right, then. Get in the car.

726
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,480
There are many places we have to visit today

727
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:17,200
What’s wrong with it?

728
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,800
I got a flat tire.

729
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,480
Do you need a hand?

730
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,840
Don’t worry.

731
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,880
I can bring it to the garage myself.

732
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,000
Don’t you have a class to attend?

733
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,360
I do.

734
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,800
Leave it here.

735
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,720
You can get it fixed later.

736
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,760
Go to your class now.

737
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,120
Okay.

738
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,320
Get on.

739
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,720
I’ll give you a ride.

740
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,120
Is it going to be okay if I ride the pillion?

741
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,960
Are you going to get on it now

742
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,840
or do you want to do the pushup first?

743
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,560
Are you ready?

744
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,120
Can I hold you?

745
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,480
Then, get off.

746
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,320
Thank you, P’Arthit.

747
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,960
Do you like to ride a bicycle?

748
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,880
Yes,

749
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,960
it doesn’t need fuel.

750
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,520
I can also get to exercise

751
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,560
Well then,

752
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,720
can I ride the pillion every now and then?

753
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,760
No.

754
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,120
Wait.

755
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,680
When does your class finish today?

756
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,480
4 p.m.

757
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,000
Okay,

758
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,760
I’ll give you a ride, then.

759
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,680
Now, go to your class.

760
00:40:52,640 --> 00:41:00,520
But I want to be an intern somewhere else.
I can get to learn new things
and apply them to our company.- Kongpob

761
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,200
You have slept?

762
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,040
Thank you.

763
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,240
Our company has accepted 2 interns.

764
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,760
You can call me Nai.

765
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,440
I’m from Chiangmai.

766
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,560
Hey, that’s Nong Kong.

767
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,440
You didn’t tell me that he would do the internship here

768
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,560
I couldn’t find the right time to tell you

769
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,160
Normally, we can talk about anything, right?
