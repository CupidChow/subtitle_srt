1
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,280
Young people these days may not be like you.

2
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,720
But there’s one guy who seems to be a loose cannon.

3
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,520
Let him be.

4
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,760
We can’t.

5
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,880
I’m your junior?

6
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,320
That doesn’t mean I have to do everything you tell me to.

7
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:20,920
Another thing is…

8
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,040
I never respect you as my senior anyway.

9
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,760
Leave me alone already.

10
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,960
Arthit picks up things very fast, you know?

11
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,320
It’s good to meet sales people.

12
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
Really?

13
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,520
Thank you so much, P’John.

14
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,600
No worries.

15
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,040
Ah, it’s almost the Flag Capturing Day, right?

16
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,200
Yes.

17
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,200
I want to see you take part in the flag capturing event with your friends

18
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,800
It’s not SOTUS.

19
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,160
How is it going over there?

20
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,200
I have found a red ball.

21
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,480
Not sure if it has a clue.

22
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Let’s see.

23
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,480
Everyone, we have got the red flag.

24
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,480
We had to run 2 rounds to chase for it for.

25
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,640
So exhausted.

26
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,960
Can any of you find more clues?

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,480
I’m now in the front of Building 15.

28
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,680
It looks like someone can retrieve another clue

29
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,000
You can come check it.

30
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,520
Good. Then, let’s meet in front of Building 15.

31
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,240
Come on, you guys

32
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,360
We have already been there, right?

33
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,080
How about this area?

34
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,160
I don’t think so.

35
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,880
Let’s go there later.

36
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,280
Let’s have a break now. I’m tired.

37
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,880
We’ve found only “S” and “E.”

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,760
What word can it be?

39
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,160
I think

40
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,200
if we can find another red box

41
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,520
we may be able to solve it.

42
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,440
Let’s get a move on.

43
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,200
Before we run out of time.

44
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,040
Come on. Let’s go.

45
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,440
Hey,

46
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,040
what are you doing?

47
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,080
And what’s in that bag?

48
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,480
Well,

49
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,440
a senior wants me to hand it to you

50
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,760
What is it?

51
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,520
Here.

52
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,960
We have been there.

53
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,240
Yeah, right?

54
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,120
Could it be over there?

55
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,000
Nong Som-O, my dear.

56
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,760
Yes?

57
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,520
I bought these snacks for you.

58
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,960
Thank you, P’John.

59
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,320
you really don’t need to.

60
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,400
So you don’t want them?

61
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,680
Yes, I do.

62
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,800
Ah, yes

63
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,400
There is someone asking for you earlier.

64
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,160
He said he had an appointment with you.

65
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,520
Khun Piti, right?

66
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,680
Yes.

67
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,560
Okay, can you call him back for me?

68
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,720
Tell him that I’m on his way to meet him.

69
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,840
Got it.

70
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,040
Arthit,

71
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,320
I want you to go out and meet this sales executive.

72
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
He wants to offer us his products.

73
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,480
Are you sure I should do this?

74
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,000
I have only met a sales executive for the first time just now

75
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,480
It’s not difficult at all

76
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,640
The process is the same as when we met Khun Lyla earlier.

77
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:11,840
Just listen to him and understand what he wants

78
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,320
Then ask for the hardcopy document.

79
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,960
And tell him to send over some samples.

80
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,000
And the ending line is exactly the same.

81
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,080
Tell him that we will contact back.

82
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,720
That’s all. So easy.

83
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,160
All right

84
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,400
Should I go now?

85
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,080
Yes. What are you waiting for?

86
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,200
Sawasdee krap.

87
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,400
My name is Piti.

88
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,760
I’m the representative of the company called Piti Commercial

89
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,760
You are Khun Jirakorn, right?

90
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,040
Ah…I’m Arthit.

91
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,960
P’John is…

92
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,560
Sorry, I mean Khun Jirakorn is busy at the moment.

93
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,960
It’s okay.

94
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,520
You are…the manager.

95
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,840
I’m actually the owner of this company.

96
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,880
You are quite an observant person.

97
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,800
Ah…Sawasdee krap.

98
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,400
My name is Arthit…

99
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,600
from the Procurement Department of Ocean Electrics

100
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,840
It’s nice to meet you, Khun Arthit.

101
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,000
Let’s get into the business. I don’t want to waste your time.

102
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,680
P’John,

103
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,840
I have this document from Piti Commercial.

104
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
He presents his products to us.

105
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,560
Take a look. I think his products are really interesting.

106
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,200
What is he selling?

107
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,440
These materials.

108
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,920
No need to.

109
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,160
We are going to buy these supplies from Sangchai Company with Khun Lyla.

110
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,480
But P’John,

111
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,840
the products from Khun Piti’s manufacture

112
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,600
are considerably cheaper than Sangchai Company

113
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,080
Don’t you want to have a look first?

114
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,200
Listen, Arthit.

115
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,720
Let me tell you something

116
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,760
Do you know what the most important thing in Procurement work is?

117
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,120
No.

118
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,960
It’s how to search and maintain connections

119
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,600
Saanchai Company is our partner

120
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,600
and does business with us for many years.

121
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,800
The owner of Sangchai is also a senior from our university.

122
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,800
How can you change to a new supplier because of lower prices?

123
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,880
Just like that?

124
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,440
No, you cannot do that.

125
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,480
I hope you understand.

126
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,600
Yes, I understand, P’John.

127
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,880
By the way, Arthit.

128
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,800
Can you do me a favor?

129
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,040
At 4 p.m.

130
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,200
someone from Sangchai Company will be here to pick up their products back.

131
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,800
Can you wait for him and check their products for me?

132
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,600
Uh...4 p.m?

133
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
Okay.

134
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,440
All right, then.

135
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,080
Do you think they can solve it?

136
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,440
I think they can.

137
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,200
It will be funny if they cannot.

138
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,480
How is the flag event going?

139
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,160
It’s getting more fun now.

140
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,840
I’ll be right there after work.

141
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,760
The ceremony will start at 7pm

142
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,280
Look, Kong.

143
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Someone is trying to open the box now

144
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,320
Look.

145
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,120
What?

146
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,560
I thought it would take them longer.

147
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,000
This is not fun.

148
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,600
Let’s go.

149
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,200
Let’s get in the line.

150
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,200
They may want to give it a shot without a real clue

151
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,160
I don’t think they know what they are doing.

152
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,160
See you tomorrow.

153
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,200
Nong Arthit.

154
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,240
It’s TGIF. Don’t you have a plan?

155
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,480
Uh…no.

156
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,080
I have to stay here to check the supplier’s products.

157
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,760
Okay, see you.

158
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,600
I’m turning the lights off. Let’s save the energy

159
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,840
How is the flag event going?

160
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,480
Hello.

161
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,920
I’m so sorry.

162
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,280
My car is broken down.

163
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,280
I’m trying to have it fixed now.

164
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,200
I may be late a bit

165
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,360
I see.

166
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,840
Can you please wait a bit longer?

167
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,080
I see.

168
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,760
All first years!

169
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,000
Fall in the lines.

170
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,840
Hurry up!

171
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,520
I need one representative

172
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,040
to hang the flag.

173
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,800
You are now my junior officially.

174
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,720
From now on, if any of us have problems

175
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:35,920
or come across any difficulties

176
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,040
we will help each other.

177
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,560
You may go.

178
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,000
Please study hard

179
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,440
Sawasdee krap.

180
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,200
For the next 4 years in this university

181
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,960
I hope you pay good attention to your study

182
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,520
as well as participate in activities

183
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,800
I hope you have good friends

184
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,440
And get good grades

185
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,000
I wish you much happiness throughout the next 4 years you study

186
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,960
And make the most use of your ability for your own sake

187
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,160
and others.

188
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Yeah

189
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,960
you are the one who unlocked the code

190
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,320
How do you know the word is “SHARE”?

191
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,640
I still have the “R” letter with me.

192
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,480
Well, we could found 2 letters.

193
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,520
We could not figure out what that word is

194
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,880
then someone stepped in to help

195
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,880
Who is it?

196
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,040
Day?

197
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,320
At first, when we got “S,” we thought of “SOTUS”

198
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,240
Why do you pick the word “SHARE”?

199
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,920
It has a good meaning of sharing.

200
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,200
To me, all the activities we are doing

201
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,240
let us share something with one another.

202
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,720
The seniors share knowledge, experiences

203
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,000
and good things with juniors.

204
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,280
Likewise,

205
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,200
the juniors also share many things with us

206
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,120
What is it that we share with you?

207
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,640
Look around.

208
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,560
If you don’t share your personal time with us,

209
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,120
we won’t have this great event.

210
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,320
Thank you.

211
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,040
Thank You too.

212
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
Kong,

213
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,240
I’ll be back.

214
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,280
0058

215
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,000
0058

216
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,160
0058

217
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,080
0058

218
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,760
I knew you would be here

219
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,680
And you also took part in the activity.

220
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,800
What do you mean?

221
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,360
I didn’t take part in the activity.

222
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,000
Are you sure?

223
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,120
Well.

224
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,680
Well, I just helped Khun Khaofang.

225
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,000
Don’t include this as I took part in the activity

226
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,000
or go there and sing that song with all of you

227
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
I see.

228
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,560
Wait.

229
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,240
Wait, 0058

230
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,560
Please,

231
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,880
stop calling me 0058.

232
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,160
My name is Day.

233
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
Yes.

234
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,200
Can I have your hand?

235
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,200
Hey, what are you doing?

236
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,160
Why are you tying that thread on my wrist?

237
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,080
Nothing.

238
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,760
I just want you to keep it.

239
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Hey!

240
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,720
I asked you to keep it.

241
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,760
Why do I have to keep it?

242
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,840
Come on. Just do it.

243
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,800
Come here.

244
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,960
Hey,

245
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
where are you taking me to?

246
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,080
Watch the steps.

247
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,840
Hey.

248
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,160
Come with me.

249
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,320
Hey, it’s illegal.

250
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,400
Hey.

251
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,480
0058.

252
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,920
Shush.

253
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,600
Be quiet.

254
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,200
Don’t you see we have the blessing ceremony of wrist tying?

255
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,760
Nong Day.

256
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,440
Let me give you a wrist tying.

257
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,680
Study hard.

258
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,720
I’m glad you can come

259
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,880
Come to the ceremony.

260
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,080
See you.

261
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,600
It’s not as bad as you think, is it?

262
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,200
0058

263
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,240
Look around and see the smiles on their face

264
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,200
You don’t want to see those smiles on juniors’ face in the future too?

265
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,960
0058

266
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,560
Do you want to come with me?

267
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,080
Uh…

268
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,640
Where are you taking me to?

269
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Well…

270
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,320
Only this is enough for me.

271
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,120
Bye for now then.

272
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,760
All right.

273
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,120
Kongpob.

274
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,840
Sawasdee krap.

275
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
Where is Arthit?

276
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,120
I cannot reach him

277
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,240
I cannot reach him either.

278
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,440
But in the last message I got from him in the evening

279
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,200
he said he would be here after work

280
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,600
If he said he would be here,

281
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,280
I’m sure he shows up soon.

282
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,960
He’s probably on this way

283
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,720
The signal may be lost.

284
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,120
Yeah.

285
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,120
Look. Look!

286
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,120
That girl

287
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,360
so cute

288
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,560
Woah

289
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,400
She has very bright skin

290
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,880
I wish I had been born 4 years later

291
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,960
Hey, you.

292
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,000
what’s your name again?

293
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,800
Kongpob

294
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,560
here here.

295
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,200
Tie this tread to that girl’s wrist for me

296
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,920
I think I’ve seen her

297
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,880
Do you feel good?

298
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,320
Let’s talk about it later

299
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,280
Hurry up.

300
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,000
Well, we are going to check out the juniors

301
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,080
See you.

302
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,480
Hello, babe.

303
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,280
I’m sorry but one box is missing.

304
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,640
Okay, let me check.

305
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,920
Hello, P’John. Well…

306
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,160
Arthit, I’m in the cinema.

307
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,480
I’ll call you back.

308
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,880
P’Yong, Production Dept.

309
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,880
Hello, P’Yong.

310
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,880
One box of the products from Sangchai Company is missing.

311
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,840
Do you know where it is?

312
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,880
Normally, when the products are delivered,

313
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,520
they are kept in the warehouse.

314
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,880
Have you checked that?

315
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Yes.

316
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,720
Then, it may be sent to the QC Department to get checked.

317
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,240
Why don’t you go look over there?

318
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,360
I see. Thanks.

319
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,240
Please wait a moment.

320
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,320
Here you are.

321
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,240
You can check it first.

322
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,320
All checked.

323
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,800
Thank you so much.

324
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,480
I’m sorry for wasting your time.

325
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,400
Where are you, P’Arthit?

326
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,560
Kongpob,

327
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,120
I’m sorry. My battery died earlier.

328
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,160
How is it going over there?

329
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,520
We are having a wrist tying ceremony.

330
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
All graduated seniors have arrived.

331
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,880
But I’m now outside the hall.

332
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,560
Hey,

333
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,120
why are you outside?

334
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,520
You must join the ceremony.

335
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,080
You are the head hazer.

336
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,680
Why?

337
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,360
You also cried alone at the back of the grandstand back then.

338
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,520
I said I didn’t cry

339
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,720
Why do you look so worn out like this?

340
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,400
Just a bit.

341
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,000
I’m in a hurry.

342
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,160
Next time, you don’t need to hurry

343
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,000
No, I want to meet…

344
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,320
Meet whom?

345
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,960
Meet…

346
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,200
the juniors. Yes.

347
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,480
Do the juniors you want to meet

348
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,000
include me?

349
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,720
Are you younger than me or not?

350
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,400
You don’t even need to ask

351
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,920
Okay krap.

352
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,640
Let’s meet the juniors together.

353
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,880
Arthit.

354
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
What?

355
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,120
I thought you were not coming

356
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,040
Are you drunk?

357
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,120
I’m not free like you.

358
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,120
I have work to do.

359
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
Are you mocking me for being unemployed?

360
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,440
I must say that today is really a good day.

361
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,600
The wrist tying ceremony is almost over.

362
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,840
We must celebrate

363
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,040
I have a place to recommend.

364
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,040
This place has a very good atmosphere.

365
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,360
the prices are reasonable.

366
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,800
And the owner is good looking

367
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
Are you trying to convince us to go to your bar?

368
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:08,720
Bright,

369
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,640
Right?

370
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,640
Your bar is so damn far.

371
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,040
Yes, it’s far.

372
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,080
But friendship comes before the distance.

373
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,400
Just a short ride by car

374
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,880
The bar is called “FIN JUNG” (so satisfying)

375
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:25,440
Are you coming?

376
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,560
Fine.

377
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,320
Let me check if any juniors want to join us.

378
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,480
Are you satisfied?

379
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,160
Good. Come 10 Pay 2.

380
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:32,880
My promotion.

381
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,080
I give you the discount

382
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,400
Come 10 Pay 2.

383
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,480
Can I have Come 10 Pay 1?

384
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,280
Are you serious?

385
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,560
Don’t be so mean.

386
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,760
just 10 pay 2

387
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,560
it doesn’t cover the investment he makes.

388
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:44,960
But I want you to come.

389
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,520
It’s a good bar.

390
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,280
Please come often.

391
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,680
Shall we go now?

392
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,840
I want to invite many juniors there.

393
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Gosh.

394
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,720
So satisfying?

395
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,800
Do you want to go back and rest?

396
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,320
You look so tired.

397
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,960
I’m okay.

398
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,400
I’ve just faced some hectic problems at work today.

399
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,840
You don’t have to rush to here if you are busy

400
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,400
It’s okay.

401
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,040
I have planned to be here

402
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,320
I must make it.

403
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,640
And…

404
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,480
I can still make it, right?

405
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,640
I could get to see the wrist tying ceremony

406
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,640
Kongpob,

407
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,880
you know what?

408
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,920
When I get to see the atmosphere like this again,

409
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,480
it’s like the fuel tank in me is filled.

410
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,800
This can fill the feelings

411
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,760
I have lost.

412
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,360
My tiredness is gone.

413
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,880
I have the strength to go back to my work now.

414
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,560
I want you to take in all of these moments.

415
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,560
It’s really a warm feeling.

416
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,880
You won’t get to have them again when you graduate

417
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,840
I will take in every bit of it as best as I can

418
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,320
I’m happy that your tiredness is gone.

419
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,920
and you can smile.

420
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,440
But next time,

421
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,760
I will go to see you myself.

422
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,320
Nong Arthit.

423
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Are you okay?

424
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,360
Yes.

425
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,960
I couldn’t get enough sleep last night

426
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,000
You couldn’t get enough sleep or actually

427
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,360
you got trashed last night

428
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,360
You look like a zombie.

429
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,560
Are you sure you are okay?

430
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,360
Yes.

431
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,600
You don’t look like you are okay

432
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,080
How about you get yourself a sweet drink to gain energy

433
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,000
If P’Danai sees you looking like this

434
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,520
you could be in trouble

435
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,880
Go go.

436
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,600
Okay.

437
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,800
Quickly.

438
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,040
Don’t be reluctant.

439
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,880
Go get a sweet drink

440
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,480
Or get it from a flower’s pollen if you can’t find one.

441
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,560
Can I get a pink milk?

442
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,120
Okay. Please wait a moment.

443
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,400
Arthit.

444
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,720
Yes, P’John?

445
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,560
Get me a coffee.

446
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,640
Sure.

447
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,000
I want iced latte

448
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,440
with only half glass of ice,

449
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,120
2 tablespoons of sugar

450
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,720
and 4 tablespoons of non-dairy creamer.

451
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,760
Can you say it one more time?

452
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,600
I cannot remember.

453
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,200
You cannot remember?

454
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,520
I’ll text you then.

455
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,280
Okay.

456
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,080
Never mind.

457
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:20,920
Madam!

458
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,680
I can remember. Don’t worry.

459
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,400
You can go

460
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,960
Repeat my order

461
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,200
Half glass of ice.

462
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,320
2 tablespoons of sugar,

463
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,880
and 4 tablespoons of non-dairy creamer

464
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,640
I give you money later.

465
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,160
Okay.

466
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,600
Pink milk is ready.

467
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,480
Oh, this one is not yours.

468
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,200
Your pink milk will be ready shortly. Please wait a bit.

469
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,320
P’Lookpuen, is my drink ready?

470
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,000
Hey, don’t call me Lookpuen

471
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,680
I told you to call me Madam Jenny.

472
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,560
Madam Jenny.

473
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,120
Hi, P’Earth.

474
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,440
are you having a break?

475
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,200
What did you order?

476
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,920
Oh, just like you. Pink milk.

477
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,000
Really? You can get this one first.

478
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,760
It’s all right. I have to get coffee for P’John anyway

479
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:01,720
I see.

480
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:06,280
P’Jenny, I pay for all of them.

481
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,280
P’Earth, I can pay for it.

482
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,000
It’s okay. Just one glass.

483
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,600
Thank you

484
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,000
Pretty girl with a kind heart.

485
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,440
I am.

486
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,880
You want coffee too, right?

487
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,960
Yes.

488
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,680
This lifts up my mood.

489
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,840
Do you usually like to drink pink milk?

490
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,480
Not really

491
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,800
I drink it on the day that I feel really tired

492
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,280
Do you like pink milk?

493
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,280
Well,

494
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,200
you can call I’m a pink milk addict

495
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,760
That much?

496
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,560
Yes,

497
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,640
when I was in school.

498
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,200
There was a milk giveaway every morning

499
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,520
The flavors are either strawberry pink milk

500
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,200
or chocolate.

501
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,800
And I had diarrhea often if I drank chocolate milk.

502
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,320
So I have been drinking pink milk since then.

503
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,360
Woah, how strange.

504
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,200
Most people drink it because it’s their favorite drink

505
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,600
But you drink it because you get used to it.

506
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,720
Look,

507
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,880
don’t get used to being taken advantage at work.

508
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,280
Got it.

509
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,120
Latte is ready

510
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,320
Let’s get back.

511
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,880
Hey, do you think he looks familiar?

512
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,840
P’Bee

513
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,240
I and Khaofang don’t understand this part

514
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,560
give me a sec.

515
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,400
P’Kongpob!

516
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,480
What’s up, Nong Bee?

517
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,520
I help tutor these juniors Calculus subject

518
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,480
But they don’t understand this part.

519
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,960
Which one?

520
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,440
4.5?

521
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,480
Is this blank sheet?

522
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,520
All right.

523
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,360
Look at this.

524
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,040
Minus 3, this makes it unable to find the value.

525
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,600
So you change Minus 3 to T

526
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,480
and take the limit of T to Minus 3.

527
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,600
So you get function T of Minus 2.

528
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,600
Now you integrate it.

529
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,640
Are you following?

530
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,760
Yes.

531
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,280
Then you replace with the value.

532
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,240
Now that you get the value,

533
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,240
you take the limit according to the given problem.

534
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,960
Then you find the answer.

535
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,120
Ah, this is how it is solved.

536
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,040
I almost embarrass myself in front of them

537
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,920
You are so smart, P’Kongpob.

538
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,080
I and Khaofang are stuck.

539
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,840
Actually, it’s not difficult.

540
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,560
You just need to adopt this formula in order to solve

541
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,360
You can come ask me anytime if you have questions.

542
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,560
P’Kongpob

543
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,480
Yes?

544
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,240
I cannot open it.

545
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,960
Thank you.

546
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,600
Are there any other problems you cannot solve?

547
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,520
Sorry to cut in.

548
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,920
Do you have a minute?

549
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,680
P’Tew, sawasdee ka.

550
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,880
I’ll be back.

551
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:10,720
take it.

552
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,600
This is opened by a man.

553
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,360
Hey, Kong.

554
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,880
What’s up?

555
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,720
It seems that the new department head professor

556
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,680
is not going to authorize the off-campus initiation activity.

557
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,280
Really, why?

558
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,440
I’m not sure.

559
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,080
It seems he doesn’t like the initiation activities

560
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,680
Okay,

561
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,520
I help you think of the way to get this approved.

562
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,200
I go back to them

563
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,120
See you later.

564
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,480
See you, everyone

565
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,400
Take care, P’John.

566
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,240
Muah muah.

567
00:34:59,400 --> 00:34:59,880
P’Earth, Arthit,

568
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,960
let’s get off.

569
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,040
Arthit

570
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:06,760
Arthit.

571
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,200
Arthit.

572
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,400
Time to go home.

573
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,960
I’m almost done putting in this info.

574
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,960
You can go first.

575
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,000
Are there a lot left?

576
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,920
We can wait.

577
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,440
We can go home altogether.

578
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,400
It’s okay

579
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,680
I don’t want you to waste your time waiting for me

580
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,320
I think I can still catch the company van

581
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,200
Okay.

582
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,160
We go first then.

583
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,480
Kongpob,

584
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,000
Why hadn’t you told me that you would be here?

585
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,160
I told you on the Flag Capturing Day

586
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,280
that I would come to see you.

587
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,160
No,

588
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,280
you should have specifically told me the date you want to visit me

589
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,520
I’m sorry

590
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,280
Why do have to snap at me?

591
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,800
Or you don’t want me to be here?

592
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,960
Uh…

593

594
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,080
Kongpob,

595
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Yes?

596
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,920
Give me your hand.

597
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,760
You study really hard.

598
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,320
You also have a lot of activities to do.

599
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,960
Don’t forget to take care of yourself too.

600
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,480
And...

601
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,800
I hope you are loved by everyone.

602
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,880
Thank you.

603
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,200
Go play football.

604
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,560
What is so funny?

605
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:56,560
“You are now my junior officially.
From now on, if any of us have problems
or come across any difficulties,
we will help each other.” – Kongpob

606
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,200
It’s 8 o’clock.

607
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,600
The last Saturday of this month

608
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,600
we have an initiation activity.

609
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,480
I have to come to the office that day.

610
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,000
It’s not good for you to dress like this.

611
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:20,880
I’m here to plant the trees.

612
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,760
What do you expect me to wear?

613
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,680
Gears are so important to us engineers

614
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,280
Can you take care of it for me?
