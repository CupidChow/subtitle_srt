1
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,880
Please help consider this request, Khun Kerkkrai

2
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,560
I haven’t seen a person who is as hardworking as you in a while.

3
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,480
But this break, I have to do an internship.

4
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,360
You can be an intern here in our company.

5
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,160
But I want to be an intern somewhere else.

6
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,400
there’s a guy from Ocean Electrics.

7
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,840
I found him to be a good guy

8
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,840
This company is a good place to do the internship.

9
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,200
Are you okay?

10
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,800
You haven’t come to class for many days.

11
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,080
Stop messing with me

12
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,440
I want to be alone

13
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,920
Hey, Tew.

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,280
Try to bring your junior line mentor to see us

15
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,440
All right, see you.

16
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,160
Sawasdee krap.

17
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,400
I’m Tod, Tanaphat.

18
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,280
You are…

19
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,440
Arthit krap.

20
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,440
What relationship do you have with P’Piroj?

21
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,120
He’s my uncle.

22
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,680
How could you oversee anyone in the future?

23
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,320
He is so gorgeous like a roman god.

24
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,040
Well, this is Kongpob.

25
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,160
The junior I told you that he wanted to see how we work

26
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,280
All right, then. Get in the car.

27
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,480
There are many places we have to visit today.

28
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,960
You are a junior of Arthit at the uni?

29
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,280
Yes.

30
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,160
What is Arthit like when he was at the uni?

31
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,080
Is he gentle like this?

32
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,400
P’Arthit?

33
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,400
He’s an extremely harsh hazer, you know?

34
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,320
What?

35
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,680
Arthit is a hazer?

36
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,000
I cannot imagine how he is like when he is fierce

37
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,240
What are you laughing?

38
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,360
Stop it.

39
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,960
And stop exposing me too.

40
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,680
I’m telling the truth.

41
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,000
You know something, P’Earth?

42
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,800
When I was a freshman,

43
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,160
P’Arthit made me do many difficult things

44
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,120
How?

45
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,160
There was one time

46
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,560
P’Arthit ordered me to shout in the middle of the canteen.

47
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,080
Really?

48
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,000
Well then, can you do me a favor?

49
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,680
What is it?

50
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,120
Go stand on the table

51
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,480
and shout out, 3 times

52
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,800
“I like men.”

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,600
I like men

54
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,960
I like men

55
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,800
I like men

56
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,480
How could you make him do such thing?

57
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,480
He was asking for a trouble

58
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,240
So I taught him some lessons.

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,520
He pulls a serious face again.

60
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,360
What did you do?

61
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,480
Kongpob,

62
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,360
are you bored?

63
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
No,

64
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,720
this is pretty fun.

65
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,040
So, you have to visit the manufacture like this often?

66
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,200
No,

67
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,800
just once in a while

68
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,440
My company has experienced some interruption in the production lately

69
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,160
So we have to find other manufacturers to help us produce goods

70
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,920
I think…

71
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,080
P’Earth is very good at what she does.

72
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,800
P’Earth?

73
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,880
What you see is not the half of what she normally does

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,760
To me, she is like

75
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,080
the strongest woman in the department

76
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,360
And to me,

77
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,520
you are the strongest senior

78
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,840
Especially when I see you working.

79
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,920
Kongpob

80
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,240
what do you think you are doing?

81
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,600
I told you, right?

82
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,720
When we are in public…

83
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,080
What are you talking about?

84
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,760
I’m not doing anything.

85
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,240
The strongest man

86
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,400
should not let this helmet unfastened.

87
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,960
Arthit, Kongpob.

88
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,240
Let’s get going.

89
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,880
We’re done here.

90
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,040
I’m going to buy some drink.

91
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,160
Do you want anything?

92
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,800
Can I have an iced coffee?

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,520
Would you like me to go with you?

94
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,240
It’s okay. No biggie.

95
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,280
P’Arthit krap.

96
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,400
P’Arthit krap.

97
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,000
You have slept?

98
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Here.

99
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,800
Thank you.

100
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,920
Let me help.

101
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,080
Yes.

102
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,000
Grandma,

103
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,320
I’m already at my dorm.

104
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,480
Yes, dad dropped me here but he’s left

105
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,520
You are having an operation tomorrow

106
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,400
Please take a rest

107
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
Okay.

108
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,560
Don’t worry.

109
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,320
I go see you tomorrow in the morning

110
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,640
When you are recovered,

111
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,120
I’ll take you home and stay with dad

112
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,960
I love you, you know?

113
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,280
Okay, goodbye.

114
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,760
Hi, Nong Day

115
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,280
I told you

116
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,280
to leave me alone, right?

117
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,040
I see you standing here alone.

118
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,080
So I want to ask if you want to go to…

119
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,560
I’m not going.

120
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,320
And I’m so okay to be alone

121
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,040
But,

122
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,760
Nong Day…

123
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,480
Hey,

124
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,200
stop calling me Nong Day already.

125
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,680
Huh?

126
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,800
Then, how should I call you?

127
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,320
0058?

128
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,680
Day?

129
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,720
Or Dechawut?

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I think

131
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,080
you better not call me at all.

132
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,040
Why?

133
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,800
Hey, you don’t seem to listen to me.

134
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,240
I said I wanted to be alone

135
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,400
Well…

136
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,120
No.

137
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,560
Do you need that drink that much?

138
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,880
Mr. Sun.

139
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,560
This is done.

140
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,880
Have you sent this file to Khun Danai to review?

141
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,360
Already.

142
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,120
What about the supplier?

143
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,360
you faxed it, right?

144
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
Fax?

145
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,280
Uh…

146
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,120
do people still use fax this day?

147
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Hey,

148
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,680
how did you send it to the supplier?

149
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,440
I sent it via email.

150
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,040
Email?

151
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,680
You cannot do that, Tod.

152
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,600
This kind of document has signatures.

153
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,560
They are somewhat sensitive

154
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,440
I see.

155
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,320
Let me resend it.

156
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,200
Hey, don’t worry about it.

157
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,040
I’ll take care of it for you

158
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,280
You can finish what you are doing now

159
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,920
Finish them before the deadline.

160
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,280
Okay, thank you.

161
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,800
This is the production of the rest products

162
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,560
including the QC time.

163
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,400
Thank you very much

164
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,360
Let me know if you need anything.

165
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,080
I want you all to do your best

166
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,080
and at the end of the year

167
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,080
I make sure I do my best in considering your bonus

168
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,080
All right.

169
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,600
If there’s nothing else,

170
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,080
I would like to end this meeting.

171
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,040
Excuse me.

172
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,680
Everyone, since you are all here,

173
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,680
I would like to inform about the new interns.

174
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,760
Our company has accepted 2 interns

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,960
They will have the internship here for 3 months by rotating to all departments.

176
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,920
let me introduce them to you now.

177
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,640
Guys,

178
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,120
please come in.

179
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,960
Hey, that’s Nong Kong.

180
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,400
How come you never told he would be the intern here?

181
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:19,160
Please introduce yourself so they know who you are and where you are from.

182
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,760
My name is Weerawat Kammuangkaew.

183
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,480
You can call me Nai.

184
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,800
I’m from Chiangmai

185
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,960
My name is Kong.

186
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,640
Kongpob Sutthirak.

187
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,720
I’m from SSU.

188
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,360
SSU has many handsome students

189
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,120
Contain yourself, Som-O.

190
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,440
Do you have other handsome friends?

191
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:48,200
So they will do the intern here by rotating to all departments.

192
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,280
Please help take care of them.

193
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,120
Thank you for your time. Thank you so much.

194
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,680
Let’s go, guys.

195
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,800
My name is Som-O.

196
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,360
Save it for later, Som-O.

197
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,800
You will get to know them soon

198
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,720
Okay, in the beginning

199
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,000
you will be working at the Human Resource Department

200
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,640
Now I’m taking you to tour around the company.

201
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,040
So you know what they do in each department.

202
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,440
Uh…I have a question, P’Durian.

203
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,680
Wait.

204
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,960
We just started and you have a question already.

205
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,440
Please take it easy, Nong Nai.

206
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,440
I’ll let you ask later.

207
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,920
All right.

208
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,400
Put it back.

209
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,560
Stop playing with them.

210
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,760
You can break them

211
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,120
Keep them.

212
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,680
Shall we go on?

213
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,080
P’Somrak,

214
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:26,920
sawasdee ka.

215
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,400
Sawasdee, Durian.

216
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,480
Kids,

217
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,760
this is P’Somrak.

218
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,080
He’s the head of QC Department.

219
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:34,680
Please make yourself at home.

220
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,840
I need to finish this first

221
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,520
This is QC Dept. or the Quality Control Department.

222
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,160
Uh…

223
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,400
You can’t keep your hands to yourself.

224
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,160
Don’t worry.

225
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,800
Do what you like

226
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,440
Thank you.

227
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,720
Okay. Sawasdee krap.

228
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,240
This is our warehouse.

229
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,640
How is it? It’s beautiful and spacious, right?

230
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,240
And this is the Procurement Department.

231
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,040
Let me take you inside.

232
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,840
Hi, Nong Arthit.

233
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,480
Where are you going?

234
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,080
To the restroom.

235
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,160
Ah, okay.

236
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Well, let’s get inside.

237
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,880
Cherry.

238
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,320
Cherry!

239
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,080
Where’s P’Yong.

240
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,480
P’Yong is probably inspecting the production inside.

241
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,880
Sawasdee krap.

242
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,280
What brings you here, Durian?

243
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,520
I bring these interns to tour around the company.

244
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,120
Very good, very hot, the father of my child.

245
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,720
Okay.

246
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,320
This is P’Chartchai.

247
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,560
He’s the deputy head of the Production Department

248
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,120
Hey, Durian.

249
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,800
Show me some respect.

250
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,080
In this department, my name is Cherry

251
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,640
Don’t listen to this old hag.

252
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,400
Let me take you around to see what we do here in this department

253
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,200
Okay?

254
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,800
All right.

255
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,080
I leave them to you

256
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,560
I need to freshen up my lips.

257
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,200
Go ahead. Take as much time as you need

258
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:48,840
Thank you.

259
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,360
Come on, young boys.

260
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,200
Let me show you what we do here in this

261
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,680
This is the Production Department.

262
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,360
Our company makes many kinds of electrical appliances.

263
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,480
Sawasdee ja.

264
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,160
You can tour around freely for now

265
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,680
In a short moment,

266
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,080
there’s a guy to tell you more in details.

267
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,520
Kong, look.

268
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,480
Have you seen this fan before?

269
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,800
It’s so wicked.

270
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,360
The wind comes out of here.

271
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,200
How’d it go, Cherry?

272
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,600
They should understand the overview of it here.

273
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,520
You can take on from here

274
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,360
Uh, P’Cherry.

275
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,800
I think something is wrong with this fan.

276
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,840
That’s a bladeless fan.

277
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,040
It’s a new product we have recently made.

278
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,600
What did you do?

279
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,960
Do you know how dangerous this is?

280
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,120
But I didn’t do anything.

281
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,000
I heard a weird sound

282
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,560
As I was about to ask P’Cherry.

283
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
it was like that.

284
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,080
I didn’t mean to break it

285
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,520
Cherry

286
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,280
Why did you put the damaged product with other showcase products?

287
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,920
Well…

288
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,360
Someone from the Design Department took the old one

289
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,240
So I put this one here for the time being.

290
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,680
I will find a new one to showcase here shortly

291
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,440
Cherry,

292
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,480
I have told you many times

293
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,640
You should be more careful.

294
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,120
I’m sorry.

295
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,640
You are new interns here, right?

296
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,520
Yes.

297
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,360
My name is Yong.

298
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,680
I’m a senior employee here in this Production Department

299
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,560
Like you see,

300
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,800
we produce many electrical appliances

301
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,840
So before coming to work here,

302
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,040
I want you two to study all of the products we have made

303
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,440
As there’s a risk involved here in this department.

304
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,240
We may give you a hard time.

305
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:19,520
But we take care of one another like brothers.

306
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,840
I apologize for what I did earlier

307
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,240
It was my carelessness.

308
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,960
Please excuse me.

309
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:28,720
See you again soon.

310
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,120
Cherry,

311
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,120
have this fixed too.

312
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,080
Well,

313
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,120
I take you two to P’Durian

314
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,920
Want some?

315
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,120
Thank you.

316
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,960
Kids,

317
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,320
what are you eating?

318
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,640
It looks yum.

319
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,600
Do you want some?

320
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,200
No, I’m good.

321
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,360
So?

322
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,160
You have toured around the company?

323
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,360
How was it? Did you have a good time?

324
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
It was very good.

325
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,880
You can have a break now.

326
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,040
But I want you to take these letters

327
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,000
to the Procurement and the Production departments?

328
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,120
The Procurement Department, Ocean Electric Co., LTD

329
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,360
Okay.

330
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,760
P’Arthit krap,

331
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,720
I can explain.

332
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,280
I’m working.

333
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,560
I don’t feel like listening to anything at the moment.

334
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,160
Kongpob,

335
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,440
you are here to be an intern.

336
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,520
Go back to your work

337
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,680
P’Arthit, please listen to me.

338
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,080
I couldn’t find the right time to tell you

339
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,920
Don’t be mad at me.

340
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,520
I really want to do the internship here

341
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,280
Well,

342
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,280
since you started working here.

343
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,520
You told me a lot of things

344
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,320
So I think

345
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,040
if I do the internship here,

346
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,520
I will get more experiences than other companies

347
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,920
Plus,

348
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,280
I also get to see you working

349
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,960
I can be near you

350
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,560
and help you

351
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,720
But you should have told me at least.

352
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,560
Normally, we can talk about anything, right?

353
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,200
I’m sorry.

354
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,800
What about MCC?

355
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:10,000
Forget it.

356
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,040
You are here anyway.

357
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,640
Don’t forget to tell me again.

358
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,240
Okay, P’Arthit.

359
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,680
And what are you doing here?

360
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,200
P’Durian asked me to give this to P’Earth

361
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,880
I’m going to give this to P’Earth later.

362
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,800
You can leave it with me.

363
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,640
Go back to your work.

364
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,120
Hold on, P’Arthit.

365
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,600
Well…

366
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,120
Arthit,

367
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,440
P’Danai is calling for you to give him the summary of our manufacturing tour.

368
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:08,840
Cherry,

369
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,760
I finished fixing the fan that was broken down.

370
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Oh.

371
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,840
What are you doing here?

372
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:22,560
Oh, I’m looking at what you are doing

373
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,400
I mean what you are doing here?

374
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,400
I have a letter for you from P’Durian

375
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,240
My hands are dirty.

376
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,800
Can you put it on my desk for me?

377
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,680
Uh…

378
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,240
where is your desk?

379
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,000
The one with a coffee mug.

380
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:06,680
And can you tell me what you are doing?

381
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,280
I’m fixing the fan you broke.

382
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,760
Don’t be kidding.

383
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
It wasn’t me.

384
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,720
The fan exploded by itself.

385
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,560
I knew.

386
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,840
When I sent it to fix,

387
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,280
they say the wires got fused together by mistake.

388
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,960
So it caused the short circuit and banged.

389
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,880
Do you have to check the motor and the electrical panel again?

390
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,680
I heard a weird sound coming out of it.

391
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,680
Maybe, something is wrong with the sound box.

392
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,640
You may want to check those again.

393
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,560
I did check them all.

394
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,360
What’s your name again?

395
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,160
My name?

396
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,520
Yes, what’s your name?

397
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,480
My name is Weerawat.

398
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,320
You don’t have a nickname?

399
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,480
You already knew my nickname.

400
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,440
Your nickname is also Weerawat?

401
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,840
No, my nickname is Nai.

402
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,520
I heard you call me “Nai” many times

403
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,000
so I thought you knew. (Note: Nai also means “You”)

404
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,200
I see.

405
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,480
Nai.

406
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,960
P’Yong,

407
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,760
the fan is finished, right?

408
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,760
I can put it back.

409
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,320
Hi, Nong Nai.

410
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,240
You come all the way to here.

411
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,160
What can I do for you?

412
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,040
Could it be that

413
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,320
you are missing me?

414
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,440
I’m here to drop a letter.

415
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,360
Seriously,

416
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,280
you can just say something I want to hear.

417
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,200
Well,

418
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,000
would you mind put this fan to where it was?

419
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,840
You are done, right?

420
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,960
Okay, boss.

421
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,840
It’s heavy.

422
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,080
You can help me carry the cord

423
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,000
Okay.

424
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,080
We’re going, P’Yong.

425
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,480
Hello, yes.

426
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,840
I have arrived

427
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:48,760
I’m waiting to get the interview

428
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,880
Thank you.

429
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,760
I have got off work.

430
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,360
Have you finished your work?

431
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,520
Would you like to go back together?

432
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,880
I have a meeting.

433
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,600
I probably get off work late

434
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,400
You can go back without me.

435
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,240
Kong.

436
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,680
Hey, Nai.

437
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,520
You just got off work?

438
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,200
Want to go back together?

439
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,080
Um.

440
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,320
How do you go home?

441
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,120
With this motorcycle.

442
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:42,880
Where do you stay?

443
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:43,520
I can give you a ride

444
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,600
You can drop me at the main street

445
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,640
I can go home by bus.

446
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
It’s quite far from here.

447
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:49,720
Okay.

448
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,560
Thanks.

449
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,600
Hey, Day. Day.

450
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,120
Well…

451
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,400
What are you doing?

452
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,080
Let go of me.

453
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,160
You have to come with me no matter what

454
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,360
Hey, what’s wrong with you?

455
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,640
Day, wait.

456
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,880
Hey,

457
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,200
if you don’t let go of me.

458
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,720
I’ll file a report the police

459
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,280
on the charge of forcing juniors to attend the activities without their consent.

460
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,240
You can get jailed up to 3 years, you know?

461
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,480
I don’t mind

462
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,800
The initiation activities have been long over since the beach day.

463
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,280
Today, I want to take you to eat.

464
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,040
Come on.

465
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,000
Hey,

466
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,920
Eat what? I don’t want to go.

467
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,160
Come on.

468
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,000
Come with me.

469
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,440
This is kidnapping.

470
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,520
We will just eat.

471
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,160
Be quiet.

472
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,240
Hey.

473
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,240
To a pub called Fin Jung at Jindarat alley

474
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,720
You are dripping the drink in his car.

475
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,080
Where are we going?

476
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,320
You can go now.

477
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,480
Tew.

478
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,720
Hi, Day.

479
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,200
P’Yod.

480
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,600
Sawasdee krap, P’Yod.

481
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,800
You don’t have to Wai me.

482
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,040
I asked you to bring our line junior

483
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,720
don’t tell me he is that junior.

484
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Yes.

485
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
So you are my line junior?

486
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,160
What a small world.

487
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,480
What’s line junior?

488
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,240
The line of student ID 0058.

489
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,040
I call you guys to have a feast within our junior-senior in this student ID’s line.

490
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,400
So you two know each other?

491
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:31,880
Yes,

492
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,320
I’m also his senior in the school.

493
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,280
We were in the same club, actually.

494
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,480
You transferred to here and started again as a first year.

495
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,320
You were not okay with the old uni?

496
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:42,800
Yes,

497
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,480
I had some problem studying there.

498
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,200
So I transferred to here

499
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,480
Why you didn’t join us during the initiation ceremony

500
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,960
I was busy.

501
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,640
You were always busy.

502
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,160
I invited him so many times and he refused to join

503
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,560
How are you doing?

504
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,800
Long time no see.

505
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,080
I haven’t seen you after you graduated

506
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,120
What?

507
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:12,760
I have already graduated.

508
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:13,960
Why do you still expect to see me there?

509
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,160
I have completed my degree. I’m not going back there

510
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,240
You can just come pay us a visit.

511
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,080
All right, I will go if there are a lot of female students

512
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,400
I go to where female students are.

513
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,520
All right. Make yourself at home

514
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,720
Thank you so much.

515
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,800
By the way, P’Yod.

516
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,800
In the past,

517
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,560
you didn’t seem to appreciate the initiation process

518
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,800
Why did you join it here?

519
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,800
I still don’t like it

520
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:43,040
But the initiation allows us to know other people more

521
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,760
We still have to live with others.

522
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,520
We have to belong in the society

523
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,040
That’s right

524
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:53,280
Well, let me officially open the party of our student ID’s line

525
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,720
Come on

526
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,040
Officially?

527
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:01,640
Are you saying that these are all we have in this line?

528
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,920
Yeah.

529
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,840
The junior from last year has already transferred to another uni

530
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,160
My senior is furthering study somewhere else.

531
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,920
So these are all we have

532
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,440
That’s right.

533
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,240
It’s not about the number of people

534
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,240
It’s the way we communicate,

535
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
understand

536
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,600
and help one another.

537
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,360
Come on.

538
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,920
Hey!

539
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,840
So, Tew.

540
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,240
You finally have a line junior.

541
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,160
Yes.

542
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,400
It’s amazing

543
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,640
P’Earth,

544
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,640
P’John and Som-O invite me to have dinner altogether.

545
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,080
Would you like to join us?

546
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,440
Well, I’m a bit tired today

547
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,120
I should go home

548
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,440
Arthit,

549
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,760
are you going to eat with P’John?

550
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,600
I have to excuse myself today.

551
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,760
It’s raining. I should go home.

552
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,400
I can give you a lift.

553
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,320
It’s okay. I don’t want to impose on you.

554
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,600
Don’t worry.

555
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,440
This kind of rain is not going to stop easily

556
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,760
Well, see you tomorrow, Tod.

557
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,560
P’Som-O, goodbye.

558
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,320
Tod.

559
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,440
Tod.

560
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,040
Yes?

561
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,600
Wait a moment, P’John is bringing his car to here.

562
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,760
Okay.

563
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,120
it's raining cats and dogs.

564
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,000
Listen, Day.

565
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,320
Well…

566
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,960
I want to point out to you that

567
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,360
being sociable with seniors and juniors

568
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,360
is not always bad

569
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,640
I never said that I didn’t want to be sociable with seniors and juniors.

570
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,240
Why did you have to drag me?

571
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,840
It hurts, you know?

572
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,720
Are you sure you never said that to me?

573
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,160
I believed I told you many times

574
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,040
but you didn’t want to listen

575
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,160
Up until now,

576
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,880
You a messing with my life,

577
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,280
It’s because you are my line senior

578
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,360
it’s just that, right?

579
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,840
How is it going, working with Tod?

580
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,000
Ah, it’s going well.

581
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,640
Tod picks up things quite fast

582
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,520
I know

583
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,520
But please help look after him…

584
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,480
Before someone make him change

585
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,920
I bother you so many times.

586
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,000
Don’t mention it.

587
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,800
You help me a lot too.

588
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,800
Like the manufacturing tour.

589
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,160
If you didn’t help me,

590
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,840
I wouldn’t finish it quickly.

591
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,080
Okay.

592
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,640
Hurry and go up to your room

593
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,640
Before it’s raining harder

594
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,280
Okay krap.

595
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,640
Please take care while you drive back

596
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,360
Let me help.

597
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,920
It’s okay.

598
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,680
Kongpob.

599
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,560
P’Arthit, I can explain.

600
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,560
P’Arthit krap.

601
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,560
P’Arthit krap.

602

Directed by
Padung Smajarn / Pongpisit Botsri

603
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,880
You can go without me. I can go home by myself

604
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,320
Let me go with you.

605
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,280
I’m not a small kid anymore.

606
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,640
I can go home myself.

607
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,880
You can just go

608
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,120
It’s been a long day to you.

609
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,000
What if you doze off in the taxi?

610
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,960
Please let me go with you.

611
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,720
It’s my way to home anyway.

612
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,040
Do as you will.

613
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,240
P’Arthit krap.

614
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,200
I had fun today

615
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,120
It wasn’t fun at all.

616
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,920
Touring around those manufactures

617
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,800
I got to see you working

618
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,600
It was fun already.

619
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,480
Do you know what?

620
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,440
I want to be by your side and take care of you like this forever

621
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,920
From now on,

622
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,120
I stay by your side and take care of you like this

623
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:19,840
So I think… if I do the internship here,
I will get more experiences than other companies.
…Plus, I also get to see you working. I can be near you and help you. – Kongpob

624
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,480
P’Arthit krap

625
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,120
P’Earth krap, thank you

626
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,240
For what?

627
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,320
For this pink milk.

628
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,920
No, it’s not from me.

629
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,400
I walk passed the intern.

630
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,640
So it’s probably from Nong Kong.

631
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,200
Wait, P’Arthit

632
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,600
What are you doing?

633
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,560
Have more.

634
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,040
Enough, Kongpob!

635
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,200
Kongpob, why are you walking so slowly

636
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,360
I don’t know how far I should keep my distance from you
