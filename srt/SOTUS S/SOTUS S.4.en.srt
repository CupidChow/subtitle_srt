1
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,280
You are now my junior officially.

2
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,400
If any of us have problems

3
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,040
we will help each other.

4
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,480
You are so smart, P’Kongpob.

5
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,400
I and Khaofang are stuck.

6
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,680
Actually, it’s not difficult

7
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,080
You just need to adopt this formula in order to solve.

8
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,440
Look around and see the smiles on their face

9
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,760
It’s not as bad as you think, is it?

10
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,680
Arthit, get me a coffee.

11
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,680
I give you money later.

12
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,440
Okay.

13
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,520
Don’t get used to being taken advantage at work.

14
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:30,440
Okay

15
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,880
Why hadn’t you told me that you would be here?

16
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,640
Why do have to snap at me?

17
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,040
Or you don’t want me to be here?

18
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,760
In the future, when you want to come to my room

19
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,800
let me know first.

20
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,880
There could be a chance that I’m caught up in a meeting

21
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,920
or go out to meet clients

22
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,080
And you cannot see me.

23
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,160
I don’t want you to waste time on waiting for me

24
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,640
Okay.

25
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,440
Do you still have work to do today?

26
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,560
No

27
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,840
What about you?

28
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,240
You come to see me.

29
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,160
Is everything all right?

30
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,040
I want to talk about the initiation

31
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,120
But…

32
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,920
let’s eat first.

33
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,640
Well, my room is a bit messy.

34
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,600
You come without notice

35
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,880
I don’t have time to clean up yet.

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,760
Let me help.

37
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,840
P’Arthit krap.

38
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,760
That bottle belongs to me.

39
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,720
Why?

40
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,480
There are many drinks in the fridge.

41
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,800
Be generous.

42
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,240
But there’s only one left of that favor

43
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,160
You want it?

44
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,040
Here.

45
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,360
Why is the steamed egg in this color this time?

46
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,400
It’s special recipe

47
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,080
How was it?

48
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,920
Well…

49
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,640
it’s so-so.

50
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,760
Not that special.

51
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,720
I put it away then.

52
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,760
Wait.

53
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,760
Didn’t you said it was not good?

54
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,560
Anyway,

55
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,440
about the off-campus initiation at the beach

56
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,800
has it been approved yet?

57
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,000
We are only waiting for the authorized letter.

58
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,120
The new dean is yet to sign it off.

59
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,000
That happens every year.

60
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,800
It’s common for the dean.

61
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,520
During my time,

62
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,120
the dean didn’t sign off easily

63
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,760
so I had to add other activities to the plan

64
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,400
Other activities…

65
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,280
like volunteer camps?

66
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,200
Yes.

67
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,680
In fact, I think...

68
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,960
you could add an activity like a reforestation.

69
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,720
I think it’s interesting.

70
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,880
Add it to your plan

71
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,120
All right.

72
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,000
I’ll try that.

73
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,520
If I get the green light,

74
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,800
are you going with me?

75
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,280
Sure.

76
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,320
You want me to go with you, right?

77
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,480
Let’s finish eating.

78
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,120
But if you are busy with your work,

79
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,040
you don’t have to go.

80
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,160
I want you to have a deserved rest.

81
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,160
I consider that a kind of rest too

82
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,080
I get to meet the juniors

83
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,760
and do activities together with them

84
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,160
Okay.

85
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,600
I take that as you have agreed to go

86
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,080
Kongpob

87
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,160
what the hell did you do?

88
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,160
Take it off

89
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,760
What time is it now, Kongpob?

90
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,520
8 o’clock.

91
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,160
Don’t you have class tomorrow?

92
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,600
I do

93
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,400
In the afternoon?

94
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,760
Why?

95
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,800
Do you want to kick me out now?

96
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,760
No.

97
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,360
Hold on, Kongpob.

98
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,960
What?

99
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,440
Don’t tell me that you have planned this from the beginning?

100
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,640
You have me fooled again.

101
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,320
Hey!

102
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Hey!

103
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,440
Here you go again.

104
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,360
Kongpob, this is not funny

105
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,160
It’s late. Let me in.

106
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,120
You could be late for work

107
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,520
Give me 5 more minutes.

108
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,760
No.

109
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,240
Get up.

110
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,360
What time is it?

111
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,040
It’s 8 o’clock?

112
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,720
What?

113
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,240
8 o’clock already?

114
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,720
And you didn’t bother to wake me up again

115
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,080
That’s your favorite line when you wake up late.

116
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,680
But it’s 8 o’clock.

117
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,200
I’m kidding.

118
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,680
It’s just half past 7.

119
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,040
What shirt do you want to wear today?

120
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,480
I iron it for you.

121
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,680
Uh…

122
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,960
the white one.

123
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,000
Any white shirt is fine. Just pick it.

124
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,080
Do you want to eat?

125
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,840
I don’t think I have enough time.

126
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,960
Please work hard, P’Arthit.

127
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,880
Thank you, Kongpob.

128
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,280
Arthit

129
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,400
Yes, P’John.

130
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,360
I have an important matter that needs your favor

131
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,680
I have placed an order from a supplier.

132
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,000
I want you to call and chase them for me

133
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,600
Tell them to deliver the order by the end of this month.

134
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,840
Okay.

135
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,680
Okay. Here are their telephone number and contact person.

136
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,320
Don’t forget to remind them that they must deliver by the end of this month

137
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,760
Got it. By the end of this month

138
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,160
Hold on.

139
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,920
What?

140
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,880
P’John,

141
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,160
But it states here that the delivery date is the first Monday of next month.

142
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,760
I know.

143
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,000
But it’s too late to get it then

144
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,080
You got it, right?

145
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,880
Yes.

146
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,120
Sawasdee krap.

147
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,040
Ah, sawasdee krap.

148
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,920
My name is Arthit.

149
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,760
I’m calling from the Procurement Department of Ocean Electric Company.

150
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,920
May I speak to Khun Supot?

151
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,600
Yes, Supot’s speaking.

152
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,960
What can I do for you?

153
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,240
Well, Khun Supot

154
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,480
the purchase order number 0023247

155
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,720
Is it possible to have the order by the last Friday of this month instead?

156
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,440
Well, Khun Arthit. You can’t rush us.

157
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,960
Actually, when I spoke to Khun John last week,

158
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,680
I thought I could get the purchase order right after we talked

159
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,680
Last week?

160
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,560
Yes.

161
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,960
And I already speed up the production process

162
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
to have it ready by Monday next month.

163
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,120
If that the case, please accept my apologies.

164
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,200
But we really need it by the end of this month.

165
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,440
Can you please rush it for me?

166
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,320
All right, Khun Arthit.

167
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:42,320
Since Khun John and I have been working together,

168
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,960
I try to finish it on Saturday of the end of this month

169
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,240
All right. Saturday is fine.

170
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,960
Sorry again that we can’t rush it and deliver it on Friday.

171
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,560
It’s okay. Thank you very much

172
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,680
Can they do it?

173
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,080
Well, P’John.

174
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,640
Khun Supot said the best he could do is Saturday at the end of this month.

175
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,040
Bummer. I’m not available on that day

176
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,640
A friend from Beijing will come to see me

177
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,360
So I can’t come to the office.

178
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,160
You have to be here to get it for me then

179
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,280
Thank you, Arthit.

180
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,240
Okay. I’ll do it

181
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,920
Sawasdee krap, everyone.

182
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,080
Sawasdee krap/ka

183
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,200
We would like to invite you all

184
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,360
to participate in the initiation activity at the beach

185
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,320
The last Saturday of this month

186
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,960
We guarantee you that it’ll be fun.

187
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,080
We are definitely going, P’Oak

188
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,280
Let’s go together, Khaofang.

189
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,240
Well, I have to ask my mother for permission.

190
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
You don’t need to.

191
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,560
I used to ask my father too

192
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,640
and he said go ahead.

193
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,880
He urged me to go

194
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,440
are you sure we can already invite these juniors?

195
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,280
We haven’t received the authorization yet.

196
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,640
It’s going to be okay.

197
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,160
We can find the way somehow.

198
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,520
Trust me.

199
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,520
All right then, we are going to be at our usual table

200
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,480
Please help spread the invitation for us.

201
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,440
Okay.

202
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,640
May, I bought this for you.

203
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,160
what should we do with that Boss.

204
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,720
I know you have strong skills.

205
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,680
It’s not difficult. You are his senior.

206
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,680
Hey hey, you guys.

207
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,720
Don’t worry.

208
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,480
I and Kong will talk to him.

209
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,320
See?

210
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,080
Nong Day,

211
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,240
we would like to ask you to join the initiation activity at the beach

212
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,520
on the last Saturday of this month.

213
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,120
Please join us.

214
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,440
In this upcoming initiation activity

215
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,240
I want everyone to go there and enjoy

216
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,120
including you

217
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,000
All of us, seniors

218
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,840
and your friends

219
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,680
would like you to join.

220
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,160
Thank you.

221
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,760
But…

222
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,720
please excuse me.

223
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,280
Why?

224
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
Well,

225
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,440
other students have the right to go

226
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,640
I also have the right to not go.

227
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,280
But most of them go.

228
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,760
Most of them?

229
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,320
How do you measure it?

230
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,120
How many names have you got, Kong?

231
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,600
200 names.

232
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,840
What about you, M?

233
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,520
I’ve got 150 names.

234
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,480
I’ve got 150 names too.

235
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,360
So, we’ve reached the target.

236
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:18,840
Yeah.

237
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,440
Really?

238
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,200
You’ve got 150?

239
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,040
Yeah.

240
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,240
Hey, that’s done.

241
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,160
We’ve got 500 names already.

242
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,520
Sweet!

243
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,040
Excuse me.

244
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Sawasdee krap.

245
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,000
Sawasdee krap.

246
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,040
What’s the matter, Khun Kongpob?

247
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,640
I would like to talk to you about the initiation.

248
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,120
I have given you my answer.

249
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,760
Can you please look at this document once again?

250
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,680
The is the name list of students who want to participate in the activity.

251
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,520
May I ask you to reconsider it?

252
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,200
I promise that I won’t do anything that risks damaging the university’s reputation

253
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,800
Receiving products BN, plastic

254
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,520
What’s up?

255
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,840
What are you doing?

256
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,280
Have you eaten?

257
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,760
I’m about to eat the steamed egg you made.

258
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,760
Please enjoy it.

259
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,240
On the last Saturday of this month

260
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,280
we have the initiation activity

261
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,280
I just got the green light this afternoon today.

262
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,240
Please go with me.

263
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,800
Kongpob, I’m sorry but I have to go to the office that day.

264
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,240
I have to cover for a senior colleague.

265
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,520
I already give him my word that I would help

266
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,040
It’s all right.

267
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,600
“Engineering Volunteer Camp
Let’s Grow Trees”

268
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Are you sure you don’t want to join us?

269
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,120
No.

270
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,920
We may think differently.

271
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,200
But I have learned a lot from you.

272
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,320
Thank you.

273
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,400
0058

274
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,160
You don’t have to convince me.

275
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,640
Don’t drag me to grow trees with you.

276
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,600
I can call the police to arrest you for abduction attempt.

277
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,440
Okay.

278
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,920
I’m not here to force anything.

279
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,160
0058, I just want to tell you

280
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,000
if you change your mind

281
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,920
you can still go.

282
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,880
I have told you

283
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,320
not to call me 0058.

284
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,440
Your name is Day.

285
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,920
I can remember.

286
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,120
Mangrove Forest Team

287
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,120
M…

288
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,400
What’s up, Kong?

289
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,120
During the planting activity,

290
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,080
you are in charge of Group 3.

291
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,520
Kong…

292
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Can I see Group 2 instead?

293
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,560
Why?

294
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,680
I want to be in the same group as May.

295
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,280
You see…

296
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,240
I don’t understand her.

297
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,800
I don’t mind she wearing shorts

298
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,200
But we come here to plant trees, right?

299
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,840
it’s not like we are going to shop at a mall.

300
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,800
I don’t want her to look bad to others.

301
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,360
Why don’t you find a good moment and confess your feelings to her?

302
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,040
You can save time on getting jealous like this.

303
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,520
I have showed her how I feel for the past 2 years

304
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,480
Isn’t it enough?

305
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:49,360
Maybe, she is waiting to hear you say it out.

306
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,680
Be bold.

307
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,840
Tew

308
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,280
Huh?

309
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,640
What group are you in charge of?

310
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,240
Group 5.

311
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,880
Are all of them here?

312
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,160
One person couldn’t come.

313
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,720
Hey, Kong.

314
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,280
I and Prae will go down there and be on standby now

315
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,880
Um, go ahead.

316
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,280
Let’s go.

317
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,600
All right, first years.

318
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,360
This is where we plant young plants together

319
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,360
You can wait here for now

320
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,880
Wait for P’M’s group to come out

321
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:36,840
and we will go next.

322
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,200
Those who wear long pants,

323
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,480
you can either fold them up or change.

324
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,680
But those who are not okay to go in there,

325
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,840
you can sit and wait here with me

326
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,760
Please be careful.

327
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,040
If you get injured,

328
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,960
you can come to me or P’Praepailin

329
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,760
If you just look at her from a distance

330
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,920
someone could snatch her away.

331
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,080
What are these for?

332
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,920
Give the water to her.

333
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:14,880
Go.

334
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,280
Come on.

335
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,280
Excuse me.

336
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,920
Can you all help me with these young plants?

337
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,160
Please come here now.

338
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,600
May,

339
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,720
are you tired?

340
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,040
Do you want to drink this?

341
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,840
May,

342
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,280
it’s not good for you to dress like this.

343
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,480
I’m here to plant the trees.

344
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,600
What do you expect me to wear?

345
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,440
something that is less revealing.

346
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,280
It seems like several male juniors want to be near you

347
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,400
They just come to help me.

348
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,080
I don’t think they have hidden agenda.

349
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,560
Another thing is

350
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,800
it depends on the individual

351
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,120
Or you actually think bad of me?

352
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,720
May…

353
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,040
you have mud on your face.

354
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,400
Hey, M.

355
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,000
Thank god you are here

356
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,080
I’m so thirsty.

357
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,080
Can I drink it?

358
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,320
Next,

359
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,280
P’Oak has something to say to you

360
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,000
M,

361
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,920
it’s your and Oak’s cue now

362
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Maprang,

363
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,440
after those two are done giving their speech

364
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,400
Can you take all of them to the beach?

365
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,000
I have to run to do something else now.

366
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:03,720
Okay.

367
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,800
See you.

368
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,160
Sawasdee krap, all of the first years here

369
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,920
We really enjoy all of your performances

370
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,920
But now we want you to be in silent

371
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,080
as we are moving on to the important ritual of tonight’s event.

372
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,280
And we hope you can make the most of it.

373
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,600
Am I right, M?

374
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,680
Ah, yes.

375
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,560
The time I had when I was in my first year

376
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,000
is the most memorable time for me.

377
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,200
It was when I could spend time with others

378
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,680
I got to know people

379
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,320
in the aspects I didn’t know before.

380
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,240
All the feelings I had

381
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,920
were showed through my actions

382
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,960
Without having to say

383
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,400
what I want to mean.

384
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,120
That’s right, P’M.

385
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,120
All the feelings you have just said

386
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,600
We want you all to make the most of this moment.

387
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Now, everyone.

388
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,920
Please stand up.

389
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,840
All of the first years,

390
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,360
Behind me are the gear badges made for your year

391
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,520
and they will be given to you.

392
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,440
We want to do our last duty

393
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
to send you off to get them.

394
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,480
What you said earlier on the stage…

395
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,800
who did you mean?

396
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,480
Well…

397
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,920
I said it in general

398
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,480
You are always you.

399
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,160
No matter how many years have passed

400
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,880
you never bother to tell me your feelings directly

401
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,440
So...

402
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,720
Do I have to say it out

403
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,560
and tell you to make you understand?

404
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,800
I don’t want to assume things.

405
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,640
What I said on the stage…

406
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,880
I…

407
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,040
I meant you.

408
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,880
Did you just tell me you said it in general

409
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,280
I meant it in general

410
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,120
the feelings I have for you.

411
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,880
And…

412
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,520
you know...

413
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,120
what it means, right?

414
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,000
I don’t know, M.

415
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,840
You could think of me as a close friend

416
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,520
Well…I

417
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,600
like you.

418
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,440
I like you more than a close friend

419
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,480
I want to be your boyfriend.

420
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,080
I tell you my feelings directly.

421
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,400
Now

422
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,520
it’s your turn to tell me your feelings

423
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,440
Are you crazy?

424
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,400
There are many people here

425
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,560
How can I say it?

426
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,360
What?

427
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,280
I didn’t hear anything.

428
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,120
Right?

429
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,360
Those kids step on our arm so harshly

430
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,000
I didn’t hear anything too.

431
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,120
Because your arms hurt, right?

432
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,440
It’s so hurtful.

433
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,000
The loser has to drink all. Okay?

434
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,320
The odd man out.

435
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,640
Yes. I’m out

436
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,000
Khaofang.

437
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,000
What are you looking for?

438
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,560
I…

439
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,160
I lost my gear.

440
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,240
Really?

441
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,480
Where did you lose it?

442
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:37,960
I’ll help you find it.

443
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,200
It should be around this area.

444
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,880
When I took it out,

445
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,040
it was gone

446
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,880
Found it.

447
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,800
Hey, Thank you.

448
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,400
Gears are so important to us engineers

449
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,320
Take good care of it.

450
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,960
Uh, P’Kongpob

451
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:17,960
Huh?

452
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,200
I…

453
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,080
Can you take care of it for me?

454
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,120
Do you know the meaning of having someone keeping the gear for you?

455
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,240
I know.

456
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,240
I’m sorry.

457
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,800
But I have already had someone else’s gear in my care.

458
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
I see.

459
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,280
Let’s get inside.

460
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,720
It’s getting late.

461
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,360
Kongpob,

462
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,640
I’m sorry for being here this late.

463
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
How come you got here anyway?

464
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,520
Well, it was Bright.

465
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,680
He is dying to come here.

466
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,440
You know something?

467
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,360
Bright put so much effort into coming here.

468
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,760
He went all the way to pick me up at my office

469
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,640
But we have to go back right away.

470
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,720
I and Bright have work to do tomorrow.

471
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,360
Just you showing up here

472
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,440
I’m happy already.

473
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,760
It’s too bad…

474
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,120
I couldn’t make it to the gear giving ceremony.

475
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,960
Don’t worry.

476
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,760
Everything went smoothly.

477
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,520
What are you talking about?

478
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,440
That isn’t the only thing I feel sorry for.

479
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,720
I also wanted to see you doing the duty of the head hazer for the last time.

480
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,760
It’s a pity that I couldn’t see it.

481
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,920
Why are you smiling?

482
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,520
Kongpob,

483
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
it must be hard for you

484
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,720
to study and take care of all the activities at the same time.

485
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,960
I just want to tell you that…

486
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,880
you are doing great at being the head hazer

487
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,400
So where is…

488
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,160
the reward you promise to give me?

489
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,040
What are you talking about?

490
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,440
No, there’s no reward

491
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,880
When did I promise that to you?

492
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,600
Yes, there is.

493
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,160
Arthit!

494
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,960
Where the hell are you?

495
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,080
Oh, you are there?

496
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,400
I have been looking for you since morning

497
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,720
I got trashed already.

498
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,320
Here, have this.

499
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,960
Kongpob,

500
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,360
do you want to join me and my friends?

501
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,800
Okay.

502
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,280
Let’s go.

503
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,920
Arthit,

504
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,000
where the hell have you been?

505
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,400
Why?

506
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,800
Why did you disappear from me?

507
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,480
You went to be with Kongpob?

508
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,960
♪ Why are you being like this?♪

509
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,600
Seriously, you two

510
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,000
How could you let me give the gears alone?

511
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,880
I have to make my face serious

512
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,600
and look stern, you know?

513
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,840
How stern?

514
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:05,880
Listen,

515
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,280
please study hard.

516
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,720
Now serious face.

517
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:09,720
Well,

518
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,200
study hard, okay?

519
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,040
Study hard?

520
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,000
Trust me, I came here in a hurry.

521
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,680
Arthit kept calling me.

522
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,280
He even took a cab to meet me at my bar.

523
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,840
Look how much he wanted to come here.

524
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,800
You’ve talked too much.

525
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,800
I don’t think we are the reason that he was in a hurry.

526
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,200
That I don’t know.

527
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,520
What are you talking about? I came here for you.

528
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,440
Bright, you wanted to come

529
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,760
Me, wanting to come?

530
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,080
Are you looking at me?

531
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,600
You must want to have a couple picture with me, right?

532
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,480
Come on. Let’s have a picture.

533
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,640
Take a picture for me.

534
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,840
Let’s use your phone camera.

535
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,680
Your phone can take good pictures. I like it.

536
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,240
You must have all of us in your frame.

537
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,120
Let me see.

538
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,880
Look?

539
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,600
The photo comes out nice, right?

540
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,240
Why didn’t you look at the camera?

541
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,400
Arthit…

542
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,920
your eyes were on Kongpob.

543
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,160
What?

544
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,160
No!

545
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,680
Ah, it’s the same.

546
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,360
He mistook Kongpob’s eyes for the camera

547
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,240
I want to show my side view

548
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,280
My side profile is nice.

549
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,360
Hey hey, easy easy. Stop.

550
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,640
Come on.

551
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,800
You are going to be a big burden to me

552
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,040
What, Kratai?

553
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,640
This is just water.

554
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,880
Just water?

555
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,960
By the way, P’Arthit

556
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,400
The company you work for

557
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,640
is it Ocean Electrics?

558
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,240
Yes.

559
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,880
How cool?

560
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,240
You are working for a big company like that

561
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,920
I bet it must be really fun.

562
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,280
To be honest, the company is good

563
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,480
But I don’t get to work in the department I prefer.

564
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,120
The Production Department has no vacant position

565
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,280
So I was transferred to help the Procurement Department instead

566
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,000
And I can apply again.

567
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,480
Really, P’Arthit.

568
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,800
You have already been employed by a big company.

569
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:12,840
Why are you still being picky?

570
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,040
If I were you,

571
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,640
I would be happy to work with any department they want

572
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,320
Well, here’s the thing.

573
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,560
When you graduate and enter the world of working

574
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:23,320
you will see that the world outside

575
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,800
is totally different than what we have on the campus

576
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,400
There is pressure

577
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,440
Everything has its own system and process

578
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,560
Look, I have to get up early to carry on my work.

579
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,920
Listen,

580
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,520
when you have to do the internship

581
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,800
you know what it’s like out there.

582
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,480
Do you understand?

583
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,240
Yes, sir.

584
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,920
After hearing that, I don’t want to graduate now

585
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,920
Yes, you don’t need to hurriedly graduate.

586
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,240
Look at me.

587
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,160
I graduated but I’m still unemployed.

588
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,400
That’s not the case.

589
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,280
It’s not that you don’t have job to do.

590
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,400
You just don’t bother to look for it.

591
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,560
No, I do look for it.

592
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,880
Have you found any job to do?

593
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:02,640
Yes,

594
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,880
I found one job.

595
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,560
What job?

596
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,880
I think you like this job too, Bright

597
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,000
Really? What is it?

598
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:13,960
A photographer for pretty female models at the Motor Show.

599
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,360
P’Arthit krap,

600
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,160
when you arrive Bangkok

601
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,920
can you text me?

602
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,760
Sure.

603
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,560
Don’t worry.

604
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
Bright has slept off for a long time.

605
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,760
We are going to be safe.

606
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,520
Are you going now?

607
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,800
Yes, I should.

608
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,720
I’ll see you again.

609
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,920
Okay.

610
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
Kong…

611
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,040
That’s your reward.

612
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,840
I think…

613
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,440
that’s the reward for being the head hazer

614
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,760
What about the reward of being your boyfriend?

615
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,280
Get it later.

616
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,760
P’Arthit!

617
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,800
Directed by
Padung Smajarn / Pongpisit Botsri

618
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,200
You can play basketball too, P’Arthit?

619
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,800
Just a little bit.

620
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,320
How about a three-point shootout?

621
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,440
Why not?

622
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,680
I have one condition

623
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,720
Which is…

624
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,040
It’s not fun if we compete without something at stake.

625
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,480
If I can make a three-point field goal,

626
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,800
you will let me kiss your cheek.

627
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,960
But if you can make a three-point field goal,

628
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,600
I will let you kiss mine.

629
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,680
What?

630
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,000
No.

631
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,400
I’m at a disadvantage

632
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,720
How about this?

633
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,880
If you can make a three-point field goal

634
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,400
I will let you kiss my cheek.

635
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,120
But if I can make a three-point field goal,

636
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,600
you must do 5 push-ups each

637
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,480
I’ll pull my punches for you.

638
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,080
If you can’t put it in the hoop,

639
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,880
I’ll kiss your cheek.

640
00:40:58,640 --> 00:40:59,640
1

641
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,640
2

642
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:01,560
3

643
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,560
4

644
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,520
5

645
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,520
I’m not pulling my punches now

646
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,560
Okay.

647
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:49,920
Hi.

648
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,680
Sawasdee krap, P’Rock.

649
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,480
What are you playing? Can I join?

650
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,280
We are doing a three-point shootout

651
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:56,920
Do you want to join?

652
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,560
Three-point shootout?

653
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Arthit was the winner of the three-point contest

654
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,080
I better go play that side.

655
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,640
So?

656
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,800
Do you want to continue?

657
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,160
You can’t be serious

658
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,120
How about we play football?

659
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:17,440
What?

660
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,680
Football?

661
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,040
Not in the mood yet.

662
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:35,520
