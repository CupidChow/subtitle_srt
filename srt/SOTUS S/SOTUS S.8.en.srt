1
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,280
Wad.

2
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,640
Why are you here?

3
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,480
Go over there and get the wrist tying.

4
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,040
Yes.

5
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,200
But…

6
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,080
No yes or but. Come on. Come.

7
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,840
It’s all right.

8
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,920
Hey, Wad.

9
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,320
Stop being pretentious already.

10
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,720
Well, there are too many people.

11
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,640
I better be here

12
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,080
Come on. Get in there.

13
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,200
Hurry up.

14
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,240
Okay.

15
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,040
Hi.

16
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,640
Hey, Wad.

17
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,000
Sit down. Let me give you the wrist tying.

18
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,440
Okay.

19
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,600
Give me your hand.

20
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,760
Study hard.

21
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,440
Make the most of your freshman year here.

22
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,760
And…

23
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,000
For what happened in the past

24
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,040
that I was wrong to you.

25
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,280
I’m sorry.

26
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Yes.

27
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,560
I want to apologize to you too.

28
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,800
And…

29
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,600
Thank you so much.

30
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,360
For helping me that day.

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,520
It’s all right.

32
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,000
We are brothers, right?

33
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,840
Thank you.

34
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,760
Let’s take a picture.

35
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,200
Come on.

36
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,080
Is there any part I just taught that you don’t follow?

37
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,120
Me.

38
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,880
Which part don’t you understand, Oak?

39
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,560
All of it.

40
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,960
Eat this, you moron.

41
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,560
It helps feed your brain.

42
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,320
Have a lot of it.

43
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,640
Your brain must be full of other shit.

44
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,200
I thought it was hard passing the admissions test for this faculty.

45
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,920
But now I wish I could get back to my kindergarten.

46
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,680
You can get transferred to the kindergarten level now.

47
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,480
Just hang in there a bit more, guys.

48
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,120
After the exams,

49
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,960
we are going to get on a trip.

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,160
A trip?

51
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,320
You don’t know about this?

52
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,960
The seniors said after the exams,

53
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,160
we would have an off-campus initiation rite.

54
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,560
Where?

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,720
I’m not sure. It’s probably a beach somewhere.

56
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,360
Wait a minute.

57
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,080
How can we be sure that this is just a fun trip?

58
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,360
I have a feeling that those seniors probably have planned to give us another hard time.

59
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,360
I don’t feel like going after thinking about this.

60
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,200
Come on.

61
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,520
Are you bailing on us?

62
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,320
Don’t put it like that.

63
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,520
Come with us, man.

64
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,320
I have a bad feeling about this

65
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,440
One thing that I’m sure of

66
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,240
is that May won’t miss this.

67
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,920
Are you sure you don’t want to go?

68
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,280
All right.

69
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,720
Let me think about it.

70
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,960
Only because you guys want me to go with you.

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,640
I have to ask permission from my mother.

72
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,120
Team, what are you doing?

73
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,600
Sawasdee krup.

74
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,920
Oh, I’m tutoring them Calculus.

75
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,400
Yeah, since you are here.

76
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,480
Why don’t you tell these guys the test you did when you were freshmen?

77
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,120
Calculus?

78
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,400
It was 2 years ago.

79
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,560
Who could remember that?

80
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,600
But I remember this.

81
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,080
In my year, only 5 people got an A

82
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,960
Half of us got an F.

83
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,760
Yeah, I remember now.

84
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,160
The testing time was so crunch.

85
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,040
I was like “what should I do?”

86
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,600
So I ended up writing a pray

87
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,720
wishing for everything to go well for me.

88
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,080
Finally, I got a C.

89
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,760
Seriously?

90
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,360
Mine was better.

91
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,440
I drew a picture of the professor on the answer sheet.

92
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,960
It’s a portrait drawing.

93
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,480
I included every detail.

94
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,840
Even his gray hair.

95
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,320
So?

96
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,400
What grade did you get?

97
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,760
An F.

98
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,600
That’s out of the question.

99
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,080
I guess that didn’t work for you.

100
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,800
Well, just read the lecture notes.

101
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,080
I bet the professor’s test won’t go beyond these notes.

102
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,720
But if you fail,

103
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,320
you can just resit with your juniors next year.

104
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,880
You are putting their spirit down.

105
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,000
Why don’t you wish them good luck?

106
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,960
All right, everyone, press your palms together.

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,560
You too.

108
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,720
“I wish you have a long life, happiness and strength.”

109
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,160
Amen.

110
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,000
Is this how your exam wishes?

111
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,160
This is actually from an abbot.

112
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,280
I didn’t even pass the test, man.

113
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,960
I don’t dare to wish them.

114
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,320
Arthit, you do it.

115
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,880
Well,

116
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,720
If you fail just this small matter,

117
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,480
it means you are an incompetent person.

118
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,600
Even if you graduate, you won’t have a future

119
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,880
No employer wants to hire you.

120
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,400
You will sure get turned down by women.

121
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,720
What you can do is comfort yourself with alcohols

122
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,720
and get ahangover

123
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,880
and sleep in the classrooms until you get kicked out by the teacher.

124
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,520
You keep borrowing your friends’ money.

125
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,120
Always a free loader when it comes to food and booze.

126
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,880
Nobody wants to hang out with you because you are a crappy person.

127
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Are you talking about Prem?

128
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,400
No, it’s you, you jackass.

129
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,440
Okay, I accept.

130
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,640
Well, just read through the lecture notes.

131
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,400
I’m sure you can do it. The exam is not that difficult.

132
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,080
I believe in you guys.

133
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,240
Give it your all

134
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,160
You can do it.

135
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,880
Come on. Let’s get going.

136
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,080
Good luck.

137
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,360
Good luck. See you.

138
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,760
There’s still next year.

139
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,720
Hey hey hey hey, guys.

140
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,520
What happened?

141
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,120
What do you mean?

142
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,280
Those seniors…

143
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,880
they were giggling with you guys like they were not themselves.

144
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,520
Come to think about it, P’Arthit is super cute when he smiles.

145
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,960
Really?

146
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,200
But I like him more when he puts on a serious face. He looks cool.

147
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,240
What’s wrong with you? How could you be this insensible?

148
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,640
He’s so cute. I like it. I don’t know about you.

149
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,120
Let’s get back to where we left off.

150
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,560
Do you still want me to be your tutor?

151
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,360
You may end up resit the class with your juniors next year like P’Arthit said.

152
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,080
Do you want to end up like that?

153
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,240
Come on.

154
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,800
Can I ask you something?

155
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,160
Why should I allow this off-campus initiation rite?

156
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,000
This trip is for all first-year students.

157
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,680
Well…

158
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,080
All the objectives in theories,

159
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,720
like building friendship, unity or doing good deeds for the community

160
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,240
I have pointed out in the document already.

161
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,400
But if you want to hear my thoughts,

162
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,200
when I was in the first year, I got to join this kind of initiation camp.

163
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,520
I was so impressed.

164
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,280
To me, this is one of the best memories I have in my life.

165
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,680
So I want my juniors to have these same experiences year after year.

166
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,760
But if you can’t authorize this.

167
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,960
I and my friends are fine with it.

168
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,600
I just feel sorry for those juniors.

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,160
They don’t get to have this experience.

170
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,000
They can be freshmen only once, you know?

171
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,400
My first girlfriend…

172
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,120
I managed to have her like me when we went on this kind of field trip.

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:46,880
Here you are.

174
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,480
Thank you!

175
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,320
You don’t have pink milk today?

176
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,480
The stall is closed.

177
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,320
Who else knows that you like pink milk?

178
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,040
Why?

179
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,400
You want to tell your friends about it or what?

180
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,040
No. I’m just curious.

181
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,520
So…

182
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,280
Have you told anyone that you like pink milk?

183
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,560
No.

184
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,600
Who else knows that you cried behind the grandstand?

185
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,080
No one.

186
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:43,040
Who else knows that your nickname is Ai-oon?

187
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Kongpob,

188
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,000
Don’t tell anyone about this,

189
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,680
or else…

190
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,080
I’m not gonna tell anyone.

191
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,880
P’Arthit…

192
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,920
When will you have the Calculus exam?

193
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,040
On Wednesday.

194
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,480
The teacher likes to test about the Parallel Cross Section.

195
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,160
Dig that

196
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
Students, you must not cheat.

197
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,080
If you do, I give you an F.

198
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,360
Get on the bus.

199
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,840
Boy checked.

200
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,200
P’Cream, sawasdee krup.

201
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,480
Sawasdee ka.

202
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,960
So you guys are on the bus no.4.

203
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,800
This one?

204
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,080
Yes. It’s this one.

205
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,280
Well, P’Cream.

206
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,880
Is this initiation activity harsh?

207
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,280
No, it’s not.

208
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,200
This is just a fun trip after the exams.

209
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,080
I see.

210
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,440
Why? Are you scared?

211
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,280
Yes.

212
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,160
If you’ll excuse…

213
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,440
Wait. It’s this way.

214
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,000
His father is afraid that he will be forced to drink alcohol.

215
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,720
Or he will be ordered to do the push up until his back breaks.

216
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,880
Actually it’s not my father who is afraid.

217
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,680
Come on. You are this old.

218
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,480
Alcohols are nothing to you.

219
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,680
And there’s no such thing like forcing or disciplining.

220
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,160
Look at those hazers.

221
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,240
They look so chill.

222
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,440
Excuse me.

223
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,320
Can I have a picture with you guys?

224
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,360
Of course. Come in.

225
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,000
1..2..3

226
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,880
1..2..3

227
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,080
Thank you.

228
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,920
Thank you.

229
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,160
You guys, when those seniors are in casual clothes.

230
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,120
They are all cute, right?

231
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,600
Maprang, you are too loud.

232
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
They may hear you.

233
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,240
I mean it.

234
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,120
Look at P’Arthit.

235
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,960
He looks so dazzling. I like it.

236
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,920
Well, I think he is…not bad.

237
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,640
But still not my type.

238
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,520
Really?

239
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,520
Then, what is your type?

240
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,680
She can be picky because she’s pretty.

241
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,400
I don’t know but I like P’Arthit.

242
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,080
He’s my type. I want him

243
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,120
Keep it down.

244
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,920
Let’s do a selfie.

245
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,080
Don’t need to be worried.

246
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,320
Get on this bus. I have to check over there.

247
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,920
It’s this one.

248
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,800
So?

249
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,480
I think those girls are shifty

250
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,360
When those seniors were harsh, those girls were terrified.

251
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,760
Now that those seniors are relaxed, those girls are swooning over them.

252
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,560
That’s how women are like.

253
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,640
Kong,

254
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,320
when you are at the beach,

255
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,080
take off your shirt and show off your six packs.

256
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,160
Those girls will swoon over you too.

257
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,040
Nah.

258
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,520
I don’t like swimming in the sea.

259
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,200
You are playing hard to get again.

260
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,800
Fine, I’ll do it myself.

261
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,000
Should I do it now?

262
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,080
You sounds like you can’t wait to get in the sea

263
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,720
Fine, you’ll get that soon.

264
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,960
Glasses boy, your eyeglasses are disturbing.

265
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,080
You glasses boy!

266
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,920
What did you say?

267
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,160
We are in trouble again.

268
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,960
I’m going home now.

269
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,120
They just teased us for fun. They didn’t mean it.

270
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,320
All right.

271
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,520
For this group of first years.

272
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,440
I heard that you really wanted to get into the sea.

273
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,640
So, I let you guys swim in the sea as much as you like

274
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,040
Don’t be too excited.

275
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,680
They probably tell us to do some weird things.

276
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,240
Finally, I have been waiting for this moment to be in the sea

277
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,960
Okay, all male first years, get into the sea

278
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,320
Get up now.

279
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,600
Only male juniors.

280
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,560
Take off your shirt and get in the sea.

281
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,640
And for the rest female juniors.

282
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,600
Move up forward and I’ll sing you a song.

283
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,840
Look, those girls get to sit there, listening to a song and relax.

284
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,640
Why do we have to get soaked in the sea like this? Why?

285
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,360
This is a double standard

286
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,240
May I?

287
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,560
What’s the problem?

288
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,880
I think it’s not fair.

289
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,920
You guys enjoy singing

290
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,160
while we are floating in the sea under the sun.

291
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,800
Why?

292
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,400
If this small task is too much for you to do,

293
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,480
I don’t think you can do anything else

294
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,440
I can do anything.

295
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,960
I admit that some of your activities are good

296
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,040
But there are also some activities…

297
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,360
that I find them unreasonable.

298
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,440
Are you sure that you can do anything?

299
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,880
Then, go there at the sea alone.

300
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,720
Your head is hot, right?

301
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,560
Why don’t you cool it down in the sea?

302
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,360
Go!

303
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,520
Okay, let’s get back to our song.

304
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,840
Kongpob, are you okay?

305
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,440
You can’t die on me!

306
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,040
Keep breathing.

307
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,240
What’s wrong?

308
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,400
Did you get cramps?

309
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,920
Did you get stung by jellyfish?

310
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,320
I’m okay.

311
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,560
How can you be okay?

312
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
I saw you got drowned in the water for a long time.

313
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,960
You told me to cool down my head.

314
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,280
Kongpob, have you gone mad?

315
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,000
If I tell you to die, will you do it?

316
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,680
Use your brain and think.

317
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,400
What happened?

318
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,360
Nothing!

319
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,800
Call it a day!

320
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,960
Kong, are you okay?

321
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,840
Huh?

322
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,400
I saw P’Arthit rushed to help you.

323
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,160
I’m really worried, you know.

324
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,200
I didn’t even know when you disappeared.

325
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,200
Are you okay now?

326
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,440
You are okay, right?

327
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,360
Let’s get up there.

328
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,760
Let’s get out of here.

329
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,080
I think Prae and Kongpob are a good match.

330
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,760
The star and the moon. You two are cute together.

331
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,320
It’s a good idea.

332
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,480
If we are drunk,

333
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,120
those seniors may find it hard to take care all of us.

334
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,440
Forget it.

335
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,120
Since we are here at the beach, we must have booze.

336
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,600
You can’t say you have come to the beach if you don’t have booze.

337
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,800
Am I right?

338
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,160
Do you think it’s a good idea?

339
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,440
Let me go find some booze for you guys.

340
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,400
Wait a minute.

341
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,000
We can just sit and share stories without booze.

342
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,200
I’ll go find some for you.

343
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,760
Your booze is here, my dear friends.

344
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,440
Look at these

345
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,400
Hey, where did you get them?

346
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,120
I stole from the seniors.

347
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
How?

348
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,840
Didn’t they say we can’t have alcohols?

349
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,240
Yes, they did.

350
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,560
You are going to be in trouble.

351
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,640
Another thing is.

352
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,880
The girls want to drink too.

353
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,480
Which girls?

354
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,840
Where are they?

355
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,680
You’ll find out in not time.

356
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,440
You are full of hot air.

357
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,160
We want to drink.

358
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,840
We have come to the beach, we should have booze party.

359
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,560
If we are sober when we wake up, those seniors won’t know about it.

360
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,920
Let’s cheers.

361
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,920
Cheers!

362
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,600
Prae, I have a question.

363
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,160
You are so damn beautiful.

364
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,240
Why don’t you have a boyfriend yet?

365
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,920
Why don’t you have a boyfriend?

366
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,160
I think, Prae and Kongpob are a good match.

367
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,800
The star and the moon. You two are cute together.

368
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,320
Many people are shipping you two, you know?

369
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,320
What do you think of this idea?

370
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,560
I can help you.

371
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,000
Honestly speaking…

372
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,560
I…

373
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,000
I don’t like men.

374
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,920
What?

375
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,840
I don’t like men.

376
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,800
Are you serious?

377
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,440
You don’t like men?

378
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,680
No, I don’t.

379
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,520
But you two don’t need to worry.

380
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,760
You are my friends.

381
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,920
I won’t have feelings for you.

382
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,520
If a beautiful person like you has feelings for me,

383
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,720
I really don’t mind.

384
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,760
Shit!

385
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,160
What are you doing?

386
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,720
P’Arthit. Be quiet.

387
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,680
Oh my gosh. What should we do?

388
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,760
What? He has our room key?

389
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:51,040
Gosh, he has a spare key.

390
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,080
We are so done.

391
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,720
P’Arthit.

392
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,680
P’Arthit.

393
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,560
I’m sorry.

394
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,400
I know that I broke the rules.

395
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,280
But please give me one more chance.

396
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,360
I will do anything.

397
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,280
I promise that something like this won’t happen again.

398
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,840
Are you sure…

399
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,080
that you will do everything I say?

400
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,520
I am.

401
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,640
Then tomorrow, you are all grounded.

402
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,720
And I will cancel all of the activities tomorrow.

403
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,920
And for you,

404
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,800
Do me a favor and get the hell out of my sight.

405
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,360
You broke the rules.

406
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,840
It shows that you don’t have respect for us at all.

407
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,320
We have nothing to talk about anymore.

408
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,960
How much longer do we have to be here?

409
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,440
It’s kind of great, actually.

410
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,360
We don’t have to do anything

411
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,760
I can’t believe you.

412
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,200
Don’t you feel sorry for your actions for once?

413
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,360
By the way,

414
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,360
what should we do for the first-year performance?

415
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,880
Haven’t the seniors called that off too?

416
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,960
I don’t think so.

417
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,960
They have told me just now.

418
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,920
Then we’re screwed.

419
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,160
What should we perform?

420
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,680
Ladies, help us think about the performance.

421
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,880
I can’t think of anything at this moment

422
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,120
I have an idea.

423
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,760
What is it?

424
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,840
Let’s reenact the dialogue where Kongpob wanted to make P’Arthit his wife.

425
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,680
do you think it’s a good idea?

426
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,240
We may get into trouble for that.

427
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,040
Yes, it’s a good idea.

428
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,280
Dramas should be based on true stories.

429
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,280
Hey, what are you guys talking about?

430
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,560
I suggest that we perform an act

431
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:53,440
with the scene where Kong wanted to make P’Arthit his wife.

432
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,400
I think it’s going to be brilliant.

433
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,760
Dramas should be based on true stories. Trust me.

434
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,080
It’s going to work. Trust me.

435
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
Let’s give it a try.

436
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,320
Take it like we just want to mimic the seniors for fun.

437
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,080
You take all the responsibilities.

438
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,640
Ask Kong.

439
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,600
Hey, Kong.

440
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,440
Are you cool with this?

441
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,640
Let’s do this.

442
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,440
Fine. Do whatever you like.

443
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,720
Fantastic.

444
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,640
Then, we’ll do this.

445
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,320
Let’s do this.

446
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,920
One huge round of applause please

447
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,560
So, this is the performance from P’Deer.

448
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,800
He’s got the look and the talent.

449
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,840
You can now sit back and relax.

450
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,720
Now, it’s time for the show from the first years.

451
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,200
Please come up here and get ready.

452
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,480
Who are our performers?

453
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,280
Come up here.

454
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,120
Do you see this gear badge?

455
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,080
This gear is the pride of our engineering faculty

456
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,880
Hey, Oak.

457
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,240
why this dialogue?

458
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,440
Hey, I did ask you.

459
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,120
I asked if you were cool with it.

460
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,480
And you nodded.

461
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,600
This is how it’s supposed to be.

462
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,120
Dramas must base on true stories.

463
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,800
So it has a climax.

464
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,760
What will you do?

465
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,280
I just take it from you.

466
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,080
How?!

467
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,200
Stop!

468
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,040
Is this funny to you?

469
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,040
I think you are way out of line.

470
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,560
This is not funny to me.

471
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,800
You dare to perform this.

472
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,160
Does this mean you don’t want to get the gear badges from us?

473
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,680
Enough and get the hell out of the stage.

474
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,720
You all will be punished.

475
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,000
Keep your head down!

476
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,160
Keep your head down!

477
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,800
Close your eyes and keep your head down!

478
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
It’s on.

479
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,480
The recording has started.

480
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,960
So we are recording now?

481
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,320
Yes. We are recording.

482
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,280
You can start.

483
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,920
Yes, just start your speech.

484
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,760
What do you want me to say?

485
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,040
Come on. Just say what you want to say.

486
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,320
Things you have in your mind.

487
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,040
Say it.

488
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:40,760
In my mind?

489
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,240
We don’t have all day. Hurry up.

490
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,320
First years…

491
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,280
You probably know by now that all we have done

492
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,840
are simply our duty and our intention.

493
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,320
It’s a long duty we have been doing for the past 3 months

494
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,120
in order to make you unite as one.

495
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,000
Having said that…

496
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
if any of us upset you in any way,

497
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,400
or make you feel bad,

498
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,000
we are truly sorry.

499
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,360
Lastly,

500
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,520
if you want to do anything,

501
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,160
you still need our permission every time.

502
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,320
But…

503
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,440
We do have to ask for your permission too.

504
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:23,960
Can you let us be your seniors?

505
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,480
If you let us be your seniors,

506
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,920
go see us at the beach.

507
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,080
We are waiting for you there.

508
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,280
First years,

509
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,880
Behind us, you will get the gear badges of your year class.

510
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,000
And this is our last duty…

511
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,880
We would like to send you off to get them.

512
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,640
P’Arthit.

513
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,960
I’m sorry.

514
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,960
Go ahead

515
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,000
Thanks a lot. See you.

516
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,240
Sawasdee krup.

517
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,760
What’s your name again?

518
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,640
I’m Kongpob.

519
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,120
I heard that…

520
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,680
it was you who came up with the chanting idea for Arthit

521
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,880
on the flag capturing day, wasn’t it?

522
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:43,720
Yes.

523
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,640
Your idea is great.

524
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,840
By the way,

525
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,600
do you want to become the leader of hazing staff for me?

526
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,400
Me?

527
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,800
Yes, it’s you.

528
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,600
All right. I’ll let you think about it.

529
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:02,800
But take this as I have saved the spot for you. Okay?

530
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,320
This is your gear.

531
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,520
Gears are meaningful for us, engineers.

532
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,480
So…

533
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,120
keep it well

534
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,320
Thank you

535
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,360
All right. See you.

536
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,600
P’Arthit.

537
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,640
I…

538
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,760
I have something to talk to you.

539
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,840
What is it about?

540
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,320
I…

541
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,800
I want to apologize.

542
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,360
For what?

543
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,080
For everything that made you mad.

544
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,160
If you know that I would get mad when you do

545
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,320
why do you still do it?

546
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,200
Well, I think…

547
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,040
Cut it out.

548
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,160
I don’t want to argue with you anymore. I’m tired.

549
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,000
Want some?
