1
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,720
P’Arthit krap,

2
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,200
please wake up.

3
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,040
please wake up.

4
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,600
Kongpob.

5
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,360
Why didn’t you wake me up?

6
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,360
I tried to wake you so many times.

7
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,280
You didn’t wake up.

8
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,480
But it’s 7.30 a.m. now.

9
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,840
I told you many times that I couldn’t be late today.

10
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,800
Your towel.

11
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,880
Do you want me to go with you?

12
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,440
It’s okay. You can go straight to the uni.

13
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,480
I think I take a motorcycle taxi.

14
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,840
Your class will start soon, right?

15
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,120
You should hurry and go to the uni now

16
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,720
If I’m late at work today.

17
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,440
I’ll order you to do a push-up.

18
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,080
If it’s you who gives me the order,

19
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,120
I will do everything you want me to

20
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,840
P’Arthit krap.

21
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,160
What?

22
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,040
What are you doing?

23
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,040
I just want to take a photo of you going to work on your first day.

24
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,280
When I look back at it

25
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,560
I know that I was with you on your important day.

26
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,840
Sawasdee, all first-year students.

27
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,120
My name is Kongpob.

28
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,480
I’m your third-year senior in this Faculty of Engineering.

29
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,280
I’m also the head of the hazing team

30
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,000
I have a duty to look after you

31
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,760
throughout your first year here

32
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So you can be disciplined.

33
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,800
I would like to ask all of you

34
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,280
to strictly comply with our rules.

35
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,240
However

36
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,320
if you disagree with any of our rules

37
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,200
you can come to discuss with me anytime.

38
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,120
I welcome all feedback and opinions.

39
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,880
This is a gear badge.

40
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The symbol of us, engineering people

41
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,800
Gears are cogwheels that work together systematically for a mechanism.

42
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,200
if a cogwheel is missing.

43
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,200
gears can’t function properly.

44
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,560
It’s the honor and dignity of us all

45
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,840
not just one particular person.

46
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,040
So today

47
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,680
I have an activity

48
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,520
for you all to prove the meaning of it.

49
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,320
I want you

50
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,320
to use your activity notebook

51
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,400
as a tool to know all of the seniors

52
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,280
all 1,000 seniors

53
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,160
by asking them to sign on your notebook

54
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,680
Get their signatures as many as you can

55
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,920
I give you 1 week.

56
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,240
But…

57
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,720
I’m not gonna demand you to get all 1,000 signatures

58
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,320
the purpose of this activity

59
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,040
is to make all of us know each other as many as possible

60
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,000
Do you think you can do it?

61
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,520
Yes.

62
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,400
I hope all of you

63
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,480
put your effort into getting to know your seniors

64
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,280
I’m sure the seniors…

65
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
want to know you as well.

66
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,200
First day: The seniors want to know freshmen

67
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,880
but ask the freshmen to come to them by means of paper.

68
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,120
Sawasdee krap.

69
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,280
Sawasdee ka.

70
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,120
My name is Arthit.

71
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,400
I’m here to drop my transcript

72
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,600
Give me a sec.

73
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,560
Khun Arthit.

74
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,520
you used to work in the Production Department.

75
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,960
Yes.

76
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,760
Well, is there still no unfilled position in the Production

77
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,680
Like we informed you earlier

78
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,360
All positions are filled

79
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,760
I see.

80
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,120
How is the Procurement Department here?

81
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,000
Well,

82
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,360
it’s a bit hectic there

83
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,640
You’ll find out when you start working tomorrow.

84
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,640
Here you are.

85
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,240
Thank you.

86
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,800
Arthit Rojanapat
Procurement Engineer

87
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,680
For the initiation ritual this year,

88
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,080
I think I make it different than the previous years

89
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,480
I think what they did the in past

90
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,800
involved too much order.

91
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,360
So many first years did not want to participate the gathering activities

92
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,440
I agree.

93
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,760
When we were first years

94
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,000
Many students didn’t want to join

95
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
We cut down some physical challenge activities

96
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,240
and add more the activities that make them see the benefits of the gathering.

97
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,640
I want this year’s initiation ritual

98
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,280
has the most benefit to the first years

99
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,800
Thank you so much for coming today

100
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,680
I and my friends are going to P’Bright’s bar.

101
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,520
Come join us.

102
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,080
May,

103
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,920
let me help.

104
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,760
Are you sure?

105
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,080
Yeah.

106
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,320
Thank you

107
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,880
Can you take this one too?

108
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,440
I bring the spoons later.

109
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,760
You bring the spoons?

110
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,560
Yes

111
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,200
When you want to help her with something,

112
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,080
why don’t you just tell her directly?

113
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,840
I’m not her boyfriend.

114
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,280
If I do anything too much, it’s not good

115
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,040
Why don’t you ask her out yet?

116
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,520
It’s been 3 years.

117
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,160
It’s not easy to change from friend to boyfriend.

118
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,640
I’m not you.

119
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,800
You asked P’Arthit out when you were just a first year

120
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
How has it been, these 3 years?

121
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,560
You are still sweet toward each other, right?

122
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,680
Too sweet that I can even see ants

123
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,720
What are you talking about?

124
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,520
You are exaggerating

125
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,200
He has to work.

126
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,920
I have the gathering activities to take care of.

127
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,800
We hardly see each other.

128
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,800
And now he’s got a position in his company.

129
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,200
This bar of yours

130
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,280
is so hot.

131
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,520
Your T-shirt is nice.

132
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,760
I know, right?

133
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,440
Ghost Ship?

134
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,760
The seller is handsome.

135
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,280
So I bought it

136
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,720
Bring me there next time.

137
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,560
Sure.

138
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,160
What about you, P’Knot?

139
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,480
Where are you working?

140
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,520
I’m still doing my master degree.

141
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,560
I have to find a topic for my research

142
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,880
It’s even more tiring than when I was in undergrad school

143
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:02,880
I see

144
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,840
What about you, P’Arthit?

145
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,800
Me?

146
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,400
Well, I just got put in a position. And today is my first day.

147
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,000
But I didn’t get to be in the Production Department.

148
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,000
I’m in the Procurement Department now.

149
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,480
There’s no position available there yet.

150
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,760
I have to wait for a position to be opened

151
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,280
and I transfer to work in the Production Department later

152
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,240
You are lucky, Arthit.

153
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,200
I’m still unemployed.

154
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,960
Why are you being dramatic all of sudden?

155
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,440
Being unemployed is lucky too.

156
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,960
Because owning a bar is so damn tiring. It’s so chaotic

157
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,160
I have to do accounting,

158
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,440
fight with the head chef.

159
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,800
You know what?

160
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,760
You are luckier than me

161
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,160
Don’t tell me

162
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,200
that you father force you to marry someone.

163
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,800
Marry someone my feet.

164
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,400
I picked the red card.

165
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,720
I have to enlist to military

166
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,240
I have to leave you for military, honey.

167
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
Since when I’m your honey.

168
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,480
Just now.

169
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,840
You all are third years now, right?

170
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Have you planned yet?

171
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,320
After the gathering activity is over,

172
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,960
where will you apply for an internship?

173
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,360
Come on, P’Knot.

174
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,720
It’s still far ahead

175
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,520
The first semester has just started.

176
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,720
Time flies, you know?

177
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,600
Have a thought about it.

178
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,000
You are third years now.

179
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,400
Trust me, it will come really quick

180
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,960
look at Bright’s face, for example

181
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,600
It doesn’t take long at all to become like this.

182
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,400
What do you mean?

183
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,960
My face is still bright.

184
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,960
Well, think about it

185
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,800
It’s not that serious.

186
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,720
Excuse me, I think I should go home now.

187
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,800
Why?

188
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,400
Tomorrow, I have to buy stuff for the gathering in the morning.

189
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,400
I don’t want to go home late.

190
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,280
How do you go home?

191
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
Do you want Bright to give you a ride?

192
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
(Take her home)

193
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,200
All right. Let me give you a ride. Come on.

194
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,360
It’s okay. I can take her home.

195
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,840
I see. Go ahead.

196
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,560
Sawasdee ka.

197
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,240
Bye bye. Take care.

198
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,720
Bright, I’m heading out now.

199
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,720
Okay.

200
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,840
Hold on, P’Arthit.

201
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,920
I have something for you.

202
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,640
You don’t like it?

203
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,520
Huh?

204
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,160
No.

205
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,240
But it’s not my birthday today.

206
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,800
And it’s not any anniversary date.

207
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,600
It’s the gift for your first day at work

208
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,440
When you use this pen,

209
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,520
you have me right beside you all the time.

210
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Ew,

211
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,880
don’t be cheesy.

212
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,320
Then, give it back to me.

213
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,480
No, no taking back.

214
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,920
You are being stingy too.

215
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,920
That’s right. Don’t you know?

216
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,840
I know.

217
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,080
I’m your boyfriend

218
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,800
How could I not know?

219
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,520
Come on.

220
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:06,600
Let’s go home.

221
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,240
I have work to do early in the morning tomorrow.

222
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,520
Let me take you to your apartment.

223
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,160
But you have the gathering activity in the morning tomorrow

224
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,000
I’m not tired.

225
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,120
But I worry about you.

226
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,040
Don’t overdo your work

227
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,880
How is your first freshmen gathering?

228
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,240
It was okay

229
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,200
Everything went well

230
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,000
No freshmen giving you a headache like I got when I was the head hazer, right?

231
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,560
Do you mean me?

232
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,280
Yeah.

233
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,680
The one and only

234
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,080
Even there is one like that, I’m not afraid.

235
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,680
I went through the extreme test with you already.

236
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,640
Hazing Staff Test.

237
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,040
6 months ago.

238
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,760
This is your test.

239
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,680
You must haze me

240
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,840
and I play the role of a freshman.

241
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,720
You may start.

242
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,800
First years!

243
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,760
Where are all your friends?

244
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
Why does no one care to answer?

245
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:33,400
Well then, I’m going to call your ID randomly.

246
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,960
If he or she cannot answer

247
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,480
Everyone here

248
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,080
will get punished.

249
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,360
Student ID 0206

250
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,920
Come out in the front!

251
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,200
Where are all your friends?

252
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,240
I don’t know.

253
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,440
How could you not know?

254
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,040
Every question I ask.

255
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,080
You must answer.

256
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,680
Understood?

257
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,080
Understood.

258
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,800
Do you see this gear?

259
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,440
Yes, I do.

260
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,920
This is the gear made for each Engineering year class

261
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,480
If you cannot prove to me that you deserve this gear badge for your year

262
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,760
You might as well walk out of here now

263
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,320
and I won’t consider you

264
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,080
as our juniors

265
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,400
Now, answer me, Khun Arthit

266
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,080
If I don’t give you this gear,

267
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,240
what are you going to do?

268
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,040
I just take it from you.

269
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,520
Do you think you can just take it from me?

270
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,880
It’s no-brainer.

271
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,920
How!?

272
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,680
I just…

273
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,040
make you my wife.

274
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,320
They say, what belongs to your lover is also yours.

275
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,000
If I can make you my wife,

276
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,240
your gear badge is also mine.

277
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,600
Are you sure

278
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,440
you want to do it right here?

279
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
Are you ready for it?

280
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,640
Shall we start?

281
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,040
No no no no.

282
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,200
Stop it right there.

283
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,800
What’s so funny?

284
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,560
Who said you could talk to your friends?!

285
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,720
Khun Arthit

286
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,400
Student ID 0206

287
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,120
You will get the following punishment

288
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,080
Kiss my cheek 200 times.

289
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,960
Huh?

290
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,880
What’s not clear in my order?

291
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,120
I told you to kiss my cheek 200 times.

292
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,720
Now!

293
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,480
Wait a minute.

294
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,040
Usually,

295
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,040
the punishments are doing a push-up or squat jump

296
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,840
Why is it kissing now?

297
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,400
Why?

298
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,920
Didn’t you just said

299
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,080
that you would make me your wife?

300
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,360
And for a man to kiss his wife’s cheeks

301
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,040
what’s wrong with that?

302
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,360
Enough. Enough

303
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,280
Kongpob, you are good to go

304
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,840
He’s good to go!

305
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,600
He’s good to go!

306
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,640
Fiiiiine.

307
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,120
Fiiiiine.

308
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,040
Are you okay?

309
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,280
Stop laughing.

310
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,880
You always ruin my image.

311
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,440
Come on, P’Arthit.

312
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,800
I just played along with my role.

313
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,560
Yeah,

314
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:39,960
you still owe me those 200 cheek kisses.

315
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,760
What?

316
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,320
What are you talking about?

317
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,120
Stop it.

318
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,040
The training was over.

319
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,120
Think of it as a special training.

320
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,320
When I have to deal with a situation,

321
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,040
I can sort it out and solve it.

322
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,320
Really?

323
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,720
NO!

324
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,240
Please.

325
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:58,800
Stop it.

326
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,720
All right, you don’t have to kiss me 200 times

327
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,080
Just one soft kiss on my cheek…

328
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,520
…is fine.

329
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
Don’t look at me like you are going to get it

330
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
NO!

331
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,400
Come on, P’Arthit.

332
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,160
P’Arthit

333
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,760
Excuse me.

334
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,640
Where are all the people here?

335
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:35,600
Ah, they are in the meeting room

336
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,560
All of them are here quite early

337
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,880
Well the, I have to excuse myself

338
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,680
Finally, you are here.

339
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,840
Come this way

340
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,360
Go to that notebook.

341
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,800
Here.

342
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Why are you so late?

343
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,000
Why are you so late?

344
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,360
Check it for me.

345
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,160
Well..

346
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,520
Here’s what happened,

347
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,480
I don’t know what is wrong with my notebook.

348
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,400
When I plug my flash drive into it,

349
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,400
nothing shows.

350
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,120
Uh…

351
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,760
I think your flash dive is virus infected.

352
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,920
Virus?

353
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,920
What virus? How come it gets infected

354
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,320
What virus? How come it gets infected

355
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,040
Help me look into it.

356
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,200
Okay.

357
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,120
Give me a moment.

358
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,840
I’m sorry. I’m sorry

359
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,480
You should have been more prepared

360
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,280
I don’t have all day to wait for you.

361
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,240
Please accept my apology.

362
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,880
Get this thing done quickly.

363
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,040
Next time,

364
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,400
when you call me to any meeting,

365
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,160
please ensure that everything is in place.

366
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,880
I’m so sorry.

367
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,320
Well, thank you anyway

368
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,160
You can go back to your IT department

369
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,760
I’m not from the IT department.

370
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,200
What?

371
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,200
What?

372
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,760
So who are you?

373
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,720
Why did you get in here?

374
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,720
Uh…

375
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,680
My name is Arthit.

376
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,280
I’ve just been appointed to the Procurement Department

377
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,120
And today is my first day

378
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,840
What can I do for you?

379
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,920
About earlier,

380
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,480
I’m sorry.

381
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,520
It’s not a big deal. Don’t worry.

382
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,960
I dragged you in without checking thoroughly

383
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,840
Well, your young appearance

384
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,400
got me thinking that you are from IT Department

385
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,040
Your name is Arthit, right?

386
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,760
My name is Som-O.

387
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,120
I’m the secretary of P’Danai

388
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,680
the Procurement Manager

389
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,800
Your name is Arthit, right?

390
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,280
Follow me to my room.

391
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,400
I’m Danai.

392
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,920
I’m the manager here.

393
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,680
Let me welcome you to the Procurement Department

394
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,960
You may notice that the scopes of job here

395
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,960
are different than what you have done before

396
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,240
At the moment,

397
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,320
our company has to produce a lot of products.

398
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,080
So our duty here

399
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,280
is to find suitable material

400
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,840
and deliver to the production team on time

401
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,560
Having you here in this department

402
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,800
I do hope that we can complete all the tasks faster.

403
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,440
Absolutely

404
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,240
All right, you can find an empty desk out there yourself.

405
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:01,440
Okay.

406
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,680
Okay.

407
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,360
Size M, please.

408
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,320
What’s your name? I need to check.

409
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,000
My name is Dechawut.

410
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,920
Your student ID?

411
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,040
0058

412
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,720
Here you are.

413
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,160
Hey!

414
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,600
You forgot your stuff.

415
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,160
Excuse me.

416
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,960
Does that fighting fish belong to you?

417
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,920
No.

418
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,680
It belongs to the former guy.

419
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,080
My name is Arthit.

420
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,560
May I know what is your…

421
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,880
P’Earth, P’Danai is asking for you.

422
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,520
Sawasdee.

423
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,000
Your name is Bonus, right?

424
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,160
I’m Arthit

425
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,920
No one cares to talk to me

426
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,440
P’Tew,

427
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
My name is Khao Fang.

428
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,280
Can you sign for me?

429
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,720
Sure, N’Khao Fang.

430
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,840
You’ve got quit a lot of signatures already

431
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,960
Thank you.

432
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,640
Please do your best.

433
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,080
Excuse me.

434
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,040
Can you also sign for me?

435
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,880
My name is Kratai.

436
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,280
You are so kind.

437
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,640
Other seniors ask me to dance before giving me their signatures

438
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,640
Really? I’m not asking you to do things

439
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,320
as I want us to know each other faster

440
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,680
But if you are asked to do things. I’m sure it’s going to be fun.

441
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,200
Yes. Thank you so much.

442
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,040
Please do your best.

443
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,000
Where are you going, Kong?

444
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:51,920
I’m getting a drink.

445
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I’ll be back.

446
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,800
P’Kongpob,

447
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,960
can you sign for me?

448
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,680
My name is Kratai.

449
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,000
Just one K?

450
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,760
My name consists of 5 letters.

451
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,520
If you want my complete signature

452
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,520
you will need to get 5 more seniors’ signatures.

453
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,040
Then come back to me.

454
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,600
Got it, P’Kong.

455
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,280
Thank you.

456
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,080
My name is Khao Fang.

457
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,160
I’m a first year, majoring in Industrial Engineering.

458
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,720
Can I have your signatures?

459
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,040
I saw you ask Kongpob to sign.

460
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,040
What did he ask you to do?

461
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,440
He asked me to come to you.

462
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:38,360
He said I needed 5 more signatures and he would sign for me.

463
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,440
5 signatures.

464
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,680
But we will give you our signatures under a condition too.

465
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,000
What is it?

466
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,680
You must show us the grilled-chicken dance

467
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,560
and we sign for you.

468
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,400
Right here?

469
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,640
That’s right.

470
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,920
If you are shy, you can bring your friend to dance with you.

471
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,960
Okay.

472
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,240
I’ll be back shortly.

473
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,320
Grilled-chicken dance sounds familiar to me

474
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,640
Familiar?

475
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,760
What are you talking about?

476
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,600
You didn’t remember?

477
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,600
No.

478
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,840
Hey, help me.

479
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,040
My name is Khao Fang.

480
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,280
I’m in the same sector as yours.

481
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:23,880
Can you help me?

482
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,600
Come on.

483
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,920
Hold on, Khun Khao Fang.

484
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,760
You said you needed my help

485
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,080
What kind of help?

486
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:32,200
Just now, I have asked some seniors to sign for me

487
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,120
They said I needed to find someone to do the grilled-chicken dance together.

488
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
Would you help me?

489
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,640
Why the grilled-chicken dance?

490
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,840
And why do you need their signatures?

491
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,040
Well, it’s just a dance

492
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,640
Why do you have so many questions?

493
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,640
I asked you why

494
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,840
because I don’t understand why you need to dance

495
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,120
in order to acquire the seniors’ signatures.

496
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,400
It doesn’t make sense.

497
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,680
Actually, I think you should…

498
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,600
It doesn’t make sense? How?

499
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,760
All we do is just dance.

500
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,200
Why so serious?

501
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,320
If you want to do

502
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,640
you should do it for good reasons

503
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,280
not just do the grilled-chicken dance

504
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,720
to please those seniors.

505
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,440
I think that doesn’t make sense.

506
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,800
And what doesn’t make sense the most is that

507
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,960
you have to get 1,000 signatures

508
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,240
from the people you can’t be bothered to know

509
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,800
It’s just some fun activities that the seniors provide for us.

510
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,440
You don’t need to read too much into it.

511
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,960
Fun activities?

512
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,120
Without good reasons?

513
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,480
It doesn’t make sense anyway.

514
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,120
Please excuse me

515
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,920
Oat, Kong,

516
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,880
I’m going to talk to that kid.

517
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,160
I think you should let him be

518
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,480
I can’t

519
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,680
He’s my direct line junior.

520
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,760
Here you are.

521
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,360
I’ll be back

522
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,640
♪ The chicken is being grilled.♪
♪ The chicken is being grilled.♪

523
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,280
♪ It gets skewered. Ouch! ♪
♪ It gets skewered. Ouch! ♪

524
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,640
♪ Skewering on its left wing. ♪

525
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,160
♪ Skewering on its right wing. ♪

526
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,880
♪ The flame is so hot. Really really hot. ♪

527
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,400
So the chicken gets skewered on its wings now

528
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,640
In our time, the chicken gets skewered on its cheeks.

529
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,840
The chicken gets older, that’s why.

530
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,760
It’s not even relevant.

531
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,000
Mister.

532
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,520
Mister.

533
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,680
0058

534
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,360
Sawasdee krap.

535
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,960
You know my student ID…

536
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,440
Is there everything you want?

537
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,000
Well…

538
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,800
I saw you rejecting your friend to get seniors’ signature

539
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,280
Don’t you feel pity for her?

540
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,400
I’m not a mean person.

541
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,160
But I don’t want to dance that grilled-chicken song

542
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,760
to get signatures from someone I don’t want to know

543
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,480
Why don’t you look from a different angle

544
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,120
those seniors may just want to know you?

545
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,040
If they want to know me

546
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,040
they should make the first approach

547
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,600
not me who should go to them.

548
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,520
Fair enough

549
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,120
Can I have your activity book?

550
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,040
The seniors want to know freshmen

551
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,440
but ask the freshmen to come to them by means of paper.

552
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,960
I understand you

553
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,760
And right now

554
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,400
this senior wants you to know him.

555
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,000
You know me now. – Tewtat

556
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,600
What’s up, newbie?

557
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,560
Are you having a break?

558
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,680
Yes.

559
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,240
Well,

560
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,160
let me introduce myself.

561
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,440
My name is John.

562
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,920
I’m the vice supervisor here.

563
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,040
If you have any questions

564
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,240
you can ask me

565
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,560
Anytime.

566
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,440
Okay.

567
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,720
You want some?

568
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,040
"Som-O"

569
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,400
Nah,

570
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,480
it has the name on it.

571
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,640
Don’t worry.

572
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,920
I told you, right?

573
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,360
I’m the vice supervisor here.

574
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,480
Take one.

575
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,160
Okay. Thank you

576
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,160
You don’t taste anything with that little bite

577
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
Have a big one.

578
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,000
Yeah. Eat the whole piece of it.

579
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,080
By the way,

580
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,920
where did you graduate from?

581
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,680
From SFU.

582
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,320
Really?

583
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,560
I went there too.

584
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,360
People who have graduated from there are all capable.

585
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,640
Like me. I graduated from there 6 years ago.

586
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,680
And look at me now.

587
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,680
I’m the vice supervisor already.

588
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:02,000
So you should live up to our university’s reputation

589
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,600
Got it.

590
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,160
Excuse me for cutting in.

591
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,960
Are you briefing this new starter?

592
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,120
No.

593
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,520
I just made a small talk to get to know him

594
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,560
Well, newbie.

595
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,680
Yes?

596
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,240
Take this document to Khun Paga at the Accounting Department

597
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:20,960
It’s urgent.

598
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,560
Okay.

599
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,680
Khun Paga, right?

600
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,560
Yes.

601
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:24,880
Talk to you later.

602
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:27,840
Hey,

603
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,160
it his first day.

604
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,800
You sent him to the queen mum

605
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,080
He just needs to hand the document to her.

606
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
P’John

607
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,200
Whose drink are you having?

608
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,160
This?

609
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,000
I don’t know.

610
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,920
I found it in the fridge

611
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,400
It’s mine.

612
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,760
It’s yours?

613
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,800
let say I’ll buy it back to you.

614
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,680
Okay.

615
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,440
Are we good?

616
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,320
Yes

617
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,760
Yes, Okay.

618
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,200
You can do it.

619
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,480
Uh, excuse me.

620
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,920
Do you know where is Khun Paga’s table?

621
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,600
I’m Khun Paga.

622
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,440
All right.

623
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,240
Khun Earth asked me to hand this document to you.

624
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,640
You work here.

625
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,120
How come you don’t know me?

626
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,240
Which department are you?

627
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,560
Procurement Department.

628
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,720
You are a new employee, right?

629
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:47,000
A new employee must firstly introduce himself to the senior employee.

630
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,960
Not just drop the document and leave like this!

631
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,480
Don’t you know this basic manner?

632
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,000
I’m sorry, Khun Paga.

633
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,040
My name is Arthit.

634
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,280
If you’ll excuse, I have to leave now

635
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,800
Wait.

636
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,720
You must wait for me to review this document first.

637
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,280
If there’s any error, it can get amended right away

638
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,240
Seriously, young people these days

639
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,680
are no good.

640
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,200
Follow me.

641
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,720
How’d it go, newbie?

642
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,280
Is every all right?

643
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,160
Yes.

644
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,080
Khun Paga is a bit strict.

645
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,120
But actually she’s a nice person.

646
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,880
I see

647
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,400
Everyone, listen.

648
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,400
You probably got to know Arthit already.

649
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,800
He’s a new employee in our department

650
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,880
Well, we got a mix-up this morning

651
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,720
Why don’t you introduce yourself to your colleagues again officially?

652
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,560
Go ahead.

653
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,040
Yes.

654
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,200
Sawasdee krap, all of you.

655
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,880
My name is Arthit.

656
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,080
I graduated from SFU with a degree in engineering

657
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,400
Nice to meet you all

658
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,880
I got transferred to take a position here from the Production Department.

659
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,600
Arthit, is your nickname Arthit too?

660
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,480
No,

661
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,280
but my friends like to call me with my real name.

662
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,840
Since you all know him.

663
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,000
Let’s have a welcome dinner this evening.

664
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,360
Well, we….

665
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,240
My treat.

666
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:40,880
…we can’t wait to eat with Arthit

667
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,400
What should we have?

668
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,840
How about Shabu?

669
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,120
Som-O.

670
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,800
You are fast in this matter.

671
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,080
All right, then

672
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,080
Give me 30 minutes.

673
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,000
If you don’t mind

674
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,360
No problem.

675
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,240
Here.

676
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,600
Enough, P’John

677
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,000
You can tell me if you want something

678
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,600
I grab it for you.

679
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,880
He can get it himself.

680
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,280
Please have a seat, P’Danai.

681
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,400
I’m really sorry to have kept you waiting for me

682
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,840
I was on the phone with my son.

683
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,360
He vented about his university

684
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,200
Is it okay if you don’t go have an have dinner with your family?

685
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,440
It’s okay now.

686
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,280
My son has moved out and stayed in a dorm near his campus.

687
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,080
It’s good for him. He will experience a lot of things his own.

688
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,920
Yes, I agree.

689
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,840
That’s why you take us out for dinner.

690
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:41,960
The thing is

691
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:44,760
it’s been a while that we get to welcome a new employee

692
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,960
Also, you all have been working really hard

693
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,240
So I want to reward you for your hard work.

694
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,920
What are you talking about?

695
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,560
Our work is not that hard, right?

696
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,600
You are scaring N’Arthit

697
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,840
N’Arthit

698
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,400
have you had someone to cook for you yet?

699
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,920
I’m good at cooking, you know?

700
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,200
Well, I…

701
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,480
Hey, P’John.

702
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,400
That’s pork is mine.

703
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,080
What?

704
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,760
I saw it was in the pot for a while.

705
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,160
I don’t want it to get more shrunken.

706
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,200
It’s not gonna shrunken.

707
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,760
I can boil you a new one

708
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,880
I want lean pork.

709
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,280
Thank you.

710
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,480
See you tomorrow morning.

711
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,800
Please take care.

712
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:35,240
Want to go to a bar together, Som-O?

713
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,680
Hello, Kongpob?

714
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,680
How’d it go?

715
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,040
Your gathering activity was over?

716
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,720
It was over a while ago.

717
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,000
I’m on my way to my dorm.

718
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,960
What about you?

719
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,720
Are you home yet?

720
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,720
Not yet.

721
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,080
I just had dinner with my colleagues

722
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,920
How was your first day in the Procurement Department?

723
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,280
Well…

724
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,520
there were some hectic moments

725
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,840
I feel strange.

726
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,760
I feel like I’m a freshman once again and got scolded by seniors.

727
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,080
What about you?

728
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,080
How is it going?

729
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,200
Are the initiation activities going all right?

730
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,480
The freshmen are fully cooperative.

731
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,520
The numbers of freshmen in the gathering event are higher than previous years

732
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,520
Are you trying to outdo me?

733
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,560
I’ve got to tell you that being the head hazer is not easy.

734
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,080
And it’s just a beginning.

735
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,560
If I can be a good head hazer from the beginning till the end,

736
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,920
Will you have a reward for me?

737
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,400
Seriously,

738
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,680
you always ask for rewards.

739
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,720
Well, let say that I have to think about it

740
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,880
and see if you really pull this duty of head hazer off.

741
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,520
What about the duty of boyfriend?

742
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,080
If I can do this duty well

743
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,320
do you have a reward for me?

744
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,760
About this one,

745
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,440
I have to think about it as well.

746
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,680
For this second reward,

747
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,480
can I have…

748
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,840
a really “good” one?

749
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,360

00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,080
Hey, Kong.

752
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,920
You don’t go out with P’Arthit today?

753
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,040
No,

754
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:33,920
he is busy with his thesis.

755
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,320
He probably works until late.

756
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,120
I thought you went out with him

757
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,440
So you could ask him what the hazing team test is about.

758
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,920
Even if I ask,

759
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,120
I’m sure he won’t tell me

760
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,440
Trust me.

761
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,280
Okay, then.

762
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,480
I’m going to see May.

763
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,080
Happy Valentine’s Day.

764
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,000
Happy Valentine’s Day.

765
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,560
I’m going now. See you.

766
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,800
you said you were busy.

767
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,200
I finished it early so that I could see you

768
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,960
I have a gift for you.

769
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,600
I have a gift for you too.

770
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,680
Can I open it now?

771
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,000
No.

772
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,400
Open it when you are in your room

773
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,920
But you can open my gift here

774
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,440
Okay.

775
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,680
Do you want me to wear two watches at the same time?

776
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,320
This one

777
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,320
is mine.

778
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,360
That one is yours.

779
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,160
And for this one,

780
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,600
let’s open it when we are in our room.

781
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:17,000
“I just want to take a photo of you going to work on your first day.
When I look back at it, I know that I was with you on your important day.”- Kongpob

782
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,000
I want you to join the gathering activity.

783
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,880
Why do we have to join it?

784
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,000
Is there anyone hitting on you at work?

785
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,000
Here’s the pen.

786
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,920
It’s easier to find a new one.

787
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,560
Where’s your name tag?

788
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,720
I forgot to bring it.

789
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,560
You are still the same.

790
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,080
What do you mean?

791
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,080
What are you doing?

792
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,320
No one is looking

793
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,400
If you want to hold my hand

794
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,080
do it when we are back home.
