1
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,446
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,989
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,650
You look happy.

4
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,201
Since when did this place

5
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,496
become freely accessible for just anyone?

6
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:20,955
I'm not just anyone.

7
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,708
I'm your son.

8
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:27,837
Yes.

9
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,257
The sole reason
you've been able to survive

10
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:35,011
in Kangoh is because you share my blood.

11
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,429
That was your only excuse.

12
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:43,853
- I met with CEO Park Sajin because...
- I want you out of Kangoh now.

13
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,774
You will be terminated
tomorrow morning at 9:00.

14
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:51,945
After that, you will be issued a notice
to be kicked out of Kangoh Group.

15
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:54,114
Why?

16
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,075
Why can't it be me?

17
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:01,246
I have the abilities
to make your dreams come true too.

18
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,330
Abilities?

19
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:06,751
Did you think those were your abilities?
Not Han Taeoh's?

20
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,628
Is that why you stole him?

21
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:10,505
If it were Taeoh instead of you,

22
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,049
I wouldn't have had
to split Kangoh in half

23
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,135
the way I did now.

24
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,930
I did everything in my power
to gain your approval.

25
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,267
So why haven't you acknowledged me
for a single moment?

26
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,853
Did you kill Inju
because I didn't acknowledge you?

27
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,605
My son! Your brother!

28
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,281
You killed him.

29
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:39,450
Kang Inha is a hollow shell.

30
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,535
Baek Inha!

31
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,037
That's who you are.

32
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,791
Put everything you have
in your hands down.

33
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,751
Go back to your old life.

34
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,545
If you go back and live quietly,

35
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,339
I won't make you pay

36
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,509
for your crimes.

37
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,560
What if I don't want to?

38
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,520
What?

39
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,314
I'm not the one that killed Inju.

40
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,066
It was you.

41
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,653
The person who made me this way
and killed Kang Inju!

42
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,990
In the end, it was all you.

43
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,454
You're finally showing your true colors.

44
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,207
Go back to being Baek Inha?

45
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,209
Now?

46
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,046
I can't do that.

47
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,006
I wasn't asking you.

48
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,800
If I tell you to leave, you leave!

49
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,263
That's the law of Kang Joongmo and Kangoh!

50
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,848
I'm different from my mother.

51
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:48,645
I won't give up that easily
without even trying.

52
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,523
There's nothing you can do.

53
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,323
I don't know. Is there really nothing?

54
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,576
Get out of my sight
before I call security!

55
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,420
Will you kill me too?

56
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,923
I don't want to see you, so...

57
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,044
Father, did you know?

58
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,298
I've come too far to turn back.

59
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,052
This wouldn't have happened
if you had acknowledged me...

60
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,680
a little sooner.

61
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,737
I wish...

62
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,867
you had reached out this hand
a little earlier.

63
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,703
Kang Joongmo's Kangoh is gone.

64
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,872
Kang Inha's Kangoh is about to begin.

65
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,293
How's Chairman Kang?

66
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,505
I just got the call
and I'm on my way to the hospital now.

67
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:22,673
I'll call you when I get there.

68
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,728
OPERATING CENTER

69
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,661
What's going on?

70
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,745
What happened?

71
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,622
I don't know.

72
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,083
I found him on the ground, passed out.

73
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,172
But why did you go to the office
at that time?

74
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,515
Why are you alone?

75
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,724
Where's your husband?

76
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,444
HYEWON

77
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,488
What?

78
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,328
What?

79
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,375
RESTRICTED AREA

80
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:43,546
How's the chairman?

81
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:47,675
It's hard to tell you anything right now.

82
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,637
What do you mean?

83
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:55,808
He missed the golden hour
to take his heart medicine.

84
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:00,855
We'll have to wait for him
to regain consciousness.

85
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:04,108
It's all up to him now.

86
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:08,571
Mom!

87
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,616
Not yet...

88
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,700
Not yet...

89
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:13,993
Don't worry.

90
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:15,995
He won't go like this.

91
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:18,289
Sit down.

92
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,105
Wait, is there a hidden space?

93
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,834
KANG JOONGMO

94
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,308
Han Taeoh.

95
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,427
Who are you?

96
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,556
Han Taeoh?

97
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,608
Don't get the wrong idea,
I'm not here to confess.

98
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,193
You're a wanted man right now.

99
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,445
But you show up in front of a prosecutor?

100
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,280
I really didn't kill anyone.

101
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:47,243
So why would you tell me that?
What does that have to do with me?

102
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,536
I screwed you over.

103
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,330
I came to repay that debt.

104
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:52,706
What?

105
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,792
The night I supposedly
killed Kang Inju and Shin Bona.

106
00:13:55,793 --> 00:14:00,005
Everything from that night was recorded
on Shin Bona's phone.

107
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,258
I really didn't kill anyone.

108
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,348
I'm giving you...

109
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,142
a chance right now, Prosecutor Ha.

110
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:14,436
Choose.

111
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:17,398
Will you take my chance
and return to the Seoul

112
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,110
or stay here and live a third-rate life?

113
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,781
INVESTIGATION ROOM 1

114
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,202
Great job.

115
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,579
Thank you.

116
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,788
This way.

117
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:58,647
ESCAPED CONVICT WANTED NOTICE

118
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,284
Find Han Taeoh right now.

119
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,788
SEONU WAN

120
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,833
Did I come to the wrong person?

121
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,627
Did I...

122
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,630
overestimate you?

123
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:25,591
Am I a joke to you
because I have no connections or money?

124
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,887
Do you think I'd do everything you ask?

125
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,936
I must be crazy.

126
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:39,438
I'm listening to this nonsense.

127
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:46,236
You are under arrest for escaping prison
and for obstruction of justice, Han Taeoh.

128
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,156
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say can

129
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:52,660
- and will be used against you in court.
- What does inferiority solve?

130
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,245
You...

131
00:15:56,664 --> 00:16:00,084
- have the right to an attorney.
- Your inferiority will solve nothing.

132
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,544
It provides no consolation
to the deceased!

133
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,713
Catch the real culprit.

134
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,007
That's solace and peace.
You need to do that.

135
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,717
So, why? Damn it...

136
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,889
Why me? Why?

137
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,100
I told you.

138
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,477
I'm repaying my debt.

139
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,438
It's your last chance.

140
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:23,983
Choose.

141
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,903
Will you stay here...

142
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:30,698
or go back?

143
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,885
Ha Myeongjin made an entrance.

144
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,150

Han Taeoh.

148
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,488
I think the chairman has him.

149
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,617
What were you thinking?

150
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,745
Why would you hold Taeoh?

151
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,343
He's not awake yet.

152
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:16,887
What happened to you?

153
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:25,354
I'll call you back.

154
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,404
Why are you so surprised?

155
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,823
What's going on?

156
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,577
Where's Han Taeoh?

157
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,788
Why are you asking me?

158
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,376
Because I know my dad was hiding him.

159
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,838
Tell me. Where is he?

160
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,634
I don't know.

161
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,303
Why do you think I'll know?

162
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,514
I don't care about this.

163
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,308
Really?

164
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,895
Then you won't care if I report this.

165
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,859
I'll tell them that the last person
my dad was with before he fainted

166
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,194
was Han Taeoh.

167
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,408
Han Taeoh. Where is he?

It's there. I'm sure of it.

172

What if it's not?

173
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,160
You can arrest me then.

174

00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,533
Please...

186
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,077
Please...

187
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,801
Hey.

188
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,052
Hey!

189
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,138
Are you dead?

190
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,683
Inju!

191
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,894
I think he's dead!

192
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:22,526
Hey! I won!

193
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,745
Yes!

194
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,164
I'm the king!

195
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,000
Damn it!

196
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,794
What's this?

197
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,839
Do you want a drink?
Do you want drugs? Huh?

198
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,567
The weather's nice.

199
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,321
The perfect weather...

200
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,492
to go back somewhere.

201
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,390
You want to cut the video there?

202
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,143
Someone came in.
It's proof there was an accomplice.

203
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,228
It's a speculation.

204
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,817
Our job's to start with a speculation
and catch the culprit.

205
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:10,944
What if you can't?

206
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,489
Mo Gijun could escape
if something goes wrong.

207
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:17,742
You need to charge Mo Gijun first,
and then...

208
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,035
And then...

209
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:20,787
And after that...

210
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:28,420
Wait, do you know who it is?

211
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,216
- Han Taeoh.
- I'll help you...

212
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,969
catch the real culprit.

213
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,805
I keep my promises.

214
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:52,193
First of all, taking evidence like this
can cause problems for you.

215
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,864
Someone who should uphold
the law commits a crime?

216
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:58,908
That's why you should help me, sir.

217
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,202
On what grounds?

218
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,419
Come back with us.

219
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:11,963
Pack your bags and be here tomorrow.

220
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,715
I'll handle the procedural issues.

221
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,594
Thank you, sir.

222
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,816
ESCAPED CONVICT WANTED NOTICE
HAN TAEOH

223
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,947
CRIMINAL AFFAIRS DIVISION

224
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,786
I'm here to turn myself in.

225
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:02,263
ON DUTY
PROSECUTION SERVICE

226
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,232
Mr. Mo Gijun.

227
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:20,782
You're under arrest
for the murder of Kang Inju and Shin Bona.

228
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,284
What is this?

229
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,788
Let go of me. Damn it.

230
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,673
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

231
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,527
SECRETARY MO ARRESTED AS NEW SUSPECT
IN KANG INJU AND SHIN BONA'S MURDER

232
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:14,836
Seongju.

233
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,672
There will be no pardon
or amnesty for Han Taeoh.

234
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,759
We just need to keep going on our path.

235
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,594
KANGOH SECURITIES CEO KANG SEONGJU

236
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:23,678
Yes, Mother.

237
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,222
All that's left is Kang Inha.

238
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:27,474
That's right.

239
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,519
And he has no power without the chairman.

240
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,314
SECRETARY MO ARRESTED AS NEW SUSPECT

241
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:40,278
Things are getting interesting.

242
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,448
I don't have...

243
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,202
any money to hire an attorney from Milton.

244
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:49,746
Don't worry about money.

245
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:53,917
We have a pro bono program at Milton
to assist in free legal consult.

246
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,798
Are you using me

247
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,468
to promote Milton,

248
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,179
or are you trying to promote yourself?

249
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:07,514
Neither.

250
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,142
I'm only following the chairman's orders.

251
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,646
Chairman Kang Joongmo
could see everything clearly.

252
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,193
He asked me to help you
finish this matter.

253
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,625
Where shall I start?

254
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,225
Dad.

255
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,520
They caught the real culprit

256
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:57,856
who killed Inju.

257
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,901
So you have to get up, okay?

258
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,035
How's Chairman Kang?

259
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,829
Is he showing progress?

260
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,874
I know you met with my father.

261
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:19,377
Did he promise you something?

262
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,297
He said he'd give me Energy.

263
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,592
You didn't refuse him.

264
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,260
In my position,

265
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,929
it's more appealing

266
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:33,266
to stand with the owner
over the bastard child of Kangoh.

267
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,268
Energy.

268
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,145
I'll give it to you.

269
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,356
If you don't like the bastard of Kangoh,

270
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,903
you can help me become
the owner of Kangoh.

271
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:48,239
Someone of the Kang bloodline
to be your cannon fodder and shield.

272
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,658
I'll be that for you.

273
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,536
I don't know.

274
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,121
It's not that appealing.

275
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,707
I'll be honest with you.

276
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:01,252
If Chairman Kang
hadn't collapsed like that,

277
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,588
wouldn't you have been ousted?

278
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:08,301
If Chairman Kang wakes up tomorrow,

279
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,554
you're fated to leave Kangoh as planned.

280
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,098
Those chances are slim.

281
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,100
That's your wishful thinking.

282
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:21,272
You can never have Kangoh
as long as Chairman Kang's alive.

283
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:35,495
What if Han Taeoh returns to work
based on the court ruling?

284
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,582
Even if that happens, don't worry.

285
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,962
As of now, is there anyone who can help
Han Taeoh besides the chairman?

286
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,675
The one who made the ridiculous dream
of Royal Road a reality

287
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,928
was Han Taeoh, not your father.

288
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:53,805
Right.

289
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,977
If the time comes to make a decision,

290
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,063
accept Han Taeoh as one of our own.

291
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,401
Aside from our board members,

292
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,820
I'll gather as much stock
as I can for now.

293
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:24,877
Why now?

294
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,339
Why?

295
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:54,741
Why did you kill
Kang Inju and Shin Bona?

296
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,499
I was treated as less than human
for a long time.

297
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,502
There were frequent beatings
and verbal abuse.

298
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,379
That's why.

299
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,882
That's why I killed them.

300
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,012
You could've just quit.

301
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:20,475
- How could you kill someone?
- You don't know what it's like.

302
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,185
What about Han Taeoh?

303
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,979
Did you plan that too? Even perjury?

304
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,274
Yes.

305
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:35,114
You've answered "yes"
to all of my questions, Mr. Mo.

306
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:40,244
You created a falsely accused perpetrator
to take the fall

307
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,081
and even committed perjury
for the perfect crime.

308
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,166
And you're willing to admit to everything?

309
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,670
Where'd your determination
to not get caught go?

310
00:34:56,636 --> 00:34:58,137
This wasn't your idea, was it?

311
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,774
I planned everything.

312
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:11,734
I did it.

313
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,362
Who planned this...

314
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:17,740
and ordered it?

315
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,285
No one.

316
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,254
Kang Joongmo's Kangoh is gone.

317
00:35:33,422 --> 00:35:35,550
Kang Inha's Kangoh is about to begin.

318
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:45,351
KANG JOONGMO

319
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:47,455
Even if that time comes,
there's no need to complicate things.

320
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:50,082
Han Taeoh was falsely imprisoned.

321
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,587
Who will help him if Kangoh doesn't?

322
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,550
He was one of our own once.

323
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,802
He was more loyal than anyone.

324
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,929
Then...

325
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,557
as the division director of
the Future Strategy Office?

326
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,642
No.

327
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:12,104
As the planning and coordination director
of Kangoh Corporation.

328
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,148
- Excuse me?
- Yes.

329
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,400
There is no such department at Kangoh.

330
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:21,781
It's a new department
that I plan to make for CEO Kang Seongju.

331
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:37,630
Is it tomorrow?

332
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:41,467
Even after the darkest night
comes the dawn.

333
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,094
It's finally here.

334
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,430
Let's have a drink before you go.

335
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,809
You've never asked me to grab a drink.

336
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,602
You must want something from me.

337
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:05,283
Why Hong Kong?

338
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,869
There's an investment company there
called Gold H Investment.

339
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:10,788
It's a paper company

340
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,959
that I created to make Kang Inha
the chairman.

341
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,004
No one knows it exists, but me.

342
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,881
Not even Kang Inha.

343
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,385
I guess one more knows.

344
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:26,053
Me.

345
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,057
You're right.

346
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,936
Now that I know your secret,
will you kill me?

347
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,773
Do you want to gamble for real with me
before you die?

348
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,236
Not shooting craps
in an illegal gambling den,

349
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,740
but seizing control of the great Kangoh.

350
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,242
A real gamble.

351
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,257
He's coming.

352
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,134
Where is he?

353
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:07,803
- Why isn't he coming out?
- Was it not today?

354
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,306
Boss!

355
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,892
- Boss!
- Boss!

356
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,144
You've been through so much!

357
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,645
Tofu.

358
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,397
Boss! Have some tofu!

359
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,565
Hey!

360
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,567
Have some tofu!

361
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,402
Who the hell eats tofu these days?

362
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,321
Still, have a bite.

363
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:26,405
Let go of me!

364
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:27,907
Open wide!

365
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,158
Don't do it!

366
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,743
Don't!

367
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,831
Congrats on your release, Boss.

368
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,294
Is that you?

369
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,338
Hyangmi's daughter?

370
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:47,593
I knew your name sounded familiar.

371
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,011
Right?

372
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,222
Taeoh and I are on different pages.

373
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,765
I don't trust gamblers.

374
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,350
What?

375
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,810
- Gamblers?
- Hey.

376
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:00,564
I don't trust you either, Hyewon.

377
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,982
You're Hyangmi's daughter.

378
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,777
Yoon Hyangmi ran off with my money.

379
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,948
Since we're on the same page,
let's talk about work.

380
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,325
That's what I wanted. Yes.

381
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,546
Gold H Investment.

382
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:26,590
Michael Chang,
a Wall Street investment genius,

383
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,301
founded an investment firm
in Hong Kong in 2021.

384
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,554
Michael moved to the States
when he was young.

385
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,849
He graduated Cornell summa cum laude
and is an eccentric genius.

386
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,642
He was an active rower in college.

387
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,812
He fell in love with trekking
and works as a professional now.

388
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,857
Wait a second.

389
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,317
Who's Michael Chang?

390
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:50,948
I heard all about Gold H Investment
from Inmate 3866, so I know it well.

391
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:55,494
But he never told me about Michael Chang.

392
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,334
MICHAEL CHANG, 53,
AMERICAN, PROFESSIONAL TREKKER

393
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,379
Me?

394
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,340
Come on.

395
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,259
He's an old man.

396
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:13,512
He's not even
some friendly neighborhood guy.

397
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,514
He's an old dude from the outskirts.

398
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,057
Who are you?

399
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,142
Me?

400
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,810
Seonu Wan.

401
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:21,770
The ace

402
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:23,731
in this field.

403
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,402
There's something you don't know about me.

404
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:31,864
I'm a rabid dog.

405
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,449
A mad dog.

406
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,075
Woof, woof!

407
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,869
Do you have a death wish?

408
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:38,704
Who will kill me?

409
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,334
Ah. Mo Gjiun?

410
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,795
But he went to jail, didn't he?

411
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,507
Later.

412
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,761
Ah.

413
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,640
That's not loaded.
Don't waste your energy.

414
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,603
Wan!

415
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,814
Damn it!

416
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,984
Do we still have business?

417
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,240
Come on. Why would you say that?

418
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,158
Tell me why you're here.

419
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,661
Gold H Investment.

420
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,747
You had me fooled completely.

421
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,875
But you gathered shares
loud enough for me to hear.

422
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,424
- So?
- What do you mean?

423
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,427
You need my help.

424
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,277
BUY

425
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,570
TRANSACTION COMPLETE

426
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,863
YOUR PURCHASE WAS SUCCESSFUL

427
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,372
Sir, there's trouble.

428
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:15,259
Well, it is indeed an honor
to join your foundation.

429
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,385
Thank you.

430
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:19,805
Mother.

431
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:23,517
- Please, excuse me.
- Sure.

432
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,647
GOLD H INVESTMENT SHARE RATIO

433
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,399
Gold H Investment?

434
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,446
But, since when?

435
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,948
GOLD H INVESTMENT SHARE RATIO

436
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:51,795
Yes, sir.

437
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,298
Gold H Investment.

438
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:56,550
Look into it right now.

439
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,761
Yes, sir.

440
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,347
FUTURE STRATEGY OFFICE
DIVISION DIRECTOR KANG INHA

441
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,186
We're almost there.

442
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:12,650
You just need to come out
and pull the trigger.

443
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,571
Great job.

444
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:21,200
Thanks, Hyewon.

445
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,333
COURT

446
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,834
Your Honor,

447
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:36,090
I am not just here
to defend Han Taeoh today.

448
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,468
I am here

449
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:43,097
to give our country's judiciary
a chance to apologize for the wrongs

450
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:46,433
inflicted on an ordinary citizen
of this country.

451
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,520
I hope that the outcome of this trial

452
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,813
becomes an opportunity

453
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:55,150
for him and for all those
who cherish and love him

454
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:58,904
to have hope for a new life.

455
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:10,124
First, as a member
of the judiciary, I offer my apologies.

456
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,292
Defendant.

457
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,337
Will you stand for a moment?

458
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,422
DEFENDANT

459
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:22,886
Defendant...

460
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,889
Han Taeoh is innocent!

461
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:34,690
That is all.
That wraps up the retrial.

462
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,818
CORRECTION FOR A BETTER TOMORROW
DETENTION CENTER

463
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,823
HAN TAEOH FOUND INNOCENT OF MURDER
AFTER RETRIAL

464
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:36,877
Did you call for me?

465
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,587
Start monitoring Han Taeoh.

466
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,924
See who he's meeting
and what's being discussed.

467
00:46:42,007 --> 00:46:44,218
Report every single thing to me.

468
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,928
Yes, sir.

469
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,095
KANG INHA KANGOH GROUP

470
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:13,223
KANG INHA SHOWS FRESH PASSION BY REJECTING
CONVENTIONAL CONGLOMERATE FRAMEWORKS

471
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,039
If Chairman Kang
wakes up tomorrow,

472
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:40,918
you're fated to leave Kangoh as planned.

473
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,712
Kang Inha is a hollow shell.

474
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,088
Baek Inha!

475
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,882
That's who you are.

476
00:48:50,093 --> 00:48:52,304
Put everything you have
in your hands down.

477
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,473
Go back to your old life.

478
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,225
If you go back and live quietly,

479
00:48:58,477 --> 00:49:00,270
I won't make you pay

480
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:03,023
for your crimes.

481
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:16,203
VIP PATIENT KANG JOONGMO

482
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,084
I'm sorry, Father.

483
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,963
You should've just died then.

484
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,924
If you had...

485
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,805
we wouldn't have go through this twice.
