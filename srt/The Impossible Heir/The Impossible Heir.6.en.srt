THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,947
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,540
Even if the process is unsatisfactory,

4
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,792
it doesn't mean
the results will be disparaged.

5
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,377
Don't be upset.

6
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,213
You're right, Father.

7
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,632
I understand.

8
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,634
You deserve a reward.

9
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,511
Tell me what you want.

10
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:10,278
NA HYEWON

11
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,988
There's a woman I want to marry.

12
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,284
I need her.

13
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,541
I give you my consent.

14
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,379
- Thank you, Father.
- Congrats, son.

15
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,871
NA HYEWON

16
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,309
I miss you.

17
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,397
Don't go.

18
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,152
Don't go, Hyewon.

19
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,336
I miss you.

20
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,523
EMERGENCY MEDICAL CENTER

21
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,567
Sir? Sir, wake up!

22
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,027
- Sir?
- Wait!

23
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,403
- Sir!
- Wait!

24
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,487
Please, move!

25
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,004
Taeoh.

26
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,431
- Taeoh!
- See if operating room is open!

27
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,807
Room two is open.

28
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,726
- Get ready for surgery.
- Yes, doctor.

29
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:51,189
Ma'am, come this way.
You need to sign the consent papers.

30
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,629
Hyewon.

31
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,401
Don't go.

32
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,655
Don't go, Hyewon.

33
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,245
Don't go.

34
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,874
Don't go.

35
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,503
Don't go, Hyewon.

36
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,603
Let's hurry.

37
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,846
HYEWON

38
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,014
How about a dry wine?

39
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,184
Sounds good.

40
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:56,481
INHA

41
00:05:56,564 --> 00:06:01,444
OPERATING ROOM

42
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,912
Fererel Conti.

43
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:15,541
It's a tasty dry wine
that isn't too sweet. It's very charming.

44
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:23,299
I think the quality of wine
depends on the time and place.

45
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:28,971
How it fits into the mood
and how well it goes with my emotions.

46
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,974
I like wine,
but I don't know much about it.

47
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:36,396
That's the most common thing people say
when asking for a wine recommendation.

48
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,067
But when you say that, it doesn't help
the person recommending it.

49
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,193
It's too vague.

50
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:47,115
You have to say keywords when you want
something from your opponent.

51
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:50,243
Like what I'm about to say to you.

52
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,965
If you want to continue being my son,

53
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:06,217
don't do anything.

54
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,010
From now on,

55
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,430
don't try to do anything.

56
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,600
You just have to do what I tell you...

57
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,854
when I tell you.

58
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:19,772
Easy, right?

59
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,572
Don't act on my own will.

60
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,490
As long as I abide,

61
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,244
you're saying
I can live as your third son?

62
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:37,248
There won't be problems
as long as you don't go over the line.

63
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,960
Take it.
It's been ringing for a while.

64
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,129
If you'll excuse me.

65
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,427
Hello?

66
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,473
The hospital?

67
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,601
Okay.

68
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,107
- Han Taeoh was in an accident.
- An accident?

69
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,109
Someone hit him in the head.

70
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,741
Don't go.

71
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,411
Don't go, Hyewon.

72
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,247
Don't go.

73
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,018
Mr. Han? Was he hurt badly?

74
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,811
More importantly...

75
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,941
Don't you have connections
with the police?

76
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:46,442
Stop them.

77
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,530
An investigation will cause a fuss,
and the media will join in.

78
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,826
There can't be any mention
of Kangoh whatsoever.

79
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,955
Do you understand what I mean?

80
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:05,878
Hyewon!

81
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,298
What happened?

82
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,759
I don't know either.

83
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,971
The surgery is taking so long
it's making me anxious.

84
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,769
Calm down. Everything will be fine.

85
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,188
He lost so much blood.

86
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,609
If he had been discovered a little later,
it would've been bad.

87
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,488
It'll be okay.

88
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,533
Taeoh is stronger than anyone.

89
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,410
I know it.

90
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,333
I know how lucky he is too.

91
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,484
It's not an incident that happened
within Kangoh.

92
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,321
It clearly occurred externally.

93
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,741
So why are you trying to cover it?

94
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,828
I don't think Mr. Kang Inha's decision
is typical.

95
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:22,038
That's my conclusion.

96
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:26,000
Since when do you conclude things?

97
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,504
- You follow, you don't lead.
- I apologize.

98
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,841
It seems you don't trust Kang Inha yet.

99
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:38,638
- What if I feel the same way as him?
- I will obey.

100
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,058
How's Mr. Han?

101
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,769
He's in surgery right now.

102
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,063
Call Director In
and prepare a hospital room.

103
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:51,025
Move him after his surgery
as soon as he wakes up.

104
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,109
Yes, sir.

105
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,115
Put that by the bed.

106
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,826
Put that beside the air purifier.

107
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,286
The monitors will go there.

108
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,837
Han Taeoh was moved to the VVIP ward?

109
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:15,132
An order hasn't been made yet,
so I'm not sure.

110
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,760
But he's undergoing brain surgery.

111
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,470
I think there was an accident.

112
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,181
You don't know how serious it is?

113
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,517
Shall I call the other hospital
and find out?

114
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,269
No. I'm sure we'll know by tomorrow.

115
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,022
Okay, good job.

116
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,074
Will he live or die?

117
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,743
The great Han Taeoh.

118
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,835
What did you just say?

119
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,295
Han Taeoh is unconscious? Why?

120
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,518
What's with her?

121
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,438
She's like that because Taeoh might die.

122
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,189
Taeoh's going to die?

123
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,777
Ooh, Kang Huiju!

124
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,531
What was that?

125
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,867
Huiju likes Taeoh.

126
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,746
Didn't I tell you before?

127
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:31,459
- The answer's with her.
- Who could understand something like that?

128
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,586
Be precise. Tell me in detail.

129
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,299
Hey.

130
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,802
Did you know that Huiju liked Taeoh too?

131
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,846
Do I look that idle to you?

132
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,223
You psychopath.

133
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,516
Whatever.

134
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:56,358
By any chance... Was it you?
Did you do that to Taeoh?

135
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,070
It wasn't you?

136
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,782
- Hey!
- Seeing you get angry seems suspicious.

137
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,700
If you mess around,

138
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,995
I might kill you myself.

139
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,294
You're making me lose my appetite.

140
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,215
Try it.

141
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,301
You little punk!

142
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,220
Don't walk off like that, punk!

143
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,306
That's enough.
You always work yourself up like that.

144
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,895
Tell me what you were talking
about earlier.

145
00:13:33,395 --> 00:13:35,231
Huiju and Taeoh. Can you support it?

146
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,358
It's a gut feeling.

147
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:41,320
Crap. You almost had me.

148
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:47,243
If she doesn't like him, how would you
explain her behavior just now?

149
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,411
That's true.

150
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,497
She has such low standards.

151
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,959
Why would she like a bum like that?

152
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,002
But...

153
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:58,963
it really wasn't you?

154
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,715
Hey!

155
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,218
Han Taeoh was assaulted?

156
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:06,637
Yes, but...

157
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,639
Is something bothering you?

158
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,599
I looked into it.

159
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,310
The police didn't even file a report.

160
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:15,563
What are you saying?

161
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,732
HAN TAEOH

162
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:39,795
Taeoh.

163
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:41,755
Are you up?

164
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:46,844
Can you hear me?

165
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,312
I'll get the doctor.

166
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,927
What do you think you're doing?

167
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,808
Why are you here?

168
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:46,445
If you're here because you're worried,
you should ask how he's doing first.

169
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,489
Answer my question first.

170
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,033
Why are you here?

171
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,955
She has a right to be.

172
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,831
How's Taeoh?

173
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,541
He's up.

174
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,294
I'll get the doctor.

175
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,600
Taeoh's... alive.

176
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,939
I won't have to worry anymore.

177
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,337
Sir, what's your name?

178
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,300
Han...

179
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:55,764
Han Taeoh...

180
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,774
HYEWON

181
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:09,194
I got an urgent call from work.

182
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,280
I'll call you later.

183
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,710
The doctor said
he's out of the woods

184
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,421
so I don't think you need to worry.

185
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,968
Also,

186
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,264
it could get a little rowdy
because of the situation.

187
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,516
- They could mention Kangoh and you--
- I know.

188
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,812
You told the police not to investigate
to avoid bringing up my name.

189
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,856
I feel the same.

190
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,025
You don't need to explain.

191
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:52,237
- Yes, Father.
- But Director Han could feel differently.

192
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,240
- Explain it so he can understand.
- Yes, sir.

193
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,492
KANG INHA

194
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,919
ATTORNEY CHU HYEOKJIN

195
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,757
Mr. Chu.

196
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:17,012
There's something...
I need you to look into quietly.

197
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,297
We need to wait
and see how the surgery went,

198
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,967
but for now, his pulse and breathing
are all stable.

199
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,788
You should go now too.

200
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,417
I want to stay.

201
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,962
- Listen to me.
- Is there a reason I can't stay?

202
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,173
- Huiju.
- To be honest...

203
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,136
I don't like you because of Hyewon.

204
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,055
Huiju.

205
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:47,686
How much longer will you keep her
by your side?

206
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,479
I'm going to marry her.

207
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,815
Father gave his consent.

208
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,984
So respect her from now on.

209
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,198
Do you know why I hate her?

210
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,367
She doesn't love you.

211
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,537
- Watch your mouth.
- The only person she loves...

212
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,040
is herself.

213
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,044
Don't fall for her lies.
She doesn't love you.

214
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,463
Do I look like...

215
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,466
a fool to fall for those lies?

216
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:20,969
- That's not what I'm saying.
- You are.

217
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,600
- Inha.
- If you insult Hyewon,

218
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:28,518
you insult me.

219
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:32,981
I won't forgive that, even if it's you.

220
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,486
You'll regret ignoring my warning.

221
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:12,729
Regret...

222
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:16,066
I don't do that, Taeoh.

223
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,865
You haven't left work yet.

224
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,826
I had something to take care of.

225
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,588
Chairman Kang's right-hand man,
Director Han Taeoh,

226
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,090
got assaulted last night.

227
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:24,509
It seems like Kangoh hushed it.

228
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,637
No matter how much they hide it,
it will get out eventually.

229
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,560
I'm sure there's a reason they hid it.

230
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,354
Just ignore it.

231
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,022
I can't do that.

232
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:41,026
He's been a nuisance for the boss.

233
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:46,156
- Do you want to say something to me?
- No, it's not like that.

234
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,661
It's just strange.

235
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,706
What do you mean?

236
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:57,084
Anyone can see it was a random assault.

237
00:22:57,167 --> 00:23:02,422
The police didn't file a report
under Kangoh Group's instructions.

238
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,802
See? Don't you think it's strange?

239
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,305
Why would Kangoh do that?

240
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,516
It'll be faster if you ask yourself.

241
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:15,143
The person who ordered it...

242
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,854
was Kang Inha.

243
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,754
Are you up?

244
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,673
Hey, Mr. Han.

245
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,564
Am I in hell right now?

246
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,651
Heaven.

247
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,822
Heaven...

248
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,323
I guess I'm not dead.

249
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,832
- Give me some water.
- Sure.

250
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,221
You'll be moved to
Kangoh Hospital tomorrow.

251
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,475
- There's no need.
- Father's orders.

252
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,187
The culprit?

253
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,066
Everyone has agreed
to forget about last night.

254
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,986
There will be no investigation.

255
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,030
In the future, this incident...

256
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,659
- won't be mentioned anywhere.
- This has to do with me.

257
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,746
Who decided...

258
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,583
- my personal affairs?
- Kangoh.

259
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:04,753
Father and I.

260
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:07,839
The chairman...

261
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,052
- and you?
- This is just in case.

262
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:18,183
Since you're the victim,
your name will be mentioned,

263
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,936
but Kangoh or my father's name
can't be mentioned with it.

264
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,772
So this incident...

265
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,442
isn't just a simple assault.

266
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,820
A simple assault case...

267
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,864
...will mention Kangoh Group? Is that it?

268
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,576
- That's excessive.
- Don't think of it like that.

269
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,956
What's best for Kangoh
is what's best for us.

270
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,751
You should rest.

271
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,628
I'm off.

272
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:55,804
Ah.

273
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,518
My father gave me his consent
to marry Hyewon.

274
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,187
We're really getting married.

275
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,494
Anyone can see
it was a random assault.

276
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:06,541
The police didn't file a report
under Kangoh Group's instructions.

277
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,586
The person who ordered it...

278
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,297
was Kang Inha.

279
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,510
HYEWON

280
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,643
Yeah, are you done?

281
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,692
I want to know...

282
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:58,611
who did this to me.

283
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,782
I know it'll be going against your will.

284
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,827
I will find who did it.

285
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:09,497
I thought that Kangoh's position
was conveyed to you.

286
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,916
Kangoh's name won't come up
no matter what.

287
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,418
How can you guarantee that?

288
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,297
I'm Han Taeoh, Chairman.

289
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,177
Han Taeoh.

290
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,347
True, that name is more than enough.

291
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,523
Kangoh's name cannot be mentioned.

292
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,066
No matter what.

293
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:42,030
No one on the outside can know
the victim was close to Kang Joongmo.

294
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,948
As long as you can promise both...

295
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,660
I give you my consent.

296
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,913
I promise.

297
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,498
Hurry.

298
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,710
You must find out who's behind it first.

299
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,505
And Han Taeoh

300
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,466
can never find out about this before us.

301
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,681
Ah!

302
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:59,858
Damn it!

303
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:15,999
We're closed.

304
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,297
What's this?

305
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,188
Han Taeoh?

306
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,884
What are you doing here?
You barely survived.

307
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,595
Are you out of your mind?

308
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,890
This will have to do for now. Take it.

309
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:18,895
When Amico comes back,
I'll have him take you to the hospital.

310
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,633
You came here
while risking your life

311
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,594
which means you need something
that you desperately need.

312
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:53,972
What do you need?

313
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,474
The location is Han River.
Jamwon District.

314
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,435
The date is May 11th.

315
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,062
Around 11 p.m.

316
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,731
Find out...

317
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,236
who attacked me.

318
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:12,699
Why can't you answer me?

319
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,996
Did you really stop
the police investigation?

320
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,999
I came to tell you that
my father gave his consent.

321
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,834
Answer my question.

322
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,838
Yeah, that's right.

323
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,339
I stopped them.

324
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,050
He's not just Han Taeoh.

325
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,637
He's Kangoh Group's
Chairman Kang Joongmo's closest confidant.

326
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:38,057
What if my father's name is mentioned
in such a trivial matter?

327
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,685
It's horrible to even imagine.

328
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,314
Of course,
my father feels the same.

329
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,860
I forgot for a moment that

330
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,696
you're also Chairman Kang's son.

331
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:56,200
You should've had Chairman Kang
give the order.

332
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,120
The way you call his name.

333
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,247
It bothers me.

334
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,832
Taeoh could've died.

335
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:06,085
If he was found a little later,
he could've died in the streets!

336
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:10,506
But aren't you curious
as to who's behind...

337
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:13,801
this terrible deed?

338
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,846
- Taeoh understands.
- He almost died!

339
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,390
He didn't die. He's fine.

340
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,395
Even if a pet dog got hurt,
people wouldn't act like this.

341
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,272
He's not a pet dog.

342
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,403
- What?
- The pets my father keep

343
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,696
are all blood-related.

344
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,699
Taeoh is different from us.

345
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,243
He's just a mutt.

346
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:46,125
Then I must be a mutt too.
Since I'm not blood-related.

347
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,547
I understand where you're coming from
as a friend,

348
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,884
- but that's enough.
- You're his friend too.

349
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,262
Don't act like he's not important to you.

350
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,309
I have work in the morning. I'm off.

351
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,924
- Chanhyeon?
- Yes.

352
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,801
Did the Ministry of Environment
send anything?

353
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:37,885
Ah.

354
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,556
Here you go.

355
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:45,810
- What about the debate location?
I found two places for now.

356
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,728
We're looking into the details.

357
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,938
That's good.

358
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,649
Give me the UN's environmental report
from last year.

359
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,733
Okay, on it.

360
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,019
Why would you change your number?

361
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,856
Do you know how much money
and time I spent trying to find you?

362
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,691
How much do you need?

363
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:36,569
Look at you.

364
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:40,072
It's been 10 years.
Is that all you have to say to your mom?

365
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,367
If you want affection,
I'll provide it.

366
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:47,288
But wasn't I just a slut to you?

367
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:49,999
50,000 won.

368
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:52,793
Your daughter?

369
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,086
What's your name?

370
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,547
Slut.

371
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,642
Just send it here.

372
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,396
What about a loan? How much can you get?

373
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:15,942
What? Do you think I want pocket change?

374
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:19,445
Unbelievable.
If you want to play in the big leagues,

375
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:20,988
you need to be more generous.

376
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:25,534
My fingertips
have been getting dull with age.

377
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:32,750
There's a house available at a low price,
and I might buy it. What do you think?

378
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,418
Why would you ask me?

379
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,339
Because I'm buying it with your money.

380
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,840
Of course, I need to ask.

381
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:43,803
If you don't give it to me,
I'll keep coming back.

382
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,351
- Should I slit my wrist?
- You're insane!

383
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,103
I'll just cut and end it here.

384
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,522
Are you crazy?

385
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:56,315
Get out before I call the cops!

386
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,268
That slut.

387
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,276
Yeah, we just parted ways.

388
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,696
Of course.

389
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,865
My lips are sealed.

390
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,120
Call me whenever you need me.

391
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,124
Yes, okay. Goodbye.

392
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,967
DEPOSIT ACCOUNT
10,009,287 WON

393
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,761
Nice!

394
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,554
This is great!

395
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,265
This is amazing!

396
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,030
You're late.

397
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,915
What's wrong with your arm?

398
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,417
Did you get hurt?

399
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,313
I'm sorry.

400
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,857
I'm sorry, Hyewon. I was wrong.

401
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,277
I must've lost my mind for a second.

402
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,780
I'm sorry.

403
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,161
I'm really sorry.

404
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,884
Enjoy your meal.

405
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,346
Welcome.

406
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,603
I can't get through this?

407
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:47,403
Then what about this?

408
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,081
SEOUL CCTV CONTROL CENTER

409
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:00,666
Yes!

410
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:06,755
Please, be here. Come on.

411
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:24,190
There you are.

412
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:25,543
I finally got you!

413
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,245
I'll have to take care
of Kang Inju now.

414
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,164
I'll make sure he has no place to go.

415
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:08,627
Then you're going
to need a lot of information on Kang Inju.

416
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:09,712
I am.

417
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:11,964
All of it.

418
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,758
Don't leave anything out.

419
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:33,402
Well? It's high, right?

420
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,114
Too high that not just anyone can reach.

421
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,329
Let's go.

422
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,559
Have you picked a date?

423
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,019
I'd like to discuss that.

424
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,688
Discuss it
with the secretary's office.

425
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:10,856
Yes, sir.

426
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,403
It's Na Hyewon.

427
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,409
That's my name.

428
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,082
You didn't ask, so I thought I'd tell you.

429
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,833
Na Hyewon.

430
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:33,128
You're one of Hanmi Party Leader
Jo Sundong's aides.

431
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,466
I didn't ask because I already know.

432
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,970
You seem to say what's on your mind,
so let me do so as well.

433
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,181
The work you're doing now...

434
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,058
When will you quit?

435
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,811
You work for Jo Sundong.

436
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:51,605
So I'm sure you know my background
with Congressman Jo.

437
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,692
Did you think I'd accept
one of his people?

438
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,611
- Father, we can talk--
- I'm speaking with Aide Na Hyewon.

439
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,784
If you want, I can get you a position
at the foundation.

440
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,704
You can have fun working there.

441
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,706
I don't want to have fun.

442
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,752
I want to work, Father.

443
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:17,631
Bravo.

444
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:31,061
Judging by everyone's expression,
it seems I've done something wrong.

445
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,064
Since I've already made a mistake,
I'll make one more.

446
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:39,695
If you're going to give me a position,
give me the one I want.

447
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,949
You want me to abandon my career.

448
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,952
It's the least you can do.

449
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,206
How frank of you.

450
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,252
There's nothing bad about that.

451
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:58,338
I like that your goals
are simple and clear.

452
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:03,385
However, when I allowed
a mere congressman's aide into Bisunjae,

453
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,097
I expected common sense
with the appropriate attitude.

454
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,350
But you don't have that.
How disappointing.

455
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,435
I'm sorry.

456
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:19,193
How could you be so thoughtless?

457
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,695
She's not being thoughtless.

458
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,240
She fully evaluated
the chairman's character.

459
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,785
She's not clever.

460
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:30,078
She's shrewd.

461
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,040
This is why I hate you.

462
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,294
We need to talk.

463
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,806
How could you say whatever's on your mind?

464
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,644
- He provoked me first.
- Do you want to be respected?

465
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:58,065
Sorry, but give it up.
He doesn't respect anyone but himself.

466
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,277
Do you feel the same?

467
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:06,532
- Should I go to work to have fun?
- You can't get everything you want.

468
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,327
You have to make sacrifices
for what's real.

469
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,079
Why would you decide

470
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,373
- what's real for me?
- Because I know

471
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:16,834
what's real for you.

472
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,961
If you get what's real,

473
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:23,090
everything will follow in its place
without me having to do anything.

474
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,260
So wait.

475
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,349
Scissors.

476
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:37,099
Oh. Mr. Han, what are you doing here?

477
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,601
Did you come to visit?

478
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,400
You're too casual.

479
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,987
You're not hesitant or flustered.

480
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,116
You didn't fail.

481
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,745
You weren't trying to kill me.

482
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,164
Excuse me?

483
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:05,002
- What are you saying?
- Was it a warning?

484
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,674
I heard you were hurt.

485
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:13,969
I'll take you wherever
you need to go if you need.

486
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:15,262
If so...

487
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,473
will you kill me next time?

488
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:23,770
You're saying
the strangest things.

489
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,313
Did your owner...

490
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,026
tell you why to do it?

491
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,196
I don't know what you're saying.

492
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,281
The reason.

493
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,616
Did your owner tell you why?

494
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:38,869
Owner?

495
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:39,953
The reason.

496
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,372
Did your owner tell you?

497
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,631
It's already done.

498
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,261
Does the reason matter?

499
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,389
Yes.

500
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,349
"It's already done."

501
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,644
So the reason's not important.

502
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:05,896
In return...

503
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,608
go and let Kang Inju know.

504
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,861
Tell him I won't forget his warning.

505
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,823
I always repay what is owed.

506
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:31,838
Damn it.

507
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:47,020
There are so many hot girls tonight.

508
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,272
I got everything prepared upstairs.

509
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,113
Just a moment.

510
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,632
When did you get here?

511
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,600
I'm glad you're okay.

512
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:10,770
Back then...

513
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:12,814
you were wrong.

514
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,032
We don't mean anything to one another.

515
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:24,826
Han Taeoh!

516
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,171
KANG INHA

517
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:41,885
Hello?

518
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,262
I was a coward.

519
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,306
If you're going to confess, forget it.

520
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:47,807
It's over.

521
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,267
It's not over yet.

522
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:52,312
At least not for me. I'm not done.

523
00:53:52,771 --> 00:53:54,105
No, I thought I was done. But...

524
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:59,110
I thought I was going to die,
and you were there.

525
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:02,489
Everything disappeared but you.

526
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,199
I told you, it's over.

527
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:06,701
- I kept losing consciousness.
- Taeoh!

528
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:09,579
- My memories started to disappear.
- Stop it.

529
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:13,208
My memories of you
didn't disappear. They only got clearer.

530
00:54:17,295 --> 00:54:19,631
You can mock me
saying it's childish self-pity.

531
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,302
Jerk...

532
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,387
I know.

533
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,598
I'm selfish.

534
00:54:30,141 --> 00:54:31,142
I'm the worst.

535
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,939
I know I have no right to say this to you.

536
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:44,614
I'm sorry.

537
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,166
I went to you that night.

538
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,351
You're right.

539
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,186
I was wrong.

540
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,568
