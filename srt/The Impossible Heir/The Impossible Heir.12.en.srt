THE LATE SEO JISUK

4
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,287
Taeoh.

5
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,009
Do you remember
your college rooftop house?

6
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:36,888
The person who broke my window
and caused a mess.

7
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,977
Since I was born, I've never had a mother.

8
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:50,985
But you had an incredible mother
who prayed for your future.

9
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:04,415
I think that's why you were bold
and confident all the time.

10
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:10,130
I'm sure it was hard for you
to secretly protect her.

11
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,980
Your mother's keepsake.

12
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,400
It seems like she left you a letter.

13
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:45,290
Thanks.

14
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,045
Taeoh.

15
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,175
We started in the mud pits
and got this far.

16
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,011
You're stronger than anyone I know.

17
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:03,099
I admit that's why I held onto you
and came all this way.

18
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,769
So don't fall apart now.

19
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:30,251
THE LATE SEO JISUK

20
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,188
To my loving son, Taeoh.

21
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,358
If you're reading this,

22
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,902
it will be my second time
leaving this world.

23
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:01,574
Even if it's my time to go,
there's something I want you to know.

24
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,745
Rage doesn't solve everything.

25
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,792
But if I'm sure about one thing,

26
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:15,630
it's that I don't want my son
to be buried in the past.

27
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,347
Bury your rage, hate,
and regret along with this letter.

28
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,559
I hope you'll be able to walk forward.

29
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,440
I lack so much as a mother
and didn't give you anything.

30
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:39,821
I know it's shameful of me to ask,
but can I ask you for one last favor?

31
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:46,244
I hope... you can let go of the past.

32
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:53,042
And... I hope tolerance
will always be with you in your future.

33
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,756
Please take your time...

34
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,342
getting to me.

35
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:06,889
If we meet again,
I want to give my son a big hug.

36
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,184
My son...

37
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,729
I love you.

38
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,690
Your loving mom.

KANGOH AIRLINE'S TRAVEL PACKAGE
FOR THE CITIZENS OF MAJU

40
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,265
Why did I run this far?

41
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,060
For what?

42
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,898
I don't plan on playing
in the minor leagues forever.

43
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,150
So, I'm going to use you.

44
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,111
You'll be my rope that'll help me reach...

45
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,072
the major leagues.

46
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,996
Desires for what I can't have?

47
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:03,417
In the end, you didn't trust me. Why?

48
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:07,046
You thought I'd mess things up,
and you're the only capable one!

49
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,717
If you're going to apologize, don't.

50
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:16,222
"I'm sorry. I was wrong."
I didn't come to hear that.

51
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,560
You ruined everything.

52
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,396
Our plan. Our dream.

53
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,483
An unforgiveable revenge?

54
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,612
For what reason?

55
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,144
This uncomfortable commotion
was caused by you...

56
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:07,898
 ...and that is why
you shouldn't come to Bisunjae.

57
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:23,122
Did I send you there for this?

58
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,624
It's the absolute worst!

59
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,376
In the end,

60
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,338
you didn't have
any expectations from me...

61
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:32,798
Father.

62
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,303
Finally, it's tomorrow.

63
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,195
Kangoh...

64
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,032
I'll protect it, sir.

2023 KANGOH CO., LTD.
SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING

66
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:40,194
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
CHAIRMAN KANG INHA

67
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,447
We can't collapse like this.

68
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,616
I...

69
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,910
I've endured everything for so long.

70
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,956
Kangoh can't fall
into someone else's hands!

71
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,749
Kangoh's mine!

72
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,292
Mother.

73
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:58,420
Call the legal team and have me released!

74
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,256
- Call my side of the family--
- Mother!

75
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,386
That's enough.

76
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,138
It's over now.

77
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,140
What?

78
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,642
Living for your dream.

79
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,813
I'm sick of it now.

80
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,607
Are you out of your mind?

81
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:22,069
- Why do you think I came all this way?
- Who was it for?

82
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,196
Was it for me?

83
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,156
Was it really for me?

84
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,325
No, Mother.

85
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,828
Don't say that.

86
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:33,706
It was for your greed.

87
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,292
Isn't that why you pushed me this far?

88
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,171
What?

89
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,008
My entire life...

90
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,177
I've never once been happy.

91
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,472
Walking on eggshells and pleasing others.

92
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,601
I never did what I wanted!

93
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,647
I was miserable.

94
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,155
I want to stop now.

95
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,659
I want to be happy.

96
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,504
Mom.

97
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,884
Let's stop now.

98
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,130
Hello.

99
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,590
Good morning.

100
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,099
- Hello.
- Hello.

101
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,726
- Hello.
- Good morning.

102
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,269
Hello.

103
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,023
Hello.

104
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,233
- Hello.
- Hello.

105
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:33,575
PY Holdings' launch
with Kang Inha's Kangoh...

106
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:43,002
MY DAUGHTER

107
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,338
Hey, Jingyeong.

108
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,216
It's a good day today,
and the sky's clear too.

109
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,427
Are you going
to the shareholders' meeting?

110
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,015
Yes, it seems my lifelong dream
is about to come true.

111
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,266
I'm sorry, Dad.

112
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,185
I have something to tell you.

113
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,368
Did you see Mom?

114
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,413
How is she?

115
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,458
Don't worry. She's fine.

116
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:29,465
Do we...

117
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,884
have a chance today?

118
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,768
I guess this is my seat.

119
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,520
Does it matter where we sit?

120
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,939
Bees will find their way to flowers.

121
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:59,953
I hope you two enjoy the show today.

122
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,000
Speaking of which, Mr. Park's late.

123
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,920
You're right. He left before me.

124
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:01,140
The sole reason
you've been able to survive

125
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:06,019
in Kangoh is because you share my blood.

126
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,771
That was your only excuse.

127
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,111
I'm different from my mother.

128
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,030
I won't give up that easily...

129
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,408
without even trying.

130
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,175
I suffered from Kang Inju,

131
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,136
and I lived in hell every day.

132
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,266
To the point
where I didn't want to live anymore.

133
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:48,770
DOCTOR PARK JINGYEONG

134
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,107
I couldn't live sober.

135
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:58,989
I'm sorry, Father.

136
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,117
No, you did nothing wrong.

137
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,244
It's my fault.

138
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:09,833
When you went astray,
all I did was scold you.

139
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,169
It's my fault for not looking deeper.

140
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,968
Right. I'll do my part as your father
before it's too late.

141
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,991
ARREST WARRANT

142
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,201
Mr. Kang Inha.

143
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:48,705
You are under arrest for the murder
of Kang Inju and Mo Gijun.

144
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,666
What are you saying?

145
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,668
Arrest him.

146
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,503
Wait a second!

147
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,505
- Get out, you two.
- Let go of me!

148
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,507
- Do you know who I am?
- Sir.

149
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,591
Get this off of me!

150
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,768
What?

151
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,191
Okay. Hang up.

152
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,277
What's going on?

153
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,030
CHAIRMAN KANG INHA

154
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,949
Director Kang Inha...

155
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,469
Yes?

156
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,262
My father wants to meet you.

157
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:30,098
Where do I need to go?

158
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,440
Goodness!

159
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,401
I'm sorry. I'll just pass through.

160
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,737
You scared me!

161
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,280
It's you!

162
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,700
Chief Gyeong!

163
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:52,579
- What's this?
- It's me!

164
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:57,709
Back in prison,
I had to follow your orders,

165
00:22:57,793 --> 00:23:01,338
but it's the other way around
now that I'm out.

166
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,093
You're supposed to be working
for your country.

167
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,845
You shouldn't have done that!

168
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,889
- You bastard!
- Come on!

169
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:14,017
- You bastard!
- You bastard!

170
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,852
It's not what you think.

171
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,355
Oh, right. Let me pick up my kid first.

172
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,940
- Stop that!
- Hey!

173
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,818
Sounds like a trick to me.

174
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,277
Just come with us quietly.

175
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,071
What are you doing?

176
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,155
- Okay.
- Let's go.

177
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,323
- Come on.
- Let go!

178
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:29,408
Let's go.

179
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,118
- Follow me!
- Okay, don't hit me!

180
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,202
What are you doing?

181
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,954
Damn it...

182
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:37,058
I kept you waiting, didn't I?
I had things to take care of.

183
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,894
Is Han Taeoh behind this?

184
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,772
If that's the case, you chose wrong.

185
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,026
Let's talk about the case.

186
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:52,157
Shall I start with Kang Inju's murder
or the conspiracy to murder Mo Gijun?

187
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,410
You have no proof or witnesses.
All you had was a warrant.

188
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:03,502
You'll have to take responsibility
for bringing me here.

189
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:10,342
You really do underestimate
our nation's prosecutors.

190
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,845
Who said I had no proof or witnesses?

191
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,168
But, Inha?

192
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,796
I'm a little scared.

193
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,633
You're scared?

194
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,345
It's only a matter of time
before I get a death sentence.

195
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,515
Now that it's come to this...

196
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,059
I'm kind of scared.

197
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,317
I shouldn't have said that.

198
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:12,612
Don't worry about what I said.

199
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,366
Is it tough in there?

200
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,494
Just hold on a little more.

201
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,205
I'll make things easier for you.

202
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,333
We're friends.

203
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,449
Mr. Mo Gijun! Are you all right?

204
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:07,959
PARK JINGYEONG

205
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,637
What's the matter?

206
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,639
You were right.

207
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,557
Mo Gijun...

208
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,604
was attacked.

209
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,530
No.

210
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,866
Don't get up. Just listen to me.

211
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,415
Who do you think...

212
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,043
did this to you?

213
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,714
Someone capable of abandoning others
for their personal gain.

214
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,217
Kang Inha has no friends.

215
00:27:58,635 --> 00:27:59,636
You were just...

216
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,097
another dog to him.

217
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,308
You're the only living proof...

218
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,977
...who knows what Kang Inha did
and can block his path.

219
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,941
Mo Gijun...

220
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,612
you're nothing more and nothing less.

221
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:24,911
All the crimes you've committed so far,
if you were on your own...

222
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,456
do you think all of that
would've happened?

223
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:39,968
I'll help you.

224
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:45,390
The days of living
as someone else's dog are over.

225
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,978
I'll help you...

226
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,814
live your own life.

227
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,597
How could you?

228
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,726
Do you know what I did to protect you?

229
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,772
Tell me.

230
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,942
Was I just one of your dogs?

231
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:40,153
I wasn't a friend?

232
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,115
Tell me!

233
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,286
I know.

234
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,749
You shouldn't have wavered until the end.

235
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,628
- What?
- If you're a dog...

236
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,509
you should've stayed loyal to me.

237
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,390
You bastard!

238
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:15,522
Gijun.

239
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,359
What do I hate most in the world?

240
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,655
Disgusting things.

241
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,412
But this disgusting and nasty thing

242
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,332
got all over me.

243
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,751
Why?

244
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,921
Because you didn't do your job properly.

245
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:43,007
I'm sorry.

246
00:30:57,313 --> 00:31:00,525
Chairman Kang promised you Energy.
Leave with that.

247
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,528
You're talking
as if you're the one giving it to me.

248
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,572
Why does it matter who gives it to you?

249
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,782
Just pay a fair price for it.

250
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,744
How much do you want?

251
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,372
One share...

252
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:17,041
will be a million won.

253
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,334
What?

254
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,378
Even with the management premium...

255
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,923
You bargained
between Chairman Kang and Inha.

256
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,508
Did that keep you busy?

257
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:29,137
I guess you missed
the stock price increase.

258
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,396
You remind me of a young Kang Joongmo.

259
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,483
Ah.

260
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,611
One more thing.

261
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,742
I hope you won't get involved
with Kang Inha anymore.

262
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,245
- Why not?
- I'm more than enough on my own.

263
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:03,272
We're from the prosecutors' office
and we appreciate your cooperation.

264
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,610
Move out of the way.

265
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,205
Grab everything.

266
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,874
- You can't touch that.
- Nothing's there.

267
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,392
One, two, three...

268
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:58,369
SENDER, KANG JOONGMO
RECEIVER, KANG INHA

269
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,300
SEOUL EASTERN DISTRICT COURT
DECREE

270
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,802
APPLICANT: KANG JOONGMO
PARTY INVOLVED: KANG INHA

271
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,973
PERMISSION GRANTED TO CHANGE THE LAST NAME
OF PARTY INVOLVED FROM "KANG" TO "BAEK."

272
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:28,274
PERMISSION GRANTED TO CHANGE THE LAST NAME
OF PARTY INVOLVED FROM "KANG" TO "BAEK."

273
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,253
It's Huiju.

274
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:32,171
I have to talk to you.

275
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,006
I'll see you at Bisunjae.

276
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,478
Bisunjae?

277
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,147
Yeah, I have to meet someone.

278
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,483
Hey, Han?

279
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:55,862
Spit it out.

280
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:59,532
Don't try to resolve things yourself.
Call me if something happens.

281
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,661
Thanks.

282
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,011
You came.

283
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,653
Chairman Kang...

284
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,034
What happened?

285
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,921
I asked her to call you.

286
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:46,639
Taeoh.

287
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,686
EASTERN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

288
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,063
Case number 1538.

289
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,440
Defendant Baek Inha,

290
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,527
please rise from your seat.

291
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,830
Do you have any last words?

292
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:37,356
We walked together looking towards
the same place.

293
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:41,444
When I thought we had arrived...

294
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,948
we were each looking
at something different.

295
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,786
How unfortunate.

296
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:05,217
Anything at all?

297
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,106
I don't.

298
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,777
Shouldn't he give
some sort of excuse?

299
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,404
Silence.

300
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,406
I will render a verdict.

301
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:34,914
The defendant, Baek Inha,
murdered his brother, Kang Inju,

302
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:38,334
attempted to murder his accomplice,
Mo Gijun,

303
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:41,003
and tried to destroy evidence.

304
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,048
With all things considered,

305
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,592
the court judges have agreed

306
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:50,638
that the nature
of the crimes are serious and heavy.

307
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:53,974
The verdict.

308
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,896
The defendant, Baek Inha,
is sentenced to life in prison.

309
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,359
How is it in there?

310
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:51,198
Don't ask me that.
Think about how it was for you.

311
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:53,868
It's not much different.

312
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,914
- I won't forgive you.
- I don't plan on asking for forgiveness.

313
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,542
Would asking for forgiveness
change anything?

314
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,467
Let me ask you one thing.

315
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,220
Why did you do that to me?

316
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,639
I don't know.

317
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:20,853
I can't remember the reason anymore.

318
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,481
Why did I do it?

319
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:25,483
Where did things go wrong?

320
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,694
Maybe...

321
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,240
it was because you were Han Taeoh.

322
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,078
You were none other than Han Taeoh.

323
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,213
Inha.

324
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,971
I liked that you were my friend.

325
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,099
I'm glad.

326
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,561
Let's be friends.

327
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:12,029
We just have to decide
what we'll do, and what we want to do.

328
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,865
Together.

329
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,514
Take care of yourself.

330
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,435
Taeoh.

331
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,378
Never mind.

332
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:12,673
Bye.

333
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,509
I won't see you out.

334
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,231
Do you have to go?

335
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:12,900
What's with you?

336
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:17,029
It's not like this is my first time
suddenly going on a trip.

337
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,114
It's just the timing.

338
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,158
Mother's not here.

339
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,077
And Father's not feeling well.

340
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:25,537
You're here.

341
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,918
You take care of
Mom and Dad until I get back.

342
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,922
How long will you be away?

343
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,758
I don't know.

344
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,178
I think this trip...

345
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,847
might take a little long.

346
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,645
What's with that look?

347
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:51,313
Wait.

348
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,232
Are you disappointed?

349
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,276
I'm smiling right now.

350
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,491
- Let's grab a drink when I get back.
- Okay.

351
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,077
Forget it. I'll take it down for you.

352
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,538
Go.

353
00:45:09,915 --> 00:45:12,042
The presidential election isn't far away.

354
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,919
Move as quickly as possible.

355
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,425
Yes, sounds good.

356
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,552
Report the progress back to me.

357
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:29,643
What brings you here?

358
00:45:31,478 --> 00:45:32,479
Do you want a beer?

359
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:34,857
Suddenly?

360
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,234
The reason I suddenly want
to drink beer...

361
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,987
We're college buddies and neighbors.

362
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:43,615
Also, we have the same humble background
with the same goal.

363
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,743
I think that's more than enough reason.

364
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,224
Impressive.

365
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:14,688
What about you?

366
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,024
Are things going well?

367
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,277
It's okay.

368
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,450
You haven't gone to see Inha, have you?

369
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,790
I want to focus on myself now.

370
00:46:34,416 --> 00:46:35,417
Yeah.

371
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,920
That was always the path you wanted.

372
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,017
I swear...

373
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,228
you haven't changed at all either.

374
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,984
I envy that you can be persistent
and achieve your goals

375
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,029
without having to change.

376
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,491
You're the same.

377
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,370
You're the same as me.

378
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:16,542
In the past or present,
we still live as fiercely as we can.

379
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,669
We dream of other things.

380
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,088
Just as we did today,

381
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,674
we won't stop tomorrow either.

382
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,679
That's us.

383
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:31,640
You and I...

384
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,893
will never change.

385
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:41,418
THREE YEARS LATER

386
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:44,796
The Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center
led by CEO Kang Seongju

387
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,549
has experienced an annual growth
of more than 10%.

388
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,552
It is leading the global business
expansion in Kangoh Group.

389
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:01,563
Chairman Kang.

390
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,608
Your dream...

391
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,611
is finally complete.

392
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,468
Mr. President.

393
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:35,180
Will you continue to attend
bipartisan luncheons in the future?

394
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:38,266
I'll invite you
to the Blue House next month.

395
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,478
I want all of you to attend as well.

396
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,898
I'll see you next week during

397
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,566
- the state visit to Italy.
- Okay.

398
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,216
I heard a lot of things happened

399
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,510
while I was in the hospital.

400
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,638
I was on the verge of losing Kangoh,

401
00:51:00,098 --> 00:51:01,308
and you overcame the crisis.

402
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,103
I always thought that someone

403
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:09,107
with no self-interest
and who only thinks of Kangoh's well-being

404
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,902
could become the owner of the 151st floor.

405
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,696
An owner

406
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,949
should protect and take care
of what's given to them.

407
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:19,868
However,

408
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,871
you couldn't protect
what was given to you.

409
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:26,958
Your love, your friend,
and even your family.

410
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,669
In the end, you have nothing beside you.

411
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:33,006
You know better than anyone else.

412
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,512
- I--
- If I give you one last chance...

413
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,232
will you be able to protect it?

414
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,786
CEO HAN TAEOH

415
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,874
Congratulations on completing Royal Road.

416
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,793
Chairman Han Taeoh.

417
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,843
It could've been you in this seat.

418
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:20,178
Don't you regret it?

419
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:24,099
Well...

420
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,561
I'd be lying if I said no.

421
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:32,732
But I have trust in my father's choice.

422
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,443
He's never been wrong.

423
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:37,654
Thanks.

424
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,532
Still, don't let your guard down.

425
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,536
If there are any issues
in Kangoh's management,

426
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,372
I could aim for this position

427
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,833
whenever I want.

428
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,335
Okay.

429
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,004
Watch over me.

430
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:27,329
THE LATE BAEK INHA

431
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,086
This is Cancún, Mexico!

432
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,463
Survival report complete!

433
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:32,811
Chairman Han Taeoh.

434
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:35,772
Why did you send me so much money
for my vacation?

435
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,901
Forget about work for now,
and have some fun.

436
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,027
You mean it?

437
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,238
You won't suddenly call me to work, right?

438
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,198
My phone will be off.

439
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:49,077
- Of course.
- Thanks, Chairman.

440
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:53,873
MR. HAN

441
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,795
Nice catch!

442
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,966
Stop it! Don't!

443
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,183
Boss, come on in!

444
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:15,562
- The ground's getting wet! I'm going in!
- Come on!

445
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,339
Let's go.

446
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:32,138
KANGOH CHILDREN'S FOUNDATION
INAUGURATION CEREMONY

447
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:28,027
When I was 18,

448
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:32,824
I dreamt of this very moment.

449
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,537
Now, having achieved that dream...

450
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,125
I'm still dreaming for myself.
