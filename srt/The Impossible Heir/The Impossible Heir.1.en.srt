THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,905
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,978
The next stop is

4
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,272
Maju Station.

5
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:53,279
Please check your belongings
and have a good day.

6
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,835
This may be a rural area,

7
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,588
but you can't find a place like this
with that money.

8
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,968
By the way, if you're 18,

9
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,429
even if you're mature for your age,

10
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:01,973
you're kind of young to live alone.

11
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,267
- Your parents are...
- They passed away.

12
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,437
Goodness.

13
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,939
Then what brings you here?

14
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,108
It's my mom's hometown.

15
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,234
Is that so?

16
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,695
What was her name?

17
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,162
- I'll take it.
- Sure, okay.

18
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,164
Great choice.

19
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,124
Let's see.

20
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,086
I'll bring the contract from my house.

21
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,297
We just need to sign it.

22
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,757
I'll come to your house.

23
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,760
Wouldn't that be right? Let's go.

24
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:45,099
They're shooting it in the middle
of the day now.

25
00:03:46,351 --> 00:03:48,228
Unbelievable.

26
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:54,275
I'm sure you'll come to find out,
but this is a great neighborhood to live.

27
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,611
It's rural,
but it's still a part of Maju City.

28
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,571
We're not county residents. Right?

29
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,425
That's Kangoh Group's third son.

30
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,971
I think the eldest came too.

31
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,223
I guess he's staying at home today.

32
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:27,850
Then again,

33
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,395
he's an illegitimate child,
what use is he?

34
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,563
That's why he was confined here.

35
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,942
Goodness.

36
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,569
Young Master Inha
goes to Kangoh High School.

37
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,698
How old are you? I mean, what grade?

38
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,782
No, wait.

39
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,993
Forget everything I said.

40
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,412
You didn't hear anything from me, okay?

41
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:48,913
Let's go.

42
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,188
Like this!

43
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,363
HIRING

44
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,367
I'm sorry, but we don't hire
high school kids.

45
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,286
I see.

46
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,039
Instead of here,

47
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,542
there's a restaurant called Hanwoowok.
Try there.

48
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,628
I think they were looking to hire someone
to man the grills.

49
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,424
Thank you.

50
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,014
There we go.

51
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:35,413
It gets hectic during dinner time,
so never be late.

52
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,749
- Yes, sir. Thank you.
- Yeah, see you later.

53
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,918
HANWOOWOK

54
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:53,389
FRESH FRUIT

55
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,434
What are you looking at?

56
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,300
I saw you at the convenience store.

57
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,263
You should leave a review
if you enjoyed it.

58
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,682
You saw me do it.

59
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,310
How was I?

60
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,479
Are you embarrassed?

61
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,651
Ah. Here in Maju, they pretend
not to see anything I do.

62
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,570
They pretend not to know.
It's like an unwritten rule.

63
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,161
- I have no reason to be embarrassed.
- You are embarrassed.

64
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,623
Because I saw you
and I don't care about the rules.

65
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:03,334
- What are you saying?
- Let me tell you.

66
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:07,088
Those people aren't pretending
not to know.

67
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,548
They don't need to pretend.

68
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,884
- What?
- It's almost like...

69
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:16,681
- you're invisible.
- We just met. That's rude.

70
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,311
If you're going to be rude,
you should apologize.

71
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,231
Do you want attention?

72
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:26,732
That's not an apology.

73
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,487
Steal something bigger
if you want attention.

74
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,448
Not worthless trash.

75
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,868
Isn't this tip better...

76
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,538
rather than an apology?

77
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,433
Up.

78
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,734
Jab then knee up!

79
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,196
Steal something bigger
if you want attention.

80
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,658
- Not worthless trash.

81
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,993
Isn't this tip better...

82
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,370
rather than an apology?

83
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,917
HORSE RACE WINNER
SPONSORED BY KANGOH GROUP

84
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,794
Let's go. Cham cham cham!

85
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,340
- Why is it two?
- You're making dust fly!

86
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,474
- Cham cham cham!
- Settle!

87
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,727
- Cham, cham, cham!
- What?

88
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,811
What's this?

89
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,690
Hey, sit down.

90
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,110
Come on in.

91
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,743
He's a new transfer.

92
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,411
Introduce yourself.

93
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,747
My name...

94
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,124
is Han Taeoh.

95
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,045
Can he not speak?

96
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,423
- Is that all?
- That was simple and nice.

97
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,551
There's an empty seat in the back.

98
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:18,636
Go sit there.

99
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,263
Now.

100
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,974
Every cloud has a silver lining.

101
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,061
We're close to having a top student
in our class.

102
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,145
Our transfer student

103
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,732
scored in the top 0.1% nationwide
on the mock test.

104
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,994
Go eat somewhere else.

105
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,079
Get lost.

106
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,956
Punk.

107
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,125
What is this?

108
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,669
- It looks good.
- It's terrible.

109
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,921
It's strange.

110
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,352
- What are you doing?
- I just don't like you.

111
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,558
What the hell?

112
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,268
That was so cool!

113
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,739
Hey, kill him!

114
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,577
What's going on?

115
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,537
Kill him! Get him!

116
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,708
Stop!

117
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,629
What are you two doing?

118
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:34,647
LETTER OF APOLOGY

119
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,526
What? Why don't you show off again?

120
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,236
Call me invisible again.

121
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,696
Give me another tip.

122
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:45,574
Hey, Inha.

123
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,785
The teacher said you can go.

124
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,204
Okay.

125
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,209
The invisible man is leaving.

126
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,380
Good luck.

127
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,143
Damn it.

128
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,855
He told him to go too?

129
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,483
The vice principal kept going on
about sending you home so he did,

130
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,902
but he had to send Taeoh home too.

131
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:25,406
The invisible man is leaving.
Good luck.

132
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,200
That's so embarrassing. Damn it.

133
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,870
- Get off.
- What? What about the movie?

134
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,663
I'm busy! Get off!

135
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,769
Why didn't you go home?

136
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,524
Didn't you get the message to go home?

137
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,582
Hello?

138
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,687
Hey!

139
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,834
I'm sorry, but can you hurry?

140
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,823
Use a watermelon!

141
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,324
He should re-enlist.

142
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,409
Hey.

143
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,704
That's enough.

144
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,808
Wow!

145
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,709
Kang Inju! Kang Inju!

146
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,356
Mom.

147
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,197
Run away.

148
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:00,829
Just...

149
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,042
Just leave right now!

150
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,569
MAJU - NAMWON

151
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,077
Son, you know, don't you?

152
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,872
You know I didn't kill your mother.

153
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,377
She's alive and well.

154
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,506
Go and tell her.

155
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,301
Tell her not to let her guard down
because I'm in here.

156
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,346
My boys left to find her,

157
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,639
and I'll see her soon.

158
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,766
Right.

159
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:04,852
We should meet too.

160
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:07,688
I miss my son...

161
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,066
so very much.

162
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,879
You, this way. You, that way. Go quickly.

163
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:32,963
Hurry up!

164
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,559
FIGHTER LA INJAE WINS MMA FIGHT FC

TEAM MAD DWAG'S TUITION FEES

166
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:04,578
Why? Are you going to learn
to fight to beat me up?

167
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,211
Do they teach you how to kill someone?

168
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,257
- That's what I need.
- You're crazy.

169
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,467
Forget it.

170
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,600
You want me to teach you?

171
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:30,979
But...

172
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,233
I'll teach you if you beat me.

173
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,238
Put it on.

174
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,223
I miss my son...

175
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,976
so very much.

176
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,228
We should meet too.

177
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,067
Are you okay?

178
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,073
You little...

179
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,951
- No! Taeoh!
- What the hell did you say?

180
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,745
Not Taeoh! No!

181
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:11,621
Not Taeoh!

182
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,789
- No!
- Move!

183
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,542
- Taeoh!
- Aren't you sleepy?

184
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,294
- Shall I put you down?
- Honey!

185
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,338
- No, no!

186
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:25,635
Hey! Stop!

187
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,762
Stop, you bastard!

188
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,184
Stop!

189
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,908
Oh.

190
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:51,286
You nutjob.

191
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,791
Am I the one you want to kill?

192
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,172
I'm so hungry.

193
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,925
Want to get burgers?

194
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,804
I won, so I'm buying.

195
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:14,810
Let's go again.

196
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,230
I surrender!

197
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,316
You won!

198
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:41,294
Bye.

199
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,046
- Friends...
- Nope.

200
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,548
I didn't finish yet.

201
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,925
I don't want anything you're about to say.

202
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:51,054
I don't want to be your friend either.

203
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,639
It was about the burger!

204
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:55,600
I was going to tell you to pay me back!

205
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:57,477
How rude!

206
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,397
Hey! You'd better pay me back!

207
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,732
Pay me back, jerk! So annoying!

208
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,165
Friend?

209
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,099
Hey!

210
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,434
Hey, Inha!

211
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,935
Did you hear the news?

212
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:41,646
Your face...

213
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,815
- What about it?
- It looks swollen.

214
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,902
- I know.
- What? Hear what?

215
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,153
That's right!

216
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,613
It's about Taeoh.

217
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:51,740
His dad killed his mom!

218
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,450
Stop lying!

219
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,410
- His dad killed his mom?
- Stop lying.

220
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,370
- There you go again.
- A murderer's son?

221
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,914
Why would I lie?

222
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,250
So what?

223
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,835
It's so brutal.

224
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,213
He's the son of a murderer!
Are you kidding me?

225
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,090
By chance, do you talk about me too?

226
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,011
That I'm a bastard who can't even
call his dad, "dad".

227
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,640
Why would you bring that up now?

228
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,559
You ran in here like this before
and told the other kids.

229
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,187
"Hey! Inha's a bastard!

230
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,147
"That's why he's abandoned here!"

231
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:32,989
You can never keep your mouth shut.
Is it because you're a lowly nobody?

232
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,535
- That's kind of harsh.
- Yeah, I'm allowed to be.

233
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,539
I'm a very luxurious bastard.

234
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:45,669
The son of a distribution center's
security chief is nothing compared to me.

235
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:49,256
The person way up there is my creator.

236
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,175
Who's your creator?

237
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,264
He's just a servant
that gets paid by my creator.

238
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,316
Don't mind him. Let's go.

239
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,829
I don't.

240
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,415
You're the one who's bothered.

241
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:56,781
I bet the other kids are chatting away.

242
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,659
They're like hyenas.

243
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,625
What're you listening to?

244
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,467
What song is this?

245
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,928
- My mom's song.
- Is your mom a singer?

246
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,013
You're crazy.

247
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:24,267
My mom listened to it everyday.

248
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,477
Ah.

249
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,022
I've listened to it so much
that the tape wore out.

250
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,026
That kind of song.

251
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,370
Don't you want to know if it's true?

252
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:46,539
Not really.

253
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,877
He's not my biological father.

254
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,921
The cause was domestic violence.

255
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,383
He's been sentenced to death
and is in prison.

256
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:59,886
- Wow.
- Are you scared?

257
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,471
Not really.

258
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,891
You're not a killer
and I've never met your father.

259
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,858
- Let's be friends.
- Are you doing me a favor?

260
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,652
You said you didn't want to.

261
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,487
How ridiculous.

262
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:22,492
Let me rephrase, instead of friends,
let's be partners.

263
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,869
Do you want to be bullies or something?

264
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,329
That's so childish.

265
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,791
I don't plan on playing
in the minor leagues forever.

266
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,877
So, I'm going to use you.

267
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,880
You'll be my rope that'll help me reach...

268
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:37,924
the major leagues.

269
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,345
In return,

270
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,348
I'll help you get what you want.

271
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:47,976
What I want?

272
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,147
What's that?

273
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,857
Whatever it is.

274
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,028
Who do you think you are?

275
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,656
With what power?

276
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,199
Top 0.1%?

277
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,202
You're just a smart bum.

278
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:07,328
I'm not a bum.

279
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,456
Han Taeoh.

280
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,543
The power you speak of.
It's not a big deal to me.

281
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,838
I have something better.

282
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,133
Desperation.

283
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:35,398
Will it be possible for me to go to...

284
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,444
- Hanguk University with you?
- My smarts,

285
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,155
top 0.1% in the nation.

286
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:44,908
I'll give it to you.

287
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,744
We just have to decide what we'll do,

288
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,829
and what we want to do.

289
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,500
Together.

290
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,698
We will depart shortly.
The doors are closing.

291
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,082
Let's each pick a problem

292
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,834
that we solved today.

293
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,460
Who wants to go first?

294
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,173
Come on.

295
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,815
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

296
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,486
♪ Happy birthday dear Han Taeoh
who just showered ♪

297
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,071
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

298
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:29,364
Whoo!

299
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,991
I told you not to do it this year.

300
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,410
Shut up and blow it out.
This was expensive.

301
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,206
Ah!

302
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:39,916
Your wish!

303
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,420
I throw you a birthday party
and you complain. Uh!

304
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:53,137
A report on industrial organization
and this week's lecture notes.

305
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,597
I color-coded it by importance.

306
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,266
The details are inside. Take a look.

307
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,317
This is why I can't help but love you.

308
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,239
Now.

309
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,450
BISUN-RO, JONGRO, SEOUL

310
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,415
That's my birthday gift to you.

311
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,542
The address to Bisunjae.

312
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,878
I recommended you to tutor Huiju in math
to Mr. Moon.

313
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:29,799
I did good, didn't I?

314
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:31,426
I'm the best, right?

315
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,849
So what are you going to do today?

316
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,018
- I'm going to school.
- After that.

317
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,144
Work.

318
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,813
Study, money, study, money, study, money.

319
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,773
Live a little, man!

320
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,777
You have to read it
before I turn in the report, okay?

321
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,320
Stop nagging!

322
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,075
Try this.

323
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,954
The color is different. It looks good.

324
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,249
Hey, this too.

325
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,876
This is lamb.

326
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:16,012
Will your father
make the announcement today?

327
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,346
What announcement?

328
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:19,849
Who he'll appoint
to the Future Strategy Office.

329
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,434
Who do you think? It's me.

330
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,938
Don't just assume,
and try to get a concrete answer.

331
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:28,983
What if they use media manipulation
against us?

332
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,110
They won't. They're scared of Father.

333
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,946
The same goes for them.

334
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,657
Ah.

335
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,112
Yes, sir.

336
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,530
- It's due tomorrow.
- Okay.

337
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,490
Hey, Taeoh.

338
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,867
Professor Choi Dongwuk's looking for you.

339
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:21,744
Bye.

340
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,838
Hey, come on in. Sit.

341
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,757
Let's see.

342
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,845
Do I have anything to offer you?

343
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,349
There's not much to being a professor.

344
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:50,398
I called to compliment you on this report.

345
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,484
I randomly chose the title.

346
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,279
The key points in your report

347
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,990
points out the future strategy
for Kangoh, right?

348
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:02,201
- Yes.
- To be honest, I got a thesis proposal

349
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,704
from Kangoh Economic Research Institute.

350
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,747
But with the report you wrote,

351
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:10,459
it narrowed it down
to the one thing they want.

352
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,296
"Co-prosperity Cooperation Center."

353
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,799
"Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center"?

354
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,094
It's a sort of business unit
for acquisitions and investments

355
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,804
in various startup sectors.

356
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,974
Of course,
investments are just the pretext.

357
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,059
The key is merger and acquisition.

358
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,814
Let me buy this report.

359
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,776
How much do you want?

360
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,740
I'll hold onto the cost of...

361
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,410
the report for my future.

362
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,213
The key you were looking for.

363
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:57,089
I think I got my hand on it.

364
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,302
This will be a new power for Kangoh Group.

365
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,264
It will open a new era for Kang Seongju.

366
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:08,601
FUTURE STRATEGY FOR KANGOH

367
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,322
KANGOH GROUP, RANKED 9TH IN THE WORLD

368
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,242
ASK CHAIRMAN KANG JOONGMO
AND SENIOR DIRECTOR KANG SEONGJU

369
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,580
KANGOH GROUP

370
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,799
A BLUEPRINT
FOR KANGOH'S SUCCESSION STRUCTURE

371
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,219
INJU OR SEONGJU?

372
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,388
WHO'LL BE THE DIRECTOR OF
FUTURE STRATEGY OFFICE?

373
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,441
THE TWO BROTHER'S SUCCESSION PLAN
HAS BEGUN

374
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,093
Oh. Wait.

375
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:31,017
Are you pretending not to know me?

376
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,978
We're neighbors
and we're in the same department.

377
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,148
I think that's enough
for you to act like you know me.

378
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,237
Hey.

379
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,660
Your coffee.

380
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,163
Ah. I don't drink coffee.

381
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,958
And my name's not "hey."

382
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,877
It's Na Hyewon.

383
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,427
Let's go eat.

384
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,433
I'm hungry! Come on!

385
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,942
Don't be too discouraged.

386
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,113
That doesn't mean do whatever you want.

387
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:31,285
You're not going like that, are you?

388
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,874
- Why?
- First impressions matter at Bisunjae.

389
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,126
Let's buy a collared shirt.

390
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,670
- Forget it.
- Then change your t-shirt.

391
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:42,838
That's enough.

392
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,090
You have to change!

393
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,675
Hurry!

394
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,177
Okay.

395
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,287
Are you interested?

396
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,458
Are you into Na Hyewon?

397
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,586
You're talking nonsense
which means I have to go.

398
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,965
- You've never had that look before.
- What look?

399
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:31,971
It's not, "What's her deal?"

400
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,891
It was more like, "I wonder who she is."

401
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,018
Fine. I'll change.

402
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,688
What? Han Taeoh just changed the subject.

403
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,814
You're crazy.

404
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,066
I'll hit on her if you don't.

405
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,485
- Do whatever you want.
- Playing hard to get?

406
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,671
How adorable.

407
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:25,816
Welcome.

408
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,028
This way.

409
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,410
Isn't our house nice?

410
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,667
My name's Kang Huiju.
I'm a first-year at Kangoh Arts High.

411
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:46,295
Are you the new tutor?

412
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:48,506
I'll take him inside.

413
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:56,764
Are you arrogant?

414
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,354
Or are you confident?

415
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,862
Good, your understanding
of quadratic equations are established.

416
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,489
Next is the most important.

417
00:42:13,572 --> 00:42:15,282
The minimum and maximum values.

418
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,619
- Are you good at anything else?
- In general form...

419
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:19,870
I asked you a question.

420
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,001
Running.

421
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,671
Wow, it's destiny!

422
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,507
Running's the second best thing
I'm good at.

423
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,345
In general form,

424
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:40,057
y equals x squared
minus two x minus three.

425
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,267
How do you fix that?

426
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:44,687
Change it to standard form
and find the vertex.

427
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,025
I see.

428
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,402
Y is open parenthesis,

429
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:56,073
x minus one, close parenthesis,
squared minus four.

430
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,785
- Also...
- I heard you're Inha's best friend.

431
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,120
Since when?

432
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:04,164
I find smart people boring.
Are you the same?

433
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:07,835
But...

434
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:10,462
have you thought about
changing your style?

435
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,047
To something younger.

436
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,133
Maybe swoop your hair to the side.

437
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:18,512
Then, the vertex is at one
with a value of minus four.

438
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,264
You're no fun.

439
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,310
Still, you're handsome.

440
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,229
I'll give you that.

441
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,741
If you're testing my patience,
you can't beat me.

442
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,410
No, I can.

443
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,912
Patience can't be bought.

444
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,122
Do you want to bet?

445
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,084
Let's see if it can be bought or not.

446
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,504
Have you hit bottom?

447
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,340
You can find out.

448
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:57,051
See if I'm at my bottom or not.

449
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,470
See what kind of person I am.

450
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,488
Send me your account number

451
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,865
and I'll wire your payment next time.

452
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,034
Also, this.

453
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,835
Even if it's uncomfortable,
you must sign it.

454
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,420
CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

455
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:42,012
SIGNEE, HAN TAEOH

456
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,866
Do you want more?

457
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:04,743
I'm good.

458
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:08,747
You see the chairman?

459
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,918
I met Mr. Moon
and your sister, Kang Huiju.

460
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:14,670
I only saw them.

461
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,382
She's grown, right?

462
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,511
What?

463
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,432
- Trying to read your mind.
- What are you saying?

464
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:28,892
"I want to see my family."

465
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:32,604
"I miss my family."
Something along those lines.

466
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:35,190
No way.

467
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,109
I'd have to see them to miss them.

468
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,654
You keep in touch with your sister.

469
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,532
Is that why? Huiju's different.

470
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,326
She's almost like my real sister.

471
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,830
Blood is thicker than water.

472
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:52,499
Something like that.

473
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,961
I'll get more beer.

474
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,555
About Na Hyewon...

475
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,143
Where does she live?

476
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:13,771
Why do you want to know?
Are you a stalker?

477
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,439
I'm really interested in her.

478
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,034
Are you being sincere?

479
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,745
I'm always sincere.

480
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:33,540
In every moment.
So where does she live and work?

481
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:37,002
What does she like the most?
Go find out, Mr. Han Taeoh.

482
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,991
Hey, open the door!

483
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,328
Open the door, brat!

484
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,496
Open the door!

485
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,248
Open the door!

486
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,050
Hey!

487
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,262
Hey.

488
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:29,847
Hyewon.

489
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,765
Your mom's here.

490
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:32,850
Come out.

491
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,147
Give it back! Give it!

492
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,568
Hey, if I hadn't given birth to you,

493
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:47,239
could you have gone to Hanguk University,
the best in our country?

494
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:50,158
Be quiet!

495
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,786
Shut your mouth before I make you!

496
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:59,126
You're in this world thanks to me.

497
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,627
If you reaped the benefits,

498
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:03,005
have some shame, you brat!

499
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,717
How long
were you going to to hide from me?

500
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:12,514
I'm sure you made plenty of money
tutoring with your background!

501
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:16,059
You're dead if I find any money
in your house!

502
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:17,811
Where did you hide it?

503
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:19,646
Give me more!

504
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,440
Unbelievable.

505
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,079
What? You ignored me before.

506
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,790
Just do what you normally do.

507
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:22,501
Hey.

508
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,254
Do you want some beer?

509
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:37,099
Mmm. We're neighbors and classmates.

510
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,643
I think that's more than enough reason

511
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,395
for us to grab a beer.

512
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,286
Unbelievable.
You're seriously just drinking.

513
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,165
I mean, I'm thankful you're not asking,

514
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,209
but it's not like you didn't see it.

515
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:05,877
You saw what happened.

516
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,171
Pretending to be clueless
is uncomfortable.

517
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,176
That's how I lived.

518
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:32,529
Aside from Bisunjae and work,
MD Kang Seongju goes swimming,

519
00:50:32,612 --> 00:50:35,866
horseback riding, golfing,
and nothing out of the ordinary.

520
00:50:36,241 --> 00:50:38,785
Executive Managing Director Kang Inju
showed a change.

521
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,955
Two days ago in Cheongdam,

522
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,832
he took over a club called Chrom.

523
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,834
- He bought a club?
- Yes.

524
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:49,588
He's deliberately trying to loaf around.

525
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:51,840
How pathetic.

526
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,762
FUTURE STRATEGY OFFICE
ESTABLISHMENT PLAN

527
00:50:56,845 --> 00:51:00,098
You'll leave the Future Strategy Office
to one of the two...

528
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,185
The establishment plan just came out.

529
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:04,770
Let's not rush.

530
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:07,481
I'm sorry, sir.

531
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:25,749
Mr. Moon...

532
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:28,085
should have arrived by now.

533
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:50,982
What of him?

534
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:53,485
You're the star on this road.

535
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:56,071
We have to get rid of any obstacles
in your way.

536
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:14,589
You'll still be able
to continue your lifestyle.

537
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,717
You won't be cut off
from financial support.

538
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,052
By chance,

539
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:22,305
if you think it's not legally valid,

540
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,099
you're wrong.

541
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:28,436
You know the legality of it can be made

542
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:31,773
depending on how it's used, right?

543
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,363
Only
the establishment plan is out,

544
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:41,867
but the news is already talking
about the Future Strategy Office,

545
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,952
so they're preparing for the succession.

546
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:45,996
Which means...

547
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,248
Director Jang Geumseok will call you.

548
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,876
Since the succession plan has begun,

549
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,712
the bastard son will become a nuisance.

550
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:59,009
What if she tells you
to give up your inherited shares?

551
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,348
If I want to get inside,

552
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:08,602
I'll give them up.

553
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,272
You're right.
There's only one answer.

554
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:14,774
It's predetermined.

555
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,778
There's only one answer.
It's predetermined.

556
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:22,616
Whether you can reach the answer or not
depends on you.

557
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,745
Go over the questions you got wrong.

558
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,080
Don't just review them.

559
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:32,334
If you want to find the answer,
look over the process.

560
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,753
If the process is wrong,

561
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,797
it will never take you
to the right answer.

562
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,304
I signed the papers.

563
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,494
Hurry up and go inside.

564
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,788
Seriously.

565
00:54:16,127 --> 00:54:17,337
But did we buy too much?

566
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:18,922
Our fridge is tiny.

567
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,799
I told you this was too much.

568
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,559
What is it? What now?

569
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,270
We didn't buy alcohol.

570
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,244
Hello.

571
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,083
- Just a second.
- Okay.

572
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,217
We've plenty of alcohol.

573
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,439
Why is there so much? Wow.

574
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,361
Now, let's go to my house.

575
00:55:23,945 --> 00:55:25,405
It's too cramped here.

576
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:27,949
Well?

577
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,454
Sounds good.

578
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:36,791
Hey. What are you doing?

579
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:39,294
Let's go!

580
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,212
I'll come after I clean up.

581
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:48,678
Clean up?

582
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,890
Oh! You can't go in.

583
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:57,520
Shall we wait downstairs?

584
00:55:57,604 --> 00:55:58,980
Uh...

585
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,607
I have to go to the bathroom.

586
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:01,691
Ah.

587
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,196
Sorry about that.

588
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:28,760
This is unexpected.

589
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,387
Who knew that'd embarrass you?

590
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,430
I'm a person. I'm not a robot.

591
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,350
What is it?

592
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:37,143
The bathroom?

593
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,980
That was an excuse.
I wanted to be clear about something.

594
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:44,484
Don't get the wrong idea,
I didn't follow Inha here because of you.

595
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,320
You want me to think that?

596
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,950
What if I want you to?

597
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:00,417
You're kind of cute today.

598
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,556
Now, let's toast!

599
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:18,268
Cheers!

600
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:23,648
Ah.

601
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,277
Got any friends?

602
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:30,947
You're always alone.

603
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:32,740
I'm pretty busy.

604
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,285
There's no one busier than Han Taeoh.

605
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,369
But he has a friend.

606
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,705
It's me.

607
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:41,499
Then you can be my friend too.

608
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:44,586
I don't want to be just friends.

609
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,713
I could be your boyfriend.

610
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:51,217
Why does that sound so cocky to me?

611
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:53,052
You're right, I'm cocky.

612
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:54,804
I don't like groundless confidence.

613
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:56,222
It's not groundless.

614
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,475
My friend?

615
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,853
Tell her who I am.
Introduce me.

616
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:05,982
He has a lot.

617
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:07,650
So...

618
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,069
he has a lot to lose too.

619
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,406
But he's so rich
that it's okay for him to lose it.

620
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:17,368
Did you hear that?
The grounds for my confidence.

621
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,080
I admit it. It wasn't groundless.

622
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:25,210
If you admit it,

623
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,005
go out with me.

624
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:32,717
I told you. I'm really busy.

625
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,179
That's such a practical reason.

626
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:38,890
- If that's why you're rejecting me...
- If you keep going...

627
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,143
you'll make me feel uncomfortable.

628
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:47,565
Okay, I got it.

629
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,074
Cheers!

630
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,271
Na Hyewon isn't easy.

631
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:28,273
She said she was uncomfortable.

632
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,359
- I'm being sincere.
- I know.

633
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:33,945
But that doesn't make it right.

634
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,158
- Let's go.
- I'll take you home.

635
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,536
- You had wine.
- Whoops!

636
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:45,039
- I'm going.
- Bye.

637
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:06,477
This feels strange.

638
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:19,782
How about another round?

639
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:32,420
This is where I lived two years back.

640
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,716
I paid the rent by cleaning a bathhouse.

641
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,096
It's not as great as the night view
at Inha's place,

642
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:43,848
but isn't it still nice?

643
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:47,352
It's better.

644
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:53,941
This place, and this moment.

645
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,195
You shouldn't think it's better.

646
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,907
Then there's no reason
for you to be with Inha.

647
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:06,496
Aren't you hanging out with Inha
for the reason I'm thinking?

648
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,247
And what's that?

649
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,585
Kang Inha's a golden rope.

650
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,296
Why did you bring me here?

651
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:17,799
You and I...

652
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,385
are very similar.

653
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,816
Just say what you want.

654
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,985
Kang Inha,
the bastard son of Kangoh Group.

655
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:41,948
You want to gamble
to see whether he'll be...

656
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:46,035
the golden rope or the rotten one.

657
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,416
- Like me.
- Yeah.

658
01:01:54,001 --> 01:01:55,002
Like you.

659
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,479
Speaking of which,

660
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:18,276
why didn't Taeoh tell me
that Hyewon lived here?

661
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,118
If I asked you to help me,

662
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:30,496
would you?
