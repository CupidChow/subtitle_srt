00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,487
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,989
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,439
I'm back, Chairman Kang.

4
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,330
If Chairman Kang
wakes up tomorrow,

5
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:24,167
you're fated to leave Kangoh as planned.

6
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,961
Kang Inha is just a hollow shell.

7
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,338
Baek Inha!

8
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,173
That's who you are.

9
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,553
Put everything you have
in your hands down.

10
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,806
Go back to your old life.

11
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,475
If you go back and live quietly,

12
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,478
I won't make you pay...

13
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,147
for your crimes.

14
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:59,119
VIP PATIENT KANG JOONGMO

15
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,292
I'm sorry, Father.

16
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,212
You should've just died then.

17
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,132
If you had...

18
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,013
we wouldn't have go through this twice.

19
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:04,953
How did you become such a monster?

20
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,707
- How?
- Don't act all high and mighty.

21
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,462
- Do you think you're any different?
- What becomes of you if the chairman dies?

22
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,257
You'll become a nobody. An invisible man.

23
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,300
You're crazy.

24
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,512
Snap out of it, Kang Inha.

25
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,474
Can't you return to being
the old Kang Inha?

26
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,060
Look who's talking.
Quit and go back to your place.

27
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,355
Didn't you say your life goal
was to get me to the top of Kangoh?

28
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:36,818
I can achieve that dream if you just
leave me alone so what's the problem?

29
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,364
Don't give me any more lessons.

30
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,951
The Kang Inha you know is gone.

31
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,371
Fine.

32
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,416
Do whatever you want.

33
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,753
However, you'll have to use
all your strength to stop me.

34
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,006
I know a lot things.

35
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,219
What do you know?

36
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,345
Everything.

37
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,515
I even have evidence to prove it.

38
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,269
Nonsense.

39
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:13,313
You can look forward to it.

40
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,523
You'll end up with nothing.

41
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,028
You'll ruin me
and take Kangoh for yourself?

42
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,196
Whatever the case...

43
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,158
who says I can't?

44
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,369
You?

45
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,664
I can't have the same dream
as you, Baek Inha?

46
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:32,957
Of course not.

47
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:36,627
You're not Kang Joongmo's son.

48
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,339
You seem to have forgotten.

49
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,384
You may be his son, but you couldn't
have had this dream without me.

50
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,095
Do you really think so?

51
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,889
Don't worry.

52
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,100
I won't stop you from dreaming.

53
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,866
Hey, Inmate 255.

54
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:52,870
You have a visitor.

55
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,415
Come on out.

56
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,812
Hello?

57
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,194
Who are you?

58
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,820
Gijun.

59
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,367
Inha.

60
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,287
I'm sorry.

61
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,500
I want to go there myself
to see if you're okay,

62
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,543
but there are too many eyes watching.

63
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,046
No.

64
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,382
You don't need to put yourself in danger.

65
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,427
Gijun.

66
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,681
Can I continue to trust you?

67
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:38,434
I'm almost at the top.

68
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,104
I can't be held back now.

69
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,524
I promised you.

70
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,694
I'll take the fall for all of it.

71
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,741
But, Inha...

72
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,080
I'm a little scared.

73
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:08,047
It's only a matter of time
before I get a death sentence.

74
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,718
Now that it's come to this,

75
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,887
I'm kind of scared.

76
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,690
Great job.

77
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,796
The average internal rate
of return is 27.3%.

78
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,968
When it's all done, it'll be 33.3%.

79
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,720
27.3% and 33.3%.

80
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,015
Gold H Investment.

81
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:45,645
It's a paper company I founded
in Hong Kong and never used.

82
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:49,023
This corporation will protect you

83
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:52,193
from hostile parties trying to acquire
the company's shares.

84
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,195
What about the funds?

85
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:59,367
For funds, if you can release a portion
of the overseas funds for finance,

86
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,703
I'll start the process
of neutralizing the opposing forces.

87
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,793
He took the bait!
It's a hit!

88
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,544
He bit hard!

89
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,963
What? He did?

90
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,220
Things are going to work out
pretty easily.

91
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,306
Kang Seongju made the request first.
He wants to meet.

92
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,350
Old man.

93
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,686
You need to get ready.

94
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,146
Well...

95
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,941
I'll try my best. What else can I do?

96
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,609
Don't worry about it.

97
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,654
With the shares at Gold H,

98
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,074
they won't be able to look down on you.

99
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,500
A little bit more to the left.

100
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,462
Looking good. Let's move this way.

101
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,214
Do you have time to talk?

102
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,550
You don't think...

103
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,178
Inju's shares are yours, do you?

104
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,016
- What do you mean?
- The shares you have

105
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,812
must only be used for the Kang family.

106
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,067
Who are you to tell me what to do?

107
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,988
With Taeyang's shares
along with my family's shares,

108
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,201
I don't think you're in any position
to tell me what to do.

109
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:28,038
I wouldn't have come
if I were scared of that.

110
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,833
I'm just telling you not to get any ideas.

111
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,420
Give that power to Seongju.

112
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,799
Is Seongju feeling urgent?

113
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:41,969
Did he ask you to say this to me?

114
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,679
He didn't ask me to do anything.

115
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:46,849
Then do you have something else in mind?

116
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,809
- What?
- If that's not it...

117
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,479
don't get involved.

118
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,439
Don't step in and get hurt.

119
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,233
Are you worried about me right now?

120
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,320
I'm warning you.

121
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,656
Don't forget your duty
as the daughter-in-law

122
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,950
of the Kang family.

123
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:21,675
Seongju, you take responsibility
for Gold H and bring them to our side.

124
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,138
Yes, I requested a meeting.
They responded right away.

125
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,431
Things are looking good.

126
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,808
Don't let your guard down

127
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:32,144
and strengthen the relationship
with the shareholders on our side.

128
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,357
It's time for the opposing shareholders

129
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,943
to come to our side now.

130
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:43,030
Do you think
they'll come over that easily?

131
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:49,495
In the end,
they're just fish living in Kangoh's pond.

132
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:54,458
They'll pick their owners
depending on who fills their bellies more.

133
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,550
We have to move faster now.

134
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,135
Okay.

135
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:09,098
I'll secure the shares Gold H has
in a few days.

136
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,601
Also, Congressman Jo
is working hard in the pits,

137
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,605
so they'll have no choice but to join us.

138
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,566
We can no longer tolerate

139
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,819
the sight of predators targeting Kangoh
from all around

140
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,822
just because your father's down.

141
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,158
We have to make a choice.

142
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,002
This is really the last step, Mother.

143
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,922
I'll succeed Father well.

144
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,924
Don't worry.

145
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:14,079
It's called Gold H Investment,
and it's owned by Michael Chang.

146
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,418
Michael Chang? Where did he come from?

147
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:23,422
He got a taste for money by inflating
and selling mergers and acquisitions.

148
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,302
He'll be allured
by a sweeter deal from either side.

149
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:31,639
We'll postpone the decision
and carry it out.

150
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,936
It could threaten PY Holdings.

151
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,228
What do you want to do?

152
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,315
Will you stand by
and watch Kang Seongju make a move?

153
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,944
Keep in mind, Mr. Kang,

154
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,614
I can let go of your hand whenever I want.

155
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:54,495
Don't make me regret my choice anymore.

156
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:28,696
What is it?

157
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,366
What are you doing here?

158
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,535
Michael Chang.

159
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,870
He called us to one place.

160
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,839
I'm surprised you're here.

161
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:47,965
Why?

162
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,804
- I don't deserve to be Kangoh's owner?
- Kang Inha.

163
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,765
What if I was qualified
as much as you were?

164
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,225
Did you forget your waiver?

165
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,689
What's the big deal
about a piece of paper?

166
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,773
Hey!

167
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:10,988
Are you insane?

168
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,072
No.

169
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,533
I'm perfectly fine.

170
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,495
I'm confident I can fight you
and win right now.

171
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:47,399
Hello, I'm Han Taeoh.
The co-CEO of Gold H Investment.

172
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,653
- I heard you wanted to meet me.
- We're here to meet Michael Chang.

173
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,323
Let's not waste our time. Let's go.

174
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,992
Gold H Investment.

175
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,661
I'm in charge
of all its domestic business.

176
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,549
HAN TAEOH
Gold H Investment Co-CEO

177
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,807
What are you doing?

178
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,434
Why did you call us all here?

179
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,479
Either way, each side wants one thing.

180
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,855
I thought it'd be good

181
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,274
to get everyone together and talk.

182
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,611
We could save time and effort.

183
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,991
True, it's not like we're strangers here.

184
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:47,167
Do you have anything to say,
Mr. Kang Inha?

185
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,546
I don't know.

186
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,465
We know each other so well.

187
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,093
I'm not sure how much I should say.

188
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,846
That's what troubles me.

189
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:47,728
Is this the best you can do to stop me?

190
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,398
Are you ready?

191
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,694
Do you think I'll let you get
what you want?

192
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,863
Inha.

193
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,657
It's already going my way.

194
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,966
Things will be a mess.

195
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,259
Ever since I was young--

196
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,094
Come on, boss!

197
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,305
- You don't have that kind of aura!
- What?

198
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,765
You can see the dignity!

199
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,892
Boss! What was it, Michael?

200
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,352
The name doesn't suit you.

201
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:29,436
Hey!

202
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,772
That's how it was in school.

203
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,106
- Back in school...
- Cheers.

204
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,150
Have a drink!

205
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,110
Have a drink!

206
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,238
Weren't we like that in school?

207
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,657
- Yes, that's right.
- You don't know me?

208
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,033
Yes, that's right.

209
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,118
That's what it was like!

210
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,044
Why won't you ask?

211
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,131
Ask what?

212
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,759
How it went with Inha.

213
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,720
I don't want to know.

214
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:06,306
It's between you two.

215
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,189
What?

216
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,066
Just...

217
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,111
It feels like
the Na Hyewon I knew is back.

218
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,363
The one you knew?

219
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,533
The one's who's so busy
that she doesn't care about other people.

220
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:43,135
JISEON

221
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,222
Yes, Jiseon?

222
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,863
Why did you call me?

223
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,575
What do you think
when you see this?

224
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:13,040
- What do you...
- Whether it's people or paintings,

225
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:17,836
it's hard to figure them out
just by looking at their exterior.

226
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,882
Things can be overlooked and discarded
at one time,

227
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,676
only to be rediscovered later.

228
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,889
In other words,
it's about looking into the future.

229
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,309
How much power...

230
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,936
do you think I have?

231
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:41,568
I'll gift this painting to you.

232
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,411
Oh, right.

233
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:56,833
The hidden meaning behind the painting
is "cooperation."

234
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,544
Bye.

235
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,183
MOTHER

236
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,061
Yes, Mother.

237
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,522
Come to tonight's dinner.

238
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,690
Why so suddenly...

239
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:24,152
I just want the family to sit down
for a meal. Don't feel pressured.

240
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:26,405
Okay.

241
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,198
I'll see you later.

242
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,177
Cooperation.

243
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,433
Hey.

244
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:45,692
Let's not waste time. The person in need
should extend their hand first.

245
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:46,776
Sit down.

246
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:52,908
I didn't know it before,

247
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:56,661
but I can see why the chairman trusted you
so much, Mr. Han.

248
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,623
Thank you.

249
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:01,958
Shall we toast?

250
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,627
Shall we?

251
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,222
Watch me.

252
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,518
Watch how I steal your dream.

253
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:23,230
Excuse me.

254
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,273
What's wrong?

255
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:34,783
Don't worry about him.

256
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,607
Your stepfather killed your mother.

257
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:09,693
Is it true?

258
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:17,659
No!

259
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,703
Honey!

260
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,289
Please! Not Taeoh! Please! Honey!

261
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,748
Move!

262
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,833
Honey, no!

263
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,837
You and I are the same.

264
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,053
Once we go out into the world,

265
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,514
let's achieve all of our plans

266
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:43,018
and get revenge on those who ignored
and tormented us.

267
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,062
What a simple dream.

268
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,814
It's not my final dream.

269
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,234
I guess you could call it a giveaway
within that dream.

270
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:55,780
Yes.

271
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,449
Let's do it.

272
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:21,848
It's me, Commissioner.

273
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,363
Inmate 301.

274
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,615
Inmate 301!

275
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,866
Inmate 301!

276
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:48,583
Congrats, your temporary release
was permitted.

277
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,882
Here are your papers.

278
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,468
Here's some cash.

279
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:00,553
The most important thing.

280
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,515
Remember that we can find you
whenever we want.

281
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,350
Yes, sir.

282
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,019
I know you're a model prisoner.

283
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,187
But those are the rules.

284
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,690
Yes, sir.

285
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,449
Visit your parents' grave.

286
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,036
Yes, thank you.

287
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:48,977
CORRECTION FOR A BETTER TOMORROW
DETENTION CENTER

288
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,656
ONE UNREAD MESSAGE

289
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,173
Jisuk.

290
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,425
Jisuk.

291
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:50,955
Seongju.

292
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,500
It's time to show our hand.

293
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,669
Open a press conference tomorrow.

294
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:28,034
KANGOH GROUP'S EMERGENCY PRESS CONFERENCE

295
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:42,674
Jisuk.

296
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:46,845
Jisuk!

297
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,603
Don't come near me.

298
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:58,356
Jisuk...

299
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,401
you haven't changed one bit.

300
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,528
You're so smart too.

301
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,531
You tricked the entire world,

302
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,826
and you put your husband in jail.

303
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,329
If I could...

304
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:16,666
I'd tear you limb from limb.

305
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:24,757
So, come with me
while I'm still asking nicely. Okay?

306
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,177
No.

307
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,762
I told you.

308
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,891
If you come with me now, I'll forgive you.

309
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,228
Forgive me?

310
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,439
You'll forgive me?

311
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,858
You killed me!

312
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,695
Whenever you stomped on Taeoh and me...

313
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,239
- Damn it.
- ...you killed our souls!

314
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:49,699
You stomped on us.

315
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:51,701
And what?

316
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,453
Forgive?

317
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:55,622
You'll forgive me?

318
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,789
Then just die.

319
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,902
Unbelievable.

320
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,221
Mother.

321
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:57,225
Even if Father woke up, he'd want this.

322
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,189
Everything's ready.

323
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,151
Let's go, Mother.

324
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,317
What's the matter?

325
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,902
Are you Jang Geumseok?

326
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,405
You're under arrest
for disposal of a corpse,

327
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:54,198
offering bribes, and embezzlement.

328
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,285
You'll need to be investigated.
Come to the station.

329
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,287
What?

330
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,747
Are you Moon Jeonghu?

331
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,375
You're under arrest
for disposal of a corpse.

332
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,502
- Come with us.
- I'll come later voluntarily.

333
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,171
- I can't today.
- Just a moment.

334
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,589
Come on. Take her in.

335
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,050
- Why are you doing this?
- What are you saying?

336
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,012
Tell us the exact charges
before you take them!

337
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:17,972
Hey, take those cuffs off!

338
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:20,600
Anything you say can be used
against you in court.

339
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:22,101
You have the right to an attorney.

340
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,104
- Don't you know who I am?
- Move.

341
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:26,397
- Now, now.
- Mr. Moon!

342
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,192
- What's going on?
- Can cops do whatever they want?

343
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,276
Mother!

344
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,819
You have
the right to an attorney.

345
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,029
- Seongju!
- Can you do this?

346
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,572
- You have to go!
- Hey!

347
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,991
- I'll take care of this! Go!
- Move.

348
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,660
- Hurry up and go, Seongju!
- Hey! Mother!

349
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,828
Go!

350
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:41,913
Seriously?

351
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,499
Get in!

352
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,334
I'll arrest you

353
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,461
- for obstruction of justice!
- Mother!

354
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,430
KANGOH GROUP'S EMERGENCY PRESS CONFERENCE

355
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:11,317
What time is it right now?
What's going on?

356
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,654
- What?
- Who is it?

357
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:29,293
FUTURE STRATEGY OFFICE
DIVISION DIRECTOR KANG INHA

358
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,588
Kangoh Group family's staged hit-and-run,

359
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,674
and the foundation's slush fund.

360
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,386
Will this be okay?

361
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,180
Tip off the police. Right now.

362
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,058
Yes, sir.

363
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,984
People who trust
and worry about Kangoh Group,

364
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,904
the shareholders, and employees,

365
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,991
how are you?

366
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:06,038
Some of you may not have heard
the news yet,

367
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:11,335
but I'm sure the majority are aware
of Kangoh Group's current situation

368
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,046
from the earlier reports.

369
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,339
INTERROGATION ROOM

370
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:19,677
Chairman Kang Joongmo
is still unconscious.

371
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,220
He's receiving 24-hour care

372
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,764
by the best staff in Korea
at Kangoh Hospital.

373
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:28,060
However, with false news
surrounding Kangoh Group,

374
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,731
it's been causing anxiety and distress
among shareholders and employees.

375
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,524
It cannot be overlooked any longer.

376
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,193
As of today...

377
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,614
I declare a state of emergency
for Kangoh Group,

378
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:43,451
and I appoint myself as acting chairman
until normalization can be achieved.

379
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:47,747
I intend to overcome this crisis wisely
and move forward.

380
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,422
This little rat...

381
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,925
He's trying to crawl in?

382
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,261
Along with our 400,000 employees,

383
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,514
and a company
that can represent our nation,

384
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:08,309
please continue to trust and support us.

385
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:13,564
We will rise again
to repay our fellow citizens.

386
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,983
Thank you.

387
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,194
- I have a question!
- Over here!

388
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,154
- Over here!
- I have a question!

389
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,031
There will be no Q&A.

390
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:29,372
What?

391
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,875
Director Jang Geumseok was arrested?

392
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,470
Mr. Han.

393
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,348
Will you leave Kang Inha like this?

394
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:49,600
Of course not.

395
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:53,479
After Jang Geumseok's arrest,
Kang Seongju lost a lot of supporters.

396
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:57,358
All of them switched over
to Kang Inha and Park Sajin's side.

397
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,696
It's only a matter of time
before Kang Inha becomes the chairman.

398
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:23,676
Mr. Han! Where are you going?

399
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,058
You know, don't you?

400
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,185
You know I didn't kill your mother.

401
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,314
She's alive and well.

402
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,319
Go and tell her.

403
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,989
Tell her not to let her guard down
because I'm here.

404
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,867
I'll see her soon.

405
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:58,544
Please...

406
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:12,266
What happened to Mom?

407
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,768
Tell me what you know.

408
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,896
- Huiju, calm down first...
- I can't calm down right now!

409
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,648
I can't reach Seongju.

410
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:23,110
What gives you the right to hold
a press conference in this situation?

411
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:27,948
Huiju.

412
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,660
We're family, and I think of you
as my little sister.

413
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,162
Mother's in danger right now.

414
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,998
Don't listen to anyone else.

415
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,209
Just listen to me.

416
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:41,045
Then you'll be safe.

417
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,507
- What?
- It's almost over.

418
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,343
Join me and support me...

419
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:50,137
Are you trying to get me
to take your side right now?

420
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:54,642
If you were really family,
shouldn't Mom be your priority?

421
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,523
It's too late.

422
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,237
Kang Inha...

423
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,658
you're not the Inha I know.

424
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,955
You're crazy.

425
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,766
- The number you dialed--
- Damn it.

426
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:37,852
Is Chae Donguk picking up?

427
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:40,938
CENTER DIRECTOR CHAE DONGUK

428
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,022
CONGRESSMAN JO SUNDONG

429
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,776
CEO KANG SEONGJU

430
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,321
MANAGER YANG JIHOON

431
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,284
I don't know who it is,

432
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,786
but they were waiting
for the perfect timing to attack.

433
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,746
He's not of this world anymore,

434
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,833
and even if the statute of limitations
has ended,

435
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:04,253
disguising the murder
that Kang Inju committed as a hit-and-run

436
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,796
is a ticking time bomb.

437
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:08,507
Not to mention...

438
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,179
KANGOH GROUP KANG SEONGJU

439
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:20,644
I've become a complete loser
after trusting Kang Seongju!

440
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,647
Congressman,
it'll be safer to step back on this.

441
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,107
In your opinion,

442
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:29,528
which way do you think
Kangoh's succession will lean toward?

443
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:33,073
Don't you think it's leaning towards
the acting chairman, Kang Inha?

444
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,283
Kang Inha?

445
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:40,289
I've never met him before.

446
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:43,959
Congressman.

447
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,797
How about I help you get a leg up
with Kang Inha?

448
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:50,925
Chae Donguk...

449
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:54,887
Jo Sundong.

450
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,734
Hello.

451
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:18,827
You may leave.

452
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:35,135
Was it you?

453
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,930
Did you do this?

454
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:43,936
I'm sure you were flustered
with that sudden press conference.

455
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,063
I heard Mother was taken to the station.

456
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:49,275
I thought sending all of those reporters
home in that situation

457
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:51,193
would really put Kangoh in a crisis.

458
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,820
I made the decision on my own.

459
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,405
I'm sorry.

460
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,748
Are you mocking me?

461
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:07,084
Do you really expect me to believe you?

462
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,504
Who are you to make that decision?

463
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:14,717
Seongju.

464
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,678
In times like these, support me.

465
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,514
I heard the reporters at the station.

466
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,057
It's over for Mother.

467
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:25,102
That dishonor...

468
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,188
there's no guarantee it won't reach you.

469
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,275
Just give it up now, okay?

470
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:42,328
You're a cockroach
that sneaks in at the slightest opening.

471
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,122
How dare you say that to me?

472
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:47,958
Hey, Inha.

473
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,259
I never want to hear my family's name

474
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,762
out of your filthy mouth.

475
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,766
If you say one more word,
I don't know what I'll do to you.

476
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,019
Got it?

477
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,357
Get out.

478
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,420
Mom...

479
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,633
I refuse.

480
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,288
Mom...

481
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,899
Mr. Kang.

482
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,693
Thank you.

483
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,030
Now that I've gotten the chance
to meet you,

484
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:08,742
you're a very reasonable man.

485
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:09,827
You flatter me.

486
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,621
I'll do my best to normalize Kangoh Group

487
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,916
and be a reliable support
for your future endeavors.

488
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:18,210
Yes, so you shall.

489
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,795
Now that you've secured your spot,

490
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,756
the launch of PY Holdings
will gain momentum.

491
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:24,925
You can look forward to it.

492
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:28,762
As long as the board meeting goes well,
Kangoh's best item will go to you.

493
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:30,180
I can promise you that.

494
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:33,475
Tonight's for celebration.

495
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,769
What's with all the business talk?

496
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:39,773
Cheers to the founding warriors
of Kangoh Group,

497
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:43,277
and the collaboration of the Blue House.

498
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,361
Cheers!

499
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:46,029
Cheers!

500
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:55,539
Goodness.

501
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,416
Yes, go ahead.

502
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:56,892
I looked into it.

503
00:48:57,768 --> 00:49:00,604
He got a leave for two nights
and three days from prison.

504
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:03,357
He returned after a day.

505
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:06,568
Something's off.

506
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:30,777
We both...

507
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,780
lost our mothers.

508
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:39,536
I think it was by the same person.

509
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,124
I think we have something to talk about.

510
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,088
Send off your mother well.

511
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:52,632
Take care of the funeral.

512
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:54,968
I'll see you then.

513
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,066
Finally, it's tomorrow.

514
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:24,933
Hello.

515
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,060
Good morning.

516
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,901
- Hello.
- Hello.

517
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,072
Hello.

518
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,119
Hello.

519
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:55,672
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE
CHAIRMAN KANG INHA

520
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,966
2023 KANGOH CO., LTD.
SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING

521
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:29,748
ARREST WARRANT

522
00:53:29,831 --> 00:53:30,832
Mr. Kang Inha.

523
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:35,003
You are under arrest for the murder
of Kang Inju and Mo Gijun.

524
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:37,130
What are you saying?

525
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:39,132
Arrest him.

526
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:40,926
Wait a second!

527
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,220
- Get out, you two.
- Let go of me!

528
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,055
- Do you know who I am?
- Sir.

529
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,139
Get this off of me!
