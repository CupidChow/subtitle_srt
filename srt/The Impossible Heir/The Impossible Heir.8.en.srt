00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:29,487
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:30,989
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,093
This is it.

4
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:56,347
Your vulgar and dirty world.

5
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:43,603
Drink it.

6
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,456
Taeoh! You're such a romanticist!

7
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,875
You're such a man! I love it!

8
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,421
Bona, isn't he great?

9
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,687
Han Taeoh!

10
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,769
There's a villa employee
named Bae Yeongeun.

11
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,771
She died in a hit-and-run 22 years ago.

12
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:10,815
She was Mo Gijun's mother.

13
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,193
Was he living under my shadow?

14
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,362
- Mo Gijun?
- He went to school with Kang Inha.

15
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,949
As an adult, he joined
the company with Kang Inju's help

16
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,744
and become his attending secretary.
He got lucky.

17
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,705
I'm sure a hefty price followed that luck.

18
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:28,082
Like doing everything Inju asked.

19
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,500
Like Director Han...

20
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,837
I mean, Han Taeoh's assault?

21
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,590
What do you think?

22
00:03:35,673 --> 00:03:37,050
Excuse me?

23
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:41,095
Do you think a person can kill
to get revenge for being assaulted?

24
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:44,557
Tell me what you know.
What type of person is Taeoh?

25
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,646
If he chose revenge,

26
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,815
he would've made him a complete loser
instead of killing him,

27
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,859
so he could never rise again.

28
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,156
Something doesn't feel right.

29
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,075
There's something there.

30
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:07,956
Find out what the hidden truth is.
Do it as quickly as possible.

31
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,624
Yes, sir.

32
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:18,049
Do I go or not?

33
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,305
I'm not into that.

34
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,900
BELIEVE APARTMENTS

35
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:04,364
Look at this.

36
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,786
Mo Gijun's mom
was an employee of the villa.

37
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,580
His mom died in an accident.

38
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,750
- She died?
- It was a hit-and-run.

39
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,504
It happened
when Mo Gijun was 10 years old.

40
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,297
If he was 10...

41
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,176
It's when he moved into Kang Inha's villa.

42
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,764
After he graduated middle school
and before he came to Seoul,

43
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:34,268
he and Kang Inha spent seven years
living in that place.

44
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,483
HIT-AND-RUN INVESTIGATION
CONCLUDED SUSPICIOUSLY

45
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,488
So what's your point?

46
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,907
I had my doubts,

47
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,368
but I was right.

48
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,538
This means he used another burner phone...

49
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,874
Shall I try to track it?

50
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,254
Let's see.

51
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,548
Okay.

52
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,971
Mo Gijun, you bastard.

53
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,559
Bingo!

54
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,643
RECENTS

55
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,937
CALLING

56
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:25,153
Yes. Hey, Gijun.

57
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,255
Hello?

58
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,340
Why did you hang up?

59
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,426
I didn't call you.

60
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,887
Maybe I butt-dialed you?

61
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,263
What the hell?

62
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,809
Anyway, don't think about anything.
Rest this weekend.

63
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,312
You did a great job testifying in court.

64
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:01,814
It's my reward to you.

65
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:09,697
How much do you
actually trust Kang Inha?

66
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:14,160
If you have even the slightest bit
of trust left in him,

67
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,245
I'd get rid of it.

68
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:19,081
Erase it completely.

69
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,420
From what I see,
I don't think Kang Inha's your friend.

70
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:41,312
Kang Inha, was your final goal...

71
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,898
me and not Kang Inju?

72
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,433
We have reached a verdict.

73
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:27,358
In case number 2023-1013,
the court finds the defendant, Han Taeoh,

74
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,444
guilty and sentences him
to capital punishment.

75
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,828
I didn't do it.

76
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,707
It wasn't me!

77
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,709
Let go of me!

78
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,587
I didn't do it! It wasn't me!

79
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,017
He received...

80
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,230
the death sentence.

81
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,166
Change it to standard form
and find the vertex.

82
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,172
I found you.

83
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,671
CORRECTION FOR A BETTER TOMORROW
DETENTION CENTER

84
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,221
We got a newcomer.

85
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,976
He'll be joining you today.

86
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,145
Don't cause trouble, and be good.

87
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,271
Got it?

88
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,564
- Yes, sir.
- Sure.

89
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,281
Damn it.

90
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,991
His tag's red.

91
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:28,080
DO NOT THROW FOOD
DOWN THE DRAIN

92
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:30,958
Damn.

93
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:32,501
I must've eaten too much.

94
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,086
It's clogged. Unclog it later.

95
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,714
A newbie?

96
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,134
Boss, he's a red tag.

97
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,139
Since when did a red tag denote rank?

98
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:46,974
I'm sorry, boss.

99
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:50,978
Hey!

100
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,231
We're still a family here.

101
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,818
Show your face, will you?

102
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,576
You look so familiar.

103
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,540
How dare you look me up
and down like that!

104
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,709
You crazy wench!

105
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,256
Oh!

106
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,301
Hanguk University! Right?

107
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,553
Let me see!

108
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,764
I'm right! He's from Hanguk University!

109
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,349
Wow!

110
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:35,022
So the hero of justice
is today's killer now?

111
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,357
Life's full of surprises.

112
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,317
Do you know him, boss?

113
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,819
Do you remember Hyangmi?

114
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,071
We went to that university
to get her daughter.

115
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,491
That's where we met, right?

116
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,994
You've got a great memory. I can't
even remember what happened yesterday.

117
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,081
How can I forget someone
who messed with me?

118
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,711
Hey, college boy. Am I right or wrong?

119
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,175
I see you're still cheeky.

120
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,929
True. People shouldn't change.

121
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,514
You'll die if you change.

122
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,936
Things are going to be fun around here,
aren't they?

123
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,563
I can't wait.

124
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,695
What?

125
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,119
Goodness.

126
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,376
Inmate 3866.

127
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,385
They'll try to use alcohol and drugs
as variables.

128
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,470
With premeditated or intentional murder,

129
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,391
there is no better excuse
than alcohol and drugs.

130
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:56,896
In the second trial,
Han Taeoh might not get the death sentence

131
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,106
because he was mentally unstable?

132
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,357
Yes.

133
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,651
The chances of that are more than 80%.

134
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:06,447
Really?

135
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,325
I wish he gets the death sentence.

136
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,287
With your abilities and connections
as Kangoh's attorney,

137
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,705
wouldn't that be possible?

138
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,381
I want 100% certainty
than he'll get the death sentence.

139
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,168
Good night.

140
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,546
I'm sure you're tired.

141
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,848
Why are you doing this?

142
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:56,974
Stop it!

143
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,434
Don't!

144
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,768
I said no!

145
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:04,982
No?

146
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,280
How dare you say no?

147
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,173
Do you know why I chose you?

148
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,260
Because Taeoh wanted you.

149
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,682
When a dog starts to desire something,
they want to become human.

150
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,061
A dog should eat what it's given
and bark when told to.

151
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,521
They can't desire to become human.

152
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,232
That's why I chose you.

153
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:52,112
I want him to know that he can desire
all he wants, but he'll never have it.

154
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:56,950
I'm going to leash Han Taeoh where he is
to teach him not to covet...

155
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,621
his owner's seat.

156
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,958
Do you get it now?
Do you know your purpose?

157
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,336
So wake up.

158
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,548
You'll die if you don't.

159
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,563
Are you scared?

160
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,607
Don't be scared.

161
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:33,403
There won't be any problems
as long as you don't forget who you are.

162
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,607
SEONNYEOTANG

163
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,400
Inmate 3866!

164
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,569
You have a visitor.

165
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,396
How are you?

166
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:39,905
What a stupid question.
I already know how you're doing.

167
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,368
It's not as bad as you think.

168
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,287
How are you?

169
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,874
I'm enjoying the unemployed life
I never planned for.

170
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,171
Sometimes I think I should've accepted
the offer to go to work for fun.

171
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,466
I regret it without regretting it.

172
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,095
I'm sure it wasn't easy to get here.

173
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:09,518
I'm sorry.
You're going through this because of me...

174
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,478
Are you worried about me right now?

175
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:13,981
You're in no position
to worry about others.

176
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,858
You're right.

177
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,279
I should worry about myself.

178
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:24,491
I'll take care of myself.

179
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,785
I know.

180
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,707
I know who Na Hyewon is
and what she's capable of.

181
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,045
How's Inha?

182
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:38,922
How is he?

183
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:43,719
He's probably carrying out your plans
as well as he can.

184
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,972
Kang Inha, the owner of Kangoh...

185
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,268
He's running towards that goal.

186
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,855
- Why do you sound so distant?
- Do I?

187
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,984
Inha's fine.

188
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,528
He's doing your part too.

189
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,490
Good.

190
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:07,534
You should start...

191
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,872
working on what you really wanted.

192
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,291
What I really wanted?

193
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:15,876
Go to Chairman Kang.

194
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,838
Be confident, and tell him
that you want to work at the foundation.

195
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:24,593
If the center is Kangoh's future,
the slush fund factory art foundation

196
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,595
is Kangoh's present.

197
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:31,558
- There's no future without a present.
- If I get the present, what about you?

198
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:33,810
What do you get?

199
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,482
What I want right now...

200
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:43,862
isn't Kangoh.

201
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:49,701
I knew it. Laundry should be done
in a washing machine.

202
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,913
I'm trying to get something.

203
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:56,917
Who do I ask?

204
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,752
I don't really know.

205
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,087
Find out.

206
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,880
I'll pay you well.

207
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,239
Jang Geumseok is absent.
You won't get another chance.

208
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,534
Make this your opportunity.

209
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,412
The art foundation up until now

210
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,873
was a place for Director Jang
to make and handle her slush funds.

211
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,750
Starting now, the art foundation

212
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:43,880
will be Chairman Kang Joongmo's place
to make and handle slush funds.

213
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,383
- If this offends you--
- You remind me of him.

214
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,802
This is what I felt when I first met him.

215
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,889
It felt like he was trying to aggravate me
on purpose.

216
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:57,185
How dare you try to test me?

217
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,690
I can kick you out of my house right now.

218
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,233
Is that a warning?

219
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:04,401
What if it is?

220
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,863
It sounds to me that you think I'm useful.

221
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,824
- What?
- Instead of kicking me out,

222
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,826
you chose to warn me first.

223
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,417
Tell me what you want.

224
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,260
Goodness.

225
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:35,599
Ah. Don't think.

226
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,809
You'll get hurt
if you think too much here.

227
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:41,563
- It's none of your business.
- Stop acting all tough.

228
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:45,025
You'll find out sooner or later
it's better not to think too much.

229
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:49,279
- You're looking for the prison leader?
- I don't need the leader.

230
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,740
I'm just looking to get something.

231
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:54,075
Only the prison leader can do that here.

232
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,161
Then tell me who it is, and get lost.

233
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,662
You little...

234
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,664
You rude punk...

235
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,503
Boy, stop messing around.
Just tell me what you need.

236
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,594
It's me! Get it?

237
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,137
It's not you.

238
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,556
Forget it.

239
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,728
I need a phone. As quickly as possible.

240
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:29,819
I'm going to rip his tongue
out of his cheeky mouth...

241
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,697
Okay, we're going!

242
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:31,548
Here.

243
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,979
It'll be three big ones.

244
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,858
It's done on the outside,
so it's expensive.

245
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:52,152
But they get the job done.

246
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,243
You can deposit the money here.

247
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,912
Until then, they're not yours.

248
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,751
I'll give you four.

249
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:13,089
But only after I check
and make sure they can make calls.

250
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,720
One more thing.

251
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,890
Charger included.

252
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:31,858
That smart little bastard.

253
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:35,028
Besides the fact that he's a murderer,
he's useful in every way.

254
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,156
Close it.

255
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,161
PARK SAJIN

256
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:46,331
There haven't been any issues with this?

257
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,626
- As of now.
- How's Park Sajin's daughter doing lately?

258
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,796
Has the drug problem persisted
since she left Kangoh Hospital?

259
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:55,006
It seems like she's trying to recover.

260
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,217
She's currently working
at Seongdong Penitentiary.

261
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,301
Seongdong Penitentiary?

262
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,636
Yes, sir.

263
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,721
PARK JINGYEONG

264
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,891
PARK JINGYEONG

265
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,017
That's interesting.

266
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,562
CHAIRMAN KANG

267
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,693
That's all for today.

268
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,027
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

269
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:30,875
Yes, sir.

270
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,670
Come to dinner this week,
and bring your wife.

271
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,255
With Hyewon?

272
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,756
Why? Is there a problem?

273
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,508
Don't be late.

274
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,808
Inmate 3866.

275
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,269
Follow me.

276
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,439
You have a visitor.

277
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,405
I refuse.

278
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,407
Hey!

279
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,746
Hey! Inmate 3866!

280
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,423
I don't know what it is,

281
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,260
but the monk has come a long way
to see you...

282
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,643
Inmate 3866, move.

283
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,105
Inmate 3866, move!

284
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,472
Inmate 3866, stop right there!

285
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,683
Hey! Inmate 3866!

286
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:35,810
Stop right there!

287
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:47,906
Don't move!

288
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,701
Don't move!

289
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,753
Mom...

290
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,144
His eyes...

291
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,521
are different.

292
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,107
The person driving that night

293
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,985
wasn't Mo Gijun.

294
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:18,306
Help me.

295
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,657
I thought you forgot
about running away.

296
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,743
Shut up and just go.

297
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:45,374
It's best to have fun with girls
when you have idle thoughts.

298
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,212
Come to the club later.

299
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,492
Hello?

300
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,743
That night...

301
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,996
Mo Gijun wasn't the one
who drove us to the hotel.

302
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,790
Mr. Han?

303
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,459
Find out who drove us to the hotel.

304
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,670
What's this? Did you remember?

305
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,214
Mo Gijun didn't drive that night.
I'm sure of it.

306
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,717
If your memory is right...

307
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,970
Mo Gijun killed Kang Inju and Shin Bona.

308
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:41,097
The evidence
is the driver from that night.

309
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,599
So do whatever you can to find him.

310
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,930
We have to go to dinner. Father's orders.

311
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,059
You have to be ordered...

312
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,688
to have dinner with your family?

313
00:36:30,771 --> 00:36:31,814
Don't mock me.

314
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,902
- It's always been like this.
- I'm not mocking you.

315
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,531
It's just sad for some reason.

316
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,413
Let's talk.

317
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,420
I have nothing to say.

318
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,594
Divorce isn't an option.

319
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:02,720
Divorce?

320
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:05,097
I'm not doing that.

321
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,840
That's just my luck. Is that bird crap?

322
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:57,900
Hi, Honggyu.

323
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,235
Who are you?

324
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:03,239
How would I know who's close with Mr. Mo?

325
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:06,492
I heard you were the captain of MDs.

326
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,037
Captain? Come on.

327
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,539
I was just a little popular.

328
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,876
That got screwed up when Chrom went down.

329
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:19,839
Anyway, what's up?

330
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,007
Are you a cop?

331
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,302
- Why would a cop want to see me?
- I'm not a cop.

332
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:27,263
Okay!

333
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,684
Anyway, I don't know anything.

334
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,478
I don't know. Even if I did, I don't know.

335
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,025
I don't want to get involved.

336
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,777
What can I tell you?
You're already involved.

337
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,457
Honggyu.

338
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:57,585
Is your brain working now?

339
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,212
Who was helping Mo Gijun at the club?

340
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,801
24 HOUR SEVEN AROMA

341
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:08,137
Have you heard of Roy?

342
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:10,181
Anyway,

343
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:15,061
he's a kid that got caught
selling fake meth, and Mr. Mo saved him.

344
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:20,316
I think Mr. Mo paid them off
because he didn't want to ruin the club.

345
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:24,487
But Roy's been completely loyal
ever since.

346
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,038
All right,
let's catch this shithead!

347
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,294
Welcome.

348
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,962
Hey! Who are you?

349
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,422
- Hey!
- Who the hell are you?

350
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,257
Piss off!

351
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,223
- What's this?
- Who are you?

352
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,893
Hey, who are you? Hey!

353
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:56,977
What's going on? No!

354
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,062
What's going on?

355
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,565
What is this?

356
00:40:04,443 --> 00:40:06,195
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey!

357
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,155
Who the hell are you?

358
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:11,242
What the hell?

359
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:13,035
Damn it!

360
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,204
Go, go, go!

361
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,725
Go around.

362
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,811
Stop, you bastard!

363
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,669
Where is he? Where?

364
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,337
- Let's go there.
- Find him!

365
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,094
MO GIJUN

366
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,653
FUTURE STRATEGY OFFICE
DIVISION DIRECTOR KANG INHA

367
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,990
Hey, Gijun.

368
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,201
Release everyone.

369
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,955
If you can't catch him today,
you won't be able to find him.

370
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,261
Mr. Mo?

371
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,100
Mr. Mo?

372
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,440
MO GIJUN

373
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,533
Mr. Mo?

374
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,336
Hey.

375
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,383
It smells. I told you not to come.

376
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,469
You hate the smell of blood.

377
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,680
POWER OFF

378
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:02,848
Gijun.

379
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,729
Let's kill Han Taeoh.

380
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,365
CORRECTION FOR A BETTER TOMORROW
DETENTION CENTER

381
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,408
Inha and I have to attend...

382
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,244
tonight's dinner under
the Chairman's orders.

383
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,082
Before I go,

384
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,542
I need to check something.

385
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,254
- Say it.
- I want

386
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,007
Kangoh's future as well as the present.

387
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:40,678
The owner of floor 151.

388
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,930
You want to own Kangoh?

389
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,436
Then don't hide...

390
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,648
anything.

391
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:10,958
Inha did it.

392
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,293
One more thing,

393
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,629
Inha knows everything

394
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,465
that happened between us.

395
00:45:19,842 --> 00:45:22,010
You, me, and Inha.

396
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,596
We can never go back
to the way things were.

397
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,724
There was never a "we" to begin with.

398
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,184
There were three people
pretending to be "we."

399
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,228
There is no more pretending.

400
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,814
It's only us two now.

401
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,900
I still believe in your abilities.

402
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:41,155
Can you use your skills for me now?

403
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,949
If you're okay with me like this,

404
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:46,452
you'll become the next owner
of Kangoh, Hyewon.

405
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,289
I'll make sure that happens.

406
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,769
BISUNJAE

407
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,692
You can start work on Monday.

408
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,613
Hyewon will be the planning director
at the foundation.

409
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:24,656
Father.

410
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,033
Congratulations.

411
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,117
This isn't right.

412
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:30,913
Mother is absent. How can you allow her
to take over that position?

413
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,498
She'll be the acting director.

414
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:35,834
This is ridiculous.

415
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:40,088
What authority do you have
to say this is ridiculous or not?

416
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,466
My father

417
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:46,553
is still the current minister,
and he's in good health.

418
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:50,307
He's also a man with clear distinctions
between work and personal matters.

419
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,559
I think very highly of him on that.

420
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,686
No, you're wrong.

421
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,649
If my father was clear on that,

422
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,570
you couldn't dream of having
your Royal Road.

423
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:09,076
The minister
taught you well on many matters,

424
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,080
- except on how to keep your mouth shut.
- Father!

425
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,749
Your sadness is an indulgence.

426
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,169
It ends today.

427
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,298
Who made your father
the Minister of Justice?

428
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,592
Don't forget that.

429
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,514
Hyewon, remember the duties
of your position

430
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:33,308
come before the rights given by it.

431
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,977
Don't forget that.

432
00:47:35,727 --> 00:47:36,854
I'll remember, Father.

433
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,065
I trust you.

434
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,007
You.

435
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,885
I'll make you regret this.

436
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,688
Judging by the atmosphere,
I guess you didn't know either.

437
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,232
True.

438
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,194
As a result, it's not a bad thing for you.

439
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,698
Your wife on the back of Kang Joongmo.

440
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,791
You said you didn't want it.

441
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:44,546
Being offered a seat at work
and having full power of the foundation.

442
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,261
- They're completely different.
- Was that Father's idea too?

443
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,346
No way.

444
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,433
I told Father
I'd work at the foundation first.

445
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:58,477
So to give me full power...

446
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:03,190
I need a reason
to stay in the Kang family too.

447
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,276
Something to convince myself.

448
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:10,447
Is that all?

449
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:12,866
Should there be more?

450
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,204
That's right. What more could there be?

451
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,831
Enjoy it while you can.

452
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,001
As much as you want.

453
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,420
Ah.

454
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:10,340
Yes.

455
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,176
Yes, I understand.

456
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,848
WESTERN DETENTION CENTER'S CUCKOO

457
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,456
Inmate 3866.

458
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:28,543
Inmate 3866!

459
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,299
You have a visitor.

460
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,250
Who...

461
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:02,596
It was you.

462
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:04,639
The rat.
