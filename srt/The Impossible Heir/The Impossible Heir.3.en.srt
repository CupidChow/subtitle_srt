THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

[microphone howling]

6
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:53,356
[Inha] All the things only I couldn't
enjoy as a part of the Kang family...

7
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:59,911
Is it finally time
to take back everything?

8
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:04,755
[chuckling]

9
00:01:04,838 --> 00:01:07,969
Goodness. Thank you again
for attending, sir.

10
00:01:08,637 --> 00:01:11,142
The center has achieved
so much over the last five years.

11
00:01:11,602 --> 00:01:13,731
I had to come in person to compliment you.

12
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,235
Mr. Chae.

13
00:01:16,779 --> 00:01:18,574
Do you like the chairman that much?

14
00:01:19,158 --> 00:01:20,703
Normally, this punk...

15
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:23,083
I mean...
Weren't you Kang Seongju's person?

16
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:26,965
No, I'm always the chairman's person.

17
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:28,886
Oh.

18
00:01:29,638 --> 00:01:30,640
[knock on door]

19
00:01:38,864 --> 00:01:42,162
[Donguk] This is the employee who
wrote the speech you'll be giving today.

20
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:46,087
Hello.

21
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:48,299
I work on the global leader training team.

22
00:01:49,218 --> 00:01:50,429
My name is Han Taeoh.

23
00:01:51,472 --> 00:01:54,980
It's so nice to see
a young man with a spirited writing style.

24
00:01:56,065 --> 00:01:58,027
He placed at the top of his class.

25
00:01:58,111 --> 00:01:59,865
What are you doing? Thank him.

26
00:02:00,825 --> 00:02:01,827
Thank you.

27
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:04,958
[knock on door]

28
00:02:07,714 --> 00:02:09,091
Everything's ready, sir.

29
00:02:10,427 --> 00:02:12,055
-Shall we go?
-Go ahead.

30
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:14,603
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

31
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:16,063
You too.

32
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:19,111
You stay, young man.

33
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:22,827
I'll see you at the ceremony.

34
00:02:23,996 --> 00:02:25,750
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

35
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:44,829
Tell me.

36
00:02:45,205 --> 00:02:48,002
From what you see and feel,
what type of owner am I?

37
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:52,887
I'm asking because the contents
of your speech have nothing to do with me.

38
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:57,229
By any chance, did you create an image
of what you hoped for in an owner?

39
00:02:59,316 --> 00:03:01,153
-That's right.
-[Joongmo] In other words,

40
00:03:01,237 --> 00:03:03,659
you don't think I'm the ideal owner.

41
00:03:05,036 --> 00:03:07,542
Answer me. What type of owner am I?

42
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:11,090
If you don't like my answer...

43
00:03:13,804 --> 00:03:14,889
will I be fired?

44
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:18,522
[chuckles softly]
If I fired you for being cheeky,

45
00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:21,653
wouldn't I be taking a step back
from being an ideal owner?

46
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:26,788
You...

47
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:30,921
are fired.

48
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,186
You're going to need me in the future.

49
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:40,858
Because you first thought of this center?

50
00:03:41,652 --> 00:03:45,618
That's why you confidently
asked Mr. Chae to set up this meeting.

51
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:49,709
The price for my report.

52
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:51,880
I'm here to collect.

53
00:03:52,715 --> 00:03:55,178
[Joongmo] Every small or big thing
that happens in Kangoh

54
00:03:55,596 --> 00:03:56,765
is reported to me.

55
00:03:57,892 --> 00:03:59,103
For the past five years,

56
00:03:59,186 --> 00:04:02,234
you didn't raise this center
to its worth of 30 trillion won.

57
00:04:02,317 --> 00:04:03,529
It was my people.

58
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:07,119
Only...

59
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,001
Only 30 trillion won.

60
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:12,880
-What?
-[Taeoh] To be honest,

61
00:04:12,964 --> 00:04:15,051
it doesn't matter if you need me or not.

62
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:17,013
As for me...

63
00:04:17,097 --> 00:04:20,646
I can go somewhere else that needs me
and just create another Kangoh.

64
00:04:21,815 --> 00:04:22,817
I know.

65
00:04:24,236 --> 00:04:25,363
I know you're qualified.

66
00:04:28,494 --> 00:04:29,496
Han Gilsu.

67
00:04:30,624 --> 00:04:31,710
[Jisuk] Don't come near!

68
00:04:31,793 --> 00:04:34,298
Don't come near me!
Let go!

69
00:04:34,381 --> 00:04:36,720
Turning your innocent father
into a murderer.

70
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:38,181
Was that you?

71
00:04:40,603 --> 00:04:42,189
The more a pebble stands out,

72
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:45,361
it's only natural to wonder
where they're from

73
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:47,157
or how they grew up.

74
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:54,506
Innocent person...

75
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,845
So...

76
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,354
So the devil has no sins?

77
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:15,421
It seems my efforts were futile.

78
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:18,637
I'll turn in
my letter of resignation today.

79
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,933
It was a short time, but--

80
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:23,564
[Joongmo] Nothing you can't do.
Nothing you won't do.

81
00:05:24,816 --> 00:05:27,697
Don't feel at ease because you lost
your composure only briefly.

82
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,538
Because in that brief moment,
you showed me everything.

83
00:05:31,621 --> 00:05:33,207
It's an inexcusable defeat.

84
00:05:34,711 --> 00:05:37,173
Never let your inner thoughts show
from now on.

85
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:39,804
Even if you're up against me. Never.

86
00:05:40,848 --> 00:05:42,100
If you want to work for me,

87
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:44,981
you need to learn to hide your real self.

88
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,747
I'll bear that in mind, Chairman.

89
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,045
Nothing you can't do.
Nothing you won't do.

90
00:05:56,128 --> 00:05:58,717
That's the kind of person
I need most right now. Besides...

91
00:05:59,677 --> 00:06:01,138
I have your weakness now.

92
00:06:02,474 --> 00:06:03,810
It's the icing on the cake.

93
00:06:04,687 --> 00:06:06,983
[people applauding]

94
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:10,156
CO-PROSPERITY COOPERATION CENTER
5TH ANNIVERSARY

95
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,787
In many situations in South Korea,

96
00:06:13,454 --> 00:06:16,628
the weak have been forced to make
sacrifices without prior agreement,

97
00:06:16,711 --> 00:06:18,840
under the pretext
of happiness for the majority.

98
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:27,315
[people murmuring indistinctly]

99
00:06:31,073 --> 00:06:32,242
[microphone turns off]

100
00:06:41,093 --> 00:06:42,680
[Joongmo] Someone told me

101
00:06:42,763 --> 00:06:45,435
about the infinite possibilities
of this center.

102
00:06:46,312 --> 00:06:47,606
Some people may say

103
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:51,906
that the center is a monster that deceives
and preys on the weak and poor.

104
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,119
Who cares if it's a monster?

105
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:57,543
Countless of startups emerge
and disappear every day.

106
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,549
We're giving them an opportunity.

107
00:07:01,175 --> 00:07:03,680
Being a part of the center?
Take pride in it.

108
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:05,559
Monster?

109
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:08,523
Become a more brutal and thorough monster!

110
00:07:09,316 --> 00:07:11,361
As long as you're a person of Kangoh...

111
00:07:11,445 --> 00:07:13,575
As long as you're one of my people,

112
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:17,415
prove to everyone that it will soon
become a brand.

113
00:07:18,209 --> 00:07:21,716
Only those who can prove it
can survive in Kangoh.

114
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,098
Instead of offering comfort
with "prosperity" and "cooperation,"

115
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:27,268
become a monster

116
00:07:27,686 --> 00:07:30,066
and become passionate
about saving something!

117
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:31,653
That is the purpose

118
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:34,366
of establishing
the Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center.

119
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:37,957
It's the goal and the reason
to move forward!

120
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:43,008
He's forcing loyalty and sacrifice.

121
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:44,679
Kangoh.

122
00:07:46,014 --> 00:07:47,726
It's a place that's worth it.

123
00:07:48,645 --> 00:07:49,856
To those who survived...

124
00:07:50,732 --> 00:07:51,818
I make a promise.

125
00:07:52,235 --> 00:07:53,404
Privileges of Kangoh!

126
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:55,366
-The pride...
-The pride...

127
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:57,705
-of being the best.
-[Joongmo] ...of being the best.

128
00:08:06,764 --> 00:08:10,438
Center Director Chae Donguk
will be relieved of his position.

129
00:08:10,522 --> 00:08:12,526
He's useless now, so he'll be discarded.

130
00:08:13,862 --> 00:08:15,198
If he's lucky...

131
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:17,620
he could be recycled.

132
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:25,510
Will Kang Seongju
naturally succeed the position?

133
00:08:25,594 --> 00:08:27,556
Kang Seongju wants Kangoh's control tower.

134
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:30,687
To Kang Seongju...

135
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:34,361
the center is just a shortcut there.

136
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:38,369
Where all of Kangoh's capital and power
are located.

137
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:42,043
Where the subsidiaries
and affiliates are managed.

138
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:43,295
KANGOH
VP KANG SEONGJU

139
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:45,676
[Taeoh] Where he can
control Kangoh completely.

140
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:48,389
Kangoh Corporation.

141
00:08:49,474 --> 00:08:50,476
That's where...

142
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:53,232
Kang Seongju wants to be.

143
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:24,294
As of today, I'll be working beside you.

144
00:09:25,714 --> 00:09:26,758
My name is Han Taeoh.

145
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:32,811
The real game...

146
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,982
begins now.

147
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:48,342
FIVE YEARS LATER

148
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,084
Father!

149
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,354
-I thought you collapsed.
-Are you disappointed I'm fine?

150
00:10:37,608 --> 00:10:39,068
What happened?

151
00:10:39,152 --> 00:10:41,406
As you can see, I'm eating.
Is there a problem?

152
00:10:53,973 --> 00:10:56,186
But it's strange,

153
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:58,858
I get this pain in my neck
whenever I see Han Taeoh.

154
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:02,073
Rumors say that he could be
the youngest chief secretary soon.

155
00:11:02,156 --> 00:11:03,701
So he'll become even cockier?

156
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:06,456
He's never caused problems
in the last five years.

157
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,628
Father seems satisfied with him.

158
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,214
That's the problem.

159
00:11:10,297 --> 00:11:12,051
Father's too dependent on him.

160
00:11:12,134 --> 00:11:13,136
They're too close.

161
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:16,268
What if he does something moronic?
It'll ruin us.

162
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:18,565
President Kang,
you should watch your mouth.

163
00:11:19,065 --> 00:11:22,865
Someone might think you're hoping
for things to go wrong.

164
00:11:24,033 --> 00:11:27,248
When assisting your husband,
don't just focus on the big picture.

165
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:29,878
Taking care of the small things
applies too.

166
00:11:30,755 --> 00:11:32,466
He's the eldest son of Kangoh.

167
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:36,182
Make sure he acts like it.
He should watch his mouth and behavior.

168
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:38,145
Yes, Mother.

169
00:11:38,228 --> 00:11:40,817
[laughing]

170
00:11:42,988 --> 00:11:44,867
Excuse me, Mother?

171
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:51,421
Speak for yourself.

172
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:54,177
Before telling my wife
how to assist her husband,

173
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,557
examine how you assist yours.

174
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:58,477
What are you doing?

175
00:11:59,437 --> 00:12:02,401
Learn some respect
before complaining about your treatment.

176
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:05,199
Do you think we're the same
just because I talk to you?

177
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:07,078
-Stay out of it, punk.
-[elevator dings]

[knock on door]

181
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:35,009
You're ready to be discharged, sir.

182
00:12:35,092 --> 00:12:38,056
Did you tell Director In what I told you?

183
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:39,977
Don't worry.

184
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:44,485
What did Kim Sangsu say?

185
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,030
Congressman Kim Sangsu says

186
00:12:46,741 --> 00:12:49,454
there won't be any issues
getting the results you want.

187
00:12:49,538 --> 00:12:52,042
After Kim Sangsu becomes the party leader,

188
00:12:52,126 --> 00:12:53,588
we'll work on his presidency.

189
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:57,470
After that...
the Royal Road Project finally begins.

190
00:13:00,476 --> 00:13:03,231
On the west coast,
I'm thinking of building a large city.

191
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,317
ONE YEAR AGO

192
00:13:04,568 --> 00:13:07,616
A mega project which is
a hundred times bigger than Kangoh City.

193
00:13:09,035 --> 00:13:12,626
I'm going to build a country
inside the country of Korea.

194
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:15,882
Do you think my dream...

195
00:13:17,176 --> 00:13:18,513
is absurd as well?

196
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,432
At Kangoh,

197
00:13:20,975 --> 00:13:24,106
we have the greatest resource,
the Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center.

198
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:28,365
The center will make your dream come true.

199
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,041
[Joongmo] Kangoh will become a country.

200
00:13:34,293 --> 00:13:37,801
The west coast site that'll make
my dream come true has been purchased.

201
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:40,389
We just have to break ground.

202
00:13:51,537 --> 00:13:52,831
A paraplegic patient...

203
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,547
uses the HMD, a head mounted display,

204
00:13:57,381 --> 00:13:59,678
on their head like this.

205
00:14:00,722 --> 00:14:04,270
Through it, this paralyzed dad can go
to the playground with his kids.

206
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,153
A paralyzed high school student
can play basketball with friends,

207
00:14:08,236 --> 00:14:09,322
play games,

208
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:14,248
and all of those things
can even feel real.

209
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:17,881
Also... What's more...

210
00:14:19,175 --> 00:14:20,177
Did you steal it?

211
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:23,643
-Excuse me?
-How can someone forget the contents

212
00:14:23,726 --> 00:14:24,853
of their development?

213
00:14:24,937 --> 00:14:27,399
-Well, the thing is...
-[Inha slams table]

214
00:14:30,698 --> 00:14:31,700
Doctor,

215
00:14:32,368 --> 00:14:35,457
we're not helping you practice
your presentation because we're bored.

216
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,336
-Yes, but...
-You said that next year

217
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:40,092
Kangoh Electronics DMC will be merged
with the software center.

218
00:14:41,302 --> 00:14:44,810
We're not just helping because
our team is pro-DMC.

219
00:14:45,477 --> 00:14:48,358
We put our team's life and soul
into this project.

220
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:49,443
[bangs]

221
00:14:49,528 --> 00:14:50,863
That's what I'm trying to say.

222
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:54,495
You worked so hard on your research.

223
00:14:55,288 --> 00:14:56,667
Shouldn't it come to light?

224
00:14:57,334 --> 00:14:59,756
Unless you want to kill
your precious baby,

225
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,384
you should try to keep it alive!

226
00:15:05,017 --> 00:15:06,520
-I apologize.
-Again with that!

227
00:15:06,603 --> 00:15:07,897
Stop saying you're sorry!

228
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:09,609
[cell phone vibrates]

229
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:10,737
Seriously.

231
00:15:15,287 --> 00:15:16,832
[Taeoh] The chairman's been discharged.

233
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:22,927
Now.

234
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:24,472
I got too worked up.

235
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:27,729
Sorry. I want to apologize to everyone.
Let's do this!

236
00:15:27,812 --> 00:15:29,231
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

237
00:15:29,315 --> 00:15:30,317
We can do it!

238
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:32,196
We can do it.

239
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:35,118
[Hyewon] It's the last official event
before the party conference.

240
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:37,289
We have to pay attention to every detail.

241
00:15:37,372 --> 00:15:40,755
And how about mentioning children
when talking about the fine dust?

242
00:15:40,838 --> 00:15:45,055
Instead of "young people,"
call them "struggling job seekers."

243
00:15:45,138 --> 00:15:48,269
Make it to be employees being laid off
for the minimum wage increase

244
00:15:48,353 --> 00:15:50,315
and show pity to small business owners.

245
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:52,402
Good, much more appealing.

There's nothing like this
to relieve stress.

-[Seongju] Of course.

In five days,
at the Hanmi Party Conference,

279
00:18:32,765 --> 00:18:35,980
Jo Sundong will be appointed
against the chairman's intent,

280
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:41,407
which will open the doors to attacks
on the Royal Road Project as futile.

281
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,455
So Jo Sundong was picked
to be the one to carry the weight?

282
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,463
What's Kang Seongju voting
for with the center?

[cell phone vibrates]

284
00:18:49,632 --> 00:18:53,640
That's what we need to figure out
while he's drunk with victory.

285
00:18:54,517 --> 00:18:55,519
Must be nice.

286
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:59,109
His first victory against my father.
I bet it'll taste sweet.

287
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:00,654
[Hyewon] There's more.

288
00:19:00,738 --> 00:19:03,869
Kang Seongju's the first guest
for the Blue House Talk Concert.

289
00:19:05,163 --> 00:19:09,046
Oh Gyeongcheol texted me to pick a topic
and prepare the script.

290
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,845
A tribute for Kang Seongju
on behalf of Jo Sundong?

291
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:14,682
Kang Seongju could've requested it first.

292
00:19:15,141 --> 00:19:17,270
In exchange for making him a party leader?

293
00:19:18,147 --> 00:19:20,360
As the starting point for future costs.

294
00:19:20,443 --> 00:19:21,487
What if...

295
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:25,871
the chairman finds out
about their secret deals?

296
00:19:25,955 --> 00:19:28,835
How much and to what extent
will Mr. Kang's punishment be?

297
00:19:29,796 --> 00:19:31,131
I'm looking forward to it.

298
00:19:31,215 --> 00:19:33,469
Kang Seongju won't just accept
the punishment.

299
00:19:34,054 --> 00:19:37,435
He'll do whatever he can to try and break
the absolute and universal law

300
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,899
that Kangoh is Kang Joongmo.

They'll attack as if they were waiting.
Jo Sundong, that bastard!

331
00:21:28,742 --> 00:21:33,125
He'll instigate and fuel the madness
and try to tear Kangoh apart.

332
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,254
How long has he been planning

333
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:38,177
in the shadows after I abandoned him?

334
00:21:39,346 --> 00:21:41,518
I should've taken care of him back then!

By any chance,

00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:50,577
you cannot react emotionally.

00:22:35,124 --> 00:22:37,420
It wasn't just me.
We already knew together.

356
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:42,263
Leave me out of there.

357
00:22:42,347 --> 00:22:44,476
I don't exist to Chairman Kang yet.

358
00:22:45,227 --> 00:22:47,106
Aren't you considering marrying Inha?

359
00:22:51,156 --> 00:22:52,158
[chuckles softly]

360
00:22:53,202 --> 00:22:54,580
Did I get ahead of myself?

361
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,333
I told him I wasn't ready yet.

362
00:22:56,918 --> 00:22:57,920
Not yet.

363
00:22:59,507 --> 00:23:00,509
"Not yet"?

364
00:23:03,807 --> 00:23:05,978
"Not yet" it is.

365
00:23:24,472 --> 00:23:25,474
[Hyewon sighs]

366
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,980
I know now is more important than ever.

367
00:23:28,314 --> 00:23:30,067
I just want us to be careful.

368
00:23:30,527 --> 00:23:31,696
It is important.

369
00:23:32,823 --> 00:23:35,494
As important as it is,
it'll only get harder for us

370
00:23:36,622 --> 00:23:38,417
if we don't catch Kang Seongju now.

371
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,883
Chairman Kang bought the site
for Royal Road.

372
00:23:42,467 --> 00:23:44,764
Kangoh Group poured in funds from within.

373
00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:47,226
There are no problems if you win,

374
00:23:48,688 --> 00:23:51,401
but if you lose,
it's breach of trust and embezzlement.

375
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:54,825
You'll find something
if you dig into Oh Gyeongcheol.

376
00:23:55,284 --> 00:23:56,954
Being the guest on the talk show

377
00:23:57,038 --> 00:23:59,627
was Oh Gyeongcheol's idea,
not Congressman Jo's.

378
00:24:02,591 --> 00:24:03,593
Two days.

379
00:24:03,968 --> 00:24:05,555
Bring me concrete facts...

380
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:08,812
in two days.

381
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:15,951
A RELIABLE WORKER WHO WORKS
WITH THE PEOPLE, JO SUNDONG

382
00:24:30,479 --> 00:24:31,481
[clears throat]

383
00:24:37,661 --> 00:24:38,788
[both chuckle softly]

384
00:24:39,372 --> 00:24:41,376
[man inhales sharply and exhales]

385
00:24:48,265 --> 00:24:49,267
[inhales sharply]

386
00:24:50,352 --> 00:24:52,106
Do you have something to say to me?

387
00:24:53,108 --> 00:24:54,653
-Yes.
-What is it?

388
00:24:55,237 --> 00:24:57,534
I know you're not pleased with me.

389
00:24:57,618 --> 00:24:58,786
Oh.

390
00:25:00,206 --> 00:25:01,208
[in English] And?

391
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,963
I don't know what the general manager
said to you,

392
00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:07,178
-but it's probably true.
-[in Korean] Is that so?

393
00:25:07,261 --> 00:25:09,600
-If you don't like me because of that...
-[snaps]

394
00:25:11,186 --> 00:25:14,860
You were a great reporter in Gwanghwamun.
The district office is different, right?

395
00:25:15,361 --> 00:25:18,200
Being a social affairs reporter
is close to manual labor.

396
00:25:18,826 --> 00:25:22,166
-I'm well-trained in most things.
-Of course. Sure.

397
00:25:22,834 --> 00:25:25,966
Secretary Na, the reason I don't like you

398
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:28,220
isn't because of Mr. Yu.

399
00:25:28,763 --> 00:25:32,604
So there's another reason
you're displeased with me?

400
00:25:32,688 --> 00:25:35,276
I've been through a lot of hardships
in politics,

401
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,446
and I've studied many people.

402
00:25:38,448 --> 00:25:40,035
I can conclude from my research...

403
00:25:41,496 --> 00:25:43,626
that no matter how hard you try
to hide yourself,

404
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,551
most people have a gap
they don't know about.

405
00:25:47,634 --> 00:25:49,680
[snaps] Through that,

406
00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:52,393
others can see inside.

407
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,447
But it's strange. I can't see through you.

408
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:03,040
I don't trust people I can't see through.

409
00:26:05,503 --> 00:26:09,511
Mmm. There's another person
who's like that. Do you know who?

410
00:26:11,431 --> 00:26:14,062
[chuckles softly] Congressman Jo Sundong?

411
00:26:15,481 --> 00:26:16,734
[man chuckles]

412
00:26:17,318 --> 00:26:19,322
[laughing]

413
00:26:20,115 --> 00:26:23,372
Wow, I may not trust you,
but you'd make a great drinking buddy.

414
00:26:23,455 --> 00:26:24,875
-[chuckles]
-[chuckles softly]

415
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,881
Ah. Some of the aides
are getting together later

416
00:26:27,964 --> 00:26:30,302
to celebrate the conference
at an afterparty.

417
00:26:30,386 --> 00:26:32,014
Would you like to come?

418
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:35,437
-I'm sorry. I have plans today.
-[man] Really?

419
00:26:35,522 --> 00:26:38,235
-[chuckles] I'm off.
-Okay.

420
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,330
[door closes]

421
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:47,128
Are you out of your mind?

422
00:26:47,838 --> 00:26:49,424
Who? Ko Huichan?

423
00:26:49,508 --> 00:26:51,554
Huiju, calm down.

424
00:26:51,637 --> 00:26:52,639
Are you insane?

425
00:26:54,475 --> 00:26:56,564
I'm not deaf. Take it easy.

426
00:26:56,647 --> 00:26:58,818
Does it look like I can right now?

427
00:26:58,901 --> 00:27:00,697
Ko Huichan? Are you kidding me?

428
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,866
Miss!

429
00:27:02,534 --> 00:27:05,665
-Are you going to argue with your mother?
-Stay out of it!

430
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,910
[sighs]

431
00:27:45,244 --> 00:27:46,246
I'll be outside.

432
00:28:03,698 --> 00:28:08,164
-Why do I have to hear about Ko Huichan?
-Chairman Ko of Daejong adores you.

433
00:28:08,749 --> 00:28:10,878
Let's go ahead
with the engagement first...

434
00:28:10,962 --> 00:28:13,300
-Mom.
-He wants to hold the wedding next year.

435
00:28:13,383 --> 00:28:15,930
[chuckles] I know. So why?

436
00:28:16,014 --> 00:28:19,061
I like Huichan. He's gentle and funny.

437
00:28:19,145 --> 00:28:21,024
You really don't know what he's like?

438
00:28:21,107 --> 00:28:24,280
Everyone knows about the trouble he caused
in the States!

439
00:28:25,073 --> 00:28:27,411
Everyone gets a little lost
when they're young.

440
00:28:27,704 --> 00:28:30,793
-The present is what's important.
-Whatever. I don't care.

441
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:33,841
Judging from the rumors I heard,
he's still just a child.

442
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,762
[clicks tongue]

443
00:28:35,845 --> 00:28:36,972
Watch your mouth.

444
00:28:37,682 --> 00:28:39,393
A forced marriage.

445
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:41,732
I won't do it.

446
00:28:41,815 --> 00:28:45,657
Is there anyone in our family
who wasn't forced into marriage?

447
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,284
That's why everyone's miserable.

448
00:28:47,368 --> 00:28:49,623
Do you want me to live miserably like you?

449
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,671
-Kang Huiju.
-I don't want that for me.

450
00:28:54,215 --> 00:28:55,760
If you force this...

451
00:28:58,516 --> 00:28:59,518
I'll die.

452
00:29:01,229 --> 00:29:02,732
And I mean it.

453
00:29:09,245 --> 00:29:10,873
-[sighs]
-[door opens and closes]

454
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:14,840
[line connects]

455
00:29:14,923 --> 00:29:18,096
Is Ko Huichan back from the States?
Find out where he hangs out.

456
00:29:19,641 --> 00:29:21,060
-[sighs]
-[line disconnects]

457
00:29:21,144 --> 00:29:23,983
I'd never agree to an arranged marriage.
I'm not crazy.

458
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:37,719
CONTACTS

459
00:29:37,802 --> 00:29:39,263
TAEOH

460
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,568
[sighs]

461
00:29:57,801 --> 00:29:58,803
Did you come alone?

462
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,685
Impressive. [chuckles]

463
00:30:04,021 --> 00:30:05,023
This way.

464
00:30:06,819 --> 00:30:08,823
[man 1] It's for real, starting now.

465
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:14,333
Management rights will go to Kang Seongju,
Chairman Kang will be ousted before that,

466
00:30:14,918 --> 00:30:18,341
and all of that will be achieved by us.

467
00:30:18,424 --> 00:30:20,095
-Okay?
-And the old man,

468
00:30:20,805 --> 00:30:24,186
wants to know
how much he can trust Kang Seongju.

469
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:26,357
Either way, he's Chairman Kang's son.

470
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,904
When the time comes,
won't he take his dad's side?

471
00:30:28,988 --> 00:30:31,577
When that time comes...

472
00:30:32,662 --> 00:30:34,164
there's a saying that goes...

473
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,423
"Once you're in too deep,
it's hard to pull out."

474
00:30:39,133 --> 00:30:43,224
Those types of people
are scared of the word "losing" the most.

475
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:45,605
-Aren't I right? Especially...
-[men chuckle]

476
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:48,527
...when it comes to money.

477
00:30:50,865 --> 00:30:52,242
[knocking on door]

478
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,875
-Gentlemen, your dish is ready.
-[man 3] Come on in.

479
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:58,797
[man 1] Now, let's have a drink.

480
00:30:58,881 --> 00:31:00,718
Let's drink something strong.

481
00:31:00,801 --> 00:31:02,555
-[chuckles]
-[faint beeping]

482
00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:04,475
[man 4] It's going
to go down smooth tonight.

483
00:31:29,734 --> 00:31:30,820
[cell phone vibrates]

484
00:31:37,165 --> 00:31:38,251
[Hyewon] Come to Inha's place.

485
00:31:42,426 --> 00:31:44,848
Kang Seongju will put Jo Sundong
at the forefront

486
00:31:44,931 --> 00:31:47,645
and try to control
the National Assembly's MOEL and MOLIT.

487
00:31:48,438 --> 00:31:51,318
They'll use their power to advance
the Royal Road Project

488
00:31:51,402 --> 00:31:54,951
despite Kangoh's financial collapse
and the resulting economic crisis.

489
00:31:55,035 --> 00:31:58,166
Furthermore, they'll try to brand them
as an evil dictatorship.

490
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,590
After they destroy the Royal Road Project,

491
00:32:01,673 --> 00:32:04,888
they'll name Chairman Kang
for embezzlement and negligence.

492
00:32:07,017 --> 00:32:09,063
We've already anticipated that much.

493
00:32:10,941 --> 00:32:12,695
But the real deal starts now.

494
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,868
After they successfully oust
Chairman Kang,

495
00:32:15,951 --> 00:32:19,542
the Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center
will be separated from Kangoh

496
00:32:19,626 --> 00:32:21,462
which is the start of Kang Seongju's plan.

497
00:32:21,546 --> 00:32:25,095
-Wait, what?
-The center's separation and independence.

498
00:32:25,763 --> 00:32:27,015
But that's not all.

499
00:32:27,642 --> 00:32:30,564
Energy chemistry, communications,
and logistic services.

500
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:31,650
Also, electronics.

501
00:32:32,234 --> 00:32:35,741
That's the portfolio of the subsidiaries
that'll be formed with the center,

502
00:32:36,535 --> 00:32:38,204
wrapped to look like a good cause

503
00:32:38,287 --> 00:32:40,835
for increased autonomy
and responsible management.

504
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,256
Transition to a holding company...

505
00:32:44,258 --> 00:32:46,220
That was Kang Seongju's goal.

506
00:32:46,303 --> 00:32:48,600
He'll try to steal the core of Kangoh.

507
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:51,690
The center's the main part,
not Kangoh Holdings.

508
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:54,612
But he's going to accelerate it.

509
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:58,829
He'll make Jo Sundong the owner
with the Blue House on his back.

510
00:32:59,914 --> 00:33:00,916
This is just...

511
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:02,962
-[glasses clink]
-[Seongju chuckles]

512
00:33:03,045 --> 00:33:04,799
[Inha] We can't compete with that.

513
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:07,470
-[Hyewon] You're right.
-[Seongju exhales]

514
00:33:07,555 --> 00:33:10,895
[Hyewon] They have almost a 100% chance
of their plan succeeding first.

515
00:33:10,978 --> 00:33:12,940
I understand. Thank you.

516
00:33:13,357 --> 00:33:14,736
Do you really think...

517
00:33:15,738 --> 00:33:18,619
-Kang Seongju will beat us?
-That's what the results show.

518
00:33:18,702 --> 00:33:19,787
There are other ways.

519
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:24,338
We can persuade Chairman Kang
to secede the center first.

520
00:33:25,131 --> 00:33:27,887
-Well?
-Chairman Kang won't give up the center.

521
00:33:29,056 --> 00:33:31,268
We don't have the justification or power

522
00:33:32,395 --> 00:33:34,149
-to change his mind yet.
-[Inha] So what?

523
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:36,529
-Do we just sit back and watch?
-Why would we do that?

524
00:33:37,823 --> 00:33:39,744
In the end, we'll complete our goal.

525
00:33:39,827 --> 00:33:42,082
Congressman Jo won't get into
the Blue House.

526
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:46,006
He's bait to provoke Chairman Kang
to get rid of Kang Seongju.

527
00:33:47,175 --> 00:33:49,346
That's the role I've decided
for Jo Sundong.

528
00:33:50,724 --> 00:33:51,810
So trust me.

529
00:33:52,937 --> 00:33:54,439
Jo Sundong and Kang Seongju...

530
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:59,032
won't be able to take anything they want.

531
00:33:59,283 --> 00:34:01,036
-[clinks]
-[both laugh]

532
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,001
As long as I'm here.

533
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,965
[reading] Save Africa.

534
00:34:49,049 --> 00:34:52,640
It's an African refugee relief
organization run by Jang Noik Foundation.

535
00:34:52,723 --> 00:34:53,975
Jang Noik Foundation.

536
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:56,021
I know it well.

537
00:34:56,648 --> 00:34:58,819
Anyway, these foundations are the problem.

538
00:34:59,821 --> 00:35:02,535
But if it weren't
a problematic foundation,

539
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,914
we wouldn't have been able to meet at all.

540
00:35:04,997 --> 00:35:05,999
On that note...

541
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:10,258
should we be thanking
the Kangoh Art Foundation?

542
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:15,435
[slurps]

543
00:35:23,033 --> 00:35:25,163
I should've come to the hospital,

544
00:35:25,831 --> 00:35:27,459
but there are eyes watching me.

545
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:31,551
I thought it'd be a hassle for you,
so I asked you to come here.

546
00:35:32,177 --> 00:35:33,638
As I've said before,

547
00:35:34,473 --> 00:35:38,105
there are no issues with the chairman
aside from his blood pressure.

548
00:35:38,189 --> 00:35:39,525
I know that.

549
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:42,155
I'm sure you will do well.

550
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:48,083
Drink it.

551
00:35:49,587 --> 00:35:50,589
[grunts softly]

552
00:35:51,674 --> 00:35:53,762
I'm very busy right now...

553
00:35:54,471 --> 00:35:58,688
I need to prepare for the 10th-anniversary
symposium for the Heart Transplant Center.

554
00:35:58,772 --> 00:36:00,066
It's concerning to me.

555
00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:02,487
[Geumseok] I hear your son

556
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,080
was admitted into rehab
for drug addiction.

557
00:36:13,384 --> 00:36:16,181
It's been a while since he was fired
from Johns Hopkins.

558
00:36:17,058 --> 00:36:18,853
Yet you've already decided to have him

559
00:36:18,937 --> 00:36:22,443
as the next head of surgery
at Kangoh Hospital?

560
00:36:24,447 --> 00:36:25,909
What do you intend to do?

561
00:36:36,054 --> 00:36:38,392
[Taeoh] I have confirmed that a villa
was purchased

562
00:36:38,475 --> 00:36:40,647
under Congressman Jo's daughter's name

563
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:41,983
in San Sebastian, Spain.

564
00:36:42,108 --> 00:36:46,366
I also confirmed a cash deposit
of $5 million

565
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:49,289
to his daughter's Swiss bank account
two days after that.

566
00:36:53,882 --> 00:36:54,925
Did you track it?

567
00:36:55,802 --> 00:36:57,305
-Yes.
-Who is it?

568
00:36:57,388 --> 00:36:59,977
Save Africa,
an African refugee relief organization,

569
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:02,691
laundered donations
meant for South Sudanese refugees

570
00:37:02,775 --> 00:37:05,614
-and transferred them to a Swiss account.
-Save Africa?

571
00:37:08,787 --> 00:37:09,872
Jang Noik Foundation?

572
00:37:10,916 --> 00:37:12,460
-Yes.
-Behind that

573
00:37:12,544 --> 00:37:14,172
will be Kangoh Art Foundation.

574
00:37:15,216 --> 00:37:16,301
Yes.

575
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:20,393
Then the brains behind it
will be Director Jang Geumseok.

576
00:37:21,478 --> 00:37:24,150
Whoever gets the center gets Kangoh.

577
00:37:25,194 --> 00:37:28,283
So do they call it Kang Seongju's center?

578
00:37:29,077 --> 00:37:32,291
The Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center
is part of the Synergy Team.

579
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,045
The Synergy Team's team leader

580
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:36,634
is Senior Executive VP Kang Seongju.

581
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:40,307
So saying the center belongs to him...

582
00:37:41,435 --> 00:37:42,771
would be correct, right?

583
00:37:44,525 --> 00:37:45,527
What's more...

584
00:37:47,113 --> 00:37:48,115
-[gun fires]
-[shatters]

585
00:37:48,575 --> 00:37:50,161

586
00:37:50,537 --> 00:37:52,541
[laughing]

587
00:37:54,879 --> 00:37:56,006
Director Jang!

588
00:37:56,089 --> 00:37:57,926
You're a sniper.

589
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,599
Shooting suits me better than golf.

590
00:38:00,682 --> 00:38:03,270
Incredible! [laughs]

591
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,193
Have you been busy lately?

592
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,865
Isn't it my job to be busy?

593
00:38:08,948 --> 00:38:10,201
-[laughs]
-[chuckles]

594
00:38:11,077 --> 00:38:12,080
Mother.

595
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,167
You're here.

596
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:18,718
KANGOH MILL

597
00:38:18,802 --> 00:38:21,641
[Seongju] Chairman Kang Minguk
was the first chairman of Kangoh,

598
00:38:22,518 --> 00:38:24,479
and he loved Kangoh Mill.

599
00:38:25,565 --> 00:38:27,694
As far as I can remember,

600
00:38:27,778 --> 00:38:32,161
he used to come here before a big event
and get lost in thought for some time.

601
00:38:33,832 --> 00:38:37,213
My grandfather always lived by this motto,
"You may fail,

602
00:38:37,756 --> 00:38:40,762
but you can't make any mistakes."

603
00:38:40,846 --> 00:38:44,352
The former chairman's
management philosophies were well known.

604
00:38:45,981 --> 00:38:47,985
Did you bring me here to tell me that?

605
00:38:50,824 --> 00:38:54,205
However, the current chairman,
Kang Joongmo,

606
00:38:54,289 --> 00:39:00,217
is trying to change those teachings
with dogmatism and self-righteousness.

607
00:39:03,265 --> 00:39:04,267
That's why...

608
00:39:06,522 --> 00:39:08,192
I thought we could come together...

609
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:15,582
and try to realign the spirit of Kangoh
that my grandfather had established.

610
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:21,969
I need the backstory of Milton's birth
from 10 years ago...

611
00:39:23,806 --> 00:39:26,896
as evidence for embezzlement
and breach of trust against Chairman Kang.

612
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:31,614
-I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
-Mr. Chu.

613
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,039
You heard me.
How can you pretend like you didn't?

614
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:40,339
I misjudged you.

615
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,598
[sighs]

616
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,980
How much longer
will you be my father's avatar?

617
00:39:48,815 --> 00:39:52,906
After a while, will you let Han Taeoh
take away that role as well?

618
00:39:53,783 --> 00:39:55,035
I don't care who you are.

619
00:39:56,329 --> 00:39:58,458
I won't forgive you
for running your mouth.

620
00:40:00,045 --> 00:40:01,047
Mr. Chu.

621
00:40:03,928 --> 00:40:05,932
I meant what I said.

622
00:40:07,561 --> 00:40:09,188
Seeing your skills

623
00:40:09,272 --> 00:40:12,946
being used as a puppet for Kangoh
is sincerely such a waste.

624
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,169
[sighs]

625
00:40:21,756 --> 00:40:22,966
Instead of Milton,

626
00:40:23,885 --> 00:40:25,847
I promise you your own global law firm.

632
00:40:47,264 --> 00:40:48,893
Chu Hyeokjin made an appearance.

633
00:40:55,865 --> 00:40:56,909
Now?

634
00:41:17,868 --> 00:41:19,872
[computer processing]

635
00:41:58,574 --> 00:41:59,952
[Hyeokjin] I thought about your offer.

636
00:42:00,537 --> 00:42:02,874
Okay, let's do it.

637
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:04,962
[computer processing]

638
00:42:07,216 --> 00:42:11,767
[Hyeokjin] In return, you'd better keep
the promise you made me.

639
00:42:12,393 --> 00:42:15,399
I don't think he'll keep that promise.

640
00:42:16,317 --> 00:42:17,319
Goodness.

641
00:42:18,029 --> 00:42:20,117
Mr. Chu. [clicks tongue]

642
00:42:22,371 --> 00:42:24,918
I said I'd make you a promise...

643
00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:29,636
but I never said I'd keep it.

644
00:42:31,724 --> 00:42:32,726
[clicks tongue]

645
00:42:33,226 --> 00:42:34,896

646
00:42:35,857 --> 00:42:36,859
Don't worry.

647
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,282
I can at least pretend.

648
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:43,413
See! I told you.

649
00:42:43,956 --> 00:42:45,668
He won't keep his promise.

650
00:42:46,795 --> 00:42:51,179
Kang Seongju has no intention of doing so.

651
00:42:56,899 --> 00:42:57,942
[device vibrates]

652
00:43:01,115 --> 00:43:05,917
IN RETURN, YOU'D BETTER KEEP
THE PROMISE YOU MADE ME.

653
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:08,881
A promise between the two.

654
00:43:10,593 --> 00:43:11,804
A promise...

655
00:43:11,887 --> 00:43:12,972
DON'T WORRY

656
00:43:15,686 --> 00:43:16,689

00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:47,119
[Taeoh] I know the real owner of Milton...

676
00:44:48,037 --> 00:44:49,206
is you, Chairman Kang.

677
00:44:49,833 --> 00:44:51,335
Milton is my weakness.

678
00:44:51,962 --> 00:44:56,053
Will you use that to threaten me?
Is this how you counterattack?

679
00:44:56,137 --> 00:44:58,099
That's not your weakness.

680
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,274
Of course, I have no intention
of launching a counterattack.

681
00:45:02,357 --> 00:45:06,157
However, I thought
maybe the purpose of Milton Law Firm

682
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,621
might not be so conventional.

683
00:45:10,498 --> 00:45:11,835
If it's not?

684
00:45:13,631 --> 00:45:16,970
Certain aspects of Milton
could become your Achilles heel.

I'm afraid Vice President Kang Seongju
has gotten ahold of your Achilles heel.

Aren't you worried?

Nothing.

00:46:07,572 --> 00:46:09,826
-I'm sorry.
-Don't think about useless things.

695
00:46:09,909 --> 00:46:12,665
Arrange a meeting with Congressman Jo
as soon as possible.

00:46:13,249 --> 00:46:14,251
Okay.

That big picture isn't for me.

00:46:23,019 --> 00:46:24,773
It's for himself.

00:46:28,906 --> 00:46:30,618
he's someone we need.

703
00:46:30,701 --> 00:46:33,582
We still have a long way to go.
Don't let your guard down.

704
00:46:36,212 --> 00:46:39,009
-I understand.
-Just become the owner of Kangoh.

705
00:46:39,093 --> 00:46:42,349
You can do anything you want after that.

706
00:46:42,975 --> 00:46:46,482
We can change the president
a thousand times over if you want.

707
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:08,735
Call Chu Hyeokjin.

708
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,464
[line ringing]

709
00:47:20,926 --> 00:47:22,262
I'll put Chairman Kang on.

710
00:47:25,018 --> 00:47:26,020
What?

711
00:47:29,652 --> 00:47:30,863
Okay.

712
00:47:30,946 --> 00:47:32,115
I'll be right there.

713
00:47:35,288 --> 00:47:38,085
HAN TAEOH

714
00:47:43,304 --> 00:47:44,557
[car honks]

715
00:47:53,742 --> 00:47:54,827
[chuckles softly]

716
00:47:56,998 --> 00:47:58,209
When did you get here?

717
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,629
You should've called.

718
00:47:59,712 --> 00:48:01,131
I would've come out sooner.

719
00:48:02,927 --> 00:48:04,681
-Let's go see the ocean.
-Right now?

720
00:48:05,348 --> 00:48:06,350
[chuckles softly]

721
00:48:06,977 --> 00:48:08,981
[waves splashing]

722
00:48:17,790 --> 00:48:19,209
It's a perfect ocean.

723
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,675
It is a perfect ocean.

724
00:48:24,846 --> 00:48:25,931
[sighs]

725
00:48:30,064 --> 00:48:31,066
This is nice.

726
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:36,995
Let's get married.

727
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,586
I want to get married.

728
00:48:47,975 --> 00:48:49,144
[chuckles softly]

729
00:48:50,689 --> 00:48:52,484
Okay, let's get married.

730
00:48:53,486 --> 00:48:56,075
The day you proudly enter Bisunjae.

731
00:48:57,912 --> 00:48:59,373
We're almost there.

732
00:48:59,456 --> 00:49:00,584
[Inha chuckles softly]

733
00:49:04,759 --> 00:49:06,178
[sighs]

734
00:49:06,888 --> 00:49:10,019
Do you believe Taeoh's plan
will be a complete success?

735
00:49:10,771 --> 00:49:11,773
No.

736
00:49:17,743 --> 00:49:22,545
I trust you, Kang Inha.

737
00:49:23,254 --> 00:49:24,422
[Inha chuckles softly]

738
00:49:25,007 --> 00:49:26,009
[chuckles softly]

739
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,725
[exclaims] Sweet!

740
00:49:33,608 --> 00:49:34,861
[Joongmo] Why are you so surprised?

741
00:49:34,944 --> 00:49:38,284
I came for what's mine.
Is that so surprising?

742
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,371
No, sir.

743
00:49:43,169 --> 00:49:47,845
Get rid of any legal issues that could
arise from reassigning the center.

744
00:49:48,429 --> 00:49:50,601
-by tomorrow morning.
-[all] Yes, sir.

745
00:49:53,397 --> 00:49:56,403
Mr. Chu, you don't seem happy.

746
00:49:56,486 --> 00:49:57,573
Of course not.

747
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,827
How could I dare interfere?

748
00:50:04,962 --> 00:50:07,425
Everyone,
I hope there are no misunderstandings.

749
00:50:07,968 --> 00:50:12,477
As each case is unique,
we must prevent any unintentional leaks.

750
00:50:12,561 --> 00:50:15,776
I will hold onto your phones
until after the meeting.

751
00:50:28,677 --> 00:50:30,054
Mr. Chu?

752
00:50:30,764 --> 00:50:31,766
Yeah.

753
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,408
CHU HYEOKJIN

754
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:48,048
If you look at the graph here,
department stores and network start-ups

755
00:50:48,132 --> 00:50:49,635
have a much higher return.

756
00:50:55,146 --> 00:50:57,150
[people speaking indistinctly]

757
00:51:01,366 --> 00:51:02,536
[sighs]

758
00:51:08,422 --> 00:51:11,721
This is Chairman Kang delivering
a fatal blow to Kang Seongju.

759
00:51:14,602 --> 00:51:16,731
Am I going to get screwed?

760
00:51:17,231 --> 00:51:18,233
Damn it...

761
00:51:18,943 --> 00:51:20,530
My phone.

762
00:51:22,492 --> 00:51:24,204
I think I have to let him know.

763
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:27,878
[gasps]

764
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:30,257
Why did you follow me here?

765
00:51:30,341 --> 00:51:33,640
-You take my phone and now you're spying?
-Spying?

766
00:51:36,478 --> 00:51:37,564
By any chance,

767
00:51:38,357 --> 00:51:39,694
is this what you need?

768
00:51:41,781 --> 00:51:44,995
Go ahead and use it.
I'm sorry about that, Mr. Chu.

769
00:51:45,706 --> 00:51:46,707
No, it's fine.

770
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:49,212
Fair is fair. We shouldn't defy it.

771
00:51:51,174 --> 00:51:52,553
I appreciate the gesture.

772
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,660
Is there anything wrong?

773
00:52:27,163 --> 00:52:28,165
No.

774
00:52:29,042 --> 00:52:30,044
Get back to work.

775
00:52:40,147 --> 00:52:41,149
[door opens]

776
00:52:43,153 --> 00:52:44,155
Mother.

777
00:52:45,407 --> 00:52:46,536
We have a problem.

778
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:50,251
What's wrong?
It's not like you to cause a fuss.

779
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:52,171
Father is trying to take the center.

780
00:52:52,881 --> 00:52:53,842
Take it?

781
00:52:53,925 --> 00:52:58,016
[sighs] He's changing it so it's
directly under the chairman's authority.

782
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,185
Says who?

783
00:52:59,269 --> 00:53:02,859
Mr. Chu just called me. It'll be announced
during an emergency meeting.

784
00:53:07,995 --> 00:53:10,457
I think it's time to bring it out.

785
00:53:11,376 --> 00:53:13,548
-What will you do?
-What do you mean?

786
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:18,181
I'll show them that Kangoh
doesn't just belong to Kang Joongmo.

787
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:33,086
[grunts softly]

788
00:53:35,132 --> 00:53:37,763
-Where's the chairman?
-There are no signs of him yet.

789
00:53:37,846 --> 00:53:39,140
[car approaching]

790
00:53:39,223 --> 00:53:40,644
[honking]

791
00:53:41,269 --> 00:53:42,606
What the hell?

792
00:53:42,689 --> 00:53:43,858
[engine revving]

793
00:53:44,943 --> 00:53:48,116
[grunts softly] Hey! Wait! Hey!

794
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,703
Move your car out of the way!

795
00:53:49,787 --> 00:53:51,039
That's filthy.

796
00:53:51,582 --> 00:53:52,584
Oh!

797
00:53:53,251 --> 00:53:56,091
The owner and this punk! One and the same!

798
00:53:57,678 --> 00:53:58,680
Look at you!

799
00:54:00,474 --> 00:54:01,476
-[car revving]
-Hey.

800
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,438
Aren't you uncomfortable in that? Gosh.

801
00:54:04,065 --> 00:54:05,568
So frustrating!

802
00:54:11,121 --> 00:54:12,123
[sighs]

803
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:18,970
KANGOH RESORT CEO, KANG INJU

804
00:54:19,053 --> 00:54:20,932
[sighs and grunts softly]

805
00:54:26,694 --> 00:54:29,908
[sighs] Look at those eyes.

806
00:54:30,785 --> 00:54:32,622
He could shoot lasers from them.

807
00:54:33,165 --> 00:54:34,375
-[scoffs]

00:54:38,008 --> 00:54:39,010
[Joongmo sighs]

809
00:54:43,936 --> 00:54:45,899
Han Taeoh is a man of many hats.

810
00:54:46,525 --> 00:54:49,531
People might think he was Kang Taeoh
instead of Han Taeoh.

811
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:54,081
[Joongmo] I'm sure you were surprised
when I suddenly called for this meeting.

812
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:57,296
However, praise should always be given

813
00:54:58,256 --> 00:55:01,471
in front of an audience to mean anything.

814
00:55:02,348 --> 00:55:04,185
Vice President Kang Seongju

815
00:55:04,268 --> 00:55:06,565
has made a great contribution to Kangoh

816
00:55:06,982 --> 00:55:08,485
and everyone here knows that.

817
00:55:09,153 --> 00:55:11,199
He was able to look into the future,

818
00:55:11,282 --> 00:55:14,497
and he established the center
for foreign cooperation

819
00:55:15,374 --> 00:55:17,754
into a mecca
for future innovation technologies.

820
00:55:18,171 --> 00:55:21,762
Vice President Kang Seongju's skills
continue to evolve even now.

821
00:55:22,931 --> 00:55:26,856
I'm sure everyone is aware
of that fact and what a marvel it is.

822
00:55:26,939 --> 00:55:29,820
So despite being my son,
I will put my pride aside

823
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,617
and borrow his skills once more.

824
00:55:34,788 --> 00:55:37,293
-Vice President Kang Seongju.
-Yes, sir.

825
00:55:37,878 --> 00:55:41,594
Can you revive
the dying Kangoh Securities?

826
00:55:42,679 --> 00:55:44,307
Let's see what you can do.

827
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:46,896
I'll leave Kangoh Securities to you.

828
00:55:48,481 --> 00:55:49,483
[sighs]

829
00:55:50,444 --> 00:55:53,450
-Chairman...
-This isn't an order as the owner.

830
00:55:53,534 --> 00:55:54,828
This is a sincere request...

831
00:55:56,122 --> 00:55:57,499
as your father.

832
00:55:58,961 --> 00:56:01,926
Is it inappropriate to use
my authority as a father at work?

833
00:56:02,426 --> 00:56:03,596
[members] No, sir.

834
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:06,225
-[man 1] It's fine.
-[man 2] You're not wrong.

835
00:56:06,309 --> 00:56:07,687
[chuckles]

836
00:56:07,771 --> 00:56:11,069
As you know,
I don't normally say wrong things.

837
00:56:12,321 --> 00:56:13,490
There's one more thing.

838
00:56:14,241 --> 00:56:15,452
As of today,

839
00:56:15,536 --> 00:56:17,666
the Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center

840
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:22,383
will be split-off and reorganized to be
directly under the chairman's authority.

841
00:56:23,511 --> 00:56:24,930
Vice President Kang Seongju,

842
00:56:25,013 --> 00:56:28,562
no, I should call you
President Kang Seongju now.

843
00:56:29,063 --> 00:56:30,065
I will make sure

844
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:33,029
no one ruins
what President Kang Seongju has created

845
00:56:33,614 --> 00:56:35,702
and try to lead it well.

846
00:56:37,706 --> 00:56:39,835
Seo Wonhae, the current center director,

847
00:56:40,085 --> 00:56:42,757
will be the new team leader
of Kangoh's Synergy Team.

848
00:56:42,841 --> 00:56:46,974
The current training center director will
fill the vacant center director position.

849
00:56:47,057 --> 00:56:49,980
I will be appointing Chae Donguk.

850
00:56:50,523 --> 00:56:52,443

851
00:57:11,105 --> 00:57:12,984

[♪ rock music playing over speaker]

853
00:57:16,074 --> 00:57:17,451
[Taeoh] You're playing the role...

854
00:57:19,246 --> 00:57:20,290
of the victim well.

855
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:25,843
You don't like fishing.

856
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,391
People can't always do what they like.

857
00:57:32,481 --> 00:57:34,986
Fishing in a run-down spot
on the verge of closing...

858
00:57:37,534 --> 00:57:38,869
with that tacky speaker.

859
00:57:40,581 --> 00:57:43,253
This combination
is often called pretentious.

860
00:57:43,921 --> 00:57:45,508
[Donguk] You wouldn't come all this way

861
00:57:46,927 --> 00:57:49,599
to start a fight with me.

862
00:57:50,726 --> 00:57:53,398
You were abandoned by Kang Seongju

863
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:55,611
and I'm here to revive you.

864
00:57:56,404 --> 00:57:57,991
What are you up to?

865
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,504
I need your anger
against Kang Seongju, Professor.

00:59:21,282 --> 00:59:22,492
-[man 2] Hurry up!
-Wait!

881
00:59:22,577 --> 00:59:24,121
-[man 2] Get in there!
-Please, wait!

882
00:59:24,204 --> 00:59:25,206
[man 2] Step aside.

883
00:59:35,268 --> 00:59:36,354
[man] At dawn,

884
00:59:37,314 --> 00:59:40,403
I got an email
from an untraceable IP address.

885
00:59:42,825 --> 00:59:46,165
A bomb to blow away
Chairman Kang Joongmo of Kangoh.

886
00:59:48,879 --> 00:59:49,881
[gulps]

887
00:59:49,964 --> 00:59:52,720
You know such matters
should be handled swiftly, right?

888
00:59:55,684 --> 00:59:56,812
I'll start right away.

889
00:59:59,984 --> 01:00:01,320
How dare you mess with me?

890
01:00:01,863 --> 01:00:05,746
Then you come here
and try to make a deal with that lie?

891
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:07,792
Unfortunately, it's not me.

892
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:09,838
Do you expect me to believe that lie?

893
01:00:21,235 --> 01:00:25,578
It's up to you whether you believe it
or not. Do whatever you want.

894
01:00:27,748 --> 01:00:31,673
Really? If that's the case,
I'll show you properly.

895
01:00:33,342 --> 01:00:34,344
[gasping]

896
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:39,856
We're from
the Eastern District Prosecutor's Office.

897
01:00:41,776 --> 01:00:43,070
Please enter together.

898
01:00:43,154 --> 01:00:44,281
[men] Yes, sir!

899
01:00:46,118 --> 01:00:47,454
[man 1] Hands off the keyboard.

900
01:00:48,414 --> 01:00:50,376
Please stand up.

901
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,798
Don't block them. Please stand back.

902
01:00:54,009 --> 01:00:55,094
Please stand back.

903
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:58,184
You can't stop them. Step back.

904
01:01:00,021 --> 01:01:01,065
[Joongmo thuds]

905
01:01:02,652 --> 01:01:05,574
-[labored breathing]
-[pills rattling]

906
01:01:18,642 --> 01:01:20,646
[Joongmo groaning weakly]

907
01:01:42,940 --> 01:01:44,944
[grunting softly]

908
01:01:58,137 --> 01:01:59,682
[elevator dings]

909
01:02:25,984 --> 01:02:28,907
-[man] We're from the prosecutor's office.
-What's going on? Hey!

910
01:02:29,617 --> 01:02:30,619
What the...

911
01:02:31,788 --> 01:02:32,832
Hey!

912
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:34,334
Who the hell are you?

913
01:02:34,836 --> 01:02:36,046
[elevator dings]

914
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:43,645
[Joongmo groaning weakly]

915
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:19,424
[♪ upbeat song playing]
