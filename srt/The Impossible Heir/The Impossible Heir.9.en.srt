00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,446
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,989
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,929
Who...

4
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,687
It was you.

5
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,939
The rat.

6
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,736
A member of North Korea's
Reconnaissance General Bureau,

7
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,780
defector Kim Gwangil.

8
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,660
You left the European-based hacking
organization for financial institutes.

9
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,873
- An ex-agent of Bluenoroff.
- Are you explaining that for my sake?

10
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,001
- Your kindness is a disease.
- Han Taeoh's dead.

11
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,054
- It's probably getting wrapped up by now.
- Why go through the trouble?

12
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,765
You found Roy.

13
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,558
Will you kill me too?

14
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,936
It won't be easy.

15
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:45,688
Really? I think it'll be easy.

16
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,740
See?

17
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:57,700
I said it'd be easy.

18
00:01:58,743 --> 00:01:59,744
This...

19
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,039
Was it money after all?

20
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,708
"Don't follow people,
follow the money."

21
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,669
I'm only following your rules.

22
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,754
You little bastard.

23
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,013
Hello?

24
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,312
Breaking news.
Today, at the Western Detention Center,

25
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,314
a prisoner on death row has escaped.

26
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:32,193
The escaped convict
turned out to be the culprit

27
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,362
of the EF Tower Hotel murder, Han Taeoh.

28
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:57,927
I'm sorry.

29
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,846
I went to do what I was told,

30
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,640
but Inmate 3866 was already gone...

31
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,477
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:14,319
You'll disappear if you tell anyone
about what we asked you to do.

33
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,467
Seonu Wan!

34
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:40,011
Are you inside?

35
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,722
Seonu Wan!

36
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,692
Is that you, Taeoh?

37
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,943
What are you saying?

38
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:38,903
I'll get the money. Wait!

39
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,238
Don't leave me out!

40
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,282
Do you have money?

41
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,909
I know you have money!

42
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,038
Where are you?

43
00:04:58,589 --> 00:04:59,799
Okay.

44
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,722
Han Taeoh escaped.

45
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,807
Han Taeoh...

46
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,600
escaped?

47
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,438
Don't bother with
unnecessary thoughts. Just find him!

48
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,857
Find Mr. Han?

49
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,534
I thought there was
a bit of romance in you.

50
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,620
I didn't know you were a little punk.

51
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,788
Romance?

52
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,499
That's fresh coming from you!
Stop talking nonsense!

53
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:36,794
Will you shoot me?

54
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,421
No, no.

55
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,343
No matter how much Kang Inha pays you,
half is mine.

56
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,261
What?

57
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,224
Follow the money.

58
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,935
Well,
the flow of money has changed.

59
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,938
To Kang Inha.

60
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,233
Come on. If you have a brain, think!

61
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,987
Don't be ignorant
and pull out a gun first.

62
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,431
HEAD OF LEGAL TEAM

63
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:36,938
Sir?

64
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,232
Han Taeoh.

65
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,818
Find him for me.

66
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,948
Where's Mr. Han hiding?

67
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,286
CORRECTIONAL SERVICE ADMIN SYSTEM

68
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,585
Where do you think Han Taeoh is?

69
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,797
Don't worry about it.

70
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,426
He'll live the life of a fugitive.

71
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,555
How long will you stay here?

72
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,600
I have no intention of getting along
with your father anymore.

73
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,358
Mother.

74
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,319
What about me?

75
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,782
I must bring down Inha
from the Future Strategy Office.

76
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:32,994
Father was so absorbed with Han Taeoh.

77
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,665
Now, he's entangled
in Inha's web of deceit.

78
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,001
If you stay here,

79
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:43,671
Na Hyewon could take the slush funds
from the foundation. It'll be over.

80
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,967
We have more than a few shares in Kangoh.

81
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,012
Don't get impatient.

82
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,143
Mother, I put...

83
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,897
Kangoh Securities will be back on track
in a short amount of time.

84
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,609
I can gain his approval for real now.

85
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,155
So I'll go see him
and have you reinstated.

86
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:10,990
No.

87
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:18,206
I've been working behind the scenes too.

88
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,709
I'll try to hurry
before the chairman goes further.

89
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,171
We must gather power from the shareholders
and board members

90
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,923
who are on our side first.

91
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,690
Is she coming or not?

92
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,611
Should I have just called her husband?

93
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,156
Damn, I need a reason to call.

94
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,033
That way I can bring up money.

95
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:14,345
She really came.

96
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,484
Are you terminally ill or something?

97
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,279
Why was this so easy?
You came and brought me money.

98
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:33,614
Find me a professional
who can find people.

99
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,199
Is your husband cheating?

100
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,702
What a shame.

101
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,121
You acted so high and mighty.

102
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,455
Can you find them or not?

103
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,626
All sorts of people gather here.
You think I can't find you one?

104
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,336
Do it by tomorrow.

105
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,589
What's your hurry?

106
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,049
- I'll pay you twice as much.
- Really?

107
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,344
By tomorrow. Get out.

108
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,889
Twice as much. Don't go back on your word.

109
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,233
Who the hell is she looking for?

110
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,530
Something's definitely up...

111
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,761
YOON HYANGMI

112
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,061
Yeah, Hyewon visited me.

113
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,563
She's looking for a professional
to find someone.

114
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,232
Do you know who she's looking for?

115
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:54,070
She's so peculiar.

116
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,490
I'm worried she might cause trouble.

117
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,245
- What if the in-laws disapprove?

118
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,603
Kang Inha...

119
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,564
Inha was there.

120
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,026
He was there.

121
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,696
There...

122
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,604
KANGOH AIRLINES
IS LAUNCHING ANEW

123
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,524
What happened?

124
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,067
I brought you here.

125
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:21,944
Does that mean...

126
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,239
I'm an escaped convict?

127
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,742
If it weren't for me,
you'd already be dead.

128
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,911
What do you mean?

129
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,206
It seems like someone
took out a hit on you.

130
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:43,674
If something insignificant continues
to pop up during important moments,

131
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,051
it's no longer insignificant.

132
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,597
That was the case for Mo Gijun.

133
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,433
His name came up
at every important moment.

134
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:54,935
It reached my ear.

135
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,938
That's how I started to follow him.

136
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,189
And at the end...

137
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,462
- Kang Inha...
- You killed my son,

138
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:23,797
so why did I keep you alive?

139
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,549
I didn't kill Kang Inju.

140
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,676
There's no proof you didn't.

141
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,428
There's no proof I did either!

142
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:34,099
Inha, he must've been there.

143
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,331
WOMAN

144
00:15:58,791 --> 00:15:59,959
Did you find someone?

145
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,502
Who do you think I am?

146
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,296
They want to meet today. Do you have time?

147
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,901
WOMAN

148
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,178
Are you looking for him?

149
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,222
ESCAPED CONVICT WANTED NOTICE

150
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,301
Now! Full house.

151
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,470
- It's mine.
- Wait.

152
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,055
What is it?

153
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,190
She hit the jackpot tonight!

154
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,035
There's no point.

155
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:00,496
Don't waste your energy.

156
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,260
Since when have you
been in contact with her?

157
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,055
How much did she sell me off for?

158
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,640
The person you're looking for.

159
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:23,310
Han Taeoh.

160
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,771
Is that right?

161
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:28,816
Why? Will you find him for me?

162
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,194
Are you insane?

163
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,071
Taeoh didn't escape.

164
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,907
- I'm sure something happened!
- Shut your mouth.

165
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,077
There's no reason he'd try to escape.

166
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,454
Not only are you disgusting and vulgar,

167
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,040
but you're trying to tell me
you know Taeoh better?

168
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,084
I know him better than anyone.

169
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,420
As if deceiving me
all this time wasn't enough, you still...

170
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,840
How dare you?

171
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,592
Should I get on my knees and beg?

172
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,057
- Don't tell me...
- Yeah.

173
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,643
I know you know about me and Taeoh.

174
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,441
You know?

175
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:13,652
You do?

176
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,321
How are you so dignified?

177
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,574
I was sorry.

178
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,119
I thought of living
with the burden forever.

179
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,247
That was before you choked me.

180
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,293
We failed each other.

181
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:31,753
Failed?

182
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,672
Failed?

183
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,929
You deceived me.

184
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,223
I'll never forgive you.

185
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,564
I bet you were happy you reached
the chairman's fingertips.

186
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,648
That's too bad.

187
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:55,903
I'm sorry to end it like this.

188
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,738
Come in.

189
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,489
Nurse!

190
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,949
Kang Inha!

191
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,702
Kang Inha!

192
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,996
- Grab her!
- Hey, you!

193
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,603
Let's see.

194
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,233
Sir, I'll get going now.

195
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,751
Tell me...

196
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,505
why you helped me now.

197
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,800
I'm the one that brought you Kang Inha.

198
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,138
Don't lie and tell me
to clean up the mess.

199
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,682
You're right.

200
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:53,520
You don't have to be the one
to get rid of Inha.

201
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:58,525
I have plenty of new pawns
willing to get their hands dirty.

202
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,653
However, if Kang Inha has joined forces
with Park Sajin,

203
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,822
it changes things.

204
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:08,410
Those two people are trying
to divide and separate Kangoh.

205
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,120
How dare Inha do that?

206
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:14,916
He's trying to cut Kangoh in half
and give it to Park Sajin.

207
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,251
You're too late.

208
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,545
He's already started the dispense work.

209
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,838
On what grounds?

210
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:23,842
I designed the blueprints
of the dispense work.

211
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:27,637
Yes, it was your plan.

212
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:32,142
I know you two were trying
to tear Kangoh apart.

213
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:36,229
I know that's why you brought
Kang Inha to me as well.

214
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,523
Turning Kang Inha
into the owner of Kangoh...

215
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,360
was my plan.

216
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,162
Put the plan back in place.

217
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:55,791
Also, get rid of Kang Inha from Kangoh.

218
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,959
You can do whatever you want with him.

219
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,963
Then I'll return everything you had

220
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,966
back to you.

221
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:20,899
I named the holdings
for the dispense work, "PY."

222
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,153
I want everyone to know
that Kangoh's start

223
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,530
was with our family.

224
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:30,200
It wasn't Kangoh Trade, but Kangoh Mill.

225
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:34,996
Your father, the founder of Kangoh Mill,

226
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,376
Park Young. PY.

227
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,380
How meaningful.

228
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:47,342
When you first came to me and spoke
of Kangoh's division and separation,

229
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:50,387
I just thought you were crazy.

230
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,527
It seems like you're not comfortable
being with me,

231
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,070
so I'll get to the point.

232
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,784
I want to be the chairman of Kangoh.

233
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:19,499
I'm curious as to why
you're telling me this.

234
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,085
Because you have to help me now.

235
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:30,677
You're a Kang in name only.
You're actually an illegitimate son.

236
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,805
So what merit do you have?

237
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,265
Why would I take your side?

238
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,393
If I become the chairman...

239
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,147
we're going to split Kangoh in half.

240
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,900
You don't have that kind of power.

241
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,401
That power...

242
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,654
needs to be made by you.

243
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:56,161
Advisor Im Jongyong of Kangoh Electronics.
He's your greatest helper.

244
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,747
Right?

245
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,749
What is it that you want to say to me?

246
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,919
There's a lot of dirt on Mr. Im.

247
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,425
Were you this much of a scumbag?

248
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,677
Do you think that's all there is?

249
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,057
If there's anyone who's unfriendly to you,

250
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,225
it's our job to find out

251
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:21,102
even the tiniest speck of dust
in his pocket.

252
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:26,233
You wanted to meet me
to blackmail me with a third-rate threat.

253
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,489
Han Taeoh would've done that.

254
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:36,034
However,
Han Taeoh's office no longer exists.

255
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,996
Now, Kang Inha's Future Strategy Office...

256
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:42,874
will move forward with you.

257
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,712
Not only the mill, but food, distribution,
and construction...

258
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,508
will all be yours.

259
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,345
Park Sajin's new empire.

260
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,723
Doesn't that sound fabulous?

261
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:04,271
So we're at the launch of PY Holdings.

262
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,775
What we're doing will be called a legend.

263
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:13,822
I won't be embarrassed
to face my late father now.

264
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,978
The number you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

265
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,314
Please leave a message after the beep.

266
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,902
KANG INHA
PARK SAJIN

267
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,455
Let's be friends.

268
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,209
Let me rephrase, instead of friends,
let's be partners.

269
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:54,005
I don't plan on playing
in the minor leagues forever.

270
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,258
So I'm going to use you.

271
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,638
You'll be my rope that'll help me reach
the major leagues.

272
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:08,353
In the end, you didn't trust me.

273
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,605
To you, you're the only capable one!

274
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,608
Making you
Chairman Kang Inha of Kangoh

275
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,152
is the only reason I exist.

276
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,530
Then what about you?

277
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:21,533
Does nothing exist for you?

278
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,201
Nothing.

279
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,328
Ah.

280
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,290
If there was anything, it's you, Inha.

281
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,419
You ruined everything.

282
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,047
Our plan. Our dream.

283
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:41,428
I'll do everything I can
to restore everything you ruined.

284
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,304
Even if you ruined everything,

285
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,724
I came to tell you
my position hasn't changed.

286
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,560
Because as always,

287
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,479
you'll be more worried about me than you.

288
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,622
Are you up?

289
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,126
Good morning.

290
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,046
Get this off of me.

291
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,132
You brought this on yourself.

292
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,760
I'll never forgive you.

293
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,386
I bet you get it now.

294
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,599
That's exactly how I felt.

295
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,685
I'll kill you.

296
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,770
I'm so scared.

297
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:38,610
Calm down. If I die, you're nothing.

298
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,578
What happened to you?

299
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:49,829
What happened to me?

300
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,165
Nothing's changed.

301
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,460
I'm still the same.

302
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,464
If you can promise me one thing,

303
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,091
I'll let you out of here.

304
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:07,180
You'll exist for me from now on.

305
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:09,140
Just as Han Taeoh did.

306
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,143
You'll become my next Han Taeoh.

307
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,771
You'll breathe and live for me.

308
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,234
You won't have a choice.

309
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:25,490
If you don't, you really might
leave this place in a body bag.

310
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,067
Taerim Mental Institute?

311
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,277
Inha...

312
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,905
had Na Hyewon admitted against her will.

313
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,578
Why do you think he let her go?

314
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,292
Because...

315
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:21,713
he's trying to get his hands
on the foundation's slush funds.

316
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:22,964
Na Hyewon.

317
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,800
You must make sure she's on your side.

318
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:30,013
To carry out the dispense work,
Kang Inha and Park Sajin will need money.

319
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:33,349
In order to get it,
they'll need Na Hyewon.

320
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,311
Put your questions aside for now.

321
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:40,148
We don't have enough time
to answer those questions.

322
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,399
There's too much to do.

323
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,409
Mr. Chu.

324
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,096
Han Taeoh.

325
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:14,557
Did you find anything?

326
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,310
He's still looking.

327
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:19,812
Yes, sir.

328
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:22,941
I'll call you.

329
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,864
I'm checking every speck of dust.

330
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,658
Tell him to wait.

331
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,216
I know what happened.

332
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,928
He's going to need a lot of money
for what's to come in the future.

333
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:54,347
The reason I gave you that position.

334
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:58,142
Make the wise judgement
as to whose side you'll take.

335
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:08,111
In return,
don't stop me from doing anything.

336
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:13,324
There are things I must do for real now.

337
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,629
Welcome back.

338
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:29,924
Na Hyewon.

339
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,900
CORRECTIONAL SERVICE ADMIN SYSTEM

340
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,907
CORRECTION FOR A BETTER TOMORROW

341
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,160
CCTV CONTROL SYSTEM
WESTERN DETENTION CENTER

342
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,924
A convoy at this hour?

343
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:22,018
WESTERN DETENTION CENTER

344
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:52,548
One, three, nine, L,
three, five, eight, three.

345
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,343
VEHICLE RECORD

346
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,928
The address...

347
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,516
Milton?

348
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,977
Milton...

349
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,105
Chu Hyeokjin.

350
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,463
Where did you go?

351
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,259
Don't do anything.

352
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,721
Nothing will happen
if you don't do anything.

353
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,851
This isn't advice. It's a warning.

354
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,146
I'm tired.

355
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,939
I'm going to bed.

356
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,954
Either way,
Park Sajin is just a tool.

357
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,957
Once he gets what he wants,

358
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,169
Kang Inha will do what he can
to get rid of Park Sajin.

359
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:16,090
You're not saying we should wait until
he tries to get rid of him, are you?

360
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,802
I'm telling you
to get rid of Park Sajin yourself.

361
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,721
How?

362
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,265
Kangoh's division.

363
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,559
Make the official proposal first.

364
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:33,274
You want me to break apart Kangoh myself?

365
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,194
You need Park Sajin on your side.

366
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,323
Give Park Sajin
half of Kangoh along with Kangoh Energy.

367
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,532
Are you insane?

368
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,076
It started out as a partnership.
So the dispense...

369
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,787
It was bound to happen.
The problem was timing.

370
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,290
As if half wasn't enough,
give him Kangoh Energy?

371
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,126
That could never happen.

372
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,211
Don't tell me.

373
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,214
Did you think that was the end?

374
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,341
Energy was a card to discard anyway.

375
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:00,885
- What?
- The rest...

376
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,804
will be temporarily entrusted
to Park Sajin.

377
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,643
- Entrust it to him?
- I promise to bring it all back.

378
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,354
The core of Kangoh Group

379
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,066
will be played
by the Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center.

380
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,901
No matter how Kangoh changes,

381
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,655
the fact that Kangoh's owner is you
won't change.

382
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:27,078
So even if Park Sajin takes half
of Kangoh, nothing will change.

383
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,083
Your blood pressure's normal.

384
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:40,252
Your nutritional balance is normal too.

385
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,921
I don't have to come anymore.

386
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,550
Thank you.

387
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,761
Great job.

388
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,620
Why are you so surprised?

389
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,456
It was just unexpected.

390
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,584
I'm meeting the chairman.

391
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,549
What brings you here?

392
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,718
I saw Director In leaving.

393
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:15,264
- Were you worried I might be sick?
- That's right.

394
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,516
There's no need to worry.

395
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,809
I should get going, sir.

396
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,603
Great job.

397
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,775
You're not here to disturb me, are you?

398
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:29,403
It seems like Director In's waiting.

399
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:37,620
I'll get going.

400
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,872
You should rest.

401
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:21,956
Who is it?

402
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:24,917
What do you mean?

403
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,338
Who is it?

404
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,520
Good night.

405
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,064
Director In.

406
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:52,653
I have no feelings toward you.

407
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,614
When that's the case,

408
00:42:56,782 --> 00:43:00,536
I can do anything I want to you
and not feel a thing. Do you understand?

409
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:06,208
Why does that sound like a threat to me?

410
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,421
You must've done something wrong.

411
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,430
Han Taeoh.

412
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:36,071
It seems like Mr. Kang knows.

413
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,198
Okay.

414
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:39,992
DIRECTOR IN

415
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:46,624
It seems like Inha knows.

416
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:50,836
If so,

417
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,089
you must meet with Park Sajin tonight
and decide.

418
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:55,924
Quickly.

419
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,093
Do it as quickly as possible.

420
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,304
What will you do?

421
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,140
I'll call you.

422
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:33,545
This place
doesn't change with time.

423
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:35,839
At the completion ceremony,

424
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:39,051
it felt like yesterday
when we looked down from here.

425
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:43,806
Did you call me this late
to take a stroll down memory lane?

426
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,308
Energy.

427
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,478
How much will you buy it for?

428
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,940
I hear you'll become independent.

429
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,401
Did you think I wouldn't know?

430
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,654
What about you?

431
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:03,909
Did you think I'd keep quiet
and stay at Kangoh Mill forever?

432
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,327
Of course not.

433
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,954
Then what's the problem?

434
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,501
Kang Inha. He's the problem.

435
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:29,560
SEONU WAN

436
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,021
What?

437
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,273
Han Taeoh.

438
00:45:35,315 --> 00:45:36,984
He's at EF Tower right now.

439
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,574
Something is definitely up
at the chairman's office.

440
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,243
He has banned people from entering

441
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,288
and he has been ordering
room service for two.

442
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,249
Han Taeoh.

443
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,294
I think the chairman has him.

444
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,013
Park Sajin's empire.

445
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,432
I'll help you.

446
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,934
You deserve it.

447
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,188
Our fathers started Kangoh.

448
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:18,275
We'll create the greatest history
that they failed to do.

449
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:25,699
In return, let go of the hand...

450
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,452
you're holding onto.

451
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:31,538
You haven't changed at all.

452
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:36,376
Seeing as how you'll abandon
your own blood to protect Kangoh.

453
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,005
You've changed a lot.

454
00:46:40,088 --> 00:46:44,593
Seeing as how impatient you were to grab
a helpless boy's hand.

455
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:45,886
Impatient?

456
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,305
Me?

457
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,850
It seems like you've got the wrong idea.

458
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,561
I don't need strength.

459
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:56,897
I needed someone from the Kang family.

460
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:02,110
Someone to become my cannon fodder
and shield.

461
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,862
Kang's bloodline.

462
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:04,988
That boy...

463
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,450
will leave Kangoh tomorrow.

464
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,204
The conditions you want. Kang's bloodline.

465
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,207
He won't have them.

466
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:23,382
Does that change your mind?

467
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,109
I'm ready.

468
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,527
Come down in five minutes.

469
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,508
I'm from the foundation.

470
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:11,805
Here you go.

471
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,875
Dad!

472
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,946
Hey!

473
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,746
Hey! Damn it!

474
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:23,830
Ah!

475
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,789
It was recording.

476
00:52:26,518 --> 00:52:28,145
It was here the entire time.

477
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:30,605
Here.

478
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,621
I found it.

479
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:49,207
I found the truth.
