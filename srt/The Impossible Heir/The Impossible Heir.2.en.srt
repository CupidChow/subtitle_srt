THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,947
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:33,867
If I asked you to help me,

4
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:37,829
would you?

5
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:47,005
No.

6
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,717
Never.

7
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,638
But I won't get in your way.

8
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,892
As long as I don't get
in your way either, yes?

9
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:03,605
-
I'm off.

10
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:10,028
Even if you don't want to,
you'll end up helping me.

11
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:38,950
Where were you?

12
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,619
Do you have a talent
for surprising people?

13
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,706
The fact that you're surprised
means you're tired.

14
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,916
Do you want me to get you some medicine?

15
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,918
Why did you come back here?

16
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,461
I don't like sleeping alone.

17
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,173
I'm spending the night here.

18
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,743
Can I invite Inha to the Saturday dinner?

19
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,828
I miss him.

20
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,747
Why would you call him here?

21
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,790
Honey, be careful.

22
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,375
Inha's part of our family, too.

23
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,085
Hey! Who says he's family?

24
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:35,632
- I have a name, and it's not "hey".
- How dare you speak to me like that!

25
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,884
The chairman is still eating.

26
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,138
Inha deserves to come.

27
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,389
- Right?
- Huiju.

28
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,975
How are you supposed to act at the table?

29
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,811
Daddy!

30
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,691
Mr. Moon.

31
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,027
Yes, sir.

32
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:59,322
Find out if Inha has plans.

33
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,406
Honey.

34
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:12,460
She wasn't thinking straight.

35
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:13,836
He's still my bloodline.

36
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,756
- He can come once.
- Once will become twice.

37
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,258
And it'll become a third.

38
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,885
There's no reason he can't come here.

39
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,054
Also, I don't need your permission.

40
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,724
Did you forget?

41
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,977
The promise you made me
when you brought him.

42
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,062
I did everything you wanted.

43
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:35,566
- Like what?
- The inheritance waiver.

44
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,986
Did you think I wouldn't know?

45
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,908
Is that why you're acting like this?

46
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,119
Everything related to Kangoh Group

47
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:48,871
is decided by me.

48
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,081
In other words,

49
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,084
you just want me to keep my mouth shut.

50
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,587
- As I've done so far, and from now on--
- Hello?

51
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,089
It's me.

52
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,050
Have you been well?

53
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,637
I'll get straight to the point.

54
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,099
Dinner this Saturday at Bisunjae.

55
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,225
Come.

56
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:11,978
Are you listening?

57
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,730
Yes, I'm listening.

58
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,690
I'll see you
at Bisunjae on Saturday.

59
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:23,740
Let's go.

60
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:25,908
I got a call from Bisunjae.

61
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,123
The chairman himself called.

62
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:38,087
Well, I expected him to call,
but he's moving faster than I thought.

63
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,637
You can tear it apart or burn it,

64
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,139
do whatever you want.

65
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,447
INHERITANCE WAIVER

66
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,450
Chairman Kang Joongmo.

67
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,869
To put it nicely, he's cold-hearted.

68
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,163
To put it honestly,

69
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,956
he's cold-blooded.

70
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,586
Your mother used her authority
and upset him.

71
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,589
Before the succession was complete,

72
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:25,551
the chairman probably had planned
to get the inheritance waiver from you.

73
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,261
Are you saying the chairman

74
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,223
thinks no differently
than my mother at Bisunjae?

75
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,725
Probably.

76
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,105
He's being friendly towards you

77
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,816
to punish your mother
for stealing his initiative.

78
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:42,151
As if he wants Jang Geumseok to see.

79
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,529
It seems the chairman's kindness

80
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,448
won't last long.

81
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,950
It's just for now.

82
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:50,535
Damn it.

83
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,375
Someone who's innocent

84
00:06:58,626 --> 00:06:59,919
but not naive.

85
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,506
Someone who knows their place

86
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,425
and the extent of their reach.

87
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,676
And of course,

88
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,804
this person
won't get greedy in the future.

89
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,806
This person...

90
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:14,976
is Kang Inha.

91
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,230
You just have to imprint that version
into their heads.

92
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:22,358
Then they'll take care of the rest.

93
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,943
"Innocent."

94
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,779
"But not naive."

95
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,364
I know it won't be easy,

96
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,576
but I trust you can do it.

97
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,839
INHERITANCE WAIVER

98
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:48,301
Is there anything else related
to Kangoh Group that I don't know of?

99
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,845
I'm sorry. That's all, sir.

100
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,139
Yes. That's how it should be.

101
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,808
You shouldn't do anything else

102
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,227
to betray my faith again.

103
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,606
There's a law firm in Singapore, Milton.

104
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:04,358
I'm thinking of signing them
as the new legal counsel.

105
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,822
It looks like you heard something
about Milton.

106
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,200
The thing is...

107
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:17,246
- I heard they'll be sold off...
- What you're thinking is right, Mr. Chu.

108
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,584
I will have Milton.

109
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,504
Milton will be a big weapon

110
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,131
to help grow Kangoh bigger than it is now.

111
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:31,135
Of course, the official relationship
between Kangoh and Milton

112
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,055
will be established for legal purposes
between Party A and B.

113
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,224
That's all.

114
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,607
If by chance

115
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,194
this hidden truth is leaked,

116
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,657
I'll be certain that the source
is you, Attorney Chu.

117
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,956
How long have you worked for me?

118
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,999
It's been 19 years, sir.

119
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,334
Nineteen years.

120
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,337
It's time for a change.

121
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,260
I'll put Milton in your hands.

122
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,595
Try to turn it into a proper spear.

123
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,892
Thank you, sir! Thank you!

124
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,061
That's enough.

125
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:25,940
I want you to be in charge of this waiver
and hold onto it.

126
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,484
- Excuse me?
- I don't know when,

127
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,404
but won't we need it one day?

128
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,573
Absolutely, sir.

129
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,078
I will keep this quiet, too.

130
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,465
KANGOH'S INVESTMENT VALUE

131
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,265
Is this...

132
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,892
The ultimate weapon
to make you the owner of Kangoh.

133
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,936
Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center.

134
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,939
That will
be the future of Kangoh.

135
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,901
"The future of Kangoh."

136
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,871
For now,
turn in your letter of resignation.

137
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,581
Center Director Chae Donguk.

138
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:27,126
Thank you for believing in me.

139
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,087
I'll build a strong foundation,

140
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,799
and I'll present you with the perfect
Co-prosperity Cooperation Center.

141
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,010
Chairman Kang Seongju.

142
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,680
Before you enter Kangoh,

143
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,558
you should learn how to speak
with caution.

144
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,103
I'll be careful.

145
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,649
Drop me off here.

146
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,737
Stay. I'll give you a ride.

147
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,031
It's hard to park there. Just go.

148
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,991
Hey. Wait.

149
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,910
Be careful.

150
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,995
Hey! Wait!

151
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,417
Can't he quit working
at the construction site?

152
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:14,548
HUIJU

153
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,217
I don't believe it!

154
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,720
Are you that happy to hear from me?

155
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,640
Of course. Why wouldn't I be?

156
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,849
It's been so long.

157
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:26,268
I'm on my way to tea lessons.

158
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,688
Tea lessons at this hour.
Can you believe it?

159
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,941
Instead of my tutor's ugly face,

160
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:35,027
I'd rather see your handsome face!

161
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:37,655
Shall I buy you dinner?

162
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,784
I'll call my tutor! I'll say I have
a runny nose, cough, and a fever!

163
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,369
Miss...

164
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,624
Dinner's not enough.

165
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,418
You're indebted to me.

166
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,295
The dinner on Saturday.

167
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,964
I begged Daddy to invite you.

168
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,218
Ah. Did you?

169
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,013
Thanks, Huiju.

170
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,141
What? Is that all?

171
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,227
I'm hungry so come to Daejong Hotel.

172
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,979
I want something expensive!

173
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,731
Inha!

174
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,065
Inha?

175
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,429
Hello, my sister.
Long time no see.

176
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,431
You came empty-handed?

177
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,476
I thought you'd bring me a thank you gift.

178
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,943
- Tell me if you want anything.
- If I do, will you get it for me?

179
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,030
Don't you think Kang Huiju
is capable of that?

180
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:05,284
Right? Our father's daughter, Kang Huiju.

181
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,165
Won't you get punished by Mother
for skipping your lesson?

182
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,792
Mr. Lee just needs to keep quiet.

183
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,668
- And your tutor?
- Thanks to me,

184
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,712
he gets paid for doing nothing today!

185
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,963
A free ride.

186
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,549
There's no reason to tell on me.

187
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,429
What were you doing?

188
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,681
- It's a secret.
- Whatever.

189
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,266
Excuse me.

190
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,768
Sure.

191
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,941
Do you know her?

192
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:38,400
What?

193
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,237
Ah. She's a friend.

194
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,947
Is this where you work?

195
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,701
- Hello.
- Hello.

196
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:50,579
If you're Inha's friend,
do you know Taeoh?

197
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,624
- Uh...
- If you're talking about Han Taeoh,

198
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,000
yes, I know him.

199
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,962
I don't like my person
having women around them.

200
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,256
Kang Huiju.

201
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,883
I'm just kidding!

202
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:06,303
- You know I'm joking, right?
- I understand even if you weren't.

203
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,849
I don't like women around my person, too.

204
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,189
Take this. I don't need it.

205
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,985
- Black bean noodles.
- You like the seafood course.

206
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,444
Isn't that why we're here?

207
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,821
Is that all?

208
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,823
Let's be honest. Daejong has better

209
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:29,410
- Chinese restaurants than Kangoh.
- But you'll order the noodles?

210
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:31,996
That's what I'm in the mood for today.

211
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,332
I'd like black bean noodles.
Make it super pungent.

212
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:37,251
Ask the chef. He'll know.

213
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,169
I will.

214
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,548
Then,

215
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,426
I'll have
the slightly less pungent noodles.

216
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,679
I'll have them prepared.

217
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:59,356
Why is our princess
so grumpy today?

218
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,901
- I'm getting a bad feeling.
- Because she's pretty?

219
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:04,737
Inha!

220
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,282
Be careful.

221
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,122
When will I see you again?

222
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,292
- I'll see you this weekend.
- Not at home.

223
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,835
Call me like you did tonight.

224
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,504
Will you bring Taeoh next time?

225
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,340
- Bye.
- I'm not kidding!

226
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,300
Take her home safely.

227
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,718
Yes, sir. Don't worry.

228
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,473
I told you! I'm not kidding, okay?

229
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,475
Ah! I can't hear you!

230
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,851
I love you!

231
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,083
Enjoy your meal.

232
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,430
If you felt uncomfortable
because of my sister, I'm sorry.

233
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,891
I apologize.

234
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,894
Did you come back to tell me that?

235
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,188
Well...

236
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,690
sort of.

237
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,402
I'll accept your apology.

238
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,071
I wasn't that great to her either.

239
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,159
What time do you get off?

240
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:39,665
- I'll wait for you.
- I told you I'm too busy to date.

241
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,583
If it's okay with you,

242
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,088
I can buy you as much time as you need.

243
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,134
I don't trust people.

244
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,386
Sorry.

245
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,493
Now! Let's call it a night!

246
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,911
Great job, everyone!

247
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,997
Great job!

248
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,544
Shall we eat before we go?

249
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,920
Sounds good. I'm buying.

250
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,216
The chief should pay. Who else?

251
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,018
I don't trust people.

252
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,270
You'll trust me.

253
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,315
By all means.

254
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,591
One year, 365 days.

255
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,344
Eight thousand,
seven hundred and sixty hours.

256
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,972
How much would that be measured in money?

257
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,770
A lot.

258
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,772
So rather than talking nonsense,

259
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,525
try to get more sleep.

260
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,367
I want to buy it.

261
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,202
Time.

262
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,417
Goodness.

263
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,379
I thought I smelled the gutter in here.
Here's why.

264
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,463
You little punk.

265
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,340
Have you been well?

266
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,384
What's this?

267
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,052
Did you wish I wasn't?

268
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,596
Don't worry about him.

269
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,472
He's always like that. Ignore him.

270
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,142
You little brat.

271
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,810
I told you not to call me that.

272
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:52,858
You keep talking back to me.
Is that how you talk to your brother?

273
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,902
Ah! Wait! Wait a second!

274
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:55,986
Hey, Huiju!

275
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,030
Let go! Let go of me!

276
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,448
Miss, calm down!

277
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:00,991
You'll both get hurt!

278
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,075
Please!

279
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,493
What's going on?

280
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,162
Your finger...

281
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,288
Let me see!

282
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,290
- You're bleeding!
- What are you doing?

283
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,335
Mr. Moon, what are you doing?
Get rid of her!

284
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,086
Get rid of her, Mr. Moon!

285
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,880
You saw it yourself

286
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,340
so I'm sure you get it now.

287
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,759
- Come on.
- You wait and see!

288
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,344
Slow down! It hurts!

289
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,848
This uncomfortable commotion
was caused by you

290
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,976
and that is why you shouldn't come
to Bisunjae.

291
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,520
If you understood me,

292
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:32,856
I trust that you know

293
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,026
what you should do next.

294
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,911
Then he left right after that.

295
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,581
Shall I call the young master
at Cheongdam?

296
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,002
There's no need.

297
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:56,880
Yes, sir.

298
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,969
- Damn it!
- You scared me. Don't move.

299
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,805
You're always letting Huiju get to you.

300
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,431
Aren't you embarrassed?

301
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,350
I bet Madame Jang feels differently.

302
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:13,272
- Why would she?
- I gave her a reason to kick Inha out.

303
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,988
Mr. Moon told me

304
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,323
Madame Jang didn't even decide

305
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:24,950
tonight's dinner menu.

306
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:26,994
She hates him.

307
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,206
Father criticized her, too,
so she wouldn't want to feed him.

308
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,499
That's right.

309
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,420
If it wasn't for Father's order,

310
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,423
that punk couldn't even dream of joining
our family dinner.

311
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,049
To Madame Jang,

312
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:44,469
having him step foot in Bisunjae
is horrifying.

313
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:48,307
I bet she thought all night
about what she could do

314
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,350
to avoid sitting with him at the table.

315
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,061
I resolved that for her.

316
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,271
What does that mean?

317
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,772
It means...

318
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,898
Gracias.

319
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,180
Are you getting an idea
of what happened at Bisunjae?

320
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,892
If I had lived my whole life

321
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:17,062
without any greed as Baek Inha,

322
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,315
would I have lived comfortably?

323
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,109
I don't know.

324
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,946
But I'm sure of what I need to do now.

325
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:33,995
Kill Baek Inha.

326
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,414
What?

327
00:23:35,497 --> 00:23:37,165
You're a shell of Kang Inha,

328
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:39,626
so you're reminiscing over old memories.

329
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,755
Baek Inha is entitled to whine over
not getting a meal,

330
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,840
but...

331
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,426
Kang Inha can't do that.

332
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,804
You're going to have
to face more humiliation

333
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,556
and insults.

334
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,019
Don't worry.

335
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,771
I'm going to make you perfect.

336
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,024
Chairman Kang Joongmo's third son,

337
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,193
Kang Inha.

338
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,865
As we expected,
Chae Donguk and Kang Seongju met.

339
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,284
Once we cross into Kangoh's door,

340
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,579
the Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center
will be set.

341
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,789
Chae Donguk and Kang Seongju.

342
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,126
Thanks to them, we bought ourselves time.

343
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,795
The proposal
is now in Kang Seongju's hands.

344
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,422
Finally, our plan

345
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:27,841
has started.

346
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,467
What's wrong with you all?

347
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,762
Does no one care about Inha
after he left like that?

348
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,722
You don't know why he left like that?

349
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,265
You were the cause.

350
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,059
You started it.

351
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,353
You brat!
After what you did to my finger--

352
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,272
That's enough.

353
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,570
Who knew

354
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,031
you people could be this cruel
and cold-hearted?

355
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:36,034
- Huiju, sit down.
- You're like a group of psychopaths.

356
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,620
Sit down now.

357
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,131
I'll see to her.

358
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,554
Inju, why did you do that?

359
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,141
Father, what did I do?

360
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,518
How dare you

361
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,270
insult me in my house?

362
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,565
- When did I?
- I'm the one that invited him.

363
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,149
However, you sent him away

364
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,734
without my permission.

365
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,860
How dare you?

366
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,655
Father, it wasn't like that.

367
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,740
Madame--

368
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:19,536
- I mean, Mother...
- I'll have to think about

369
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,664
what you gained from insulting me.

370
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,809
- Mom.
- You're 17. You're practically an adult.

371
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:46,104
I won't tolerate your childish behavior.

372
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,232
Being entitled comes with duties.

373
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:51,443
Being prudent.

374
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,652
That's one of them.

375
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,660
Ms. Jin will bring you an ice pack.

376
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:01,953
Put it on your cheek.

377
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,021
Did you need something?

378
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,773
What's gotten into Huiju lately?

379
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,026
Why does she keep mentioning
the child in Cheongdam?

380
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,990
You know why, don't you?

381
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:42,118
Well...

382
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,997
Her new math tutor

383
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,958
is a friend of Master Inha.

384
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:52,671
- Who?
- Master Inha said he had a friend

385
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,214
in a rough situation.

386
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,548
Are you out of your mind?

387
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,384
Sir, we're in trouble...

388
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,594
Say it.

389
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,138
Miss Huiju...

390
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,019
She's not in the bathroom

391
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,688
or the dressing room.

392
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,484
I checked the basement and the greenhouse
just in case, but she isn't there.

393
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,027
Her phone's not here either.

394
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,946
I think she left on her own.

395
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,531
Keep your mouth shut.

396
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,199
Don't let the chairman find out.

397
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:22,951
Yes, ma'am.

398
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,842
MOM

399
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,204
TAEOH

400
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,589
- Hello?
- I ran away from home.

401
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,663
Hi!

402
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,254
That's good!

403
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,340
Ah.

404
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,802
Thank you for respecting me
and not calling Inha.

405
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,470
Good job.

406
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:10,892
Why are you staring at me like that?
Is it your first time seeing a runaway?

407
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,602
Get up if you're done.

408
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:16,648
Do you know why I came here
after running away?

409
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:20,443
The first time I spoke with Han Taeoh.

410
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,903
The adults will worry.

411
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,197
Running is the only thing
we have in common!

412
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,539
Get up.

413
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,378
Hmm? I know her.

414
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,422
We meet again.

415
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,799
Yes, hello again.

416
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,468
But why are you two...

417
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:47,971
Taeoh is my math tutor.

418
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,306
I heard you're in the same department.

419
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,351
You can be Taeoh's peer.

420
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,603
If you need a friend,
be friends with Inha.

421
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,772
You're quite cute.

422
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,733
I'm more pretty than cute.

423
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,529
Taeoh, let's go.

424
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:10,785
Huiju, get in right now.

425
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,870
I said that

426
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,497
I'd run far away if you told Inha.

427
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,041
Did you really think
your threat would work on me?

428
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,877
- Taeoh!
- I'm your teacher.

429
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,089
If you don't like it,
you can skip the name.

430
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,300
Then come with me or...

431
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,678
I won't move a step.

432
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,723
Yeah, Taeoh. Let's go together, okay?

433
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:32,849
I'm begging you.

434
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:35,852
If you're going to take Taeoh home,
can I get a ride, too?

435
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,062
Do you think
this is a subway or something?

436
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,856
Do you even know what a subway looks like?

437
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,901
I saw it on TV!

438
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,445
Is that what you wanted to hear?

439
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,113
Let's help each other out.

440
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,866
I'm Taeoh's neighbor.
I live across the street.

441
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,118
What? Across the street?

442
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,251
You two live here?

443
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:02,295
You see each other morning and night?

444
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,379
Drive safely.

445
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,464
See you later.

446
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,010
I should go, too. Thanks for the ride.

447
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,270
Did you know they lived here?

448
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,438
Are you joking?

449
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:22,565
This is so annoying.

450
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,276
No, you can't. Not Taeoh.

451
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,195
I don't have to tell you why, right?

452
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,404
What about you?

453
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,408
Do you like her?

454
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,536
Nope.

455
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,163
You can't lie to me.

456
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:41,000
I hope she likes you, too.

457
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,419
I mean it.

458
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:44,712
If Mother finds out,

459
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,422
Taeoh will be fired, got it?

460
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:48,174
I'm confident I won't get caught.

461
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,468
Seriously...

462
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,642
See? I told you I had a bad feeling.

463
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,234
As of May 4, 2013,

464
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,945
your employment contract
has been terminated.

465
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,920
Ring it up together.

466
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:09,881
I'll buy tonight.

467
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,349
Mr. Moon smoothed it out with Mother.

468
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:23,227
So go inside and beg for forgiveness
no matter what.

469
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,522
Shall I ask for them to move Taeoh
into the house?

470
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,733
I don't like him living there.

471
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:31,444
- Are you still talking about Taeoh?
- I'm rooting for you.

472
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,698
What do you know about Taeoh?

473
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:39,869
When you're getting to know someone,
20 days is more than enough.

474
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,672
Oh, my...

475
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,558
You look like you're about to go to war.

476
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,560
Every day's a war.

477
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,896
Fortunately, the winning rate isn't bad.

478
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,532
But don't you want to know

479
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,495
where we'll be in 10 years?

480
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,123
You'll be where you want to be,

481
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,584
and I'll be where I want to be.

482
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:34,048
- I guess Kang Inha won't be there.
- I told you.

483
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,635
I don't want to be the middleman
for you to get to Inha.

484
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,096
Why would you
bring that up now?

485
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:46,519
Stop your independent war
and focus on going to Inha.

486
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,646
Don't think about using me

487
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,357
or trying to get help from someone else.

488
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,030
There's a timing to everything in life.

489
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,701
It's whether you can grab it or not.

490
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,414
If you can grab it, how will you use it?

491
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,833
The outcome of a war rests on that.

492
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,710
It's not always about the attack.

493
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:23,055
I hope you win this war.

494
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,354
What did you just say?

495
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,857
A new math tutor is coming.

496
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,500
- My uniform.
- What about it?

497
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,086
- I have to go to school.
- You said you'd rest today.

498
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,546
When?

499
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,216
- Last night, I'm sure of it...
- Uniform!

500
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,181
You don't look well.

501
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,476
You should've taken the day off.

502
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:12,438
I'm going to.

503
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:14,607
What?

504
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,575
The director will kill me
if she finds out!

505
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,452
I'll kill you if you don't!

506
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,247
Call the school and say I'm sick
and will be absent.

507
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,498
It's so simple.

508
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,583
Where are you going to go?

509
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,256
Mr. Lee?

510
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,718
Oh!

511
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,387
Uh...

512
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,405
I found you.

513
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,619
Are you really leaving like this?
No farewell?

514
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,706
What kind of teacher doesn't care about
their student at all?

515
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,709
"Take care. Study hard."
Isn't that the least you can say?

516
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,252
This isn't right!

517
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,302
I came all this way to say goodbye!

518
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,512
I never asked you to. Farewell?

519
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,222
I definitely don't want to do that.

520
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,266
I'm going to do it!

521
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,310
I want to do it!

522
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,520
That crappy farewell.

523
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,154
I like you.

524
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,741
I said, I like you.

525
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:49,952
So?

526
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,746
I just told you that I like you.

527
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,081
Is that the only thing you can say?

528
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:01,339
Yes, Mr. Moon.

529
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,177
What are you doing?

530
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,096
Speak for yourself.

531
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,103
Yes, Mr. Moon.

532
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,607
Ah, aside from the advance payment,
I don't need the rest.

533
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,067
Send me the account number.

534
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,651
I'll send it back.

535
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,074
A teacher and a student?

536
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:31,160
No.

537
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,829
I'm an employee and you're the employer.

538
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,791
That ended upon termination
of the contract.

539
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,209
And you like me?

540
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:40,669
I told you.

541
00:39:41,545 --> 00:39:44,757
If you're testing my patience,
you won't win.

542
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:48,469
Do you have anything left to say?

543
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,814
You're right.

544
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,734
Employee and employer.

545
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:07,696
I forgot for a moment.

546
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,365
Party A and Party B.

547
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,827
A type of servant
who works for my dad's money.

548
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,039
The relationship between
an owner and servant never changes.

549
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,083
That's what my grandfather said.

550
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,003
Thanks for your hard work.

551
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,632
Right.
You said you wouldn't say goodbye.

552
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:30,469
Then, continue to work hard.

553
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,849
Outside the line you drew, Mr. Han Taeoh.

554
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:45,526
I'm done. Come and get me.

555
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,479
I saw you and Huiju earlier by chance.

556
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,106
Aren't you being unnecessarily harsh
on her?

557
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,150
Were you the nosy type?

558
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,234
No.

559
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,529
But I can't seem to help myself with you.

560
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,074
Don't worry about it.

561
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,535
It's none of your business.

562
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,248
Think of Kang Huiju
as one of your many means.

563
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,918
Do you know that's really out of line?

564
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,878
I think you're just being
overly sensitive.

565
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,298
I don't know what you're trying to say,

566
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:52,760
but I don't need your advice.

567
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:32,258
Na Hyewon, what's your deal?

568
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:40,933
- Coffee!
- Yes, all right! Coffee's coming!

569
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:45,104
Two coffees!

570
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,439
I'm in a great mood today!

571
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,149
You don't have to.

572
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,527
No. Wait!

573
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,029
- What? I'm the winner.
- Get your hands off.

574
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,366
- Flush.
- What?

575
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,245
I bet that's fun.

576
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:04,498
If I had money, I'd clean them out!

577
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:09,128
Shall I hit up Hyewon again?

578
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,758
What's she going to do? Kill her mother?

579
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:25,477
- Take it inside.
- Yes, sir.

580
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:35,487
Damn it. What are you doing?

581
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,031
Put them back!

582
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,600
I'll die either way. This is no big deal.

583
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,593
- That's all.
- Thank you.

584
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:07,246
She ran her mouth
saying how smart her daughter was.

585
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:09,081
You really go to Hanguk University.

586
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:11,375
You grew up well.

587
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,460
Rags to riches, right?

588
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:18,674
- Who are you?
- Your mom ran off with 50 million won.

589
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,217
We came here to collect.

590
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,301
"Mom"?

591
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:22,886
I don't have one.

592
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,180
What's wrong with you?

593
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:29,351
That's your problem.
We're just here to collect.

594
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:32,521
Then collect it by finding her.

595
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:35,607
Or go to the police
and file a formal complaint.

596
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,987
That rude little brat. What the hell?

597
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:42,448
What are you doing? Get her.

598
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:43,782
Yes, boss.

599
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,167
Where are you going?

600
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,960
Listen to the rest before you go.

601
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,596
Boss.

602
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,726
How dare you look me up
and down like that!

603
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,478
You crazy wench!

604
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:16,523
Who are you?

605
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,319
What's going on?

606
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,404
What do you think you're doing?

607
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,118
I'll see you at home later. Okay?

608
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,835
Stop. Put your phones away.

609
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,552
What are you doing?

610
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,597
- Do you have a place to go?
- I don't understand.

611
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,933
Do you have a place to go
so you can avoid them?

612
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,685
Is that all?

613
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:57,648
How many times do you think
I've been through something like that?

614
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,067
A whole lot.

615
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,111
But I never once avoided it or ran away.

616
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:04,988
Do you know why?

617
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:08,867
If I ran away, it felt like
I was accepting her as my family.

618
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,206
What happened today is no big deal.

619
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,375
I did nothing wrong.

620
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,301
Inha!

621
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:27,761
What now?

622
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:31,056
Thugs came for Na Hyewon.

623
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:32,307
Who came for her?

624
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,935
They tried to hit her and asked for money.
It was chaos.

625
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,874
KANG INHA

626
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:02,129
NA HYEWON

627
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:07,801
The number you--

628
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,553
What the hell?

629
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,331
The number
you have dialed is not responding--

630
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:43,378
Damn it.

631
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,278
The number you--

632
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,275
I was worried about you.

633
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,361
I'm so relieved.

634
00:53:41,551 --> 00:53:43,386
I'm going to stay at Inha's house.

635
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:46,973
Bye.

636
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,437
Don't go.

637
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,983
Don't go, Hyewon.

638
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:06,326
If I don't go,

639
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:09,621
what difference will it make?

640
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,939
We don't mean anything to one another.

641
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,901
How do you know that?

642
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,236
The way you're acting...

643
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,030
In a month or two, no.

644
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,492
Are you sure you won't regret it tomorrow?

645
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,620
You're not, are you?

646
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:52,747
This is our reality.

647
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:58,211
I won't regret it.

648
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,132
Sorry.

649
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:04,801
I know I'll regret it.

650
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,140
Didn't you want to live
a different life than now?

651
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:12,517
If we settle now,

652
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,478
nothing will change.

653
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:04,319
The way you're acting...

654
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,654
In a month or two, no.

655
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:10,200
Are you sure you won't regret it tomorrow?

656
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,081
Taeoh!

657
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,083
Han Taeoh!

658
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,132
Han Taeoh!

659
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,769
KANG INHA

660
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:00,959
KANG INHA

661
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,389
Hello?

662
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:25,442
Tell me.

663
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:34,117
5 YEARS LATER

664
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:43,251
CO-PROSPERITY COOPERATION CENTER
5TH ANNIVERSARY

665
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,380
The chairman is here.

666
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:15,408
Sir, congratulations!

667
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,035
How do you feel today?

668
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:23,374
Please, say a word.

669
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:07,502
This is the employee who wrote the speech
you'll be giving today.

670
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:13,967
Hello.

671
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:17,845
I work on the global leader training team.
My name is Han Taeoh.

672
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:24,894
Our game...

673
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,022
Our game...

674
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:32,485
...has only just begun.
