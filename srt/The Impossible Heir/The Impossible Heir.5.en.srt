1
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,446
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:30,947
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,828
They're using the prosecutor
in a family quarrel.

4
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,165
If this gets out,

5
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,669
we'll be torn apart by the prosecutor
and not Kang Seongju.

6
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,090
Was it Prosecutor Ha Myeongjin?

7
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,640
Since he has no connections,
he's motivated to attack.

8
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:58,725
That's too bad.

9
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,145
The price for opening Pandora's box.

10
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,106
It won't be cheap.

11
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,736
It seems he worked hard
to get to where he is without any help.

12
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,114
Don't you feel guilty?

13
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,742
Or anything like that?

14
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,287
Do I need to?

15
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,040
Or anything like that?

16
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:24,751
No, there's no need.

17
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,879
We've got a long way to go ourselves.

18
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,367
Eat or be eaten.

19
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,828
As long as our nation stands,

20
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,539
prosecutors and conglomerates
can't escape it.

21
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,084
Eat or be eaten.

22
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,170
It just means both sides are bad.

23
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,132
The lowlife who's eaten.

24
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,384
The lowlife who eats.

25
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:17,971
Which one do you want to be?

26
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,431
Naturally, the one doing the eating.

27
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,310
Without the "lowlife" part.

28
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,939
How's he going on about lowlifes
in this day and age?

29
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:31,442
NO ILLEGAL SOLICITATION
NO ACCEPTING BRIBES

30
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,917
I'm glad you look healthy.

31
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,171
Chairman Kang Joongmo.

32
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,343
Now, let's not waste time
and get started, shall we?

33
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,761
There's no need to recite it.

34
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,809
The chairman admits to all charges.

35
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,769
Also, the chairman's defense...

36
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:12,066
is on this USB.

37
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,366
All you have to do

38
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:23,203
is bring this out in front
of the prosecutor.

39
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,163
The rest...

40
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,541
will be taken care of by the people
in here.

41
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,680
TO PROSECUTOR HA MYEONGJIN

42
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,600
Hmm.

43
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,650
- What is this?
- It's our message to you.

44
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,446
This is low, even for Kangoh.

45
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,365
Everyone speaks of the great Kangoh.

46
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,785
Are you trying to openly bribe
the prosecutor?

47
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,703
Right in the prosecutor's office?

48
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,413
Well...

49
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,377
Take a look first.

50
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:49,747
EASTERN DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE'S
BORROWED-NAME ACCOUNT CONNECTIONS

51
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,465
Sir, it's bad.

52
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,142
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE

53
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:10,893
District Attorney?

54
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,187
Wait a second.

55
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,358
- Who is it?
- The DA of the Eastern District.

56
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,152
Yes, District Attorney.

57
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,321
It's me. What's the matter?

58
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,457
DISTRICT ATTORNEY JEONG JINHO

59
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,001
Yes, District Attorney.

60
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:38,963
No, I...

61
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,550
- There he is!
- He's coming out!

62
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,595
Will you take responsibility
of the investigation?

63
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,013
What were the results?

64
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,640
- Please, your statement.
- How do you feel?

65
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,185
Don't you feel bad
for the Kangoh Group's investors?

66
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,937
What is your relationship
with him? Is he your son?

67
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,607
Will Kang Seongju
take responsibility and resign?

68
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:19,796
Chairman.

69
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,589
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:24,092
I've committed a grave sin.
Please spare me.

71
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,345
Get up.

72
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,140
Mr. Chu.

73
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:33,684
One might think

74
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,355
I came here to kill you.

75
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,077
HIDDEN THIRD SON OF KANGOH GROUP

76
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,162
UNIQUE CAREER PATH
FOR A CONGLOMERATE'S SON

77
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,831
WHY REVEAL THE THIRD SON NOW?

78
00:06:54,914 --> 00:07:00,211
KANG INHA SHOWS FRESH PASSION BY REJECTING
CONVENTIONAL CONGLOMERATE FRAMEWORKS

79
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,798
Fresh passion?

80
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,426
What the hell did he do?

81
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,263
He's got to do something to show passion,
you stupid reporter!

82
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,142
Damn it.

83
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,612
No.

84
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,282
What?

85
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,245
Yeah, I'm Kang Seongju.

86
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,205
What?

87
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,293
Yeah, I'm Kang Seongju.

88
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,044
What?

89
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,380
Hey, I'm Kang Seongju!

90
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,924
Kangoh is mine.

91
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,677
No matter what anyone says.

92
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,221
It's mine.

93
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,646
PROSECUTOR HA MYEONGJIN

94
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,654
Stay in Haenam for a year or two,

95
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,698
and I'll call you back when it's time.

96
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,626
Damn it!

97
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,380
Damn it!

98
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,760
The chairman's secretary
will be our Division Director?

99
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,845
Division Director? No way.

100
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,100
HAN TAEOH DIVISION DIRECTOR
KANG INHA CHIEF MANAGER

101
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,061
PERSONNEL APPOINTMENTS

102
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,497
You must've been surprised.

103
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,875
Congrats.

104
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,253
Thanks.

105
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,129
What happens now?

106
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,465
What?

107
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:15,596
Are you talking about your position?

108
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,476
Is there a problem?

109
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,647
Just stay in your position.

110
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,899
All of your duties...

111
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,068
will continue without change.

112
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:34,532
Keep friends close.

113
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,535
Keep your enemies closer. Is that it?

114
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,874
I never once thought you were the enemy.

115
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,460
I'm not sure if you feel the same.

116
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,758
If you thought I'd be grateful...

117
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,595
you're mistaken.

118
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,441
Speak for yourself.

119
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:13,070
Enemies become true adversaries
only when they're on the same level.

120
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,992
Damn it!

121
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,078
It pisses me off that he got a promotion!

122
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,373
Why do I have to do this to you?
You did nothing wrong!

123
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,838
Get up. What are you doing?

124
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,676
Han Taeoh as Division Director? Seriously?

125
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,138
The head of the first division
of the Future Strategy Office!

126
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,600
Does that make sense?

127
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,770
It doesn't make sense.

128
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:47,647
The Future Strategy Office no less.

129
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:50,858
The Division Director?

130
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,489
ROOMMATE

131
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,783
What do you want?

132
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:04,830
Really?

133
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:06,999
Mr. Moon!

134
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,626
Mr. Moon...

135
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,003
What's the meaning of this?

136
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,880
My mother went to the villa?

137
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:15,257
My father was angry.
She didn't have to go.

138
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,719
He might not have said it out of anger.

139
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,639
You could've said something!
You should've stopped her!

140
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:26,143
She wanted to move before the chairman
issued an official announcement.

141
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,728
So I respected her wish.

142
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,821
Give her some time.

143
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:40,116
She hasn't taken a break in a while.

144
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:35,379
Cheers to Madame Jang Geumseok's
comfortable break! Cheers!

145
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,881
Cheers!

146
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,305
2023 KANGOH
FIREWORKS FESTIVAL

147
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:12,082
Kangoh Securities' CEO position dismissal
has been rejected in advance.

148
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,251
The board meeting has been canceled.

149
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,045
Thank you, Father.

150
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,422
In return, live in silence.

151
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,175
I'm allowing you to breathe.

152
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,594
So do only that.

153
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:25,930
Yes, sir.

154
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:31,227
I know I can't stop you
from going to the villa.

155
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,688
You should fulfill your duties as a child.

156
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,607
But that's it.

157
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,151
If you two try to do anything else,

158
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,987
your place in Kangoh and Bisunjae

159
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:43,989
will be gone forever.

160
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:48,035
Mark my words.
That's how you'll survive this.

161
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,966
What comes after that?

162
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,222
Is there nothing after?

163
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,434
Father.

164
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,814
Father, it's me.

165
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,403
I have worked so hard my whole life.

166
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,739
To live as your son with no flaws.

167
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,325
My dreams.

168
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,327
A normal life.

169
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,746
I gave all of that up for this!

170
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,541
So why are you being like this to me?

171
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,168
This order is wrong.

172
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:43,716
Before you argue with me,
you should tell me why you did it.

173
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,926
I had no other choice!

174
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:52,099
Why else would I have done it?

175
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,069
Father.

176
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,823
I'll never forgive you.

177
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:10,993
Never.

178
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,371
Why are you so quiet?

179
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,050
- I'll mark your words.
- Get out.

180
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,838
- Who?
- Han Taeoh and Kang Inha.

181
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,592
They were best friends
at Hanguk University.

182
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,761
You really didn't know?

183
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,681
No, I had no idea.

184
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,890
True.

185
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,811
You and Seongju didn't go to that school,
so you might not know.

186
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,480
You both studied abroad.

187
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,941
The idiot and that mutt...

188
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,778
Tell me more about them.

189
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,117
Stop drinking and tell me.

190
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,043
Did you call me, sir?

191
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,088
I'm thinking of putting
Chief Manager Kang Inha in charge

192
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,757
of negotiations for Kangoh Tech One sales.

193
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,218
Do you want to know my opinion on it?

194
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,888
We have to sell this time.

195
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:57,766
China's IM's attempt to leak technology
last year

196
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,519
still bothers me.

197
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,071
Let's go see the ocean.

198
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,199
The real ocean this time.

199
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,683
A weakness.

200
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,227
That's Kangoh Tech One's current status.

201
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,440
In the long run,
it'll bring more losses than gains.

202
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,068
Abandoning it is right.

203
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,446
This is my chance to get rid
of something that drains energy

204
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,073
and go all in with the center.

205
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:02,748
Kangoh's future can be secured
with the Co-Prosperity Cooperation Center.

206
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,755
It will complete the Royal Road.

207
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,640
The most urgent matter at hand

208
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,643
is the insufficient funding
for the construction.

209
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:28,649
If the sale goes my way,
some of the frozen capital will recover.

210
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:41,203
We must bet everything
and support Kang Inha in this negotiation.

211
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,497
The reason I trust Kang Inha with this

212
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,749
is because of you.

213
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:47,835
Chief Manager Kang Inha

214
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,420
will be able to get you

215
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,048
the results you're hoping for.

216
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,821
There won't be any requests for a while.

217
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,489
Keep a low profile.

218
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,951
Are you scared an angry Kang Seongju
might come for me?

219
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,291
He's not just angry,
he's seething.

220
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,252
Being careful won't hurt.

221
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:33,046
Are you underestimating
Lazarus Special Forces Kim Gwangil?

222
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,215
Do you want to keep living as Seonu Wan?

223
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:36,758
Then listen to me.

224
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,179
I'm Kim Gwangil, a top spy
of the Reconnaissance General Bureau

225
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,139
who once manipulated banks worldwide.

226
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,390
And I still got it.

227
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,766
This is South Korea.

228
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,310
You were born in North Korea.

229
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:49,479
This isn't the same country
you showed your talent in.

230
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,190
Nothing is guaranteed here.

231
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,067
Why are you so worried
about others lately, Mr. Han?

232
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:57,654
Kang Seongju won't find out about
your involvement if he catches me.

233
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:58,906
No problem.

234
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,450
You should be careful.

235
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:05,329
Don't get caught by Kang Seongju
and drag me into it.

236
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:06,955
Of course.

237
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,208
No problem.

238
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,324
Don't you think

239
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,369
these conditions
are enough to get married?

240
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,859
Let's get married.

241
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,650
I'm marrying Hyewon.

242
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,986
You're the first person I told.

243
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,850
Congrats.

244
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:33,143
HAN TAEOH

245
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,731
What did you just say?

246
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,192
Who will take over
the sales of Kangoh Tech One?

247
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:26,113
Wait.

248
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:29,783
- I'm leading the negotiating team?
- This is your first performance test.

249
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,244
As your first test,

250
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,081
you must solve using standard tactics
without any tricks or deceit.

251
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,668
That's how you'll be recognized
by everyone.

252
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:42,003
I'll do whatever I can
to fulfill his wishes.

253
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:47,008
The main character here
isn't Kangoh or the chairman,

254
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,094
it's you and only you.

255
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:53,557
Everyone will have their eyes on you,
waiting for you to mess up.

256
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:56,309
And...

257
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,062
waiting for you to fail.

258
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,481
I already feel naked.

259
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:04,067
Many people will try to do so
and get disappointed

260
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,987
because you will succeed.

261
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,532
I have to.

262
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,202
I will.

263
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,835
Looks good.

264
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:23,837
Thank you.

265
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,005
My pleasure.

266
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,718
KO HUICHAN

267
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:34,806
I knew it.

268
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,142
You were ignoring my calls.

269
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,187
What brings you here?

270
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,773
A personal delivery service.

271
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,402
Completely unnecessary service.

272
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,031
Come on.

273
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,991
Let's try to make this work.

274
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,494
Just hang out with your own kind.

275
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,537
- This isn't like you.
- What can I do?

276
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,165
My parents want to set
our engagement date.

277
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:03,168
You tell me you hate me.
What am I supposed to do?

278
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,467
Ko Huichan.

279
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,930
Meet someone better than me.
You have a lot of choices.

280
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,681
Just pick one of your many.

281
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:20,519
My old man says it has to be you.

282
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,395
You try convincing him otherwise.

283
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,482
Why would I have to do that?

284
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:29,611
- You take care of your father.
- What you say really excites me.

285
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,159
Do you love me?

286
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,704
You don't.

287
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,256
I haven't answered yet.

288
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,676
I didn't answer you yet!

289
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:01,268
DAEJONG INNOVATION CEO
VICE PRESIDENT KO SUCHAN

290
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,771
The team leader
for negotiations for Daejong

291
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:06,523
will be Vice President Ko Suchan.

292
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,567
Unlike your father,

293
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,236
he's known to be rational and reasonable.

294
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,531
I met him once before in the past.

295
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,951
He didn't speak much,
so it made me uncomfortable.

296
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:20,954
I couldn't read him.

297
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,748
He could be simpler than you think.

298
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,960
He was a math prodigy,
and even though he was the heir,

299
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,837
he majored in math
which was unprecedented.

300
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:33,592
When it comes to numbers,
he's so sensitive it's like he has OCD.

301
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,263
How much needs to be spent,
how much can be earned,

302
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:42,183
and on top of that, how much needs
to be multiplied to earn more.

303
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,854
Make it fall into place perfectly,

304
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:49,190
like this? Boom.

305
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:54,237
You'll have to look at this negotiation
as a mathematical formula.

306
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:58,491
Whatever the case may be,
we just need to prepare our hand.

307
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,619
Either way,

308
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,079
we're all gathering to fight
over numbers for profit.

309
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:06,916
They're here.

310
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:16,217
Welcome!
Hello.

311
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,262
We have been ordered to support
the negotiating team!

312
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,430
Here are some slippers.

313
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,976
This way.

314
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:27,979
Oh, no.

315
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,397
Mistake.

316
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,192
Sorry. I forgot to tell you.

317
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:34,611
They will be joining our team.

318
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:37,238
Mr. Jeong. Manager Jeong Dongmyeong.

319
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,742
Beside him is Ms. Ma.
Assistant Manager Ma Jui.

320
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,119
Hello!

321
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,496
Hello.

322
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,502
Mr. Kang? A word.

323
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:57,717
Put your things down and rest.

324
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,437
You should have at least told me

325
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,439
who would be joining the team.

326
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,567
They're my best partners.

327
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,654
I trust them the most after you.

328
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,617
Relax.

329
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,161
I bet they're scared
that something's wrong.

330
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,247
Let's go.

331
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,794
Now.

332
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,424
Our party leader will stay in Yeouido
to prepare for the conference.

333
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,593
Let me know if anything urgent comes up.

334
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,803
Yes, sir.

335
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,138
Ah.

336
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:44,222
Enjoy your lunch.

337
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,600
- Great job.
- Great work.

338
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,114
I know a great ramyun place.

339
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:02,866
Do you like ramyun?

340
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,302
You're here. Hi.

341
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,429
Add some rice cakes.

342
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:26,931
Be careful with the eggs, okay?

343
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:29,893
Mmm. She must be important.

344
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,520
- You want me to be careful.
- That's right.

345
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,731
It'll be out in 10 minutes.

346
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,193
Take a seat.

347
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,246
Were you surprised
when I asked you to have lunch?

348
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,082
To be honest, yes.

349
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,127
I'll get to the point.

350
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,671
Do you want to work as an aide?

351
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,133
Sitting at a desk looking through papers
as a secretary

352
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,385
is no fun, is it?

353
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,932
Can I ask you why?

354
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,603
Here.

355
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,573
Did you investigate me?

356
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,661
Me investigate you?

357
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,248
What for? I investigated Kang Inha.

358
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,709
Don't act so surprised.

359
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,755
Investigating things
take up half of my duties. You know that.

360
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,342
I want to turn you

361
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,804
into a competent political aide.

362
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:51,099
Because you think I have
a close relationship with Kang Inha?

363
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:53,434
I can't say no.

364
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,940
But the remaining 70%
is because I need your skills.

365
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:01,276
- Does the congressman want this?
- No, I do.

366
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,694
This is 100%.

367
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:06,114
Ah. But...

368
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,075
do you know what's interesting?

369
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:13,580
The congressman doesn't know
about this at all.

370
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,959
- If so...
- It will be my personal investment

371
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,711
in you, Na Hyewon.

372
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,883
Shall I cancel the ramyun?

373
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,971
No. It's been a while since I had some.

374
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,473
Okay.

375
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:36,144
You'll fall in love
with the taste!

376
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,021
I guarantee it.

377
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,364
Yeah, leave it here.

378
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:41,000
This isn't a fairy tale,
and there's no happily ever after.

379
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,378
You should've stopped
the princess act by now!

380
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,589
It's a crime if it's forced.

381
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,425
Don't drag me into your fairy tale.

382
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,020
- Huiju.

383
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,940
Your job isn't to protect me.
It's to protect yourself.

384
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,250
An aide?

385
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,335
Oh Gyeongcheol asked you?

386
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,713
Isn't that funny?

387
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,008
- Think about it.
- Do you mean it?

388
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,844
We only considered Congressman Jo
and not Oh Gyeongcheol.

389
00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:36,597
- He's the one that made Jo Sundong.
- Will you try to raise Oh Gyeongcheol?

390
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,182
I could raise you.

391
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:40,810
You?

392
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,104
I mean it. Think about it.

393
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,690
Of course,
I could do it better than anyone.

394
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,026
I know that all too well.

395
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:51,237
I know too. That's why I said it.

396
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,321
Exactly.

397
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:56,492
I'll do it on my own.
I'll rise up on my own too.

398
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,121
I don't need your help.

399
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,750
Good for you.

400
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:28,858
And the date?

401
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:30,693
Not decided yet.

402
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,865
I'm tired. Are you going to stay?

403
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:38,117
I'm heading out.

404
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,830
Congratulations.

405
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,412
DELETE IMAGE

406
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,750
DELETE ALL IMAGES ON CARD

407
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:32,213
DELETING, PLEASE WAIT

408
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,228
Back then...

409
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,611
...if it were you and not Inha.

410
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,240
Back then...

411
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,701
Don't go.

412
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,789
We don't mean anything to one another.

413
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:10,459
What if I was wrong?

414
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,229
It doesn't change anything.

415
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:11,270
Ko Huichan will be leading the
negotiations for Daejong, not Ko Suchan.

416
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,651
It's Ko Huichan and not Ko Suchan?

417
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,861
Yes, sir.

418
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,202
I don't care who it is.

419
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,039
I wish they both sink down.

420
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,542
It won't change anything, will it?

421
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:37,213
It's Ko Huichan.

422
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,923
The helpless moron, Ko Huichan.

423
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,719
I'm surprised too.

424
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:49,725
Either way, we're not up against
Ko Huichan or Ko Suchan.

425
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,811
It's Daejong.

426
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:55,273
The negotiation concept can change
depending on who's leading it.

427
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:57,733
The basic elements of a sale
is the buyer and the seller,

428
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,820
and the price set by both parties.

429
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,740
When it comes to that,
has anything changed?

430
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,702
Nothing.

431
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,413
Even if there's a problem
with our strategy,

432
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,374
it's a problem that we can overcome.

433
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:17,169
It's one of the most trivial matters
we need to win.

434
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,719
It's time. Let's go.

435
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,107
MANAGER JEONG DONGMYEONG

436
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,111
Yes, Mr. Kang.

437
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,262
Sir, it's not too late.

438
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,182
There's no reason to spend a lot of money
on a weakness.

439
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,475
Who doesn't know that?

440
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,227
What do you want me to do now?

441
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,437
You're right.

442
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,315
You should've convinced my father
a lot sooner.

443
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:22,485
How many times did I tell you?

444
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,780
We should have gone all in
on the real estate business.

445
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,909
What even is Kangoh Tech One?

446
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,537
Will you try to make AI weapons
and sell them?

447
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:00,356
ONE HOUR LATER

448
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:07,988
From the price offered,

449
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,367
Fifteen percent down
and no employment succession.

450
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,786
Are you here to buy gum?

451
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,373
Don't you know Daejong started
as a confectionary business?

452
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,501
There's gum everywhere.
Why would I buy gum?

453
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,920
Now that I hear it, you're right.

454
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,256
Twenty percent down.

455
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:30,052
Kangoh Tech One holds more than 50 patents
for the helicopters it produces.

456
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,973
Also, we completed the difficult task
of localizing unmanned drones.

457
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:36,600
Then 25% down would be difficult.

458
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,063
But what can we do?
Those who are thirsty should dig a well.

459
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,986
You weren't interested
in Kangoh Tech One to begin with.

460
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,154
Why say that?

461
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:51,365
I'll be blunt,
it's good for us to buy it cheap.

462
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,120
That is very blunt.

463
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,959
Thirty percent down.

464
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,927
Live up to Kangoh's name and play hard.

465
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,471
No employment succession.

466
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,868
I'm getting tired
of the lack of progress.

467
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,412
What do you think, Mr. Han?

468
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,083
We haven't reached an agreement
and we're circling, so I feel the same.

469
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,711
How about we resume after lunch?

470
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,129
We can cool down a little.

471
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,341
Mr. Kang?

472
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,594
- Sure.
- Sounds good to me.

473
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:56,889
Then let's resume the meeting
after 60 minutes.

474
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:11,403
Daejong wants no employment succession
with a price cut of 30%.

475
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,826
I can't believe Ko Huichan. That moron.

476
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:31,799
Do you have something to say?

477
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:35,094
You got a text during the meeting
and I'm curious about it.

478
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:38,847
It was personal. It was from a friend.

479
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,350
I see.

480
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,811
- Why do you ask?
- Why...

481
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,272
do I ask?

482
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:50,985
I'm sure you know that Kangoh Tech One
is the biggest issue within the group.

483
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,112
I'm sure you're aware

484
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:57,449
today's meeting is important
and Kangoh's reputation depends on it.

485
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:58,993
Of course, Mr. Han.

486
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:02,371
But you exchanged personal texts
with a friend?

487
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:06,375
And you have the audacity
to ask me why I asked?

488
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,003
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize.

489
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,713
You're not sorry at all.

490
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:15,593
Jeong Dongmyeong.

491
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,554
Go home.

492
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:21,348
I'll let Mr. Kang know.

493
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,408
Do you want something else to eat?

494
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,285
Maybe something different?

495
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:46,040
Did you tell Jeong Dongmyeong to go home?

496
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,794
- Yeah.
- Why?

497
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:54,256
It was an important meeting
with representatives from both groups.

498
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,178
Is it possible for him
to text a friend during it?

499
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,680
It's not possible

500
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,224
and it can never be possible,

501
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,893
but he was doing it.

502
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,270
If it were me,
I wouldn't have just let him go home.

503
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,689
So you went easy on him
because he's one of mine?

504
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:13,859
It means I don't have the authority
to do more than that.

505
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:17,446
Oh. Yeah.

506
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,198
That's true.

507
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:22,534
I have the authority to make
all the decisions in this sale.

508
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:25,537
That includes...

509
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:29,333
the rights to disciplinary action
related to meetings.

510
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,380
I'm hungry.

511
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,341
My sugar levels are dropping.

512
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,472
I've decided...

513
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:47,476
to do the time leap.

514
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:51,563
Time leap.

515
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,148
Time leap?

516
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:56,694
I'm saying we should go back in time
like they do in movies.

517
00:44:57,361 --> 00:45:00,197
Simply put,
back to the time when IM wanted

518
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,033
- Kangoh Tech One's technology.
- You want to manipulate it?

519
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:05,035
Those extreme expressions

520
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,162
can be avoided between us.

521
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,706
No matter how you express it,

522
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,833
it's nothing more or less
than a manipulation.

523
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,502
Okay.

524
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,296
Then let's call it a manipulation.

525
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:20,092
Fortunately,
it was kept a secret last year.

526
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,511
No one on the outside knows.

527
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:29,268
As a result, it made things much easier.

528
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:31,979
- What are you going to do?
- IM deserves a chance

529
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,647
to pay off their debt to us.

530
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,154
You want to use IM
to leak false information to Daejong?

531
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,280
- Yeah.
- Inha.

532
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:44,324
We're not breaking the law
and it's not cheating.

533
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:48,454
The fact that it was canceled last year
is the only part we're leaving out.

534
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,040
I'm just going to leak a few points
to Daejong.

535
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,877
This isn't a lie. It's a tactic.

536
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:58,464
You do the strategy.

537
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:02,092
I'll do the tactics.

538
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:06,764
Don't worry, man. Okay?

539
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,517
IM's CEO specializes in these tricks.

540
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:15,355
Playing fair is the key to gaining support
from shareholders and board members.

541
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:20,360
Taeoh, you're so one-sided.

542
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,365
The shareholders and board members,

543
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,494
none of them actually care

544
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:31,121
about playing fair.

545
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,540
They care about the result.

546
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,753
Whatever fills their pockets...

547
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,214
is a happy ending.

548
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,674
Whatever doesn't fill their pockets...

549
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:45,302
is a sad ending.

550
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:52,518
I know you're feeling desperate.
I feel the same.

551
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,479
I could be more desperate
than you. Still...

552
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:58,023
I won't tolerate going down
the wrong path.

553
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:02,236
The time leap you're talking about...

554
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,321
doesn't exist.

555
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,244
I told you it wasn't the right path.
Still?

556
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,455
I prepared it alone with difficulty.
I knew you would scold me.

557
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:19,711
Are you mad?

558
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,590
What will you give in return?

559
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:25,759
What do you mean?

560
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,139
There's no such thing as a quid pro quo.

561
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:33,767
A price.

562
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,229
Nothing?

563
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:42,734
- Really?
- Currently in Germany,

564
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,904
IM has entered the initial stages
of tech collaborations with Eugen.

565
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:48,740
As for Eugen,

566
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:53,704
they've agreed to keep quiet
about last year's tech leak.

567
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,373
That's all.

568
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,510
You should've just offered something.

569
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,596
What?

570
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:14,433
Exploiting an opponent's weakness
through threats brings more issues. You...

571
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,856
You picked the worst choice for a trick.

572
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,941
Whether it'll be evil or good...

573
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,695
the results will tell us.

574
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,455
What's the matter?

575
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:39,958
What?

576
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,016
Anyway...

577
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,584
Seriously, you punks...

578
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,753
What's your real deal?

579
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,679
An evaluation report from the Chinese
company IM stated that developing

580
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,138
30 MINUTES AGO

581
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:36,682
state-of-the-art vertical takeoff drones

582
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:39,977
would be possible with the K200GF9 patent
held by Kangoh Tech One.

583
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,981
IM wouldn't have written the report
for no reason.

584
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,901
I'm sure there was a clear reason for it.

585
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:52,197
Do you think they'll try
to buy Kangoh Tech One?

586
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,408
If IM aggressively jumps into this...

587
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,327
Everyone in China will try to jump in
with money.

588
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:01,123
If that happens, Kangoh Tech One's value
will quadruple.

589
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,169
Who knows?
Raising the stakes could've already begun.

590
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,468
I don't think it'll be easy
to make a decision.

591
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:17,931
How about we all take a chance
to review and reconsider?

592
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:21,143
If it's according to your prediction,

593
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:25,605
they could have us and IM on opposite ends
of the scale to buy time...

594
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:28,650
We'll buy it,

595
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:33,280
cut it into bite-sized pieces,
and release it in the Chinese market.

596
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,242
Or we can put up the entire thing too.

597
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,329
Why would we review it again?

598
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:43,790
Our difference in opinions--

599
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,795
You must tell us
exactly what Kangoh wants.

600
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:51,673
That's the only way
we can give our opinions.

601
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,348
A price increase of 13%.

602
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,145
Conditions for employment succession
on top of that.

603
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:11,985
KANGOH RESORT CEO, KANG INJU

604
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:15,447
Look at them.

605
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:21,078
Did I send you there for this?

606
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,163
I'm sorry.

607
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,665
A 13% price increase
and employment succession?

608
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:29,252
Success through lies and tricks
is just half a success!

609
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:32,339
While Chief Manager Kang devoted himself
to half a success,

610
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,757
what were you doing?

611
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,260
If you must punish someone, punish me.
Mr. Han did nothing wrong.

612
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:40,180
Are you saying it's all your fault?

613
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,182
That's right.

614
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:46,436
If that's the case,
tell me what you did wrong.

615
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:49,397
- It wasn't a legitimate--
- That's enough!

616
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,486
You have no idea what you did wrong.

617
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:57,239
- I'm sorry.
- How are you sorry

618
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,616
when you can't even grasp
what you did wrong?

619
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,161
Because your tricks tarnished
this success?

620
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:06,748
Or is there something else I don't know?

621
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:07,833
No, sir.

622
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,960
There's nothing you don't know.

623
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,675
Listen carefully to what I say.

624
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:21,429
Deceit and tricks are tools
that can be taken out when needed.

625
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:25,851
A tarnished success is still a success.
A good end is still good after all.

626
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:29,688
Of course, as Kang Joongmo's son,
you're the exception.

627
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,941
There are matters
we don't handle ourselves.

628
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:35,360
There are others who take care of it,

629
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,238
and we have someone for that.

630
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,741
They exist for that purpose!

631
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:42,826
But, you!

632
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:45,453
You don't even consider using them
for your needs!

633
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,122
This is why!

634
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,167
It's all your fault!

635
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:55,839
The arrogance of thinking
you could do something by yourself!

636
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,049
It's the absolute worst!

637
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:02,470
Exploiting an opponent's weakness
through threats brings more issues. You...

638
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:06,600
You picked the worst choice for a trick.

639
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:11,396
You weren't aware of the stinky filth

640
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:14,524
as you smothered it all over your hands.

641
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:19,613
How dare you consider
coming into Bisunjae covered in filth.

642
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,574
Leave.

643
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,284
Yes, sir.

644
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:27,913
You stay.

645
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,833
I'll see you at dinner on Saturday.

646
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,962
Yes, sir.

647
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,029
In the end,

648
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:05,575
you didn't have
any expectations from me...

649
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:07,994
Father.

650
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,586
Hello?

651
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:21,466
If by chance there's a legal problem,

652
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,094
you will take responsibility.

653
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:26,930
Yes, sir.

654
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,641
Kang Joongmo's third son
suddenly appeared.

655
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,434
There are many watching.

656
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:35,063
The shareholders and board members
are all watching closely.

657
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,773
During this important time,

658
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:39,401
there can be nothing controversial.

659
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:44,364
That will become a stain on me,
Kang Joongmo, and Kangoh.

660
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,866
If this happens again...

661
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:47,951
Never again.

662
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,162
It will never happen again.

663
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,623
Kang Inha.

664
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,419
He takes after me.

665
00:54:58,670 --> 00:54:59,671
That's why

666
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,590
his methods are the same as mine.

667
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:03,842
That's not what I want.

668
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,636
I want someone who's different from me.

669
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:09,639
That's how he'll be useful
in the right place.

670
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:13,059
If he's like me,
I have no reason to keep him by my side.

671
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,228
Tell him yourself.

672
00:55:17,772 --> 00:55:19,858
Tell him that he's just like you.

673
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,652
Didn't you say that yourself?

674
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:26,573
If you do that,
he'll be able to figure out...

675
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,076
exactly what you want.

676
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,129
Before the contracts are signed,

677
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:45,091
you make sure this doesn't leak outside
the negotiation team.

678
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,428
Keep it quiet.

679
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,723
Director Ko is here.

680
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:35,266
- Really?
- Yes.

681
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,355
I heard you made a big deal.

682
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:45,318
Then you should throw a party.
Why are you drinking alone?

683
00:56:49,531 --> 00:56:51,324
I came to have a drink with you.

684
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,910
And I had a favor to ask.

685
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,121
You do?

686
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:58,957
It's about Kang Huiju.

687
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,917
Your little sister.

688
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,628
Why does she hate me so much?

689
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:07,757
You had me there.

690
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,010
I'm serious.

691
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:15,306
My dad won't give me communication rights
if I don't marry her.

692
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:19,978
If you do a favor for me.
I'll support you and Huiju's marriage.

693
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:22,397
Say the word.

694
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:24,816
I'll do whatever you want.

695
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:34,826
What about murder?

696
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:39,539
What do you think you're doing?

697
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,211
I'm just kidding, man. Don't be scared.

698
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,507
Hey, Honggyu! Bring more alcohol!

699
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,259
Drink up.

700
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:15,742
Are you stalking me?

701
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,368
You didn't pick up.

702
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:19,537
I knew you'd be here.

703
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,208
I can read you like a book.

704
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,260
Here.

705
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,930
Come on.

706
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:52,904
That felt emotional.

707
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:55,073
You're crazy.

708
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,420
The chairman called me.

709
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,005
He wants to meet.

710
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,342
Is it a good sign?

711
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:16,427
Go see him.

712
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:23,935
Bye.

713
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,076
RECENTS

714
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:38,301
HAN TAEOH

715
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,136
