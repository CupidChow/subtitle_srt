Did you forget that EF Tower 
wouldn't exist without my family?

10
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,922
Give back the center 
you stole from my son.

11
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:52,224
Is the center Seongju's weapon or yours?

12
00:01:52,307 --> 00:01:55,313
If not both, is that what your brother, 
Jang Noik, wants?

Did you really try to deceive me

You should've been prepared for this

20
00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:19,153

Well, you're not an angel either.

24
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:32,179

return the center back to Seongju!

You can't expose my connection 
with Congressman Jo

35
00:03:25,786 --> 00:03:28,374
because you're afraid 
you'll tarnish Kangoh's image.

36
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,380
But not me! 
I don't care about Kangoh's image!

I will do anything for my son!

No, let me be more honest.

There's nothing I won't do for myself.

40

I wanted to bring you down myself,

who wanted to do the same.

Then you come here 
and to try to make a deal with that lie?

Unfortunately, it's not me.

You all know he has a heart condition.

more than anything right now.

00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,702
He asked me to tell you

139
00:11:26,037 --> 00:11:27,708
to all leave.

That rude bastard.

142
00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:35,932
He should tell us himself.

143
00:11:36,767 --> 00:11:38,897
How dare he make a mere secretary tell us?

144
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:42,445
[Geumseok] If that's what the doctor 
suggested, we should listen to him.

145
00:11:43,196 --> 00:11:46,411
Let's do what the doctor said 
and let your father rest.

146

-Let's go. 
-[Geumseok] Okay.

What are you doing? Let's go.

148
00:12:12,673 --> 00:12:15,260
We should go too. 
There's nothing for us to do here.

149
00:12:22,316 --> 00:12:24,195
You're not like us.

-What about you? 
-I have to get back to the art center.

Don't be too late.

153
00:13:09,494 --> 00:13:12,291

than you may think.

-Mom. 
-[Geumseok] Just so you know,

the details of the wedding soon.

Father collapsed.

157
00:13:21,142 --> 00:13:23,230
And that's why we must hurry.

158
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:26,194

Damn it.

163
00:13:50,577 --> 00:13:53,206
Father could've given us a warning 
before collapsing.

164
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:57,924
At least pretend you're worried.

were on my side at times like this.

Just buy him.

Do you think he's you?

People are all the same. 
Do you think he'll be any different?

172
00:14:18,173 --> 00:14:19,927
Shut up already! [clicks tongue]

173
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:25,688
Then... how about using Huiju?

174
00:14:25,772 --> 00:14:27,651
What's with you today? Are you crazy?

175
00:14:28,318 --> 00:14:30,573
-Why would you bring that brat up? 
-Who knows?

176
00:14:31,074 --> 00:14:32,619
She could be the answer.

177
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:34,873
What if Huiju

178
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,877
-and Han Taeoh-- 
-Do you want a divorce?

179
00:14:37,545 --> 00:14:38,547
Eyes up front.

180
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:42,597
Hey, turn on some exciting music.

181
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,766
Yes, sir.

182
00:14:47,272 --> 00:14:49,068
Other than Chu Hyeokjin and us...

183
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:54,871
who else do you think knows 
about Milton and Father?

184
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:59,046
I'm sure it's someone on the inside.

185
00:15:00,298 --> 00:15:03,013
-An insider? 
-Someone close to your father,

186
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:04,098
or an enemy.

187
00:15:04,599 --> 00:15:08,481
[sighs] We have to find out 
who it is immediately.

188
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:10,402
And do what?

189
00:15:10,987 --> 00:15:14,326
Will you thank them for taking care 
of the dirty work for us?

190
00:15:14,995 --> 00:15:16,957
Forget about those useless thoughts.

191
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,005
Take the opportunity 
when it presents itself.

192
00:15:20,464 --> 00:15:21,717
What will you do?

193
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,184
We must prepare an emergency meeting 
with the key executives of the group.

194
00:15:26,727 --> 00:15:28,689
Don't you think we should get to work

195
00:15:28,814 --> 00:15:31,444
to make it rewarding 
for our anonymous informant?

196
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:44,220
[Taeoh sighs quietly]

197
00:15:44,303 --> 00:15:45,388
[cell phone vibrates]

198
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:51,527
KANG INHA

199
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:54,658
[Inha] Come out. 
I just got to the hospital.

200
00:16:06,305 --> 00:16:08,017
The chairman is still unconscious.

201
00:16:08,769 --> 00:16:09,980
Director In says that...

202
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,571
he can't guarantee anything right now.

203
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:16,033
You told me to trust you.

204
00:16:17,494 --> 00:16:18,831
Is that still valid?

205
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:26,179
Or...

206
00:16:28,266 --> 00:16:30,938
-is it over for us? 
-That won't ever happen.

207
00:16:31,063 --> 00:16:32,859
Keep your word!

208
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:36,449
Or we all go under for this.

209
00:16:37,744 --> 00:16:39,205
I know what you're scared of.

210
00:16:39,288 --> 00:16:41,835
-I know... 
-What I'm scared of isn't important.

211
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,087
It's important to me.

212
00:16:44,549 --> 00:16:47,889
If you start to waver, our plan crumbles.

213
00:16:52,064 --> 00:16:53,984
Trust me and wait, no matter what.

214
00:16:55,403 --> 00:16:56,823
I'm asking as a favor.

215
00:16:56,907 --> 00:16:59,537
Let's be honest. 
There's no other way besides that.

216
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,671
I'll wait. No...

217
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:08,346
I'll try to wait.

218
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:23,293
[cell phone vibrating]

219
00:17:25,715 --> 00:17:27,844
PRESIDENT KANG INJU'S SECRETARY

220
00:17:29,388 --> 00:17:30,473
Hello?

221
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:32,729
[man] President Kang Inju 
would like to see you.

222
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,152
[Inju sighs]

223
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,422
How's this place?

224
00:17:56,610 --> 00:17:57,654
It's nice.

225
00:17:59,198 --> 00:18:00,951
You can move in today if you want.

226
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:03,039
I'm saying you can have it.

227
00:18:03,414 --> 00:18:06,505
Is it expensive? I won't be able 
to afford it in this lifetime.

228
00:18:06,588 --> 00:18:08,132
This is suitable for you.

229
00:18:10,554 --> 00:18:11,640
It's quite desirable.

230
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,399
However, it seems like 
you didn't do your research.

231
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:25,500
You live in a tiny studio apartment 
that you don't even own.

232
00:18:25,584 --> 00:18:27,337
Do you want me to be your person?

233
00:18:28,214 --> 00:18:29,216
What if I do?

234
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:32,264
-[inhales sharply] I thought you hated me. 
-I do.

235
00:18:33,474 --> 00:18:35,478
But you're desirable.

236
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:37,315
Are you trying to acquire me

237
00:18:38,276 --> 00:18:39,612
in case the chairman dies?

238
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,535
-Can I not? 
-The chairman is still alive.

239
00:18:43,161 --> 00:18:44,539
I know that.

240
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:47,002
-I do... 
-[Taeoh] If you really wanted me,

241
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:50,300
you should've brought something bigger 
than this house.

242
00:18:55,477 --> 00:18:56,688
Something bigger...

243
00:19:01,197 --> 00:19:02,282
[grunts softly]

244
00:19:07,417 --> 00:19:08,670
Tell me what you want.

245
00:19:24,786 --> 00:19:26,413
-[Inha yells] 
-[cell phone clatters]

246
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,173
Why now?

247
00:19:34,639 --> 00:19:36,560
Everything you have

248
00:19:37,227 --> 00:19:38,772
should be enough

249
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:42,404
to make me want to become your person.

250
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:43,532
[scoffs]

251
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,709
[exclaims softly]

252
00:19:50,211 --> 00:19:51,506
You're out of your mind.

253
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,096
I'd have to be 
to consider working for you.

254
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:13,759
[door opens]

255
00:20:15,094 --> 00:20:17,057
-[door closes] 
-[sighs]

256
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,979
MO KIJOON

257
00:20:23,235 --> 00:20:24,237
Where are you?

258
00:20:25,198 --> 00:20:26,200
Come up.

259
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:28,538
Come up here right now, you asshole!

260
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,472
[elevator dings]

261
00:20:53,672 --> 00:20:55,216
-[whacking] 
-[Inju exclaims]

262
00:20:57,137 --> 00:20:58,347
[yells]

263
00:20:58,431 --> 00:20:59,433
Oh!

264
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:03,900
I'm the one hitting you, and I'm tired! 
Hey, does that hurt?

265
00:21:06,573 --> 00:21:08,451
-No, sir. 
-That's right.

266
00:21:08,535 --> 00:21:11,457
I told you. I'm hitting you, 
but I'm the one dying here.

267
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,419
Yes, sir.

268
00:21:14,129 --> 00:21:15,131
Starting tomorrow,

269
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:17,636
have someone follow Han Taeoh.

270
00:21:20,266 --> 00:21:21,268
No, wait.

271
00:21:23,355 --> 00:21:25,026
I can only trust you.

272
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:27,698
You do it.

273
00:21:27,865 --> 00:21:31,539
Don't eat or sleep. 
Watch him closely, okay?

274
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,960
Yes, sir.

275
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:36,465
[clatters]

276
00:21:37,635 --> 00:21:38,637
[sighs]

277
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,024
What are you looking at? Get out.

278
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:53,667
[door opens]

279
00:21:54,877 --> 00:21:56,088
-[exhales] 
-[door closes]

280
00:21:56,171 --> 00:21:57,173
[sighs]

281
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:00,263
If he's a human being,

282
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:03,937
I'm sure we're bound 
to find something he's hiding

283
00:22:04,564 --> 00:22:06,191
if we look hard enough.

284
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,782
-[sirens wailing in distance] 
-[footsteps approaching]

285
00:22:24,896 --> 00:22:27,025
The situation is bad, 
yet you seem relaxed.

286
00:22:27,317 --> 00:22:29,989
You and Inha aren't the only ones 
who need comfort.

287
00:22:30,198 --> 00:22:31,993
I need to be comforted too.

288
00:22:33,454 --> 00:22:38,005
You're not expecting that comfort 
to come from me, are you?

289
00:22:40,594 --> 00:22:42,430
I can't afford that right now.

290
00:22:44,017 --> 00:22:45,520
Chairman Kang has collapsed.

291
00:22:45,604 --> 00:22:49,444
Kang Seongju will seize the chance to rise 
while carrying his mom.

292
00:22:50,154 --> 00:22:52,158
What can we do in a situation like this?

293
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:57,753
Wait.

294
00:22:59,047 --> 00:23:00,884
That's not the answer I wanted.

295
00:23:02,011 --> 00:23:04,850
At the very least, 
you should have the answer.

296
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:07,146
You say not to expect comfort from you...

297
00:23:08,984 --> 00:23:10,444
but you want answers from me.

298
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,367
You said to trust you.

299
00:23:14,202 --> 00:23:16,541
Then shouldn't you have all the answers?

300
00:23:16,624 --> 00:23:19,797
Kang Inha is the only person 
who can demand anything from me.

301
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,012
What if I become...

302
00:23:24,222 --> 00:23:26,561
someone who can demand things 
from you soon?

303
00:23:28,898 --> 00:23:29,900
Soon?

304
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,492
Marriage?

305
00:23:34,994 --> 00:23:37,123
Why does that sound like 
a full stop to me?

306
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,461
As if your ultimate goal...

307
00:23:40,922 --> 00:23:42,300
was always getting married.

308
00:23:43,553 --> 00:23:44,722
But it's not, is it?

309
00:23:45,347 --> 00:23:47,978
Are you trying to interfere 
with my view on life now?

310
00:23:48,312 --> 00:23:49,314
Fine.

311
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:51,861
Let's say that's your ultimate goal.

312
00:23:52,613 --> 00:23:54,324
Then instead of looking so angry,

313
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:56,119
shouldn't you use your head...

314
00:23:56,203 --> 00:23:57,205
[scoffs]

315
00:23:57,288 --> 00:23:59,835
...to try and find a way 
to overcome this crisis on your own?

316
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,508
Or at least pretend to?

317
00:24:03,383 --> 00:24:04,762
You could put in the effort...

318
00:24:06,014 --> 00:24:07,391
to achieve your goal.

319
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:10,982
That's not advice. You're berating me.

320
00:24:12,193 --> 00:24:13,237
Thanks.

321
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,322
Don't mention it.

322
00:24:47,514 --> 00:24:48,850
[door opens]

323
00:24:57,618 --> 00:24:58,828
I'm here, sir.

324
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:07,345
[tires screeching]

325
00:25:14,652 --> 00:25:16,656
[engine accelerating]

326
00:25:24,838 --> 00:25:26,383
Can I trust you?

327
00:25:29,305 --> 00:25:31,519
[Taeoh] You know my weakness.

328
00:25:36,571 --> 00:25:37,656
If I fail...

329
00:25:37,739 --> 00:25:40,286
I'll expose your weakness.

330
00:25:41,539 --> 00:25:42,624
If I succeed?

331
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:47,300
-Did this work come at a cost? 
-Reward and punishment come as one.

332
00:25:47,383 --> 00:25:50,472
You've never once asked for a reward.

333
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,355
I plan on asking for more from now on.

334
00:25:57,236 --> 00:26:01,077
[Joongmo] Sometimes I think that 
I didn't choose you,

335
00:26:01,787 --> 00:26:03,457
but you chose me.

336
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,879
If that's true...

337
00:26:07,298 --> 00:26:09,845
-why me? 
-I never chose you.

338
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:13,728
I chose my future based on my judgement.

339
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:15,022
Your future?

340
00:26:15,105 --> 00:26:17,527
Yes, my future.

341
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:19,030
[Joongmo] Then answer me.

342
00:26:19,113 --> 00:26:22,036
This dangerous act 
we're performing right now.

343
00:26:22,996 --> 00:26:27,088
Are we doing it for you or for me?

344
00:26:34,018 --> 00:26:35,814
Chu Hyeokjin, you bastard!

345
00:26:40,322 --> 00:26:41,742
Vice President Kang Seongju.

346
00:26:42,744 --> 00:26:46,418
-Tell him to come here now. 
-Will you call him here and punish him?

347
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:47,712
How?

348
00:26:47,796 --> 00:26:50,510
A demotion? Pay cut? 
Will you confine him to his villa?

349
00:26:50,593 --> 00:26:51,846
I won't forgive anyone,

350
00:26:52,263 --> 00:26:54,475
not even you, 
for insulting my son like that.

351
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,398
I'm sure you can let it slide this time. 
And after that?

352
00:26:57,481 --> 00:27:00,112
Can you guarantee 
you can stop him next time?

353
00:27:02,283 --> 00:27:04,036
The question of guarantee.

354
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:07,878
You bring it up because you're confident 
you can handle it.

355
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,466
A one-off approach.

356
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:13,556
It should be finished with a first strike.

357
00:27:14,307 --> 00:27:16,562
Make sure they don't try it a second time.

358
00:27:16,645 --> 00:27:20,027
Eliminate future threats 
that could come after.

359
00:27:20,904 --> 00:27:21,947
I will...

360
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,830
-file a complaint against you. 
-What?

361
00:27:25,914 --> 00:27:27,082
An anonymous source

362
00:27:27,918 --> 00:27:31,592
whistle-blowing the dark connection 
between Milton and you.

363
00:27:32,259 --> 00:27:34,096
We will move one step ahead of them.

364
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,981
Vice President Kang Seongju will never 
be able to raise this problem again.

365
00:27:46,204 --> 00:27:47,958
Who did you have your eye on 
in the prosecution?

366
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,468
Prosecutor Ha Myeongjin.

367
00:27:53,553 --> 00:27:57,059
He used to be a cop 
and has no other connections.

368
00:27:57,936 --> 00:28:00,399
An ex-cop prosecutor with no connections.

369
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:02,862
I bet he's thirsty.

370
00:28:02,946 --> 00:28:04,700
Whether it's a promotion or money...

371
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:06,954
or both.

372
00:28:07,581 --> 00:28:11,004
What's my role in your plan?

373
00:28:11,964 --> 00:28:13,174
Just stay silent.

374
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,807
As if nothing has happened.

375
00:28:17,892 --> 00:28:21,609
As for Milton, 
continue to handle it as usual.

376
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:29,248
Who will benefit more

377
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:32,505
from what we're doing right now? 
You or me?

378
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:34,383
Neither you nor I.

379
00:28:36,054 --> 00:28:37,599
The biggest beneficiary in this...

380
00:28:38,768 --> 00:28:40,479
will be the Royal Road Project.

381
00:28:41,064 --> 00:28:42,901
[laughing]

382
00:28:44,655 --> 00:28:46,449
A wise answer to a silly question.

383
00:28:46,533 --> 00:28:48,078
It was a pointless question.

384
00:28:49,121 --> 00:28:50,415
Tell me what you want.

385
00:28:51,042 --> 00:28:54,090
Like you said, 
a reward should follow success.

386
00:28:55,425 --> 00:28:57,806
When I'm faced with a big crisis...

387
00:28:59,308 --> 00:29:01,354
just lend me a helping hand.

388
00:29:02,231 --> 00:29:03,776
You know how to crack a joke.

389
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:05,112
I mean it.

390
00:29:05,988 --> 00:29:07,909
Just think of it as insurance.

391
00:29:09,746 --> 00:29:10,748
Sure.

392
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:13,546
Now.

393
00:29:15,758 --> 00:29:18,723
Bring out the last piece of the puzzle 
you prepared.

394
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:21,562
Kang Inha.

395
00:29:22,689 --> 00:29:25,277
-Who? 
-The last puzzle piece that I prepared

396
00:29:25,987 --> 00:29:27,281
is your third son.

397
00:29:28,534 --> 00:29:29,828
Is that child

398
00:29:30,955 --> 00:29:32,249
the best you could do?

399
00:29:32,332 --> 00:29:34,170
Someone to become your scapegoat.

400
00:29:34,253 --> 00:29:36,132
Someone to become the devil for you.

401
00:29:36,215 --> 00:29:37,886
That's who you need.

402
00:29:37,969 --> 00:29:41,309
You're desperate 
for someone like that as well.

403
00:29:42,227 --> 00:29:44,983
You speak as if you know 
what I'm thinking.

404
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:46,235
That's your problem.

405
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:49,993
You need someone from your bloodline 
to do what your other two sons can't.

406
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:53,918
He exists, so why not use him?

407
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:58,051
Once you're done with him, toss him out.

408
00:29:59,303 --> 00:30:01,140
He was surplus anyway.

409
00:30:01,224 --> 00:30:05,398
He's someone who can be used 
or discarded when needed.

410
00:30:11,202 --> 00:30:13,707
-[Joongmo] There can't be any setbacks. 
-[Taeoh] Yes, sir.

411
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:16,087
He can't get greedy for Kangoh.

412
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:19,301
[Taeoh] Yes, sir.

413
00:30:20,011 --> 00:30:23,226
Prepare a comprehensive contract 
outlining his role,

414
00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:25,397
and specifying what he can and cannot do.

415
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,278
Include every detail, and bring it to me.

416
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:29,739
Do it yourself.

417
00:30:30,323 --> 00:30:32,452
-Yes, sir. 
-As soon as it's ready...

418
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:36,419
bring him to me.

419
00:30:38,591 --> 00:30:39,593
Yes, sir.

420
00:30:51,032 --> 00:30:52,744
[Donguk] When you say you need me,

421
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:56,500
is it you or Kang Joongmo?

422
00:30:58,129 --> 00:31:00,258
[inhales sharply] Does it matter?

423
00:31:00,342 --> 00:31:01,427
Of course.

424
00:31:03,056 --> 00:31:04,517
What I want...

425
00:31:06,103 --> 00:31:08,232
isn't a dog like you. I want the owner.

426
00:31:09,527 --> 00:31:12,909
The dog has a new owner.

427
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,002
You don't need to look at me like that.

428
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:21,843
Either way, 
you're the one that's expendable.

429
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:27,145
[cell phone vibrating]

430
00:31:29,066 --> 00:31:30,820
NA HYEWON

431
00:31:32,072 --> 00:31:34,619
-Kang Seongju just-- 
-[Hyewon] Inha disappeared.

432
00:31:42,426 --> 00:31:45,390
His phone is off, 
and he took some time off from work.

433
00:31:46,225 --> 00:31:48,187
I came to his place, but he's not home.

434
00:31:49,899 --> 00:31:51,945
I don't know where he went.

435
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,035
That...

436
00:32:16,912 --> 00:32:17,914
I've seen it before.

437
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:21,838
-I'll bring him back. 
-I'll go too.

438
00:32:21,922 --> 00:32:24,301
Stay here. Nothing will happen.

439
00:32:32,693 --> 00:32:35,490
[door opens and closes]

440
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,582
[waves splashing]

441
00:33:10,686 --> 00:33:11,688
[young Inha] Mom.

442
00:33:50,348 --> 00:33:51,350
You're here.

443
00:33:51,893 --> 00:33:55,024
Don't leave the headquarters 
for the time being.

444
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:58,824
Can't you handle Kangoh Securities 
at headquarters?

445
00:33:59,408 --> 00:34:02,999
I plan on doing just that. 
Since we're in a state of emergency,

446
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,211
I'll take care 
of the urgent matters first.

447
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:09,554
You need to be swift 
so your father can recover in peace.

448
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:11,808
[Inju] Hey, Seongju!

449
00:34:13,895 --> 00:34:15,356
Why would you stay at headquarters?

450
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,442
[scoffs]

451
00:34:17,068 --> 00:34:20,366
With the raid and Father's absence, 
someone has to deal with this.

452
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:23,372
Yeah, so why does that have to be you?

453
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:25,001
Then you do it.

454
00:34:25,961 --> 00:34:26,963
Happy?

455
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:30,721
[inhales sharply] You little...

456
00:34:30,804 --> 00:34:31,931
Wait, you can't.

457
00:34:33,769 --> 00:34:37,192
It's been a while since the prosecution 
lost trust in you, hasn't it?

458
00:34:38,027 --> 00:34:40,741
-You little punk. 
-A stepmother is still a mother.

459
00:34:41,576 --> 00:34:42,912
Common sense and courtesy.

460
00:34:42,995 --> 00:34:44,373
[scoffs]

461
00:34:44,456 --> 00:34:46,001
Is that too much to ask for?

462
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:50,093
Just pick one role. 
Either be a stepmother or a mother.

463
00:34:50,636 --> 00:34:52,138
Cut the act. It's sloppy.

464
00:34:52,222 --> 00:34:53,934
-Damn you. 
-Damn me?

465
00:34:54,852 --> 00:34:56,021
Stop messing around.

466
00:34:56,898 --> 00:34:58,359
Don't piss me off.

467
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,077
Let's not shed unnecessary blood.

468
00:35:04,287 --> 00:35:06,041
Stop huffing and puffing like that.

469
00:35:06,125 --> 00:35:07,293
You little punk.

470
00:35:10,216 --> 00:35:13,013
-[door slams] 
-He's so ignorant.

471
00:35:13,765 --> 00:35:16,980
I think we need to do something.

472
00:35:17,773 --> 00:35:18,942
It's okay, Mother.

473
00:35:20,194 --> 00:35:22,365
Foolish people can only get so far.

474
00:35:22,449 --> 00:35:24,453
That's why he's dangerous.

475
00:35:24,537 --> 00:35:28,335
When someone is dumb, 
they use brawns over brains first.

476
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:31,760
Don't you know reckless 
and impulsive people are the scariest?

477
00:35:31,843 --> 00:35:32,845
Mother.

478
00:35:33,262 --> 00:35:34,974
Don't worry. Okay?

479
00:35:35,057 --> 00:35:37,103
I'll be home later. Please take it easy.

480
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:41,654
[door opens and closes]

481
00:35:51,508 --> 00:35:52,760
[cell phone vibrating]

482
00:35:52,843 --> 00:35:55,473
HAN TAEOH

483
00:35:57,477 --> 00:35:58,479
Did you find him?

484
00:35:58,563 --> 00:36:00,734
-[waves splashing] 
-Yeah.

485
00:36:03,322 --> 00:36:04,324
[line disconnects]

486
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:07,372
[sighs]

487
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:15,973
[Inha] Go.

488
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:18,310
I want to be alone.

489
00:36:20,398 --> 00:36:21,526
[Taeoh] I'll get to the point.

490
00:36:22,778 --> 00:36:26,368
The chairman's fine. 
Nothing was wrong with him to begin with.

491
00:36:36,931 --> 00:36:38,058
You should've told me!

492
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:40,187
At the very least, I should've known!

493
00:36:46,826 --> 00:36:47,828
Calm down.

494
00:36:48,913 --> 00:36:50,709
Just listen to why I lied.

495
00:36:50,792 --> 00:36:53,047
Are you trying to teach me 
a lesson right now?

496
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:54,382
You're amazing, Taeoh.

497
00:36:55,468 --> 00:36:59,225
In the end, you didn't trust me. Why?

498
00:36:59,852 --> 00:37:03,025
You thought I'd mess things up, 
and you're the only capable one!

499
00:37:05,614 --> 00:37:08,035
It wasn't you, 
I just didn't trust the situation.

500
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:10,331
-Don't play games with me. 
-Games?

501
00:37:10,414 --> 00:37:13,295
You think I bet my entire life on you 
to play pointless games?

502
00:37:14,047 --> 00:37:17,763
If things don't go according to plan, 
you'll have to survive to start over!

503
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:21,604
What if I drag you into this and we fail?

504
00:37:21,688 --> 00:37:23,148
It's over then.

505
00:37:24,442 --> 00:37:26,113
I'd do the same thing again. Why?

506
00:37:28,117 --> 00:37:29,327
For you, Inha.

507
00:37:31,456 --> 00:37:32,500
[Inha sighs]

508
00:37:33,127 --> 00:37:35,214
You always say it's for me.

509
00:37:35,882 --> 00:37:37,928
Not for you, but for me.

510
00:37:39,305 --> 00:37:43,648
Making you the chairman of Kangoh 
is the reason I exist.

511
00:37:45,067 --> 00:37:46,069
[scoffs softly]

512
00:37:47,029 --> 00:37:48,032
That's the reason?

513
00:37:49,827 --> 00:37:50,829
Then what about you?

514
00:37:53,459 --> 00:37:54,837
Does nothing exist for you?

515
00:37:55,421 --> 00:37:56,423
Nothing.

516
00:37:57,551 --> 00:37:58,553
Ah.

517
00:37:59,513 --> 00:38:02,351
If there was anything, it's you, Inha.

518
00:38:03,646 --> 00:38:04,648
Except for me.

519
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:09,157
The one thing you want for yourself.

520
00:38:11,369 --> 00:38:12,371
Nothing.

521
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:14,960
The reason I exist...

522
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:17,465
is you and only you.

523
00:38:26,441 --> 00:38:29,532
Let's go. The chairman wants to see you.

524
00:38:31,702 --> 00:38:33,915
Chairman Kang Joongmo's third son, 
Kang Inha.

525
00:38:35,084 --> 00:38:36,086
This is the start.

526
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,528
-[♪ upbeat song playing] 
-[glasses clinking]

527
00:39:02,346 --> 00:39:05,770
What? [chuckles softly] Who is this?

528
00:39:07,064 --> 00:39:08,275
[Huiju scoffs softly]

529
00:39:08,358 --> 00:39:10,362
I can't bring myself to see this.

530
00:39:11,489 --> 00:39:14,370
As for the rest of you, 
will you excuse us?

531
00:39:14,454 --> 00:39:17,043
Who are you to tell my friends to leave?

532
00:39:17,126 --> 00:39:20,007
Do you want to be humiliated 
in front of them?

533
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:22,763
Or would you rather endure it alone?

534
00:39:25,059 --> 00:39:26,061
Get out.

535
00:39:27,188 --> 00:39:28,190
I said, get out.

536
00:39:31,446 --> 00:39:32,448
[woman] What the heck.

537
00:39:35,454 --> 00:39:36,456
Now.

538
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,797
How will you humiliate me? 
Go ahead and do it.

539
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,842
Ko Huichan...

540
00:39:43,095 --> 00:39:44,264
I will not marry you.

541
00:39:44,974 --> 00:39:45,976
What?

542
00:39:46,644 --> 00:39:47,646
That was it?

543
00:39:48,523 --> 00:39:50,860
I'm glad you feel that way.

544
00:39:50,944 --> 00:39:54,284
Anyway, I don't like you.

545
00:39:54,868 --> 00:39:58,835
So don't dream of marrying me.

546
00:39:58,918 --> 00:40:01,131
I heard our parents all want this.

547
00:40:01,214 --> 00:40:03,301
Then you can marry the parents.

548
00:40:03,385 --> 00:40:08,395
-I hear your dad's in critical condition. 
-Forget it. I've told you what I want.

549
00:40:09,272 --> 00:40:10,274
Do you have a lover?

550
00:40:12,612 --> 00:40:14,449
I know you have one too.

551
00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:16,328
So you do have one.

552
00:40:16,411 --> 00:40:18,958
I'm glad we have something in common. 
That's good.

553
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:21,589

561
00:40:54,905 --> 00:40:59,122
I'm going to do what Dad wants 
and date her officially.

What are you doing?

566
00:41:29,265 --> 00:41:32,188
At least you'll pretend to know me 
if I die because of you.

567
00:41:32,271 --> 00:41:33,816
Are you being serious?

568
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,362
When have I ever 
not been serious with you?

569
00:41:36,446 --> 00:41:39,285
No matter what I did, 
you've never taken me seriously.

570
00:41:44,253 --> 00:41:45,297
It's late. Go home.

You know I can do this all night.

579
00:42:50,803 --> 00:42:51,805
Go.

580
00:42:53,433 --> 00:42:55,813
[sighs softly] I'm going 
to tell my parents

581
00:42:56,523 --> 00:42:58,068
that I'm going to marry you.

582
00:42:59,403 --> 00:43:01,407
You just wait and see.

583
00:43:02,535 --> 00:43:03,913
I'll take care of everything.

584
00:43:05,123 --> 00:43:08,254
My parents will have no choice 
if I insist.

585
00:43:10,175 --> 00:43:12,137
Okay, let's get married.

586
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:14,976
What's next?

587
00:43:16,814 --> 00:43:18,776
Do you think your parents will give in?

588
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,947
In the meantime, what about me?

589
00:43:21,447 --> 00:43:26,207
Shall I endure being treated like scum 
and dream of becoming your husband?

590
00:43:26,875 --> 00:43:27,961
I'll protect you.

591
00:43:28,044 --> 00:43:29,881
What will you protect me with?

592
00:43:33,221 --> 00:43:34,223
Huiju.

593
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:38,273
Your job isn't to protect me. 
It's to protect yourself.

594

Surviving the Kangoh family.

595
00:43:42,615 --> 00:43:44,828
Do you still think 
the world is on your side?

596
00:43:44,911 --> 00:43:47,750
This isn't a fairy tale, 
and there's no happily ever after.

597
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:50,130
You should've stopped 
the princess act by now!

598
00:43:51,675 --> 00:43:53,721
Is it a crime to love you my whole life?

599
00:43:54,388 --> 00:43:58,146
Can't I dream of a fairy tale world 
where we live happily ever after?

600
00:43:58,229 --> 00:44:00,860
I'll turn that fairy tale into a reality!

[breathing heavily]

602
00:44:03,156 --> 00:44:04,743
It's a crime if it's forced.

603

Don't drag me into your fairy tale.

604
00:44:09,628 --> 00:44:10,630
Wait and see.

605
00:44:11,757 --> 00:44:14,094
See if I marry you...

606
00:44:15,973 --> 00:44:17,100
or not.

607
00:44:17,685 --> 00:44:19,856
If you want to waste your time, 
be my guest.

608
00:44:21,735 --> 00:44:22,779
I won't change.

I know you're all busy.

616
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:19,637
I won't waste too much of your time.

617
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:21,975
Let's discuss the main agenda briefly.

618
00:46:22,058 --> 00:46:23,562
According to legal procedures,

619
00:46:24,606 --> 00:46:27,194
I'm sure everyone here is fully aware

620
00:46:28,154 --> 00:46:29,783
that while Chairman Kang is away,

621
00:46:30,534 --> 00:46:33,540
I am obligated to take the role

622
00:46:34,542 --> 00:46:35,795
as the acting chairman.

623
00:46:37,464 --> 00:46:42,725
However, I lack too much 
to take responsibility of Kangoh Group.

624
00:46:43,392 --> 00:46:46,525
That being said, 
I know myself all too well.

625
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,991
For that reason, I have decided that...

626
00:46:52,578 --> 00:46:56,878
for the sake of Kangoh 
and for all of you here,

627
00:46:56,962 --> 00:47:01,972
a much more qualified leader 
should lead Kangoh Group.

628
00:47:02,932 --> 00:47:06,815
I nominate Kang Seongju, 
the president of Kangoh Securities,

629
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:10,906
to be the acting chairman of Kangoh Group.

00:48:06,601 --> 00:48:08,814
What? It's not 1,000 won per share?

639
00:48:12,487 --> 00:48:14,032
[man] What? I don't believe it!

640
00:48:23,009 --> 00:48:25,179
Sir, something's off 
with Kangoh Securities.

will lead Kangoh Group well.

Don't worry about a thing.

Yes, if it's not urgent, 
can we talk later...

00:49:24,757 --> 00:49:25,717
What did you say?

654
00:49:26,636 --> 00:49:28,932
Kangoh Securities shareholders 
have received

655
00:49:29,015 --> 00:49:31,646
a substantial amount of stock 
into their account

656
00:49:31,729 --> 00:49:33,441
instead of small dividends.

657
00:49:33,525 --> 00:49:36,238
An unprecedented selling accident 
at Kangoh Securities.

658
00:49:36,321 --> 00:49:37,950
Instead of 1,000 won per share,

659
00:49:38,033 --> 00:49:42,292
shareholders received 1,000 shares 
in this ridiculous accident.

660
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:45,507
Kangoh Securities has plunged 
in the stock market today.

661

Investors were nervous, 
but it turns out that...

How in the world did this happen?

in the process.

680

They certainly went too far with this.

00:50:46,504 --> 00:50:49,384
How could they sell over 
five million shares in half a day?

682
00:50:49,467 --> 00:50:51,514
How is that a technical error?

683
00:50:51,598 --> 00:50:52,975
A hundred and twelve trillion won.

684
00:50:53,058 --> 00:50:54,520
It gives me goosebumps!

685
00:50:54,603 --> 00:50:57,526
[inhales sharply] 
But was this really a mistake?

686
00:50:58,110 --> 00:50:59,279
Is something up?

Why would I go through the hassle?

I'd rather kill him 
than go through the trouble.

What's Seongju going to do now?

All he wanted to do 
was stay at headquarters.

I'm sorry for harming Kangoh's image.

702
00:52:23,197 --> 00:52:27,873
If something like that could harm Kangoh, 
we wouldn't be at our best as we are now.

I'm sure you did this knowing that, 
so why did you do it?

00:52:37,308 --> 00:52:38,895
So it was a gift for me.

707
00:52:39,772 --> 00:52:44,405
-That's right. 
-Which means you want something in return.

708
00:52:44,489 --> 00:52:47,913
I believe every gift comes with a price.

709
00:52:48,497 --> 00:52:54,259
I have also experienced that nothing 
in this world is for free.

710
00:52:55,052 --> 00:52:56,054
What do you want?

711
00:52:58,518 --> 00:52:59,520
[sighs]

712
00:53:00,564 --> 00:53:01,732
If I save you--

713
00:53:01,816 --> 00:53:03,695
You'll save me?

714
00:53:05,406 --> 00:53:07,744
Isn't that why you were looking for me?

715
00:53:07,828 --> 00:53:09,748
If I save you,

716
00:53:10,917 --> 00:53:14,508
officially acknowledge me 
as a person of Kangoh.

717
00:53:14,592 --> 00:53:16,554
As Chairman Kang Joongmo's son.

718
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:18,432
As Kang Inha.

719
00:53:18,516 --> 00:53:19,685
[Taeoh] Don't back out now.

720
00:53:19,768 --> 00:53:22,189
The moment you hesitate or waver...

721
00:53:23,526 --> 00:53:24,570
it's game over.

722
00:53:27,491 --> 00:53:29,663
[laughing]

723
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:38,681
It seems you hold value 
to the title of being my son.

724
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,854
[chuckles softly] Not at all.

725
00:53:42,522 --> 00:53:43,816
I am well aware

726
00:53:44,943 --> 00:53:49,285
that being your son is nothing more 
than just a label.

727
00:53:50,955 --> 00:53:51,958
But?

728
00:53:52,626 --> 00:53:54,755
Please make an exception for me.

729
00:53:55,507 --> 00:53:57,218
"Kang Inha is Kang Joongmo's son."

730
00:53:58,428 --> 00:54:00,265
Please make sure everyone's aware of that.

731
00:54:01,101 --> 00:54:02,646
I want the world to know.

732
00:54:03,815 --> 00:54:05,109
Please, do it yourself.

733
00:54:06,779 --> 00:54:09,492
That's my condition for this deal. 
It's the only way...

734
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:13,876
Kang Joongmo's Kangoh can continue.

735
00:54:15,922 --> 00:54:16,924
[exclaims softly]

736
00:54:27,654 --> 00:54:29,323
Read it and sign it if you agree.

737
00:54:29,742 --> 00:54:32,204
We can catch up after that.

738
00:54:37,381 --> 00:54:38,383
[Inha sighs]

739
00:54:42,934 --> 00:54:45,940
HEIR TO KANGOH 
CONTRACT

740
00:54:46,567 --> 00:54:47,819
What if...

741
00:54:49,615 --> 00:54:52,036
I don't sign? What happens then?

742
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,252
We won't see each other again.

743
00:54:58,925 --> 00:55:00,553
Then I guess I have no choice...

744
00:55:02,014 --> 00:55:03,016
but to sign.

745
00:55:10,489 --> 00:55:14,163
Foreign investors continue to sell 
amid bad news from Kangoh Securities.

746
00:55:14,247 --> 00:55:15,249
[man] There he is!

747
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:17,127
[camera shutter clicking]

748
00:55:17,211 --> 00:55:19,423
[woman 1] Is it true that 
Gold & Simon were involved?

749
00:55:19,508 --> 00:55:22,179
[man 1] Do you admit that losses fall 
on the small investors?

750
00:55:22,263 --> 00:55:25,645
[woman 2] How do you feel about sucking 
the life out of those small investors?

751
00:55:25,728 --> 00:55:27,941
Do you have anything to say 
to the investors?

752
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:29,736
[man 2] Can you give us a few words?

753
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,072
[woman 3] Please share a few words!

754
00:55:31,574 --> 00:55:34,328
-We'll make a statement next time. 
-[reporters clamoring]

755
00:55:35,372 --> 00:55:36,457
[door closes]

756
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,044
[sighs]

757
00:55:41,175 --> 00:55:42,596
[scoffs]

758
00:55:50,193 --> 00:55:52,197
[plant stems snapping]

759
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:01,382
[Joongmo] Will that really 
get rid of your anger?

760
00:56:08,814 --> 00:56:09,816
You...

761
00:56:12,321 --> 00:56:14,576
What are you doing here?

762
00:56:15,787 --> 00:56:16,789
[sighs softly]

763
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:18,793
Wait.

764
00:56:19,962 --> 00:56:22,466
Did you trick all of us?

765
00:56:23,761 --> 00:56:27,017
Were you just playing with us?

766
00:56:29,731 --> 00:56:30,733
[Joongmo] Exactly.

767
00:56:31,234 --> 00:56:34,574
You should've put your plan into action 
if you wanted to kill me.

768
00:56:36,787 --> 00:56:37,789
[Geumseok grunts softly]

769
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:41,170
[Joongmo] You still don't know?

770
00:56:41,254 --> 00:56:46,472
You can't take anything from me.

771
00:56:46,557 --> 00:56:47,684
I'll kill you!

772
00:56:49,437 --> 00:56:50,439
Ah!

773
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:53,863
[Joongmo] You missed your chance.

774
00:56:54,405 --> 00:56:55,616
I'm alive,

775
00:56:55,700 --> 00:56:58,831
and I came back to punish you.

776
00:56:58,914 --> 00:57:02,714
You can look forward 
to my punishment for you.

777
00:57:05,803 --> 00:57:07,515
I'll see you at the board meeting.

778
00:57:14,988 --> 00:57:16,992
-Mother, what did... 
-[screaming]

779
00:57:33,901 --> 00:57:35,905
[door opens and closes]

780
00:57:39,161 --> 00:57:40,288
[Mr. Moon chuckles softly]

781
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,126
Sir.

782
00:57:44,881 --> 00:57:47,720
Prepare a feast for dinner. 
We'll have a guest.

783
00:57:47,804 --> 00:57:50,643
Tell everyone to attend dinner.

784
00:57:51,937 --> 00:57:52,939
Yes, sir.

785
00:57:53,983 --> 00:57:55,235
[gate opens]

786
00:58:25,796 --> 00:58:29,679
[Joongmo] Skip the formalities 
and just have a seat.

787
00:58:30,305 --> 00:58:31,307
Yes, Father.

788
00:58:43,791 --> 00:58:44,793
[cutlery clatters]

789
00:58:53,393 --> 00:58:55,272
[door opens and closes]

790
00:58:56,608 --> 00:58:58,862
Inha, welcome.

791
00:58:58,946 --> 00:59:00,240
A big welcome.

792
00:59:03,246 --> 00:59:04,248
Let's begin.

793
00:59:10,511 --> 00:59:12,515
[camera shutter clicking]

794
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:51,092
Chairman Kang, do you acknowledge 
your relationship with Milton?

795
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:53,847
Do you have anything to say 
about Kangoh Securities?

796
00:59:53,931 --> 00:59:55,518
[reporter 1] Please, say something.

797
00:59:59,024 --> 01:00:00,360
Are you ready, Father?

798
01:00:00,443 --> 01:00:01,988
[reporters] Father?

799
01:00:02,072 --> 01:00:03,074
Did he say "father"?

800
01:00:04,201 --> 01:00:06,748
-[reporter 2] Is he really your son? 
-[reporter 3] Say something please.

801
01:00:06,832 --> 01:00:08,836
[reporter 4] Did you have a child 
out of wedlock?

802
01:00:08,919 --> 01:00:11,883
-[reporter 5] Please, say a word! 
-[reporters speaking indistinctly]

803
01:00:21,862 --> 01:00:23,866
[♪ melancholy song playing]
