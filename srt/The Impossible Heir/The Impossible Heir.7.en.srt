00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,320
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL
AND IS NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY

2
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:30,697
TO ACTUAL PLACES, PERSONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, SETTINGS AND EVENTS

3
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,826
KANG INJU, NARA ENTERTAINMENT

4
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,458
Drugs?

5
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:50,842
Goodness.

6
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,978
HAN TAEOH

7
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:18,161
NA HYEWON

8
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:20,830
What is it?

9
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:28,713
Kang Inju.

10
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,099
DRUG DISTRIBUTION?

11
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,244
Where's Hyewon?

12
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:00,578
Where is she?

13
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:06,543
We parted ways in the hotel parking lot.

14
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,298
The bride can't be here
on her wedding day.

15
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,259
In return...

16
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,680
This was waiting for you.

17
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,326
Say something.

18
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,496
You got nothing to say?

19
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:54,591
You must have an excuse
for coveting your owner's girl.

20
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:59,512
I heard you and Inha
were friends at Hanguk University.

21
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:06,811
Inha was the ridiculous owner.

22
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:11,816
You were that ridiculous owner's dog.

23
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:13,818
A pup.

24
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,989
Why do you think I pretended not to know
even after I found out?

25
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,040
Because I wanted something like this.

26
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:31,544
You pretended
not to be in on this together.

27
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:35,798
What was your ulterior motive
for getting involved with Kangoh?

28
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,304
Did you just laugh?

29
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:47,602
I told you I always pay back
everything I receive.

30
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,146
Did you not hear?

31
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,689
You little punk...

32
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,650
Gold Trekking Tour in Southeast Asia.

33
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,152
And Nara Entertainment
is the investment company.

34
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,030
How's that? Do you get it now?

35
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,533
What's this nonsense?

36
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,536
Proof that you're the real owner
of Nara Entertainment.

37
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,458
Damn.

38
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,002
You're already surprised?

39
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,130
I'm just getting started.

40
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,716
What are you...

41
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:20,885
What are you up to?

42
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:24,555
I'm about to tell you what
Gold Trekking Tour's real business is.

43
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,601
Illicit funds obtained through
stock manipulation and accounting fraud.

44
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,104
You used your slush fund

45
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:35,275
towards a huge futures trading and failed.

46
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,194
After losing your investment,

47
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,990
you tried to fill the loss
with an Indonesian bauxite mine,

48
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:43,825
but you failed.

49
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,202
This is embezzlement.

50
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:47,829
Well...

51
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,291
You were pushed to the edge
with a ticking time bomb.

52
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,417
You were desperate.

53
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,545
I get that.

54
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,423
You get it?

55
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,675
Gold Trekking Tour's a distribution line.

56
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,262
A market called Chrom.

57
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,974
Aren't these conditions enough
to become a drug lord?

58
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,935
Perfect conditions to make bad decisions.

59
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,812
Was that it?

60
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,856
The real card up your sleeve?

61
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,941
My secret and your secret.

62
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:20,153
Which one will make the chairman angrier?

63
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,242
Choose.

64
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,831
Will you die
or survive and enjoy what you have?

65
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,378
His name's Mo Gijun.

66
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,631
He's the team leader of Security Team 3
in Kangoh Security.

67
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,178
But the thing is...

68
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,514
His position in Kangoh Security
only exists on paper.

69
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,351
In reality,
he works as Kang Inju's secretary.

70
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,686
So CEO Kang Inju was behind this.

71
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,896
Is that it?

72
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,023
How could I dare?

73
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,277
But I don't think a mere secretary
would act independently...

74
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,364
You didn't see or hear anything.

75
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,282
Since you didn't see or hear anything,

76
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,494
there's no need to run your mouth.

77
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,038
Yes, sir.

78
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,730
Damn it!

79
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,902
Taeoh.

80
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:44,195
Han Taeoh!

81
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,783
No matter what you do,
I'm Kang Inju, the eldest of Kangoh Group!

82
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,618
What about you?

83
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,705
You're just Han Taeoh.
You're nothing but a dog.

84
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,667
Han Taeoh.

85
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,711
Ah.

86
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,714
There's one more person who's nothing.

87
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,758
Na Hyewon.

88
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,183
Damn.

89
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,189
You want me to make my move?

90
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,234
Do you want to see

91
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,445
how I'll bury your girl alive?

92
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,343
Get on your knees.

93
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,888
Can't you hear me?

94
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,056
Get on your knees.

95
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,683
Is that all you wanted?

96
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:57,435
No way.

97
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,480
How much could your knees be worth?

98
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,902
From now on, you come when I call,

99
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,696
go where I want, and crawl when I say.

100
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,323
Got it?

101
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,123
Choose.

102
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,377
Will you kill your girl

103
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,214
or survive

104
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,966
and make that dream come true?

105
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,908
Wow!

106
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,368
Hey!

107
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:56,869
Hey, you...

108
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,580
You must love her!

109
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,165
Hey, Taeoh!

110
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:02,833
Hey, Han Taeoh!

111
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:06,087
You're a real man!

112
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,507
Hey! I'm so impressed!

113
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,094
Hey! Bring some alcohol!

114
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,310
Hey! Hey...

115
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,603
Hey!

116
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,904
Taeoh.

117
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,199
Do you want one?

118
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,492
Shall we go to paradise?

119
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,704
Now, now.

120
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,089
 What's going on?

121
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,633
I can't remember anything.

122
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,895
Something's wrong.

123
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,605
This...

124
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,983
This isn't like me.

125
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,295
- Mr. Kang!
- What?

126
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,588
There's a problem.

127
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,799
CEO Kang Inju was murdered.

128
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,777
What did you just say?

129
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,495
A storm is coming.

130
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,832
This is truly tragic news.

131
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:56,085
It has just been reported
that the eldest son of Kangoh Group,

132
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,878
CEO Kang Inju of Kangoh Resort,

133
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,006
was found brutally murdered
not too long ago.

134
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,010
The leading suspect in the case
is revealed to be Mr. Han,

135
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,221
a man in his 30s
and an employee of Kangoh.

136
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,141
KANGOH RESORT CEO KANG INJU
DISCOVERED MURDERED

137
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,963
Okay.

138
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,757
This is good enough, right?

139
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,818
Wait at home.

140
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,529
I'll call you after I find out
what happened.

141
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,240
It's not true, right?

142
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,077
It's a misunderstanding, right?

143
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,456
He didn't do it.

144
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:16,790
It is a misunderstanding.

145
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,585
So don't worry. Go inside.

146
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,046
I'll bring Taeoh with me.

147
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,007
It's been so long. Let's all grab a beer.

148
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,914
FAIR AND KIND CITIZENS' POLICE

149
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,151
Now, shall we get started?

150
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:45,963
 You must focus now.

151
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,716
Kangoh has no official stance.

152
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:54,096
Block all media coverage
as quietly as possible.

153
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,640
Make sure this doesn't become
your last chance from me.

154
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,189
What time
did you leave the club?

155
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,357
I don't remember.

156
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,110
I asked you when you arrived at the hotel
a few times,

157
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:09,653
and you still don't remember.

158
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:11,947
No.

159
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,240
Look here, Mr. Han.

160
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,743
Your lack of memory won't solve this.

161
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,662
You're a suspect
in the murder of two people.

162
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,998
Are you sure I did it?

163
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,501
Only three people used
the private elevator for the Royal Suite

164
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,088
before and after the incident.
You and the two deceased.

165
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:30,174
Before and after the incident,

166
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,218
only three people entered
the Royal Suite room?

167
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,221
You were caught at the scene.

168
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:41,351
Signature Hotel's Royal Suite room can
only be used by Kangoh's owner and family.

169
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,020
To protect the owner's privacy,

170
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,939
there are no cameras in the elevator
or outside the door.

171
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,399
- That means--
- It's unfair?

172
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,778
Then try to remember.

173
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,174
You had one hell of a party.

174
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,301
There were traces of snow in your blood.

175
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,136
Cocaine.

176
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,983
Drink it.

177
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,027
Did you forget already?

178
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,780
You have to make
your girl's dream come true.

179
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,657
Right?

180
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,124
Wow!

181
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,919
Taeoh! You're such a romanticist!

182
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:53,173
You're such a man! I love it!

183
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,677
Bona, isn't he great?

184
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,845
Isn't it strange?

185
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,769
Everything after that is just gone.

186
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,688
You're saying I killed someone,

187
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,732
but I don't remember anything
from that moment.

188
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,534
Even methamphetamine.

189
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,456
Of course, you don't remember.
You were high.

190
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,668
You took the drugs to claim
diminished mental capacity

191
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,171
due to drugs.

192
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,257
Don't worry.

193
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,510
We'll find your memory.
You just need to confess.

194
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:42,389
Now, shall we start over?

195
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,060
FAIR AND KIND CITIZENS' POLICE

196
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,615
 The hotel room.

197
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,243
Who did this to me?

198
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:05,829
Kang Inju?

199
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:07,956
Shin Bona?

200
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,628
I have to remember.

201
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,465
Everything that happened that night.

202
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,343
All of it.

203
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,562
It has been revealed
that the suspect being investigated

204
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,272
for the murder of CEO Kang Inju,

205
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,566
Mr. Han, was facing embezzlement charges

206
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,028
in a separate investigation
by the prosecution before this incident.

207
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:41,490
Mr. Han, who has been dismissed
from his position,

208
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:42,991
is set to face trial

209
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,995
for allegedly receiving rebates totaling
over 470 million won from a subcontractor

210
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,498
and causing significant losses
for the company.

211
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,125
The police in charge of the case
say this murder

212
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:56,338
could be a retaliatory crime fueled
by resentment against the company--

213
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,272
FUTURE STRATEGY OFFICE HAN TAEOH

214
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,323
Yes, Father.

215
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:24,992
I was clear.

216
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,786
I told you to block media coverage.

217
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,162
 I'm sorry.

218
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,498
It was entirely unexpected.

219
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,458
I...

220
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:36,545
should've been more attentive.

221
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,131
- I'll call the broadcasting--
- No.

222
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,509
Will you say he never committed
embezzlement and to issue a correction?

223
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,845
Why? To argue? Wake up!

224
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,805
Don't you know what's happening?

225
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:47,889
Or did you lack...

226
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,351
any sense at all from the start?

227
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,479
I'm sorry.

228
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,690
 Again with the apologies!

229
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,775
When will you stop being sorry?

230
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:01,945
Wait.

231
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,032
Do you think this ridiculous tip

232
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,368
came from the inside?

233
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:14,082
If it happened
because of someone's foolish judgement,

234
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,542
then that someone...

235
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,212
will have to pay the ultimate price.

236
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,385
I like things done neatly.

237
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:28,847
I hope that someone knows
that he should clean up

238
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:33,602
after his mistakes
since he committed them.

239
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,686
As for you,

240
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,022
I'm not a patient person.

241
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:38,899
You must heed my word now.

242
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,236
Unless you want this to be our last
like I warned you before.

243
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,650
KOREAN PASSPORT

244
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:30,700
You asked me to make it,
so I did. Are you really running away?

245
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,952
Run away?

246
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,621
I'm just avoiding it just in case

247
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,749
I get roped into it. It's a precaution.

248
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,962
That's what you call running away.

249
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:45,632
I'm not running away!

250
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:14,953
Did you have dinner?

251
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,164
I saw the news.

252
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,833
It's not true.

253
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:24,629
- Shall I cook something?
- Was it the chairman's decision?

254
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,676
You should've chosen another way.

255
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,762
Even if it's best for the company,
you should've stopped it!

256
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,931
Why should I?

257
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,560
- What?
- Han Taeoh killed Kang Inju.

258
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:42,105
I don't feel that affectionate towards
my brothers or family,

259
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,441
but he was my brother and family.

260
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,943
Are you asking me to take Taeoh's side?

261
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,571
Are you sure he's the murderer?

262
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:52,240
You said you don't believe it.

263
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,825
- He wouldn't do that!
- Wake up.

264
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,077
Snap out of it and listen to me.

265
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,079
You and I...

266
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,583
are part of the Kang family now.

267
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,502
People of Bisunjae.

268
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,253
No matter what happens,

269
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,965
it means Kangoh must always come first.

270
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,595
Are you the same Inha I knew?

271
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,098
You're so unfamiliar.

272
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,184
The truth is always unfamiliar.

273
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,480
From this moment on,
any traces you may have of Taeoh

274
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,106
need to be erased.

275
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,108
What do you mean by that?

276
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,530
I'm saying it for you.

277
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,783
Don't make me angry.

278
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,207
Mr. Han Taeoh.

279
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,376
Come out.

280
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:19,387
SEOUL EASTERN DISTRICT COURT

281
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:26,978
We left the club around 2:00 a.m.
and it took about 15 minutes.

282
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,524
I arrived at the EF Tower parking lot
and they got out.

283
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,819
The three of them entered
the basement entrance of the hotel.

284
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,071
I checked that myself.

285
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,201
A water company truck was blocking
the entrance.

286
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,995
So I parked a bit far away
from the entrance.

287
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:49,084
Mr. Kang said there was no need to get out
and told me to leave.

288
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,710
So I stayed in the car.

289
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,129
But you didn't leave right away.

290
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,507
Yes, everyone was very drunk.

291
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,967
I made sure they got inside.

292
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:00,095
I figured I should wait until then.

293
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:05,141
Whose idea was it to have
another party at the hotel?

294
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,605
It was Mr. Han Taeoh.

295
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:19,197
He seemed to be in a very good mood
that night.

296
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:22,033
He has been to Chrom before,

297
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:23,618
but I've never...

298
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,121
seen him like that.

299
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,833
Has the defendant ever had

300
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:32,627
an argument
with the late Kang Inju before?

301
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:38,299
No, not that I recall.

302
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:43,888
He has said something strange before.

303
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,182
Something strange?

304
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,351
Yes.

305
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,478
Well...

306
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,233
 Go and let Kang Inju know.

307
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,945
Tell him I won't forget his warning.

308
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:00,947
I...

309
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:04,451
always repay what's owed.

310
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,339
Silence in the court! Silence!

311
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,861
If you're going to apologize, don't.

312
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,491
"I'm sorry. I was wrong."
I didn't come to hear that.

313
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,289
You ruined everything.

314
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,084
Our plan. Our dream.

315
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:41,172
I'll do everything I can
to restore everything you ruined.

316
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,341
Even if you ruined everything,

317
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:46,761
I came to tell you
my position hasn't changed.

318
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,556
Because as always...

319
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,018
you'll be more worried about me than you.

320
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,646
What if...

321
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,817
- I'm innocent?
- Do you think you are?

322
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:04,320
Or is that what you want to believe?

323
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,032
I don't know.

324
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,452
Regardless of what the truth is...

325
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,998
I have no right to ask you...

326
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,003
for forgiveness while I'm here.

327
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,296
You don't.

328
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,881
You have no right.

329
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:27,135
So spend your remaining time blaming
and cursing yourself for it.

330
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:30,471
This is the farewell I prepared.

331
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,016
I hope you liked it.

332
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,824
He didn't ask me.

333
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,413
He didn't ask me anything.

334
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,000
He didn't ask me why I did it.

335
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,753
He didn't ask me anything.

336
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,821
Traces of narcotics were found
in the defendant's blood.

337
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:33,242
Were you aware of or did you witness
any drug use that night?

338
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:35,662
No, I had no idea.

339
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,333
When Mr. Kang goes to the club,
I have to prepare a lot of things.

340
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:44,462
I have to restrict access
to the VIP zone on the second floor.

341
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:47,048
There are a lot of people
who want to join the party.

342
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,299
More than you'd think.

343
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,468
So, are you saying the defendant's claims

344
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:54,931
of being forced to do drugs
under pressure of the late Kang Inju

345
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,432
could also be false?

346
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,517
Objection.

347
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,228
He's leading the witness
based on speculation.

348
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:03,106
Sustained.

349
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:10,279
Then I'll change the question.

350
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,450
Is the defendant a habitual drug user?

351
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,495
I don't know.

352
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:21,374
We're not close enough
for me to know that about him.

353
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,012
 Mo Gijun is the witness again?

354
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,724
He saw and heard a lot of things
since he's close to Mr. Kang.

355
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,435
Shall I find out more about him?

356
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:44,105
I'm sorry.

357
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,024
- I shouldn't have--
- Do it.

358
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,650
Excuse me?

359
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:53,614
He tried to kill Han Taeoh
and now has accused Han Taeoh of murder.

360
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:56,701
A nobody involved in both cases?

361
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:02,040
I need to know
why Inju tried to kill Taeoh.

362
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,083
Why Taeoh...

363
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,214
killed my son.
I must know the real reason.

364
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:12,842
Mo Gijun's the key.

365
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:17,180
Find out everything you can about him.

366
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,017
See if he has something.

367
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,394
And if he does, find out what it is.

368
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,772
Yes, sir.

369
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,445
Inmate 423, move it!

370
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,241
Move!

371
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:40,888
What is this?

372
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,522
Keep the space!

373
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,448
Inmate 423, get up!

374
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,826
Inmate 423!

375
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,122
Wake up!

376
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,082
Get up! Damn it!

377
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,381
 There was one more person.

378
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:17,925
To the infirmary!

379
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,218
- Yes, sir!
- Hurry!

380
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,303
There was...

381
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:22,763
one more person there.

382
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:30,206
Are you up?

383
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:40,216
Will starving yourself
prove your innocence?

384
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,760
I'll give you vitamins.

385
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:46,222
You'll need to get regular fluids
for a while.

386
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,267
You can rest before you go.

387
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,894
It's fine. I'm okay.

388
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,648
Sure, okay.

389
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:21,841
Mr. Han Taeoh.

390
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,762
You have to survive to have hope.

391
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,564
Can I ask you a favor?

392
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,947
Don't be surprised.

393
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,950
You killed Kang Inju for me.

394
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,954
I can do this much for you.
That's what I think.

395
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:54,999
The guard will be here for you soon.

396
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,917
You don't have much time.

397
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,770
 The number you've dialed
is out of reach. You'll be redirected to--

398
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:40,795
Hello?

399
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:44,924
 It's me.

400
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,138
Wait.

401
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,464
What happened?

402
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,342
Did you really do it?

403
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,222
Did you really...

404
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,729
kill Kang Inju?

405
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,316
I'm going to find out.

406
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,902
If I really...

407
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,531
killed Kang Inju...

408
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,867
or not.

409
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:00,666
How can I help?

410
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:14,555
Let's go.

411
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:40,372
You owe me for what just happened.

412
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,548
Good boy.

413
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,426
That's a good boy.

414
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:54,929
Give me your hand.

415
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,765
Hand.

416
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,732
It'll just be a huge headache
if we tried to find out who you called...

417
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:07,858
HANEUL BANK
105 369

418
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,569
...and why you called them.

419
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,780
But nothing in life is free.

420
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,157
That applies even harder here.

421
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,160
The price for my silence.

422
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:20,996
It's within a limit
that won't burden either of us.

423
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:26,835
Shall we go now?

424
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,452
Hello, sir.

425
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,871
Hello, sir.

426
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,749
- Hello.
- Good morning.

427
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,209
- Hello.
- Hello.

428
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,919
- Hello.
- Hello.

429
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,337
Good morning, sir.

430
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,590
- I'll show you the way.
- Thank you.

431
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,517
FUTURE STRATEGY OFFICE HAN TAEOH

432
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,819
Use your common sense, okay?

433
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,321
I'm sorry.

434
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,233
Han Taeoh asked me to come.

435
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,112
No.

436
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,950
I haven't said anything yet.

437
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,870
I know. I don't want to do it even though
you didn't say anything.

438
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,457
I don't want to get involved
with Han Taeoh.

439
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,542
Even if he's offering a bag of money...

440
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,294
No.

441
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:36,882
I'll ask you one thing.

442
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,594
Do you have anything to do
with Kang Inju's death?

443
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,689
Did he say I was involved?

444
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:52,773
No.

445
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:56,860
He told me to tell you this
if you continue to refuse.

446
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,363
Tell him I can talk from in here too.

447
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,949
He'll know what it means.

448
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,121
The Han Taeoh I know wouldn't
speak empty threats.

449
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,539
No matter what,

450
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:10,791
he'll do what he says.

451
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,418
So go meet him?

452
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,211
He said he needed you.

453
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:16,880
He asked for your help.

454
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:20,926
Bullshit.

455
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:23,053
A favor?

456
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,097
My ass.

457
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,850
One more thing.
Don't use a regular meeting room.

458
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,394
All conversations are recorded there.

459
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,855
What am I supposed to do?

460
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:41,822
Sorry about that.

461
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,789
CHAIRMAN KANG'S HOSTILE PARTIES
PARK SAJIN

462
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,791
I will start the report on Park Sajin,

463
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,127
who's the central force
opposing the chairman.

464
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,964
So this is what Mr. Han Taeoh did.

465
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,008
This is who
Mr. Park met with recently.

466
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,802
Those two met and spoke.

467
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,637
Do you know what they talked about?

468
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,099
From what I could tell,
they were looking for a restaurant.

469
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,601
A restaurant?

470
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:14,188
All of their meeting places
were at famous restaurants.

471
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,149
But these days,

472
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:20,027
one more person
has been attending their meetings.

473
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,576
Chae Donguk.

474
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:31,413
He's the type to cut ties
as soon as there's nothing to gain.

475
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,542
Which means, he has a lot to gain

476
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,129
from Park Sajin and Im Jongyong right now.

477
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,216
Let's focus on those two.

478
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,635
Start with the basics.

479
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:47,596
- Track their accounts.
- Yes, sir.

480
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:05,572
FUTURE STRATEGY OFFICE KANG INHA

481
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,577
 I did what you said.

482
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,622
What will you do now?

483
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,792
I need to keep going.

484
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,669
Once I go...

485
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,296
I'm sure I'll see a path.

486
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,091
I know you didn't do it.

487
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,553
That isn't like you.

488
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:39,731
Your time's up.

489
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:43,735
I have to go.

490
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,304
- When did you get here?
- Just now.

491
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:14,892
You must be tired. Shower and rest.

492
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,945
Let's stay like this for five minutes.

493
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:31,783
We haven't seen each other in a while.
You feel uncomfortable around me.

494
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,535
That's not true.

495
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,871
Even if it were, I won't be angry.

496
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:37,998
I get it.

497
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,170
I'm exhausted. I'm so tired.

498
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:46,715
Comfort me.

499
00:48:47,716 --> 00:48:49,801
I need your comfort the most right now.

500
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,977
I love you, Hyewon.

501
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,743
 I know you didn't do it.

502
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,287
That isn't like you.

503
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,351
CORRECTION FOR A BETTER TOMORROW
DETENTION CENTER

504
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,410
Inmate 423.

505
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,247
Your lawyer is here.

506
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,375
Go ahead.

507
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,137
Why are you so surprised?

508
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,766
Is this your first time seeing
South Korean Attorney Ko Jeongwoo?

509
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,238
I took difficult steps in coming here.

510
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:36,908
I don't expect you to be overjoyed
or touched,

511
00:50:36,992 --> 00:50:38,827
but shouldn't you at least thank me?

512
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:40,662
I had to threaten you to come.

513
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:41,788
Wow.

514
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,083
Is that how you greet me?

515
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,920
In any case, never call me again.

516
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:51,965
Don't send anyone to me.

517
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:53,175
One more thing,

518
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:54,885
especially not her.

519
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:59,097
I get you were urgent,
but how could you think of sending her?

520
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,186
Before she's your friend,

521
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,688
she's part of Kangoh's family now,
isn't she?

522
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,274
Anyway...

523
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,778
let's not see each other again.

524
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:14,488
Would that be okay?

525
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,033
My threats aren't over yet.

526
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,957
Are you going to kill me?

527
00:51:28,168 --> 00:51:29,169
Sit down.

528
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,933
What do you want to know?

529
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,143
Mo Gijun.

530
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:49,272
Other than myself,
he's the last person to see them.

531
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:51,858
He's the starting point.

532
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,655
I need to know what really happened
that night.

533
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,699
The starting point of the truth.

534
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:01,535
Hurry.

535
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,037
I don't have much time.

536
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,003
The visitation's over.

537
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:17,926
Damn it!
