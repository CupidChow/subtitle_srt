1
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,120
Work hard.

2
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,319
Be careful.

3
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,279
This guy is a traitor.

4
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,759
The crown prince of the Star Group is leaving.

5
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:44,839
See the guest out.

6
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,879
Alright.

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,799
Help me.

8
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,280
5,000
Okay.

9
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,439
Thank you for saving me.

10
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,039
No need to thank me.

11
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,159
Just pay me.

12
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,279
Do you really need money?

13
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:24,919
Yes.

14
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,039
If you need a lot of money,

15
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,519
would you consider being my lover?

16
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,679
If you drink all the alcohol here,

17
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,519
the money is yours.

18
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,520
How about it?

19
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,439
Ah, what’s wrong?

20
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,799
Can't drink anymore?

21
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,839
Then I’ll buy you a guitar.

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,319
Hurry up and drink.

23
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,399
You can really drink.

24
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,839
Look at you go, my darling.

25
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,799
Finish it quickly.

26
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:01,559
Amazing, my darling.

27
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,599
Ah, what’s the matter?

28
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,679
Where are you going?

29
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,799
You're the one who drugged the drink.

30
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,559
Because I rejected you, you resorted to this dirty trick.

31
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,959
So despicable.

32
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
Hey, Manager.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,399
I'm also trying to earn money.

34
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,079
I'll help you solve the money issue.

35
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,799
What exactly do you want?

36
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,559
Stay by my side for three months.

37
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,520
Deal.

38
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,119
But I have a condition.

39
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,999
I haven't thought of it yet.

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,759
I'll tell you later when I think of it.

41
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,599
I have only one request.

42
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,439
If I get tired of it, it will end anytime.

43
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,079
So don't fall in love with me.

44
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
Here we go.

45
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,319
This little luggage for three months?

46
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,239
This is my secretary, Seong-yu.

47
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,279
If there is anything you don't know,

48
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,519
just ask him.

49
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
If you need anything, let him know as well.

50
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,199
This way, please.

51
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,359
Young master doesn't like noise.

52
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:40,919
When at home,

53
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,279
make sure to keep quiet.

54
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,919
Curfew is 9 PM.

55
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,079
After 9 PM, absolutely do not

56
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,159
leave your room.

57
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,959
Young master is very clean.

58
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,479
Absolutely do not eat anywhere outside

59
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,719
the dining room.

60
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,119
This is Master Jaehyeok's room.

61
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,799
This is Yunho.

62
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,359
Your room.

63
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,119
And then.

64
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,959
This is the guest room.

65
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,039
Let's go check somewhere else.

66
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
Oh.

67
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,959
Yunho.

68
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,719
What are you doing here?

69
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960
I
can't sleep.

70
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,159
Wanted to have a drink.

71
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,279
Just in time.

72
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,959
No need to look for you.

73
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Come with me.

74
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,399
Not bad, right?

75
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,039
Really not bad.

76
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,399
What are you doing?

77
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,159
You're the one who came over to hug me.

78
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,319
Now you're asking what I'm doing?

79
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,799
What should I do with you?

80
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Come here, quickly come over.

81
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,839
The new guy, Yunho.

82
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Isn't he too much?
Yeah, yeah.

83
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,399
Heard he deliberately tried to seduce the young master at night.

84
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,599
Even said we're not as good as him.

85
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,639
Complaining about all sorts of things.

86
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,079
You're no exception, brother.

87
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,359
Young master Jaeho now, no matter what it is.

88
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,719
He's become an indispensable presence.

89
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
Is there something going on?

90
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,999
We've got guests.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,279
Master Jae Ho’s name is Yunho

92
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,679
Waiting on the side

93
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,519
It seems that Master Zaihao

94
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,959
I like Yunho very much, right?

95
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,359
Thank you for your hard work. Drink it.

96
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,519
I'm the secretary

97
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,359
It's okay

98
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,519
I'll decide whether it matters or not

99
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,039
Or do you hate what I gave you?

100
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,879
My arms are sore, hurry up and continue

101
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,639
You go to the party dressed like this

102
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,879
No decent clothes

103
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,519
in formal occasions

104
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,359
Can't wear earrings

105
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,599
Whose dog is this?

106
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,759
I don’t know if I have to wait for the elders

107
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,959
After taking it first

108
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,319
Come and get it again?

109
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,679
Not big or small

110
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,639
He is from my family

111
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,039
Which family are you from?

112
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,319
It turns out he is the crown prince of the Star Group.

113
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,839
rude

114
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,560
Jae Ho

115
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,359
Oh my little baby

116
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,519
it's me

117
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,799
I am coming

118
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,199
I said where did I go, but it turned out to be here?

119
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,399
help me quickly

120
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,759
This person is a pervert

121
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
Are you crazy?

122
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,079
How can you drink when you go out with the young master?

123
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,080
And let the young master carry you back?

124
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,999
I'll teach him a lesson, you go out.

125
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,359
Went out with the secretary.

126
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,919
It's the first time the secretary has come back drunk.

127
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,719
No, it must be.

128
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,359
Trying to get my attention.

129
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,639
Why kiss her?

130
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,879
Hey, wake up.

131
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,039
Oh.

132
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,599
I've finished teaching him a lesson, drag him away.

133
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,440
Young master, the new models have arrived these days.

134
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,359
Please make a selection.

135
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
Get lost.

136
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,720
You get lost too.

137
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,159
Jaemin young master.

138
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,160
I've heard he's back already.

139
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,719
Why doesn't he stay abroad properly?

140
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,599
Why did he come back?

141
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,319
Why is it so hot, really.

142
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,319
Hey, who are you to be so casual?

143
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,519
Who's he?

144
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,639
He's called Yunho.

145
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,359
A friend that young master Jaehyun brought back a few days ago.

146
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,719
A friend brought back a few days ago by young master Jaehyun.

147
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,879
Young master Jaemin probably doesn't know him.

148
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,559
Just right.

149
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Earlier, I could only see you all, it was quite boring.

150
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,200
Let him serve me, keep him here.

151
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
Let me report to Young Master Jae-ho.

152
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,559
Since when did my brother become so stingy?

153
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,319
Do I need permission to use someone for a bit?

154
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,399
Or is it that

155
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,159
I haven't been back for so long

156
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,159
that I'm not considered a young master anymore?

157
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,679
What time is the meeting with President Miracle scheduled for?

158
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,279
There's a video conference.

159
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,239
Start as soon as you get there.

160
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,799
What are you doing now?

161
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,519
Have I been too kind to you?

162
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,559
You don't understand any rules at all.

163
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,879
I like this secretary.

164
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,799
Let's do this then.

165
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,359
He doesn't understand the rules.

166
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,479
You hand him over to me.

167
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,999
I'll teach him the rules.

168
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,079
It seems you like him quite a bit too.

169
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,479
Then go with him.

170
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,679
Don't come back.

171
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,719
All of you, get out.

172
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,719
Jae-min

173
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,880
Go somewhere nice to play.

174
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,599
Go out.

175
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,439
This place is nice.

176
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,479
Seems like you come here often.

177
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
This is my secret base.

178
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,479
Brother, a drink please.

179
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,479
Okay.

180
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
Hello

181
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,920
And then

182
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,199
This is my exclusive spot

183
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,599
So, you're a pop idol singer

184
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,519
No wonder you're so handsome

185
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,399
Sit here

186
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,359
My brother hasn't liked me

187
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,599
Since we were young

188
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,359
So he sent me abroad

189
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,359
Causing me to return without many friends

190
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
Jae-min

191
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,919
As long as you don't mind

192
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,319
I'd like to be your friend

193
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Really

194
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,639
There's a room in Jae-ho's home you're not allowed to enter

195
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,479
Do you know what's inside?

196
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,239
You've found the right person to ask

197
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,239
How come there's no one home

198
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,439
No need to search

199
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,639
Everyone else is in the courtyard

200
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,759
The eldest brother has important business today

201
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,879
He told us not to disturb him

202
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,359
Before leaving, he especially warned us

203
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,200
Why did you betray me?

204
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,720
Master Jae-ho

205
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,479
I was confused; it wasn't intentional

206
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,239
I promise it won't happen again

207
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,679
Please forgive me this once

208
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,680
Forgive

209
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Do you take me for a fool? Hurry up and speak

210
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,519
Master, really just forgive me this once

211
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,999
Are you an idiot?

212
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,519
What if it had stabbed somewhere else?

213
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,439
Fortunately, the wound isn't deep.

214
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,479
No need to go to the hospital.

215
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,639
But make sure to apply medicine on time.

216
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,999
To heal properly.

217
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,039
So this wound needs someone.

218
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,039
To be by the side for constant care, right?

219
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,879
Yes.

220
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,039
Because the wound absolutely cannot get wet.

221
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,079
Someone needs to be there to take care of it.

222
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,079
I'll take care of him.

223
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,759
Okay.

224
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,519
You take care of me.

225
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,520
Where should I start?

226
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,559
Sit here.

227
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,759
Stay by my side.

228
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,599
Starting with the beard.

229
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,399
Have you found out who ordered it?

230
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,119
Who do you think ordered it?

231
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,199
How would I know?

232
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,839
There's only one person.

233
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,839
Who could guess.

234
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,399
Who is that?

235
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Jae-min.

236
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,519
How is that possible?

237
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,319
Jae-min hasn't been back in Korea for long.

238
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,199
How could he order the bearded guy?

239
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,999
In my opinion.

240
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,799
You think Jae-min...

241
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,119
Biased

242
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,159
Load the people, load the people

243
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,959
How long has it been since he came back?

244
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,279
Do you trust him that much?

245
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,039
I'm just stating the facts

246
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,879
If you think he's good, then follow him

247
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,760
That's okay too

248
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,639
How did it go?

249
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,919
The bearded guy failed

250
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,759
It would have succeeded with earlier action

251
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,919
Although he didn't manage to kill him

252
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,279
He did injure him

253
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,999
I didn't know the young master

254
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,679
Would be so interested in just a secretary

255
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,119
Suddenly thought of a good plan

256
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,279
Always protecting the big brother

257
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,559
Everyone has worked hard

258
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,839
I'm treating everyone today

259
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,159
Feel free to drink up

260
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,359
I heard not long ago

261
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,239
A madman with a knife

262
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,479
Stabbed my big brother

263
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,078
To prevent such unfortunate incidents

264
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,559
I hope everyone will do their utmost

265
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
Let's toast

266
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,479
What type do you pr

267
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,598
Choose one.

268
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,999
Then...

269
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,318
This, this, this one.

270
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,359
What are you doing now?

271
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,199
Everyone, let's drink.

272
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,759
The evening breeze...

273
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,479
So refreshing.

274
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,199
You're so easily satisfied.

275
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,119
Life has so many worries.

276
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,039
So many.

277
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,439
If only for a moment, it would be nice to feel a bit relaxed.

278
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,999
Do you have any worries?

279
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,559
My worries...

280
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,399
Are all problems that money can solve.

281
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,839
Unlike yours.

282
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,679
Involving life and death.

283
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,239
Yeah.

284
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,599
You're much luckier than me.

285
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,399
Of course.

286
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,159
So let my money...

287
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,279
Solve your worries.

288
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,359
Then both of us...

289
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,999
Can have fewer worries.

290
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,719
Why are you being so nice to me?

291
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,599
I also want to know.

292
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,639
Never mind, do you want to dance?

293
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,519
The weather is so nice.

294
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,119
Who did I drink with yesterday?

295
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,319
I think I kissed someone too.

296
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,920
Days are very...

297
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,479
Call Yunho over.

298
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,479
Are you looking for me?

299
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,439
Do you remember what happened yesterday?

300
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,079
Did something happen between us yesterday?

301
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,319
Why don't I have any impression at all?

302
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,679
You also came yesterday

303
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,999
Recently, I followed Zaimin

304
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,239
keep distance

305
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,839
I don’t believe Jae Min

306
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,319
Still don't believe me

307
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,919
If this continues

308
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,399
Everyone around me will leave

309
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,399
I didn’t expect you to sing so well

310
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,719
Of course

311
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,839
I'm an idol singer

312
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Although

313
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,960
Your girlfriend doesn't say anything

314
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,479
I don't have a girlfriend

315
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,760
What about the boyfriend?

316
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,599
What to say

317
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,239
Neither men nor women

318
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,999
This is the situation now

319
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,319
Who are you qualified to fall in love with?

320
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,599
What's your situation?

321
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,279
you are mine now

322
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,280
Not inferior at all

323
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
You um

324
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,439
Is there anyone you like?

325
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,279
In the dream

326
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,999
Brother, how did I come back?

327
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,239
immersed in sleep

328
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,159
The princess doesn't wake up

329
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,679
She had to ask the prince to kiss her

330
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:45,919
oh

331
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,079
What's going on with you and Young Master Jae-ho?

332
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,719
Do you like Young Master Jae-ho?

333
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,999
I've never thought about it that way.

334
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,919
On the contrary, it feels like he always sees me

335
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,279
as a thorn in his side.

336
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,159
Our Yoon-ho,

337
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,719
he's handsome,

338
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,559
capable,

339
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,319
and even very loyal.

340
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,519
So he's very popular with the girls.

341
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,559
Is there anyone more perfect than him?

342
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Don't talk while eating.

343
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,039
If you don't talk,

344
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,839
no one will think you're mute.

345
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,479
Not long ago, Choong-ho got injured because of me.

346
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,079
Shouldn't you ask my opinion before bringing him back for treatment?

347
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,799
Do you have any other opinions?

348
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,599
Don't give others...

349
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,559
Enough.

350
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,999
Eat.

351
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
You have to recover quickly.

352
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,559
You two, eat this.

353
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,439
TER COM A is coming EE YOURS

354
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,440
How about it?

355
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
How about what? SO EE

356
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,239
I'm super popular wherever I go. SOME E E

357
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,999
I feel like Young Master Jae-ho

358
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,399
seems to like you. AND EE SOME

359
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,159
What do you think? AND EE SOME

360
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,160
What do you think?

361
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,719
I don't understand why you

362
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,439
I would think so

363
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,080
I've been here once

364
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,439
I haven't thought about it that way.

365
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,519
If you are not

366
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,959
If you like boys

367
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,719
Stop asking and leave now.

368
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,399
This is the best approach for everyone

369
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,119
He likes boys

370
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,119
It's his choice

371
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,239
Because he likes boys

372
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,999
I don't have to leave him

373
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,479
anyway

374
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,639
He is my boss

375
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,999
What is this?

376
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,520
Jae-ho's

377
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,159
Still a carrier

378
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
Hello who

379
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,279
OK, I got it.

380
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,439
Go right over there

381
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,359
Did everything as instructed.

382
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,359
Say come right over

383
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,839
What do you want to do?

384
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,519
What are you talking about

385
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,959
What did I do?

386
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,919
You know me

387
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,480
One

388
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,799
Whatever you want to do

389
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
If Yunho gets hurt a little

390
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,439
I'll make you pay.

391
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,799
My brother really knows how to joke around.

392
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,599
How could I let Yunho get hurt?

393
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,799
Yunho is my good friend.

394
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,759
Sorry, young master, we lost track of him.

395
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,759
We will check the hotel surveillance immediately.

396
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,799
Your hairline looks great.

397
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,999
Your skin is good too.

398
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,719
You like me.

399
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,519
What do you think?

400
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,159
It's not the first time you've done this, brother.

401
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,559
But up to now, I haven't forced the issue.

402
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,639
I was drunk at that time.

403
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,359
You kissed me back then.

404
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,319
Why are you avoiding my gaze?

405
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,719
I thought only you liked me.

406
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,319
From the very beginning of the signing.

407
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,999
I had a plan.

408
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,919
My life.

409
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,079
Was like a piece of darkness.

410
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,039
Every day, I'm dead tired.

411
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,999
And there's no sign of the debt decreasing.

412
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,599
That day.

413
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,639
I was so exhausted.

414
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,799
I went to the Han River.

415
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,279
Later.

416
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,879
You appeared.

417
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,119
Just like you said.

418
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,959
Solved everything.

419
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,119
With money.

420
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,799
All my problems.

421
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,359
I know

422
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,679
But

423
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,719
I'm so grateful to you

424
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,839
Do you remember what happened?

425
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,119
Someone yesterday

426
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,319
Drugged your drink

427
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,439
Fortunately, when I found you

428
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,679
Nothing happened and that person ran away

429
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,199
So

430
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,119
Really nothing happened?

431
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,279
The chairman wants to see you

432
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,639
Who told you to come in without knocking?

433
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:47,959
Yes, yes

434
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,159
I'm sorry

435
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,520
Get out

436
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,119
Are you worried I'll do something bad to you?

437
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,999
Oh, come in

438
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,559
The chairman is outside with the new secretary

439
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,119
Waiting

440
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,999
The new secretary is named Yunho

441
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,639
Jaehok got hurt because of him

442
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
Yes

443
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,599
When we found the young master

444
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,600
The young master was already

445
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Enough

446
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,079
Tell Jaehok to come in

447
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,119
Yunho, that guy

448
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,919
Still don't want to see him

449
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,559
Very disappointed in your conduct

450
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,359
Look at you

451
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,919
I'm sorry

452
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,599
It won't happen again

453
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,799
It was because of that friend

454
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,879
How do you interact with your subordinates

455
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,759
Mixing personal and professional matters

456
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,199
It happened because of me

457
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,559
Such a thing

458
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,279
How can I turn a blind eye

459
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,319
He is the secretary you hired

460
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,279
It's due to the relationship with him

461
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,559
Not being handled well

462
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,199
That put him in danger

463
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
To prevent it from happening again

464
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,079
Your relationship with Yoon Ho

465
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,519
Cannot get entangled again

466
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,040
Understood

467
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,759
How's your health?

468
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
How do you know?

469
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,839
Don't be shy

470
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,919
It happens often

471
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,919
You're no exception

472
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,999
Can I go out for a while?

473
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,199
Jaemin asked me to take him to the bar

474
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,719
Why are you asking me about this?

475
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,199
Didn't you dislike me being with Jaemin before?

476
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,879
It's okay

477
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,199
Don't bother me with such things

478
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
Young master

479
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,439
Let me comfort you

480
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
Where are you going?

481
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,159
I have something to do, so I'm leaving first.

482
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
Let's go together.

483
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,599
Why did you come back so late?

484
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,119
I told you I would be back late.

485
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,679
And you agreed to it.

486
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,280
You think I care about you this much.

487
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,919
I'm just angry because you didn't.

488
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,159
Follow the rules.

489
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,359
So you're trying to punish me again?

490
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,519
When did I ever punish you?

491
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,159
Wasn't there any such time?

492
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,959
Don't forget I bought three months of your time.

493
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,079
I can do whatever I want.

494
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,999
So what?

495
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,799
I don't need three months.

496
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,800
Get out now.

497
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,719
The last time wasn't handled well at all.

498
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,999
This time, there can't be any mistakes.

499
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,479
Understood.

500
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,480
Don't worry.

501
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,879
This time, I definitely won't disappoint you.

502
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,119
Then I'll wait for your good news.

503
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,158
Everyone getting together.

504
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,239
It's the happiest.

505
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,319
Yeah.

506
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
It is.

507
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,599
Are you sure that's what you think?

508
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,399
Your expression hasn't been good today.

509
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
My expression.

510
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,280
When?

511
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Wait a mininute

512
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,840
Hi

513
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,999
What are you doing here?

514
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,879
I'm with you now

515
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,999
It doesn't matter anymore

516
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,439
If you can't get a greeting, leave.

517
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,279
Then I should

518
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,599
How to do it

519
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,879
Now to teach me a lesson

520
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
Find a home specifically

521
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,200
Who is it?

522
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Why haven't you come for so long?

523
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,240
Hello

524
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,840
Please sit down
and eat together

525
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,039
Oh, but he's really handsome.

526
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,360
Thanks

527
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,279
Are you a trainee like Yunho?

528
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,119
Trainee life is tiring, right?

529
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,159
Our Yunho also does this every day

530
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,160
Tortured by the boss

531
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
You've had too much to drink
Be quiet

532
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
I've finished all the wine
I bought a lot

533
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,879
I'll buy some more wine.

534
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,879
Do you know where to buy

535
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,920
Who is he?

536
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,239
A bit like a fool

537
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,680
is a fool

538
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,399
I'll take care of the fool.

539
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,080
What do you want?

540
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,919
If you need money, I'll pay double.

541
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,879
No, I'll give you three times.

542
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,319
Master

543
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,759
Don't waste your energy.

544
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:14,999
We are just responsible

545
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,319
Kidnapping the Master

546
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,439
It was Zaimin who ordered it, right?

547
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,679
What he wants

548
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,839
I don't know what you are talking about

549
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:25,679
Just follow quietly.

550
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,159
You'll know when you see it.

551
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,599
What a puppy

552
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,239
If you don't want to die, put the knife down.

553
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,439
Come down quickly

554
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,439
Are you okay, Master?

555
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,880
elder brother

556
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,040
Master

557
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,480
elder brother

558
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,359
Are you okay?

559
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,039
I thought you were really dead.

560
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,039
How can I die with you around?

561
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:31,359
When you took the knife for me

562
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,319
Than I die

563
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,959
More uncomfortable

564
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,639
fortunately

565
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,119
We're both still alive.

566
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,320
dad

567
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,959
How could you come in so quietly?

568
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,280
Your kidnappers have been caught.

569
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,879
Let Jaemin first

570
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,880
Copy Room

571
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,399
Just rest in peace.

572
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,119
This time it will definitely

573
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,120
Uproot them.

574
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,839
Get up!

575
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,639
Where are the others?

576
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,759
Ask you about others

577
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,079
You thought you protected them.

578
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,519
They will protect you too

579
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:26,959
Come if you can.

580
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,759
What else can I do except kill me?

581
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,080
Yeah

582
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,759
Yunho, leave this to me.

583
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,879
Really? Let me see if you can hold on.

584
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,880
One

585
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,599
you

586
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,039
Not that I don't like this

587
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,239
Bloody scene

588
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,839
My brother is lying in the hospital now.

589
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,079
This level of crime deserves a price.

590
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,600
Right

591
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,119
Yeah, bring the water.

592
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,439
How is your health today?

593
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,159
I'm fine.

594
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,199
Feeling uncomfortable

595
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,520
Why

596
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,999
I miss you all day

597
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,239
Yeah

598
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,119
On the way here

599
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,319
Met some familiar male models

600
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,559
Go by the side

601
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,159
Those people were called by Seong Woo.

602
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,559
Called over here.

603
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,759
They made a mess of the hospital.

604
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,279
It was all chaotic and messy.

605
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,279
I chased them all out.

606
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,880
Really?

607
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,799
Of course, it's true.

608
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,079
If you don't believe me, call Seong Woo.

609
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,839
Who do you think is behind it?

610
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,399
Who do you think is orchestrating this?

611
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,079
Who do you think is pulling the strings?

612
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,679
Don't worry.

613
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,239
I'll help you.

614
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,359
No one can take what belongs to you.

615
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,039
Just kidding.

616
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,399
I just hope you stay

617
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,879
happy and healthy forever.

618
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,519
But,

619
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,879
if I go to the scene

620
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,639
and assess the situation,

621
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,559
will it be more helpful to you?

622
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:41,599
I think I only asked Yun Ho to come.

623
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,519
What's wrong?

624
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,159
Not confident letting Yun Ho handle it?

625
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,559
Yun Ho hasn't been here long enough.

626
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,119
Master Jae Ho said more people would be better.

627
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,839
So he asked me to come help too.

628
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
Really?

629
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,719
Since you're here, do a good job.

630
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,040
Then,

631
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,759
Specifically, where should we start?

632
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,599
Re-arrest the kidnapper for questioning.

633
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,159
No need to do that.

634
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,119
It's already been confessed that the Beard came for revenge.

635
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,359
Didn't we capture the Beard last time?

636
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,439
There are still people willing to follow him.

637
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,079
So, we're asking for your help.

638
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,919
We want to investigate who's behind this.

639
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,159
Just in case.

640
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,959
But I didn't expect Chan-woo to come as well.

641
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,559
I only prepared a gift for Yoon-ho.

642
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:16,799
Our relationship is so good.

643
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,359
What other gift would be necessary?

644
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,919
After seeing you, I'll decide.

645
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,879
Isn't this an extremely expensive designer watch?

646
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,640
It's yours.

647
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,400
Do you like it?

648
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,079
Isn't it beautiful?

649
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,239
I'm glad you like it.

650
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,840
How's your health?

651
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,239
Almost completely healed.

652
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,959
I'm not asking about your wound.

653
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,119
The issue with your wound.

654
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,319
The doctor reports to me daily.

655
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,639
I'm asking about your heart.

656
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,599
Lately, your eyes...

657
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,839
Look like love is starting to bloom.

658
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,039
Like a fool's.

659
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,599
What I want to say is...

660
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,599
What I want to say is

661
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,519
The same mistake

662
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,679
Don't repeat it again

663
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,039
Making mistakes repeatedly

664
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,079
Have you forgotten?

665
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,999
When you were obsessed with Minho

666
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,079
How hard it was

667
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,519
Dad, I

668
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,479
I'll handle it. Come on, Heung

669
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,680
Wed, Wed

670
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,559
What did the Chairman say?

671
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,959
You don't look so well

672
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,639
Nothing

673
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:43,919
And you?

674
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,479
I heard you received a big gift today

675
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,999
Rumors spread so fast

676
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,999
Jae Min

677
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,479
To make me work hard on this task

678
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,079
Gave me a gift

679
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:55,080
An expensive one

680
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,359
Jae Min

681
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,319
Usually

682
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,479
He seems carefree

683
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,279
He seems quite serious

684
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,799
Didn't you say love isn't something obtained through competition

685
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,999
And said you didn’t like Jae Min

686
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,399
Look at yourself now

687
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,400
Oh

688
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,600
Are you jealous?

689
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:12,759
No

690
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:14,759
I never get jealous

691
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,119
A person who makes me jealous.

692
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,639
Would never stay by my side.

693
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,679
But just now,

694
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,439
when I came in, I heard

695
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,400
someone called Minho.

696
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,879
What's up with that?

697
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,439
You must have heard it wrong.

698
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,240
Don't worry about it.

699
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,439
Gave me a fright.

700
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,159
Glad nothing happened.

701
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,680
Who are you?

702
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,519
For Jae Ho,

703
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,759
the most precious person.

704
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,520
No, My, My.

705
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,439
Yunho, no.

706
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,319
Let go of me.

707
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:57,559
Hey Jae Ho,

708
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,959
is something bothering you?

709
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,920
No.

710
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,199
After being close friends with you for so long,

711
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,639
I can tell what you're thinking just by looking at your eyes.

712
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,759
I can tell what you are thinking just by looking at your eyes

713
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,319
Love,

714
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,119
isn't that complicated.

715
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,439
You,

716
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,199
just overthink too much.

717
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,839
Sometimes,

718
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,360
compared to the person involved,

719
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:23,479
others around

720
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,839
can see things more clearly.

721
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,599
Let me think about it.

722
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,799
Regardless of the decision you make.

723
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,159
Just don't use Yunho.

724
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,559
As a substitute for anyone else.

725
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,999
I know who I truly love.

726
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,119
Really is.

727
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:46,439
Why are you here?

728
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,440
Because I missed you.

729
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
I barely managed to sneak out tonight.

730
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,759
Won't you give me a little reward?

731
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:06,119
Be careful tomorrow.

732
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,279
Stay safe.

733
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,919
Also, be on guard against Jaemin.

734
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,319
Why are you so prejudiced against Jaemin?

735
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,839
I think he's not bad.

736
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,559
What do you know?

737
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,239
That person is best at pretending.

738
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,359
Isn't that your prejudice?

739
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,799
days a

740
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,800
You.

741
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,080
Why do you dislike Jaeho so much?

742
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,719
He's completely different from me.

743
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,439
How different?

744
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,919
Since birth,

745
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,199
He's had everything.

746
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,759
But I had to fight for everything myself.

747
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,319
Why is it like this?

748
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,320
Aren't you and Jaeho brothers?

749
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,199
He's never treated me like a brother.

750
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,799
He never regarded me as a brother, right?

751
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,439
The most important thing between family members is communication.

752
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,159
Why don't you try talking to Zaihao?

753
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,319
You are too naive.

754
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,359
If everything could be solved through communication,

755
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,679
then there wouldn't be so many family conflicts

756
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,119
or crimes happening.

757
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,719
It's only the weak

758
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,719
who solve things through dialogue.

759
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:08,319
What I want is submission.

760
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:11,839
After this is over, come to my side.

761
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,679
Whatever the big brother can give,

762
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,519
I can give you too.

763
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,879
You don't like me anyway.

764
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,679
How do you know

765
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,119
whether I like you or not?

766
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,479
You just have a sense of possession.

767
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,599
You just want to win against Zaihao.

768
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:26,879
I don't want to be the

769
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,279
sacrifice between you and Zaihao.

770
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,479
He likes you.

771
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,279
How can you be sure?

772
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,479
Min-ho is back too.

773
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,359
Will your relationship with him

774
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,279
remain the same as before?

775
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:36,479
Drunk.

776
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:56,680
Ah, crazy person.

777
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,679
Isn't it just a joke between men?

778
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,199
Go away.

779
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,559
Isn't this too much?

780
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,319
Isn't this too much?

781
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,759
Recently I was on Instagram

782
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,599
and clicked on so many things

783
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,999
Let's take a picture

784
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,639
Today is our first date

785
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,239
I tried hard to find guides

786
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,999
I heard this place is super delicious

787
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,679
But even my brother doesn't like desserts

788
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,239
I didn't even know

789
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:21,319
I'm an incompetent lover

790
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,319
Don't like sweet things

791
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:24,599
But I like to eat you

792
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,479
There are too many people here

793
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,759
So what

794
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,960
Come in and talk

795
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,559
Why did you come here

796
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,479
I was locked up by them

797
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,439
If it weren't for you

798
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:11,439
I couldn't have lasted until now

799
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:12,679
They

800
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:14,279
Where were you locked up

801
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,799
And how did you escape

802
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,400
Minho

803
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,639
Go call a doctor

804
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,399
Is Minho okay

805
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:34,399
Why are you here

806
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:35,560
Jaehyuk

807
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:36,999
I'm asking you

808
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,319
I heard Minho is back

809
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,720
Yes

810
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,799
Just sent to the hospital

811
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,719
What are you planning to do?

812
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,319
Him.

813
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,999
He lived with me.

814
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:48,559
I'll take care of him.

815
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,239
Personal feelings.

816
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,199
Must handle it well.

817
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,559
Don't let these things

818
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,199
affect the group.

819
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,919
Understood.

820
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,920
I'll handle it properly.

821
00:49:58,480 --> 00:49:59,480
Don't worry.

822
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,959
I'll be leaving now.

823
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,799
You've been living here for a while.

824
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:19,680
What are you doing?

825
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:20,919
They locked me up.

826
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,279
They beat and tortured me.

827
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,079
My whole body hurts now.

828
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,399
Can you call a doctor for me?

829
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,159
I heard Minho came back.

830
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,599
Jaehyo's old feelings might rekindle.

831
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,839
Of course, definitely.

832
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,840
You guys haven't been here long, so you don't know.

833
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:43,679
Back then, Master Jaehyo

834
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,039
was crazy in love with Minho.

835
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,639
Really crazy.

836
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:47,679
I've never

837
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,759
seen Master Jaehyo

838
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,079
- like anyone that much. -Stop gossiping and get back to work!

839
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,159
I only have my brother.

840
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,879
I was so scared when I

841
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,359
I just wish I had my brother by my side.

842
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:19,319
Am I bothering you?

843
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,800
Yunho...

844
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,879
Come have some pizza.

845
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,959
It looks so delicious.

846
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,559
Jaeho, can we talk?

847
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,799
Jaeho...

848
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,559
Can we have a chat?

849
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,799
What exactly do you want?

850
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,039
What did I do?

851
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,599
Stop playing games.

852
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:11,119
Jaeho is mine now.

853
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:13,759
It's really pathetic.

854
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:17,079
It seems neither of you know this is an impossible love.

855
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,240
What do you mean?

856
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,759
Looks like you still don't know.

857
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,039
You and Jaeho...

858
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:22,999
Are real brothers.

859
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,679
Stop talking nonsense.

860
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:26,759
Check the room with the tiger mark over there.

861
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:27,760
Go inside and take a look.

862
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,319
Am I really talking nonsense?

863
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,719
You'll find out soon enough.

864
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,599
All the sweet moments with him...

865
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:35,639
Turns out to be a forbidden love.

866
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,039
Do you think Jaeho can handle this?

867
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,559
But I kind of envy you.

868
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:44,560
A penniless guy...

869
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,719
Suddenly becomes the son of a rich family.

870
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,840
Envious, indeed.

871
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,600
SIT

872
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:41,639
How do you know?

873
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,719
It seems you have seen

874
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:47,719
Zaihao and I

875
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:49,639
We grew up together

876
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:51,079
Between my father and uncle

877
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,999
Close relationship between generations

878
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,799
So when I was a kid I heard

879
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,039
Dad talking to uncle

880
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,479
I hid quietly

881
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,319
What are you going to do with that woman?

882
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:04,199
That woman is pregnant

883
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,719
I gave her money to have the abortion.

884
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:07,519
Let her not show up

885
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,439
In this place

886
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,359
Knowing that this child exists

887
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,759
But I didn't expect it was you

888
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:19,640
ah

889
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,959
You know I see

890
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,039
When you take a photo with your mother

891
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,199
How happy are you?

892
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,879
That's the proof that Jae-ho belongs to me.

893
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,919
Zaihao and I are brothers

894
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,519
So the one I love

895
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,759
It's a brother's thing

896
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,839
I can only pray that

897
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,559
Zaihao knows

898
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,359
In case someone else knew

899
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,799
Zaihao will bear

900
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,559
The crime of incest

901
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,639
Jae-ho will also lose.

902
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:54,559
His position in the group.

903
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,519
If Jae-min knows about it,

904
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,239
it's a perfect chance to bring Jae-ho down.

905
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,919
Please don't tell Jae-min.

906
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,199
I won't.

907
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,399
However,

908
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,879
it's up to you.

909
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,919
So leave Jae-ho.

910
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,759
And don't ever show up again.

911
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,919
I don't like this.

912
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:15,319
You wouldn't want your mother's death

913
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,279
to disturb her peace, right?

914
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,519
As long as you leave,

915
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,399
it's good for everyone.

916
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,239
Others don't need to know, and it'll be the same as before,

917
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,759
a return to the beginning.

918
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,159
Jae-ho will be with me.

919
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,160
Ah...

920
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,359
In exchange, I'll keep this secret for life.

921
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:44,800
Jae-ho...

922
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,960
Where are you going?

923
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,399
I temporarily

924
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,999
need to go home for something.

925
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,039
Then let me go with you.

926
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,719
It's fine.

927
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,399
Then I'll arrange a car for you.

928
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,559
Take a car.

929
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:11,719
I've already booked it.

930
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,039
Don't worry about me.

931
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,079
Got it.

932
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,080
Come back soon.

933
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:18,759
No.

934
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:20,160
I'm leaving first.

935
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,719
Very happy, don't contact me again.

936
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,439
Damn it.

937
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,399
Likes girls.

938
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,399
You dare just leave like that.

939
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,399
Find out where Yunho is.

940
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,039
Where did he go and who was he with?

941
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,599
I need to know everything.

942
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,119
Actually, I saw yesterday.

943
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,119
Went out together.

944
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,999
Didn't you say you don't like men?

945
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,959
Still hanging out with a man.

946
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:33,960
Yunho, where did you go?

947
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:37,839
Your person is missing.

948
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,919
Why are you asking me?

949
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:41,199
Stop bluffing.

950
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:42,439
You've wanted to.

951
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,079
Take everything from me since you were a child.

952
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,039
What kind of family is like this?

953
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,239
Have you ever once.

954
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,079
Considered me as family?

955
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,599
Not even once did you or dad.

956
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:52,679
Look at me directly.

957
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,239
I.

958
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,599
Will prove to that old man.

959
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,519
Just because you like men.

960
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,039
How ruinous you've become.

961
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,119
I never wanted to fight with you before.

962
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:31,879
Even when you wanted to take my things.

963
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,079
It didn't matter to me.

964
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:36,519
So I thought it was okay.

965
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:37,519
But this time, you...

966
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,319
You've crossed the line, Jae-min.

967
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,799
Your company will be managed by someone else.

968
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,639
You can just be a worthless secretary.

969
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:44,919
Young master.

970
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,959
Found it.

971
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,159
You and Jae-min...

972
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,159
When did you start having that kind of relationship?

973
00:58:58,560 --> 00:58:59,799
Is he better than me?

974
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,319
Or...

975
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,439
Does he give more than I do?

976
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:02,799
Break up.

977
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,079
I know it's hard for you to accept right now.

978
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,559
But love isn't something that can be forced.

979
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,680
It can’t be solved by forcing.

980
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:09,759
You say to me now,

981
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,279
Force.

982
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,999
When we were talking romance,

983
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,279
When we were making love in bed,

984
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:16,039
I never forced you.

985
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,999
Now you talk about force.

986
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:18,599
Watch carefully now.

987
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,039
You'll see what force means.

988
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,839
Don't do this.

989
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:23,559
We're brothers.

990
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:29,879
What did you say?

991
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,559
We are biological brothers.

992
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,919
Impossible.

993
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:40,879
Stop talking nonsense.

994
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,639
Go and ask your dad.

995
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,559
What really happened back then?

996
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,239
At that time, the secretary was pregnant.

997
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:51,319
She didn't terminate the pregnancy and gave birth to the child.

998
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,199
Stop talking nonsense.

999
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:56,439
I'm begging you.

1000
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:06,159
That's why you left me.

1001
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,479
It's not because you don't like boys.

1002
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:10,439
It's because you are my brother.

1003
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,159
Run away.

1004
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,839
Let's leave this place.

1005
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,039
Go somewhere where there are no people.

1006
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,879
Just the two of us living together.

1007
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,439
If that's not possible,

1008
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:27,079
we'll go to heaven,

1009
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,079
or we can go to hell together.

1010
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,599
If it's with you,

1011
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,279
whether it's heaven

1012
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,359
or hell, it doesn't matter.

1013
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,239
Okay.

1014
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,479
Before that, I want to show you something.

1015
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,639
What is this house?

1016
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:06,319
I originally wanted to bring you here when we got married.

1017
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,039
Didn't expect it to be earlier.

1018
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,159
Sit down.

1019
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,760
I am willing to go against my nature and instincts.

1020
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,199
I am willing to go against my nature and instincts

1021
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,559
As long as I can hold you.

1022
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,959
I can restrain.

1023
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:28,479
My greed.

1024
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,519
You're my only one.

1025
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,159
Yunho.

1026
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
Wow.

1027
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:02,439
I don't know if I should say your relationship is really good.

1028
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:05,319
Or you're both naive fools unaware of reality.

1029
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,759
Why is it you again?

1030
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,399
Why are you doing this at all?

1031
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,999
I want to deliver you two,

1032
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,239
This couple, to your father.

1033
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:16,119
If you meet him, remember to.

1034
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,120
Say hello for me.

1035
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,239
Damn it.

1036
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,359
Why are you doing this to my father?

1037
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:22,920
It's nothing.

1038
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,639
Just sending regards on behalf of my mother.

1039
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:26,879
Sent a message.

1040
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:29,960
Awake.

1041
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:33,959
How are you feeling?

1042
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:34,960
You
lied to me, right?

1043
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:38,599
I'm not Jaehyun's real brother.

1044
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,359
Hey, of course I lied to you.

1045
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:52,799
Ah.

1046
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:53,800
I truly didn't expect.

1047
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,519
You to naively believe it.

1048
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,639
Seeing your misfortune.

1049
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:58,640
Really is amusing.

1050
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:01,759
Why are you doing this?

1051
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:06,559
Because that old man.

1052
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,279
Abandoned my mother.

1053
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:10,039
My mother raised me alone.

1054
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,559
And she passed away from overwork.

1055
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,359
Yet, you're living happily.

1056
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:21,079
The happier you are, the more I hate you.

1057
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,599
I'm really looking forward to seeing what expression that old man will have when he sees you.

1058
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,239
You...

1059
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,319
Do you think you can get away with this?

1060
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:34,839
Are you okay, Yunho?

1061
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:35,839
Yeah, I'm fine.

1062
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,599
It will be okay.

1063
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:47,879
Who are you, really?

1064
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:54,960
President.

1065
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:56,080
Master Jaeho and Yunho...

1066
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,799
Have been unreachable since last night.

1067
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,319
I'll go find them now.

1068
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,239
Take some people and go here.

1069
01:05:02,280 --> 01:05:03,119
Quietly follow behind me.

1070
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,559
Don't get discovered.

1071
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:06,200
Let's go.

1072
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,799
Jaeho...

1073
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,160
Minho...

1074
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:25,880
How come you...

1075
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:29,439
I have your beloved son...

1076
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,639
Kidnapped.

1077
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,400
Dad.

1078
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,999
You...

1079
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,239
It seems you've forgotten me.

1080
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,319
I'm so heartbroken.

1081
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:43,960
Stop.

1082
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,319
Calm down, Minh Ho.

1083
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,319
Stop it.

1084
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,479
There's still a chance.

1085
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,519
Stop it?

1086
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,519
My mother died right in front of me.

1087
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:54,839
What right do you have to say that?

1088
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:55,879
Wasn't it you back then?

1089
01:05:55,880 --> 01:05:56,799
Abandoned my mother.

1090
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,599
Otherwise, my mother wouldn't have died.

1091
01:05:58,920 --> 01:05:59,920
What?

1092
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,280
Back then.

1093
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:02,720
That child.

1094
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,559
Looks like you finally remembered, Dad.

1095
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:11,119
At that time.

1096
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:12,439
I tried to find you.

1097
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,439
You and your mother.

1098
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:16,919
Wanted to send you abroad.

1099
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,599
But couldn't find you.

1100
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,200
Alright.

1101
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,079
I know you hate me.

1102
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,239
Know you're angry with me.

1103
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,479
But.

1104
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:29,719
Your brother did nothing wrong.

1105
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:32,159
How is there no wrong?

1106
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,399
It's because of them that I, as a child.

1107
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,039
Grew up without a father.

1108
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:37,599
And that's why my mother left me so early.

1109
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:38,319
I struggled.

1110
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,359
Lived a hard life.

1111
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,079
And what about them?

1112
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:41,719
But all kinds of enjoyment

1113
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:42,279
But they

1114
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,559
Still feel wronged

1115
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:44,639
Enough

1116
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,599
Minho

1117
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,119
This is all

1118
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,439
My bad

1119
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,719
your mother

1120
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,719
I didn't take good care of it

1121
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:56,399
You also suffered a lot.

1122
01:06:57,520 --> 01:06:59,159
I'm really sorry

1123
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,599
If you want revenge

1124
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,719
Take revenge on me

1125
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:07,760
dad

1126
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:10,519
I came here this way

1127
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:11,560
I don't want to hear your apology.

1128
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,079
Want you to feel

1129
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:19,239
The pain of losing someone you love

1130
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,919
But don't worry

1131
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:21,799
If you all die

1132
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:23,039
I'll go along too.

1133
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:24,999
Apologizing to my mother

1134
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:26,759
I'll keep my eyes on it

1135
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,479
Don't move

1136
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,239
It's my gun.

1137
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,759
Or your hands are fast

1138
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:38,479
Brother, you are

1139
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,839
Not giving in at all

1140
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,400
stop

1141
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,560
Why

1142
01:07:43,640 --> 01:07:44,719
That's why I'm so tired.

1143
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:45,960
oh

1144
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:47,959
Call everyone else out

1145
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:48,960
hurry up

1146
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Minho

1147
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:51,959
What's the meaning

1148
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,479
If you don't come out, I'll shoot you.

1149
01:07:58,520 --> 01:08:00,999
It's not bad to come all at once

1150
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,839
No need to look for them one by one

1151
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,280
so

1152
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:05,839
Who starts dying?

1153
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:07,599
Otherwise, you decide for yourself

1154
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,199
Who to start with

1155
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,959
You can't go out anyway, Minho

1156
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,319
Put down the gun

1157
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:14,879
Now I can turn back

1158
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,880
What

1159
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,839
I can only shoot one shot

1160
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:21,239
That

1161
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:22,599
Who wants to go with me?

1162
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,240
One

1163
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:25,799
Do you want to come with me?

1164
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:27,359
or

1165
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,079
dad

1166
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,439
Dad, come with me.

1167
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,799
Hello Minho

1168
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,719
All of this is

1169
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,599
My bad

1170
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,318
Kill me

1171
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:41,759
words that can put you at ease

1172
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:44,119
I

1173
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:46,919
willing to die

1174
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:55,599
I was too impulsive at that time

1175
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,559
give your mother money

1176
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:59,559
let her go

1177
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:00,759
so much money

1178
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,479
Thinking that it can satisfy food and clothing

1179
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:06,479
But I didn't expect

1180
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:07,639
After your mother escaped

1181
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:09,679
will give birth to you

1182
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,278
as time goes by

1183
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,079
child born

1184
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:15,439
Even if I try my best to find

1185
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,799
The result was not found either.

1186
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:18,959
Although I

1187
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,278
You may not be able to reveal your identity

1188
01:09:22,279 --> 01:09:23,358
But you are like this

1189
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:24,119
suffer

1190
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,318
I won't sit back and do nothing

1191
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,439
My thoughts are too short

1192
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:29,159
I

1193
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,959
To you mother and son

1194
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,358
Owe too much

1195
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
dad

1196
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:36,239
Have you really looked for me?

1197
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,358
anywhere in the world

1198
01:09:38,359 --> 01:09:40,599
Come and find your biological son

1199
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:43,199
No father would deny recognition

1200
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,519
Minho

1201
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:01,839
What are you doing?

1202
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:03,479
Quickly, call an ambulance.

1203
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:05,520
Dad.

1204
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,599
If at that time.

1205
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,119
Mother had taken me.

1206
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,839
Abroad.

1207
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:13,399
Would you have loved me.

1208
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,879
Like you love Zaihao?

1209
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,119
Minho.

1210
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,120
Would you be sad.

1211
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:21,799
Knowing we disappeared?

1212
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:22,959
No.

1213
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:25,719
Were you happy?

1214
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:27,079
Minho, stop talking.

1215
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,399
Dad.

1216
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,519
During this time, things I've failed to do.

1217
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,359
I will make it up to you bit by bit.

1218
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
So.

1219
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,479
Hang in there.

1220
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:37,759
Dad.

1221
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,679
This is the first time I've hugged Dad.

1222
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,239
This is what being hugged by Dad feels like.

1223
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:45,119
Next time.

1224
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,479
Don't ever lose me.

1225
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:48,479
At that time.

1226
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,039
I will be obedient.

1227
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:52,159
Be a good son.

1228
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,479
Okay.

1229
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:55,879
My good son.

1230
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,400
Minho.

1231
01:11:06,520 --> 01:11:07,839
Take a deep breath.

1232
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,039
Minho.

1233
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,679
Watched the surveillance.

1234
01:11:25,720 --> 01:11:28,199
Minho entered that room.

1235
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,879
The photos were swapped at that time.

1236
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:32,439
Yunho's parents were hit by Minho's adoptive father.

1237
01:11:32,440 --> 01:11:34,399
Hit by car at night and fled the scene.

1238
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:36,119
That's how they passed away.

1239
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,439
Here's this too.

1240
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,479
An email Minho scheduled.

1241
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:40,719
That was sent in advance.

1242
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:44,199
Contains all evidence of crimes by Minho's adoptive father.

1243
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,199
From the start.

1244
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:48,119
Seems like it was all planned by Minho.

1245
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,919
Take it to Yunho.

1246
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:54,559
What should we do.

1247
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,999
Let him decide.

1248
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:06,919
What he wants to do.

1249
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,399
As long as you want.

1250
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,519
No matter when, I can help you get revenge.

1251
01:12:11,240 --> 01:12:12,479
Forget it.

1252
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:13,759
I don't want because of such a person.

1253
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,559
To stain my hands with blood.

1254
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,439
I'll handle it on my own.

1255
01:12:17,880 --> 01:12:19,839
Most suitable for those people.

1256
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,319
It's only prison.

1257
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:25,920
Brother.

1258
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:28,599
I want to take you som

1259
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:30,239
Where

1260
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,160
Mom, where are you?

1261
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,279
I have someone I like.

1262
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:51,679
You will support me, right?

1263
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,320
Mother

1264
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,359
I will love Yunho forever

1265
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:06,880
What's wrong

1266
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:07,519
Because I won

1267
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,079
Come to show off to me

1268
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:09,759
Why

1269
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:10,919
Hate me so much

1270
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,559
Not so annoying

1271
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:16,119
I just can't understand my father.

1272
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,199
Only care about you

1273
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,159
Same son

1274
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:21,519
Why such discrimination?

1275
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:23,639
No matter what I do, my father won't like me.

1276
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,679
So I want to get more attention

1277
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:29,519
To take away yours and torture you

1278
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,279
Then suddenly I had this idea

1279
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:34,319
Wanting my father's attention

1280
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,159
Only if I succeed

1281
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:37,759
Dad, I'm sorry.

1282
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,159
I'm not a good father

1283
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:41,559
Not done well

1284
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,359
The role of father

1285
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:46,199
Jaemin, can you forgive me?

1286
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:47,880
Jaemin

1287
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:49,559
I have always been myself

1288
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,999
Running a company is too tiring.

1289
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,719
Need your help

1290
01:13:58,360 --> 01:13:59,879
Looks great my sons

1291
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,639
This time, in the sweep operation

1292
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,199
all the traitors were cleared out.

1293
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,759
The ones left now

1294
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:09,879
are all elites

1295
01:14:09,880 --> 01:14:10,880
and my most trusted people.

1296
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,279
Starting from today, officially,

1297
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:16,119
I will retire.

1298
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,519
From now on, the Star Group

1299
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,159
will be managed by Jae-Ho.

1300
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:30,840
Yun-ho,

1301
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,039
the duties previously handled by Jae-Min,

1302
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:34,439
you will be responsible for.

1303
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,399
From now on, you will assist Jae-Ho

1304
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:38,319
to manage the company well.

1305
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,159
So,

1306
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,199
how come young master Jae-Ho is making kimbap?

1307
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,679
What's wrong with that?

1308
01:15:12,200 --> 01:15:13,719
I can cook other dishes as well.

1309
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:15,559
Just couldn't show it today.

1310
01:15:15,560 --> 01:15:16,399
Do you want to taste it?

1311
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,519
Never mind.

1312
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,799
Wow, you're quite impressive.

1313
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,199
How can you make this person

1314
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,200
so obedient?

1315
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,439
What's going on?

1316
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,600
Come over here.

1317
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,599
Why are you here?

1318
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,759
Shouldn't I be here?

1319
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:48,719
You've been away for so long.

1320
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:50,559
I couldn't sleep at night.

1321
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:53,319
It's not me, I'm going to see mom.

1322
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,679
By the way, I'm here to clean up.

1323
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:56,640
It hasn't been a long time, right?

1324
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:58,560
Ah, whatever.

1325
01:15:58,600 --> 01:15:59,759
No matter where you are,

1326
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:01,239
I want to be there too.

1327
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:03,199
Well, young master,

1328
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,199
let's start working together now.

1329
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:06,319
What kind of work?

1330
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:16,919
Come quickly.

1331
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:22,880
Oh, I'm going into the room.

1332
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:26,759
Understood, young master.

1333
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:32,880
What?

1334
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:33,960
What are you doing here? Surprise!

1335
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:36,360
Oh, what is this?

1336
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:37,520
What's happening?

1337
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:40,399
Let me open it. One, two, three.

1338
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:53,479
When I ran away before,

1339
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,959
I did something like this.

1340
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,399
But at that time, I seemed to forget an important step.

1341
01:16:57,400 --> 01:16:59,279
So I wanted to perfectly fill the regret.

1342
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:03,160
Yunho,

1343
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,719
will you marry me?

1344
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,359
Marry me.

1345
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,999
It should be me marrying you.

1346
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:27,680
Look there.

1347
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,639
The moon is super bright.

1348
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:32,599
Mom and Dad in the sky must be watching us.

1349
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,439
Then I have to do even better.

1350
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,119
They will always be watching us.

1351
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:40,719
This kind of surveillance

1352
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:42,879
Can be accepted regardless of the amount.
