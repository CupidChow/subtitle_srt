00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,370
♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,840
♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,100
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,030
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,540
♫ or pretend to be indifferent. ♫

7
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,830
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,630
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,390
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:39,460
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:46,580
♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

12
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:52,950
♫ Love is like a migratory bird waiting for the season. ♫

13
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:58,850
♫ How long does it take for them to be aware of each other? ♫

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,300
♫ You are like summer night, ♫

15
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,980
♫ I'm like a little star in the sky, ♫

16
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:12,980
♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

17
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:16,540
♫ Deliberately, I hit your shoulder, ♫

18
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:21,200
♫ and listen to your reprimand. ♫

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,660
♫ The caring feeling is so sweet! ♫

[Fang-fang: Lin Xichi, Happy Chinese New Year!]

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,739
Happy Chinese New Year!

24
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:22,340
Fang-fang, thank you.

25
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,370
Little Fang Fang,

26
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,520
Happy New Year to you, too.

27
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,139
Aren't you happy?

28
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:09,120
Xu Fang, can you send me some food?

29
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,239
I don't want to eat the leftovers from New Year's Eve.

30
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:31,180
Chi-chi.

31
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:36,779
Chi-chi, it's mom.

32
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,820
Chi-chi.

33
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,879
Chi-chi.

34
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,580
Auntie?

35
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,260
I'm Xu Fang.

36
00:04:13,779 --> 00:04:15,598
You are such a big boy now.

37
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:17,378
I really couldn't recognize you.

38
00:04:17,378 --> 00:04:19,820
Why... are you here?

39
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:23,959
Chi-chi is probably not at home.

40
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:28,719
If she is, she may not want to open the door for me.

41
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,000
It's not true! She's probably visiting relatives with Lin Xigeng.

42
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:41,540
Auntie, I'm off.

43
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:43,079
Xu Fang.

44
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:48,418
Did Chi-chi tell you about what happened to our family?

45
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:51,620
Only some of it.

46
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,699
Are you available now? I'd like to talk to you.

47
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,399
That's how it happened.

48
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:07,120
I didn't mean to lie to her.

49
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,559
We discussed this issue for a long time back then.

50
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:13,700
It was the best lifestyle we could give her.

51
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:17,659
But it's not better than staying with her.

52
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:21,520
Lin Xichi's feeling upset

53
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,750
because she thought you'd always be with her.

54
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,639
You kept giving her false hope

55
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,099
and disappointing her.

56
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:34,139
She even found the past of you and her very ridiculous.

57
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:41,080
Did you know how I spent my nights for the first few years?

58
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,640
You think I didn't feel sad about leaving her?

59
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,240
But that's what adults do, there are many things out of my control.

60
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:52,919
I believe every mother in this world

61
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,719
wants the best for their children.

62
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:00,819
Do you think hurting her is the best for her?

63
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,479
Is that what adults do?

64
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,459
I know Chi-chi grew up with you.

65
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,020
And both of you are studying at Rong University.

66
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,010
She probably spends more time with you than with me.

67
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:32,659
Actually, I'm glad that she has a friend who knows her well.

68
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,640
I want to ask you for a favor.

69
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,740
Spend more time with her and comfort her.

70
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,459
Can you do it?

71
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,940
Don't worry!

72
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,559
That's good!

73
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,758
Okay, I need to go back to Rong City now.

74
00:06:52,758 --> 00:06:54,420
See you!

75
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,640
Your food is here.

76
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:29,078
- What took you so long?
- Hungry?

77
00:07:29,078 --> 00:07:31,200
Cooks in restaurants have almost all gone home for New Year.

78
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,460
So it took a longer time.

79
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,520
Wait! Why aren't you wearing shoes?

80
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,999
Here! Sit up.

81
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,619
Your feet!

82
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,399
Isn't this more comfortable?

83
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:57,618
No matter how hard my life is, I still get hungry.

84
00:07:57,618 --> 00:08:00,559
It's the New Year, you should go out.

85
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,238
You are trying to steal my food.

86
00:08:03,239 --> 00:08:06,800
- Are you listening? You should go out.
- I don't want to.

87
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:10,140
No food for you then.

88
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:14,840
Looking at me is useless! You have to go.

89
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:22,300
- I'll finish it.
- Fine! I'll go.

90
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,180
Xu Fang.

91
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:05,099
If I were abandoned by all, can I really go to you?

92
00:09:07,579 --> 00:09:11,060
What you said at the restaurant,

93
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,159
do you mean it?

94
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,899
Of course!

95
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,479
If you were to become homeless,

96
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:20,480
just come to me.

97
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,619
I can't promise other things

98
00:09:24,619 --> 00:09:28,359
but I'd definitely reserve my unique kennel for you.

99
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:34,640
Your family has a dog, too.

100
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,019
Isn't there an old dog in his twenties?

101
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,038
You'd better get rid of that dog.

102
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:41,420
He's so hot-tempered.

103
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,340
I can't live with him.

104
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,459
You'r crazy.
(T/N: lit. you're sick)

105
00:09:47,479 --> 00:09:50,860
That dog's sick! I'm scared.

106
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,039
Dad, Mom, Lin Xichi's here.

107
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:57,300
Chi-chi, it's been a long time!

108
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,860
Uncle, Auntie, Happy New Year!

109
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,999
Come on in!

110
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:05,200
You've grown taller and prettier.

111
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,578
- Really?
- Yes, you are prettier.

112
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:09,659
She's a beautiful young lady now. It's true!

113
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:16,019
Chi-chi, Xu Fang told me that both of you always stay together at school.

114
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,260
I'm glad that you take care of each other.

115
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,560
No, Xu Fang's the one who is taking care of me.

116
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,319
That is what he should do.

117
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:25,418
- Yes, you're right.
- Enjoy it.

118
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,640
I've always seen you as part of our family.

119
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,579
Can you not be that straightforward?

120
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,440
Did I say something wrong?

121
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,620
I've always seen you as my daughter.

122
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,478
She always wanted a daughter.

123
00:10:43,479 --> 00:10:47,038
If we weren't busy with work, we would have one.

124
00:10:47,038 --> 00:10:49,559
Your parents find you unnecessary.

125
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:53,200
No, he's not, as long as we have you.

126
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,940
By the way, I'll cook something for you.

127
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,319
Auntie, it's okay, I've had my lunch.

128
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:01,558
I'll get you some fruit then.

129
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,258
Thank you, Auntie. Thank you, Uncle.

130
00:11:05,258 --> 00:11:07,218
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

131
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,699
Have some dog poop candy.

132
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:18,979
No, thanks! I need to go to the restroom.

133
00:11:18,979 --> 00:11:22,220
If you feel bored, just stay in my room, I had my phone there.

134
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,540
Lin Xichi, I want to have a match with you!

135
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,980
How?

136
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:59,319
Fang-fang and I have always been fighting, but

137
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:04,339
he's the one who's never left me.

138
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,000
Auntie, don't worry! Lin Xichi's all right.

139
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,600
Thank you, Xu Fang. Luckily, Chi-chi has you.

140
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,340
Please take care of her!

141
00:12:54,339 --> 00:12:55,760
What's wrong?

142
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,100
What's wrong with you?

143
00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:09,040
I never thought the one who's always by my side

144
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,280
wasn't my father or mother.

145
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:16,400
It's you.

146
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,459
Don't worry! I'll always be with you.

147
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:31,320
We'll be best friends forever.

148
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:35,139
What?

149
00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:39,120
Yes, they'll start with a friendship.

150
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,540
- A friendship?
- Let's go!

151
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,420
They've been friends for so long.

152
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,360
- You know nothing.
- That's very worrisome.

153
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,880
Let's go!

154
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,339
Chi-chi, I have something to tell you.

155
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,880
I know what it is.

156
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,400
You do?

157
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,080
You've been talking to my mom behind my back.

158
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,899
You didn't have to keep me in the dark, I know you're doing it for my sake.

159
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,100
Actually, I have something else to tell you.

160
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,280
What is it?

161
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:29,060
I... This...

162
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,759
I...

163
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,880
Do you want some ice cream?

164
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,298
- Let's go then.
- Let's go!

165
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,159
- Hurry up!
- Have you never had ice cream before?
[Dairy Queen]

166
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:54,860
Here's the menu!

167
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:59,738
I wanted to eat this when I got into high school but I didn't come in once I saw the price.

168
00:14:59,738 --> 00:15:03,240
But you're a rich man, so I'll order as I wish.

169
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,539
I want this! This! This! And this!

170
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:10,179
How many do you want?

171
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,240
You'll pay for it.

172
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,680
I want two.

173
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:24,219
- Sure!
- You're so stingy.

174
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:28,080
I was cheated by a demon, so now, I'm penniless.

175
00:15:31,075 --> 00:15:33,400
[Belgian chocolate flavor]

176
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,139
One day, I was so hungry.

177
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:41,080
But I had only one coin, so I bought two buns.

178
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,098
I was walking and someone dropped ice cream on the floor.

179
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:48,219
- I didn't see it and...
- Then, you picked it up and ate it?

180
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,859
- Hi, here's your Dairy Queen.
- Thank you.

181
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,160
Eat!

182
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,758
Remember, don't ever eat food that falls on the floor.

183
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,860
What are you doing?

184
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,339
What are you looking at?

185
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:32,219
Weibo! There's a question.

186
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:38,119
- What is it?
- What does it feel like to be in love with an idiot?

187
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,239
It's a hard question indeed.

188
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:48,319
Because the one who's in love with an idiot probably isn't bright, either.

189
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:51,239
I'm too smart to answer this question.

190
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,958
But Fang-fang, don't feel too worried about it.

191
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:58,760
Someone can answer this question for you.

192
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,339
Who?

193
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,239
Your future girlfriend.

194
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,130
Let's go!

195
00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:26,800
Sister, have you arrived at the university?

196
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,780
Don't worry, I'm not a kid! I didn't get lost.

197
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,560
Zidan, I'll give you a hand.

198
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,160
Why did you come back so early?

199
00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:35,840
I'll do it myself.

200
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,659
Nie Yue will be here soon, I saw her downstairs.

201
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,659
My cup broke.

202
00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:00,939
Can you lend me yours to have some water?

203
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:04,140
I think Nie Yue has an extra cup.

204
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,230
You should use hers.

205
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,439
Sure!

206
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,099
Mr. Ye, we've ordered the dog food you recommended.

207
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,000
- Great!
- And they're selling well.
- No problem.

208
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,560
Don't worry!

209
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,339
Why did you come back so early?

210
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:53,500
I felt bored staying at home.

211
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:59,998
The owner of Qi Qi and Xiang Xiang hasn't picked them up yet?

212
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,600
She called and said she'd be here in a week.

213
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,000
But it's been more than ten days.

214
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,200
Welcome! Feel free to look around.

215
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,400
How old is your dog? What's its breed?

216
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,400
Labrador, four years old.

217
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,198
In that case, these are not suitable for it.

218
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,600
It's old enough to bite bigger sticks,

219
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,500
and chicken breast.

220
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,100
Let me help you with it.

221
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,300
Hello, Wifey.

222
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,100
Don't worry! I'm buying snacks.

223
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,800
Sure! And toys.

224
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,500
I remember.

225
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,400
What's the matter?

226
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,600
Do you need any help?

227
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,500
You're feeling unwell?

228
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,800
Our dog is dead.

229
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,800
That's my wife.

230
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:32,900
She's sick and has been in the hospital.

231
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,900
I can't bring myself to tell her.

232
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,400
I lied and said that my friend was looking after her baby dog.

233
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,000
And it's fine.

234
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,400
I'm afraid she can't accept the truth.

235
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,700
I'm sorry.

236
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,000
This is so embarrassing.

237
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,700
No, it's not.

238
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,900
I understand your feelings.

239
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,100
If I were you, I would feel very upset, too.

240
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,400
Have some water!

241
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,100
Thank you.

242
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,300
You can have these.

243
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,200
Your wife will feel relieved if she sees this.

244
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,300
You can return them when you have time later.

245
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Thank you so much.

246
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,300
I really appreciate it.

247
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,100
Sometimes, lying is also a form of love.

248
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,600
But if you were the wife in the sickbed

249
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,500
who worked hard to get well and found out the truth in the end,

250
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:05,500
could you forgive the liar?

251
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,400
Because of the lie,

252
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,700
she couldn't see her dog for the last time.

253
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:16,000
She has been robbed of her right to feel sad.

254
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,800
That's why she doesn't know if

255
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,700
the dog's still alive.

256
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,500
Don't you find that sadder?

257
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,000
I think I'd rather buy into those white lies.

258
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,400
But I didn't experience what you just said.

259
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm not sure what my reaction would be, either.

260
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,400
Actually, it feels very bad

261
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,200
to be seen as a fool.

262
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You can't complain about anything,

263
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,900
because you know everyone was doing it for your sake.

264
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,800
How was your holiday?

265
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,400
You didn't reply to my messages.

266
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,400
Nothing!

267
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,800
Nothing special about it.

268
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:23,600
If something's bothering you, you should deal with it first.

269
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,300
I agree with you.

270
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,700
Don't fall asleep!

271
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,200
What are you doing?

272
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,500
Trying to keep yourself awake for the revision?

273
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,100
What is this?

274
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,100
You should study mechanical engineering, not veterinary medicine.

275
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,400
Don't disturb me!

276
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Ever since you came back, you've been studying so hard.

277
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,400
I feel like I wasted too much time during my first year.

278
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Having a relationship isn't wasting time.

279
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
It's about your future.

280
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,800
I'm not in a relationship!

281
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,000
Yes, you're not in a relationship.

282
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,400
You've been busy working at the pet shop and dealing with the archery team.

283
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,400
- I get it, you're not in a relationship.
- Stop with the nonsense!

284
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Okay, I stop.

285
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,200
It's late, go to bed now! Stop reading, okay?

286
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,300
Okay, my class president.

287
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,900
Give me a call before you go to the archery practice tomorrow.

288
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,100
I want to sleep in but I'm afraid my alarm can't wake me up.

289
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:15,200
Professor Yan's class is at ten in the morning.

290
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,000
No problem!

291
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,100
Did you come down just to talk to me?

292
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,000
I wanted to go to the restroom.

293
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Do you have toilet paper?

294
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,800
You always use mine.

295
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,700
I need two pieces.

296
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,600
Lin Xichi, give me the toilet paper!

297
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,400
Lin Xichi!

298
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm here!

299
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,800
Chi-chi, wake...

300
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,000
What time is it?

301
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,400
Nie Yue, you...

302
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,500
Why didn't she wake me up?

303
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,000
Oh gosh, I'm late!

304
00:28:25,479 --> 00:28:29,179
I'm sure I won't pass this class, the professor even gave me a warning.

305
00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:31,459
- Why didn't you wake me up?
- I did!

306
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:34,999
I called you so many times, you hung up my first call and my second call couldn't reach you.

307
00:28:34,999 --> 00:28:37,000
I thought you woke up.

308
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,600
I didn't, I woke up at ten and ran to the classroom without even washing my face.

309
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,900
I was still late.

310
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,800
Then, who hung up on me? He Liyang and I went out at the same time.

311
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,700
Was it Xin Zidan?

312
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,100
Why did she do that again?

313
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,400
What do you mean again?

314
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,600
Someone broke my cup before the holiday.

315
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,500
She broke it? How did you know?

316
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,000
It's a blind guess.

317
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,700
Why did she break your cup?

318
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,900
Because of Xu Fang?

319
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,900
How would I know?

320
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,700
I'm full!

321
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,800
Feeling unhappy?

322
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,900
- Nope!
- Why?

323
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,800
Xin Zidan.

324
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,800
Where is that Big Brother Chi who's not afraid of anything or anyone?

325
