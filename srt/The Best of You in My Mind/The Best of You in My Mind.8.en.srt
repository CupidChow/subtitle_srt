00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:06,340
♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,798
♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

4
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:13,100
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,920
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,509
♫ or pretend to be indifferent. ♫

7
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:23,840
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,500
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,460
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,365
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11
00:00:39,365 --> 00:00:46,376
♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

12
00:00:46,376 --> 00:00:53,000
♫ Love is like a migratory bird waiting for the season. ♫

13

♫ How long does it take for them to be aware of each other? ♫

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,320
♫ You are like summer night, ♫

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,930
♫ I'm like a little star in the sky, ♫

16
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:12,990
♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:16,511
♫ Deliberately, I hit your shoulder, ♫

18
00:01:16,512 --> 00:01:21,155
♫ and then, listen to your reprimand. ♫

19
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:26,835
♫ The caring feeling is so sweet! ♫

[Episode 8]

22
00:01:33,919 --> 00:01:37,239
What kind of girls do guys like?

23
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:41,139
Don't bother knowing why, just tell me!

24
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:44,460
Girls with flying long hair who wear white dresses.

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,299
Girls who know how to be coy.

26
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:48,720
Do all guys like girls like that?

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,499
In short, you're not that kind of girl.

28
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:56,120
Why are you asking me this?

29
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,099
- I'm not telling you!
- My meal...!

30
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,559
Say,

31
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:16,759
did she just ask me about the kind of girl I like?

32
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,499
You look good in white.

33
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:53,099
Really?

34
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,439
Let's go!

35
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:01,939
Have you had breakfast yet?

36
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:49,019
I heard that girls like drawing at studios.

37
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,260
I wonder if you like it or not.

38
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,160
Yes, I do.

39
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,419
You're running out of time.

40
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,440
Okay, not bad.

41
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:10,710
You... You like Picasso too?

42
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:14,580
Did you know... we both drew Picasso's dog/

43
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,740
The Lump you drew is the most famous dog of Picasso's.

44
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,920
Picasso once said that

45
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,270
Lump wasn't a dog or a friend.

46
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,940
It was a very unique existence.

47
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,759
Picasso had many dogs.

48
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,539
But Lump was the only one that appears in his thirteen paintings.

49
00:05:33,619 --> 00:05:38,500
Does this mean we have a connection?

50
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:50,040
Chi-chi, let's exchange gifts, shall we?

51
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,420
You want this?

52
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,359
It's a simple yet vivid painting.

53
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,079
- I'm flattered.
- Here.

54
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,720
You dropped this.

55
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,759
It's alright.

56
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:45,339
Actually, you look good with short or long hair.

57
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:53,278
Excuse me, here's your steak.

58
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,979
Thank you.

59
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:57,860
Thank you.

60
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,560
Enjoy your food.

61
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,239
Let's eat!

62
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:07,480
I ordered this for you but I'm not sure if you like it.

63
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,920
I'm sure it's good, Senior Ye.

64
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,599
Filet mignon is taken from the rare part of the cow carcass.

65
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,920
I find it very delicious.

66
00:07:22,659 --> 00:07:25,719
What's wrong? Is it too raw?

67
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,439
No, it's not.

68
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,299
I just suddenly thought of the drawing from the anatomy class.

69
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:48,440
Where's the filet located?

70
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,252
About here.

71
00:07:51,252 --> 00:07:53,759
It's where injections are done.

72
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,140
In order to preserve its sciatic nerve,

73
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:59,740
injections must be done on the front and upper part of its body.

74
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,459
Below the loin, right?

75
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:15,080
Why am I talking about anatomy while we're eating?

76
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,759
I've been talking about my interest, are you feeling bored?

77
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,630
Not really!

78
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,860
Just that...

79
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,320
as a freshman, you haven't learned about the anatomy of the cow yet, right?

80
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:02,659
Be careful!

81
00:09:02,659 --> 00:09:04,319
Let's not go back yet.

82
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,460
I'll take you to another place.

83
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,100
Let's go!

84
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,740
Look! My friend owns this shop.

85
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,150
Enjoy yourself here.

86
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,520
There are so many dogs here.

87
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,899
Labrador, husky,

88
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:40,899
Schnauzer,

89
00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:43,000
and Bulldog.

90
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,680
You seem to know a lot about dogs.

91
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,899
And they're all purebred.

92
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:51,439
Of course! Our pet shop provides advanced care services.

93
00:09:51,439 --> 00:09:55,439
So many of our pets are purebred dogs which have had competitions.

94
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:59,159
It's a Westie.

95
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,599
Can I carry him?

96
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:06,599
Sure.

97
00:10:06,599 --> 00:10:08,799
Come to me.

98
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,859
Carry on with your work.

99
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,799
I guess this moment is the happiest you've been all day.

100
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:19,859
I've had a lot of fun the entire day.

101
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:44,840
Xu Fang.

102
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,080
Let's go!

103
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:49,280
Xu Fang. Jiang Zhengxu.

104
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,400
Don't you have practice today?

105
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,458
Wait, what are you wearing? Don't you find it ugly?

106
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,500
We went out today.

107
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:02,118
What kind of girls do guys like?

108
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,879
Girls with flying long hair who wear white dresses

109
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,280
and who know how to be coy.

110
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,319
We went to the art gallery for a drawing session.

111
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,659
We also had steak together.

112
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:13,659
Don't you think you look like Sadako?

113
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:15,259
You look so terrifying.

114
00:11:15,259 --> 00:11:16,999
I...

115
00:11:16,999 --> 00:11:18,899
Xu Fang!

116
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,660
Don't take it seriously!

117
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,640
He's always been this rude.

118
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,700
I'm used to it.

119
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,360
Senior, I'll go now.

120
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:38,619
Thank you for hanging out with me today.

121
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,900
Xu Fang! I won't talk to you ever again.

122
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,479
Didn't you say guys liked this style?

123
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,180
Do I look like Sadako?

124
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:19,620
Lin Xichi, you just wait and see!

125
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,019
Lin Xichi, tell me!

126
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:25,459
did you not wait for me on purpose?

127
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:28,358
I woke up at 6:00 a.m. and came to school at 6:30 a.m.

128
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:31,258
You have no idea how fresh the morning air is.

129
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:34,420
And I don't have to risk being late while waiting for someone.

130
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,400
- You...
- You, what you?

131
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:40,238

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,620
What are we going to eat?

167
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,480
Why aren't you wearing the outfit from yesterday?

168
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,659
You looked good in it and that wig.

169
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,259
I'm Sadako.

170
00:14:57,259 --> 00:14:59,819
I'm afraid to scare you with that look.

171
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:02,779
What are we going to eat?

172
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:04,919
I can't let you scold me for nothing.

173
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:08,240
I know what you like to eat.

174
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,940
Xu Fang, you know me well.

175
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,259
I had steak yesterday, but I wasn't full at all.

176
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:17,339
I went back to school and the canteen had closed.

177
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:20,800
- I was so hungry.
- Here!

178
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,999
- This one is my favorite.
- Be careful, it's hot!

179
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:27,599
I'm not afraid of it! I used to get a stomach ache from having deep-fried tofu.

180
00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:30,420
We used to skip classes for this.

181
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,039
I even skipped classes by forging our parents' signatures.

182
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,480
My father was called to come to the school,

183
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,200
wondering why we always got sick together.

184
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,599
I used to write your essays and the teacher never found out.

185
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:47,458
At the time, we collected the Yugioh cards.

186
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,058
I even got a rare card, do you remember it?

187
00:15:50,058 --> 00:15:54,759
The one I asked for on my birthday.

188
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,098
Fang-fang, today's my birthday. Enjoy these candies!

189
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,899
Awesome!

190
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,558
You're being so nice today.

191
00:16:13,558 --> 00:16:17,239
Then, what do you want for your birthday?

192
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:26,119
Look! I just need one more card.

193
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,219
Then I'll return these candies to you then.

194
00:16:35,219 --> 00:16:38,119
No!

195
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:40,219
I wasted my one-month allowance.

196
00:16:40,219 --> 00:16:43,359
If I give it to you now, would you accept it?

197
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:45,900
Right now, I won't need it.

198
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,099
I used to beg for it but you didn't give it to me.

199
00:16:50,099 --> 00:16:54,058
I don't collect them anymore, so even if you insist, I won't accept it.

200
00:16:54,058 --> 00:16:56,559
Are you sure?

201
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,620
Something is wrong with you.

202
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,418
Spit it out! Why are you doing this?

203
00:17:05,418 --> 00:17:07,279
What are you talking about?

204
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,578
Isn't your birthday next week? This is your birthday present.

205
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:14,140
Yeah, my birthday is next week.

206
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:17,519
But our class will visit a farm next week.

207
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,480
We will be back at night.

208
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,340
Night?

209
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:25,880
Is Senior Ye going, too?

210
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,779
I guess so.

211
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,900
After that, I'll have dinner with my mother.

212
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:45,559
What a coincidence!

213
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:47,159
Right.

214
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:49,519
Go straight and turn right.

215
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,339
- Turn right?
- Turn right.

216
00:18:17,439 --> 00:18:20,439
Let's go home now! I'll make it for you at home.

217
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,440
Chi-chi.

218
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,518
- Mom.
- What's wrong?

219
00:18:35,518 --> 00:18:37,739
Here.

220
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:39,118
You're hungry, aren't you?

221
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,078
Let's have something good.

222
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,259
Mom, sit.

223
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,940
Mom, I've bought you a burger.

224
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:54,179
Great.

225
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,459
Isn't it delicious?

226
00:19:02,459 --> 00:19:04,259
Yes, it is.

227
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,240
Chi-chi, your birthday's in a few days.

228
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,980
You're turning nineteen soon.

229
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,139
- You still remember it?
- Of course, I do.

230
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:19,599
Mothers always remember their children's birthdays.

231
00:19:21,439 --> 00:19:25,519
But I wish you wouldn't grow up as fast,

232
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:28,339
so that I could grow old slowly.

233
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:36,459
Mom, are you available on Wednesday?

234
00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:38,459
Let's have dinner together.

235
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:40,259
Sure.

236
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,380
My daughter's grown up.

237
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,240
She's now a good and pretty lady.

238
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:51,799
Do guys from your school chase after you?

239
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:53,860
Do you like any of them?

240
00:19:54,699 --> 00:19:56,399
Mom.

241
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,979
Feeling shy?

242
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:02,979
Nineteen is the best age.

243
00:20:02,979 --> 00:20:05,579
Love is the most beautiful at this age.

244
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,579
It's so good to be young.

245
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:14,620
Did you meet my father when you were my age?

246
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:19,419
Yes. We were at the same university

247
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,980
but we studied different courses.

248
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,759
Your father didn't talk much.

249
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,660
That's why others thought he was not so friendly.

250
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:32,999
But during the cold winters, he always sent me jujube juice.

251
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,939
Always.

252
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:36,980
At that time, I thought

253
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,539
he didn't know how to make me happy or sweet talk me,

254
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,539
but he could give me warmth.

255
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:47,100
That's why I knew no matter what happened in the future,

256
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,860
he'd always make me jujube juice.

257
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,500
That's why I got married to him after graduation.

258
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:58,800
I've never thought my dad was that sweet.

259
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:03,180
I thought he had been a strict person since he was young.

260
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,918
Did you know? When I was little, my classmates came to our place for a meal.

261
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:10,819
And they all said my dad looked like a killer.

262
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,399
But he has been taking care of both of you.

263
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:19,798
I don't think so.

264
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:22,359
He never made us a proper meal.

265
00:21:22,359 --> 00:21:25,979
He didn't know how to cook fish at all.

266
00:21:25,979 --> 00:21:30,539
Both Lin Xigeng and I survived all these years because we're independent enough.

267
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,898
Both of you have had a miserable childhood because I wasn't with you all the time.

268
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,819
Luckily, both of you grew up well.

269
00:21:41,539 --> 00:21:43,339
Mom,

270
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:47,558
actually, it's not your fault.

271
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:49,719
I understand why you left.

272
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,380
No woman would be able to live with my serious father.

273
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,940
But to think about it again,

274
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,300
I still hope that

275
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,080
you guys could reconcile and get along well.

276
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:08,939
Because Lin Xigeng and I still need a home after all.

277
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,120
Mom, how long have you not talked to my dad?

278
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,939
For a long time.

279
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:26,159
I don't know what to say.

280
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,240
I'm back.

281
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,140
You're back.

282
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,280
Dad has a WeChat ID.

283
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,260
I can ask him to add Mom's WeChat ID.

284
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,020
Zidan,

285
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:32,700
can one own two WeChat IDs?

286
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,840
Yes, it's like having two QQ IDs.

287
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,139
Xin Zidan, how could you do that?

288
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:51,538
Why didn't you help me take my parcel? I was using Cainiao, too.

289
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:53,779
I didn't know that; you didn't ask me to do so.

290
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:55,659
I'll help you next time.

291
00:23:55,659 --> 00:23:57,780
Where are the others?

292
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,839

Nie Yue.

294
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,180
What does your mother share on her Moments?

295
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,678
Health information and rumors! Here's one of them.

296
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:20,239
The first one is about the five main factors for cancer.

297
00:24:20,239 --> 00:24:23,139
- You must share this on your Moments, otherwise—
- Hold on, hold on!

298
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:25,780
Just send me all of them.

299
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,200
Done! Check them out.

[Lin Chang Ge]: Chang Ge, it's me Fang-fang.

303
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,319
This should do, shouldn't it?

304
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:10,700
Should I add more?

305
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:17,700
Nie Yue, if a middle-aged man

306
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:21,318
doesn't reply to a middle-aged woman's messages,

307
00:25:21,318 --> 00:25:23,519
should she keep texting him?

308
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,179
I'm not a middle-aged woman, so I'm not sure about that.

309
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:31,700
But I'm sure they're more reserved than us.

310
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,420
You're smart!

311
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:41,739
[Lin Chang Ge]: I met our daughter today.

312
00:25:41,739 --> 00:25:44,279
and we talked about many things.

313

We talked about many things in the past.

314

I remembered the jujube juice

315
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:03,160
you gave me when we were young.

316

Our daughter has grown up.

317
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:13,880
I hope one day she could meet someone sweet, too.

318

It's a great idea.

Mind your own business! All these years, you never took care of our children.

You don't need to do so now either.

322

Hello, Sister.

323
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:45,799
Is Dad at home?

Yes, he's cooking.

I pretended to be mom and sent him some messages on WeChat

329
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:09,818
But he sounded so cold saying not to worry about.

330
00:27:09,818 --> 00:27:11,720
Is he alright?

331
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:15,958
Why are you playing such a childish game? You're going to mess things up.

332
00:27:15,958 --> 00:27:19,899
Dad is already doing so well! He goes to work and comes home on time.

333
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:21,438
You know him very well.

334
00:27:21,438 --> 00:27:25,860
He's a stubborn person who is not good at words.

335
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:29,138
- Did you say something cringy?
- No, I didn't.

336
00:27:29,138 --> 00:27:33,139
I think you should stop it; you know how intense their relationship is.

337
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:37,179
Stop being penny-wise and pound-foolish! You'll mess things up.

338
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:39,960
If there's nothing else, I'll hang up now.

339
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,359
I have things to do! Bye-bye.

340
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,279
- Hello.
- Hello.

341
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,438
- Hello.
- Hello.

342
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:05,980
Hello.

343
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,779
Hello, Nie Yue! I'm here.

344
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:11,938
Okay, wait for me! I'll be there soon.

345
00:28:11,938 --> 00:28:14,899
- Sure, I'll wait here.
- Okay.

346
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,820
You scared me.

347
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,320
Thank you.

348
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,719
Nie Yue, you're amazing!

349
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:40,378
This is so cool! I've decided to paste them on my wall.

350
00:28:40,378 --> 00:28:43,298
And I'll give the rest of them to my friends and relatives.

351
00:28:43,298 --> 00:28:46,499
You're giving them to your friends and relatives?

352
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:49,081
- That's right!
- Where will they paste them?

353
00:28:49,081 --> 00:28:53,519
Their doors! I'm so good-looking, bad guys would run away from seeing my face.

354
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:58,340
It seems that you're quite confident with your appearance.

355
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:05,339
What are you doing here at this late hour?

356
00:29:05,339 --> 00:29:07,440
It's so dark here, aren't you scared?

357
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,939
I haven't finished my experiment yet, so that's why I decided to do it tonight.

358
00:29:11,939 --> 00:29:15,100
Can I go check it out?

359
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:20,398
- We... It's going to be—
- It's okay! I don't have anything to do anyway.

360
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:22,439
I-I-I'll come with you.

361
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:25,859
- Let's go, then.
- Let's go.

362
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,519
What's the experiment about?

363
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,659
We will actually be doing a dissection...

364
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:39,199
- Don't touch it!
- I didn't, the water came out by itself.

365
00:29:39,199 --> 00:29:41,499
Wear it! You're in the lab now.

366
00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:43,300
Okay.

367
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,360
Put it on the floor.

368
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,200
Do I look cool?

369
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,879
Sit down.

370
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:10,800
If you feel nauseous, I'll get you a mask.

371
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,919
No, I'm not. I'm hungry.

372
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,519
I didn't know you were this hardworking.

373
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,100
It's so late already, but you're still studying here.

374
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:24,099
That's right! It's because I'm the class monitor, I need to be good at doing experiments.

375
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:28,760
Besides, my ambition is to become a great doctor.

376
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,679
Awesome!

377
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:35,039
Ar-Are you guys specifically just cutting beef?

378
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:39,600
No? No, I mean

379
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,999
beef is nice and healthy.

380
00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:46,338
Because I'm an athlete, our coach always asks us to eat beef.

381
00:30:46,338 --> 00:30:49,340
Because beef is rich in protein.

382
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:53,778
- I'll help you.
- Don't touch it.

383
00:30:53,778 --> 00:30:55,880
Don't touch it!

384
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,560
Stay still!

385
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,579
Dr. Nie, your WeChat profile picture

386
00:31:08,579 --> 00:31:11,678
is a cartoonish boy.

387
00:31:11,678 --> 00:31:15,300
Is that you-your boyfriend?

388
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,540
No.

389
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,160
That's good. Then, who-who is he?

390
00:31:30,459 --> 00:31:32,360
Mr. Hei Yu.

391
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:40,620
The Hei Yu... who sings and dances.

392
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,780
That one.

393
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:47,380
Yes, yes, yes!

394
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,460
He's so cool!

395
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,418
- I know you're disgusted by me.
- No.

396
00:31:57,418 --> 00:31:59,859
No, I'm not.

397
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:02,580
I'm just... I'm surprised.

398
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:07,199
I never thought you're part of

399
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:09,080
those crazy fan clubs.

400
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,140
Actually, I'm crazy.

401
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,219
What do you do for your idol?

402
00:32:15,219 --> 00:32:17,779
I'm in charge of online fan support.

403
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:21,740
I'm the team leader of design in our fan club.

404
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:27,258
Got it! You learned how to design when were a part of the fan club?

405
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,640
Smart!

406
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,740
I'm a genius after all.

407
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:37,538
Do you have enough time for all this? You need to study, cut beef, and...

408
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:41,560
No, you need to study well and...

409
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,200
do things for the fan club.

410
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,238
Because I have my love.

411
00:32:46,239 --> 00:32:48,400
Love is my source of energy.

412
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,819
- Actually...
- Love is your source of energy?

413
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,500
It's hot in here.

414
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,119
I think it's not possible for one to produce good works

415
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:06,580
without strong determination.

416
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,679
That means Hei Yu's your source of determination?

417
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,900
How should I put it?

418
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,639
He is and isn't.

419
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:16,900
Have you read "The Little Prince"?

420
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:21,299
There's this one sentence in the book.

421
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,800
My rose is so important

422
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:27,280
because I've spent so much time on it.

423
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:32,419
I've been a fan of Mr. Hei Yu since he was a rookie.

424
00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:36,599
I noticed how hardworking he always was; that's why I work hard all the time.

425
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:40,519
I saw him improve step by step,

426
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:45,480
so I think I can do that to become who I want to become.

427
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:50,880
His existence is positive energy in my life.

428
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,159
The thought of him staying up doing this

429
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:58,200
motivates me to finish my experiment.

430
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,300
Even though I don't fully understand it, I got the gist of it.

431
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,039
It's not complicated at all,

432
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:10,079
the same as you loving archery championships.

433
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:13,380
Then, do your parents know about it?

434
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,979
I'd better not tell them.

435
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,060
Why not?

436
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,700
I don't want them to worry about me.

437
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,559
Are you sure you're not disgusted by me?

438
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:30,338
Of course, not!

439
00:34:30,338 --> 00:34:32,258
I've got to thank Mr. Hei Yu.

440
00:34:32,258 --> 00:34:35,459
Because of him, I get to own these cool posters.

441
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,198
Sister, you're getting old! Please grow taller.

442
00:35:06,198 --> 00:35:08,120
Happy birthday!

Happy birthday, Silly Dog!

444
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:12,599

May you be happy always!

449
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,139
Your boyfriend is so sweet!

450
00:35:37,139 --> 00:35:40,139
When will I get a sweet boyfriend, too?

451
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:43,918
- It's just a pair of slippers, how is it sweet?
- No, you're wrong!

452
00:35:43,918 --> 00:35:48,218
Things such as slippers, towel, and cups that are daily necessities are useful everyday.

453
00:35:48,218 --> 00:35:51,619
And they'll always remind you of him. How sweet!

454
00:35:51,619 --> 00:35:54,420
I know, right? What a thoughtful man!

455
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:57,079
You're exaggerating.

456
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:00,118
- He got you all these for the winter.
- That's very nice of him!

We should check out that pet shop, too.

458

Fifteen minutes? Why didn't you wake me up?

00:36:16,539 --> 00:36:19,559
I did but you ignored me. Hurry up!

00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:10,740
calm the animals down while examining them.

489
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:14,859
They're not humans, so they won't listen to you when you tell them to stay still.

490
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:18,179
Moreover, sick animals tend to be emotionally unstable.

491
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:22,159
It's very important to know how to control and examine them.

492
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:25,978
First, get to know about them through their owners.

493
00:38:25,978 --> 00:38:28,419
Then, with the help of the owners,

494
00:38:28,419 --> 00:38:30,799
go near them from the left-hand side.

495
00:38:30,799 --> 00:38:33,778
Never approach them from behind for they'll get frightened.

496
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:37,000
For goats, we usually calm them

497
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,419
by holding their horns and getting on their backs.

498
00:38:39,419 --> 00:38:42,360
I'm going to show you all how to do it.

499
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:46,179
First, hold the horns to stable it.

500
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:48,800
Then, get on its body

501
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,258
and lock it using your thighs.

502
00:38:52,258 --> 00:38:56,199
Then, you may start examining, treating, or getting it vaccinated.

503
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:59,738
- Does everyone understand?
- Yes.

504
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,400
Good goat!

505
00:39:04,399 --> 00:39:09,620
Okay, you may try that method on the goat.

506
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,359
Just be extra careful! Would anyone want to try?

507
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:17,398
- Nie Yue, I'll hold the goat for you.
- No, I don't want to! You should do it first.

508
00:39:17,398 --> 00:39:19,358
- I'll hold it for you.
- I don't want to.
- Nie Yue, try it!

509
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:21,859
- Get her stuff! Let her be the first.
- Go! Be the first one!

510
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,899
- Chi-chi, you can do it!
- You can do it!

511
00:39:23,899 --> 00:39:25,679
Be careful, Chi-chi!

512
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:27,559
- Is it a good goat?
- Yes. Really!

513
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:28,718
- Can I do it?
- Be careful, hold them tight!

514
00:39:28,718 --> 00:39:30,718
- It's going well.
- Yes, hold tight!

515
00:39:30,718 --> 00:39:34,219
- It likes you.
- But I'm scared to get on its body.
- It's a good goat.

516
00:39:34,219 --> 00:39:35,939
Be careful! Don't sit on the goat.

517
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:37,518
Good! Okay, look!

518
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:39,879
- Like this?
- Yes.

519
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:42,139
Good job!

520
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:54,360

[ Melody by Qiao Lin - Lyrics by Xueran Chen and Qiao Lin]

521
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:58,030
♫ Not so difficult! ♫

522
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:03,270
♫ Making a choice is not so difficult. ♫

523
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:09,960
♫ It’s all warm and scattered expectation. ♫

524
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,660
♫ Not so difficult! ♫

525
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:18,200
♫ Making a decision is not so difficult. ♫

526
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:24,940
♫ Nothing more than day and night mediocre bravery. ♫

527
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:31,730
♫ People hesitate so they've missed many fulfillment, ♫

528
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:37,700
♫ always at a loss and in a hurry but feel terribly upset. ♫

529
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:41,160
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

530
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:45,520
♫ A smile is really not that difficult. ♫

531
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:51,320
♫ Unconsciously, we will eventually dry our tears. ♫

532
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,920
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

533
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,220
♫ A promise is really not that difficult. ♫

534
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:05,040
♫ How could the regret of the past represent today? ♫

535
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,670
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

536
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:12,960
♫ A hug is really not that difficult. ♫

537
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,820
♫ Our time isn't worthy to be entangled with loneliness. ♫

538
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,300
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

539
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,690
♫ Loving someone is really not that difficult ♫

540
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:29,970
♫ Loving someone is really not that difficult ♫

541
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:38,180
♫ Loving someone is really not that difficult ♫
