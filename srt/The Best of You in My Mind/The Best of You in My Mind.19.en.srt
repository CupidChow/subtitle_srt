00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:06,360
♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,780
♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,190
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,030
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:20,590
♫ or pretend to be indifferent. ♫

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,830
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,600
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,520
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,590
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:46,540
♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

12
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:53,030
♫ Love is like a migratory bird waiting for the season. ♫

♫ How long does it take for them to be aware of each other? ♫

♫ You are like summer night, ♫

♫ I'm like a little star in the sky, ♫

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,080
♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

17

♫ Deliberately, I hit your shoulder, ♫

18
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,180
♫ and listen to your reprimand. ♫

[Episode 19]

22
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,930
Hello, Xu Fang.

23
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,431
Hello.

24
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:58,840
How are you recently? I haven't heard from you for a while.

25
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,470
You're back?

26
00:02:00,472 --> 00:02:02,060
Yes.

27
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,520
Let's meet up!

28
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,539
All right! Have you eaten?

29
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:11,070
Why don't we have something nice?

30
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,160
Sure! See you at the school entrance.

31
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,699
Okay. Wait for me! I'll be there soon.

32
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,880
You're finally back! I missed you so much.

33
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,570
I have so many words...

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,660
Do you feel better?

35
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,610
Chi-chi,

36
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,800
I have something to tell you.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,720
Go ahead!

38
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,720
I'm planning...

39
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,520
to train abroad for a while.

40
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,180
Go abroad? Why?

41
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,080
Am I annoying to you?

42
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,250
First, you hid in the mountains.

43
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,120
Now, you want to go abroad after finally coming back.

44
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,979
Do you want to avoid me so badly?

45
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,300
No, it just that... actually, it's because

46
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:40,600
this is an opportunity that is very important for me.

47
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,320
I understand that everyone is planning

48
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,140
for their future after graduation.

49
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,540
It just... It just that I didn't think that

50
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,820
you will leave me out of your plans.

51
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,520
You're just like my mother, always thinking about yourself and leaving me whenever you feel like it!

52
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:08,100
- That's not true!
- Why did you leave me when I needed you the most?

53
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,899
You can leave! I don't need your pity.

54
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,620
I don't mind breaking up.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,380
Have you made a decision?

56
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,130
Coach,

57
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,960
I don't think I should go.

58
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,480
Why not? It's the only way for you to compete again.

59
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,240
Is it because of Lin Xichi?

60
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,140
Her mother left when she was a child.

61
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,400
It left a huge impact on her.

62
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,240
It is difficult for her to believe that someone who left will return to her again.

63
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,190
We'll definitely break up if I insist on leaving.

64
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,670
So, Coach,

65
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,040
I don't think I should go.

66
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,700
Xu Fang, I understand what you are saying,

67
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,140
but you need to think about yourself.

68
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,020
If you give up archery for this

69
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,380
and let an obstacle defeat you,

70
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,260
then your hard work for all these years will be wasted.

71
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,020
You can't disappoint yourself,

72
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,100
even though you don't want to disappoint Lin Xichi.

73
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,280
Coach, I've made my decision.

74
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,680
Sorry!

75
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,860
I was so stupid! I shouldn't have turned a blind eye.

76
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,320
Why did I let you date her?

77
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,940
You had another quarrel with Brother Fang?

78
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,720
It's not just another quarrel, we might break up.

79
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,939
Is that necessary? Only because he is going abroad?

80
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:27,059
It is! I was never part of his plans.

81
00:07:27,059 --> 00:07:29,250
You can't only look at his current plans!

82
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,110
You need to look further into the future, 5 years, 10 years from now.

83
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:36,499
I don't have to! If he won't be with me now, he won't be with me later.

84
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,980
I realized something after her accident.

85
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,000
As long as she's healthy and safe,

86
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,660
whether she wants to be with me or where she is,

87
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,420
it's not important.

88
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,700
As long as she can live healthily and happily,

89
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,500
I'll already be satisfied.

90
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,460
Love is about fulfilling the wish of the other and not possession.

91
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,840
If his dreams are somewhere far away,

92
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,460
let him go so he can fulfill his dreams.

93
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,439
I can't do it! I want Xu Fang by my side even if he is sick.

94
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,579
I want to take care of him, I don't want us to be separated!

95
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:17,859
- Sister.
- I can't talk with you.

96
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:24,459
I didn't think that Lin Xigeng has matured so much after all these years.

97
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:27,000
Although I was stubborn just now,

98
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,770
I need to admit that what he said was right.

99
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,020
How could I want Xu Fang to stay by my side

100
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,340
even if he is sick?

101
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,180
Chi-chi! I finally found you.

102
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,680
- Someone wants to see you.
- Who is it?

103
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,259
Just follow me, then you'll know. Let's go!

104
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,200
Coach.

105
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,400
Look at his target!

106
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,280
He... What's wrong with him?

107
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,380
- Target panic.
- Target panic?

108
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,320
He has it for some time, no one knows except for me.

109
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,140
Once an archery athlete suffers from target panic,

110
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,120
his career is as good as over.

111
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,740
How? He has never told me before.

112
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,100
He hasn't told anyone.

113
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,020
It caused him to underperform at the team event

114
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,500
and fall out with his teammates a few days ago.

115
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,960
I think his pride

116
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,980
doesn't allow him to be a loser in front of everyone.

117
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,800
Why is he such a fool?

118
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,180
I told him to go abroad to go through recovery training two days ago.

119
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,620
That is his only chance,

120
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,580
but he rejected it.

121
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,560
He told me that he doesn't want to leave you here alone.

122
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,620
I...

123
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,120
It's all my fault.

124
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,440
It's my fault.

125
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,159
Don't be sad!

126
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,040
I am too selfish.

127
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,179
You didn't know his situation, either. Right?

128
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,620
I thought he wanted to go abroad,

129
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,320
because he wanted to break up with me after graduation.

130
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,420
I doubted him when he needed me the most.

131
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,360
Why am I so selfish?

132
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,180
That's enough.

133
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,660
Tell me why I am so selfish?

134
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,000
Don't cry!

135
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,859
Do you know? You're the only one who can motivate Xu Fang now.

136
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,300
You heard me?

137
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,020
Don't cry! You look so silly.

138
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,660
How do I look?

139
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,019
It's an A-line dress! Now, my waist looks smaller, right?

140
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:43,700
Turn around for me!

141
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,640
Much better!

142
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,300
I'm leaving.

143
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,220
Good luck!

144
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,740
Good luck!

Let's go and eat!

147
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Why are you here?

148
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,400
I'm hungry, let's go and have something delicious!

149
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,599
Go by yourself! Didn't you want to break up?

150
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,540
Did I? Did I say that?

151
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,279
Why can't I remember? Maybe I have amnesia.

152
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,420
But you still remember that I'm your dad.

153
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,659
Dad. Dad. Let's go, dad!

154
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:56,460
I want to eat something nice. Treat me to something delicious!

155
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,700
Treat me since you're my dad.

156
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,760
Here it is.

157
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,380
Your juice.

158
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,900
Such a clumsy person!

159
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,950
- Who let such a person work here?
- Sorry, sorry! Thank you.

160
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:16,200
Jiang Zhengxu works here?

161
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,660
- Since when?
- After the winter break.

162
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,960
Jiang Zhengxu stopped practising when you quit the team.

163

He stopped? Why?

00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,420
Ask him yourself!

165
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,439
- Hello.
- Hello.

166
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,879
I want a waffle and strawberry juice, also a latte.

167
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,420
All right!

168
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,540
Is latte fine?

169
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,920
For Table 5.

170
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,940
Jiang Zhengxu, we came here specially

171
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,320
because Xu Fang wanted to eat the waffles here.

172
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,300
Oh, no! Xu Fang, how could I forget about my morning classes?

173
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,539
No need! You can have my strawberry juice.

174
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,239
What's wrong? Why did you stop practising?

175
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,440
None of your business!

176
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,280
Let's talk!

177
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,400
Sure!

178
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,360
But that's only because Lin Xichi begged me.

179
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,000
Lin Xichi?

180
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,320
I don't want her to see you in a weak state.

181
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,700
Why did you come here?

182
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,080
Why didn't I hear about any of these?

183
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,900
It's not important.

184
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,020
It's a family problem.

185
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,140
It will only get me

186
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:11,280
some pity and words of comfort if I told you.

187
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,060
There's no point!

188
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,240
During the New Year,

189
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,220
my dad fell sick.

190
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,200
His business partner took all his money.

191
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,440
My mom was too afraid to go out because of the debt collectors.

192
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,780
Paint was splashed on our door and broken glass was all over the floor.

193
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:45,140
She had no choice, so we had to move.

194
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,660
I realized my family's situation is not how it used to be.

195
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,860
I can't afford to spend any more money on archery.

196
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,240
I'm a man, so I need to do something.

197
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:04,320
So I thought that my graduation is a nice end.

198
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,060
After competing in the National College Archery Invitational, it would be perfect.

199
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,620
But I... I never thought that

200
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,880
my perfectly planned ending of my college life was ruined by you.

201
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,200
You're still laughing? You dare to laugh? Laugh?

202
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,640
Xu Fang, you're great!

203
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,480
No wonder you're my best brother.

204
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,940
Well, you can still train

205
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,140
as an amateur player while working.

206
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,600
I'm not you.

207
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:50,420
I know that I've already reached my full ability in archery.

208
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:54,160
I can never be the individual event's champion. Right?

209
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,309
♫ We've had our chaotic youths ♫

210
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:01,820
♫ But we still remember how our hearts beat ♫

211
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,200
Can you tell me,

212
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,200
what Ding Yi told you that day?

213
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,740
Congratulations!

214
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,140
Thank you!

215
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,880
I'm sorry! I accidentally overheard your conversation with your girlfriend.

Many people have high hopes for us.

220
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,120
Our parents. Our coach.

221
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,460
Our teammates. Our girlfriend.

222
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,600
We can't disappoint them.

223
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,340
What a pity!

224
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,320
I still lost in the end.

00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,900
We can never take part in this competition anymore.

We've prepared for this for three years. Don't disappoint me!

♫ Who is the one who helps you ♫

236

Xu Fang.

237
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,560
Actually, in my heart,

238
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,759
you are the genius archer.

239
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,039
♫ We've had our chaotic youths ♫

240
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,140
When we were young, I always lost to you in archery.

241
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,580
I've always lost, how could I not be angry?

242
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,520
But you know what?

243
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,520
I'm not jealous of you at all but happy for you.

I like archery, I love archery.

247
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,800
But what I hope to see

248
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,960
is the moment when you become a champion on television.

249
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,870
How awesome that would be!

250
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,500

263
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,650
Xu Fang,

264
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:26,760
kick my butt!

265
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,200
Why should I do that?

266
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,299
Just do it, kick me! I need some power.

267
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:35,679
You... Stand still! Where?

268
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,999
- Here.
- One.

269
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,720
Two.

270
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,859
Wait, wait!

271
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,160
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

272
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,660
I pretended to be an arrow

273
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,520
but I still can't hit the gold ring.

274
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:16,260
Do you know what my biggest dream is

275
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:20,720
every day at this archery range?

276
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,160
It's definitely not getting the champion.

277
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,900
That's right!

278
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,160
My dream is never to become a champion.

279
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,280
I know I won't make it.

280
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,040
My biggest dream

281
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:49,100
is to join every competition available.

282
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,420
How tough it is!

283
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,800
Every competition!

284
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:03,500
If I get the chance to be greedy,

285
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,690
the World Championships,

286
00:25:06,690 --> 00:25:09,320
the World Cup,

287
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,970
and even the Olympics,

288
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,580
I want to participate in all of them.

289
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,390
It's alright if I'm not in the finals.

290
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,940
Rankings are not that important.

291
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,220
As long as I'm able to participate,

292
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,420
it means Jiang Zhengxu,

293
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,900
it means that I, Jiang Zhengxu,

294
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,940
am awesome.

295
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:46,040
It's true! This is the dream that supports me.

296
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,740
It keeps me going on to improve myself.

297
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,260
I believe that as long as I work hard,

298
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,500
I'll be able

299
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,700
to represent the country and participate in these competitions.

300
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,560
I'll be wearing the national team's jersey;

301
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,360
the one in red.

302
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,440
Rankings are not important.

303
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,800
Winning a champion is not important, either.

304
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,540
I already win if I only get to participate in those competitions.

305
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:24,500
I win if I don't give up!

306
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,220
However, my dream will never come true.

307
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:42,640
Xu Fang, you are the only one who can make my dream come true.

308
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,180
But you punk...

309
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,840
You wanted to quit the team.

310
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,141
Do you know how much I love to see you shoot an arrow?

311
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,560
Fast, accurate, and resolute!

312
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,380
You're a natural-born athlete, you know that?

313
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,000
All right!

314
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,600
I promise you!

315
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,890
Your dream,

316
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,580
I'll help you fulfill it.

317
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,220
You promised!

318
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,600
I'll leave him to you.

319
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,800
Why are you here?

320
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,740
I'll always be by your side.

321
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,460
How was your chat with Jiang Zhengxu?

322
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,020
Let's talk!

323
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:25,360
Don't say anything, let me listen!

324
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,040
I'm sorry!

325
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:58,320
I didn't even know that you were sick.

326
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,260
Do you remember what you told me when we were young?

327
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:11,040
We need to take an injection if we are sick.

328
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,030
It's alright to scream if it's painful.

329
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,980
Don't pretend to be strong!

330
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,940
We'll recover after the pain.

331
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:31,440
Go abroad and cure your target panic.

332
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,140
I'll be waiting here for you to return.

333
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,440
You've decided to go abroad?

334
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,700
Coach, I'll leave after the graduation commencement if possible.

335
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,720
I'll improve my technique while recovering.

336
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,220
That's great!

337
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,340
I'm eager to see you return and dominate the archery scene.

338
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:21,640
After you finish packing at home,

339
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,600
and come back to participate in the graduation commencement,

340
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,780
you'll be leaving.

341
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,920
I'm talking to you.

342
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,980
I heard you.

343
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,180
Remember to eat and rest well over there.

344
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,340
You can come back any time if you miss us.

345
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,300
The weather is chilly over there.

346
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,020
You should take some more clothes.

347
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,620
Don't stay up late to play games!

348
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,000
It's bad for your eyes.

349
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,500
Initially, we wanted you to have a hobby

350
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,200
and keep your body fit by letting you learn archery.

351
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,680
I didn't think that you end up making us proud.

352
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,420
It's done!

353
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,240
You're leaving soon.

354
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,760
Dad!

355
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,160
Dad.

356
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,660
What is this?

357
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,720
Fang-fang (the mom), I hope this letter finds you well.

358
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:25,880
Both of our children missed you

359
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:29,000
ever since you left for Rong City.

360
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,440
They are very obedient.

361
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,480
Although Chi-chi is still naughty,

362
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,960
she is starting to take care of her brother.

363
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,320
Don't worry!

364
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:42,620
I hope everything is well for you at Rong City.

365
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:46,900
May you find success in your work and treat more patients.

366
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,400
Changge, I hope this letter finds you well.

367
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:06,300
It's been a year since I left.

368
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,720
It's so busy over here

369
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,020
that I've not written to you for some time.

370
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:17,120
I remember that Geng-geng was so thin when I saw him last time.

371
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,840
Please make sure that they eat well.

372
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,740
I've been thinking recently.

373
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,980
If I didn't want to become a surgeon

374
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,300
or if you didn't insist to stay in your hometown,

375
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,140
would we have been able to live together?

376
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:53,160
Fang-fang, I hope this letter finds you well.

377
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,100
Chi-chi has grown up.

378
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,900
She is a girl after all.

379
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,160
There are some things that I don't know how to handle.

380
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,600
I wish you were here.

381
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:08,620
I think she needs you more than I.

382
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,880
You can be a doctor anywhere.

383
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,500
I don't know why you must leave your family to become one.

384
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:18,280
I'm sure that we'll be able to solve our problems

385
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,720
as long as we are together.

386
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,400
But now that

387
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,000
the mother left the naive kids, the kids miss their mother easily.

388
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,980
Are you sure that this is the best way?

389
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,500
Changge, I hope this letter finds you well.

390
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,400
We were apart more than we were together.

391
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,680
I'm sorry that you have to take care of our children alone.

392
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm neither a qualified wife

393
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,020
nor a qualified mother.

394
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,120
But I think the kids will understand me one day.

395
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,500
Right?

396
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,379
Chi-chi? When did you come back?

397
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,460
This...

398
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,900
Dad.

399
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,880
I read them all.

400
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,920
I'm not hiding them from you.

401
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,360
I wanted to...

402
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,840
find the right time to show you when you grow up.

403
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,120
Chi-chi.

404
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,920
I never intended to hide anything.

405
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,840
Although I agreed to a divorce with your mom,

406
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:11,200
I still care about the both of you.

407
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,620
I understand

408
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,940
that you must hate me

409
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,400
for lying to you after all these years.

410
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,000
Dad.

411
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,780
I'm sorry.

412
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,600
You took on the role of a father and a mother

413
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,380
for all these years.

414
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:35,560
Yet, I still blamed you.

415
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,640
I'm sorry!

416
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:46,780
Chi-chi, you've grown up.

417
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,660
Oh right!

418
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:57,220
Chi-chi, did you come back with Xu Fang?

419
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,120
I heard that he is going abroad?

420
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:07,040
Xu Fang is a good kid.

421
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:12,640
But no one is good enough to deserve you in my opinion.

422
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,720
I think so, too.

423
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,790

♫ Not so difficult! ♫

♫ Making a choice is not so difficult. ♫

426
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:55,250
♫ It’s all warm and scattered expectation. ♫

♫ Making a decision is not so difficult. ♫

00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:10,220
♫ Nothing more than day and night mediocre bravery. ♫

430
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:17,010
♫ People hesitate so they've missed many fulfillment, ♫

431
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:23,070
♫ always at a loss and in a hurry but feel terribly upset. ♫

432

♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

433

♫ A smile is really not that difficult. ♫

♫ A promise is really not that difficult. ♫

♫ How could the regret of the past represent today? ♫

438
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,870
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

♫ Loving someone is really not that difficult ♫
