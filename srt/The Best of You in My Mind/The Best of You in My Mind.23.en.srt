00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:06,430
♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,890
♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

4
00:00:09,890 --> 00:00:13,250
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:17,060
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:20,610
♫ or pretend to be indifferent. ♫

7
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,920
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,560
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

9
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,470
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:39,530
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:46,520
♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,100
♫ Love is like a migratory bird waiting for the season. ♫

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,800
♫ How long does it take for them to be aware of each other? ♫

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,340
♫ You are like summer night, ♫

15
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,120
♫ I'm like a little star in the sky, ♫

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:13,150
♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

17
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,590
♫ Deliberately, I hit your shoulder, ♫

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,210
♫ and listen to your reprimand. ♫

19
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,710
♫ The caring feeling is so sweet! ♫

[Episode 23]

22
00:01:39,658 --> 00:01:42,238
I thought it wasn't time yet.

23
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:45,019
Your body is ready.

24
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,000
Just remember to forget the past and start from the beginning.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,740
Give it a go!

26
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,950
Your goal is neither the target nor the gold ring

27
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:17,429
but an accurate shooting movement.

28
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,710
Forget about winning and the result!

29
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,580
You just need to find the correct feeling

30
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,990
to complete a perfect shooting.

31
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,380
Your Mandarin was perfect in that sentence.

32
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,249
- It's so late, why are you still here?
- I was waiting for you.

33
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,090
You've never had an archery lesson since you've joined the team, right?

34
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,430
I see you do it all the time.

35
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,190
It's so easy! Just like this.

36
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,460
You're so arrogant.

37
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,390
Archery is not as easy as it seems.

38
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,240
How about this? Let me teach you since I have nothing to do today.

39
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,609
Just come here.

40
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:51,410
Come! Stand like this.

41
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,219
Come! Feet shoulder width apart, face your right.

42
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:57,739
Come! I've loaded the arrow for you.

43
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,509
Hold the bow between the thumb

44
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:03,840
and index finger. Right!

45
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,990
I'll set up the clicker.

46
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,579
Like this! Yes, very good.

47
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,579
- Like this?
- Great! You're talented.

48
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:12,909
- I can't lift it.
- Here! Let me help you.

49
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,810
Here! Here! Pull.

50
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,570
Aim! Count down, okay?

51
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,229
Three. Two. One.

52
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,930
Release!

53
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,539
Ten points!

54
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,950
I'm a genius.

55
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,820
You're amazing!

56
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,160
Do you mind if I marry into your family?

57
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,950
I mean

58
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:50,440
this will just be an engagement until I achieve my goals.

59
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,480
I'll marry you afterwards.

60
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,640
So, for now...

61
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,010
I don't mind.

62
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:03,010
I really don't mind.

63
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,410
You don't?

64
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,460
Nie Yue, will you marry me?

65
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:26,050
Yes, I will.

66
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,640
Fang Fang, I'm back.

67
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,640
Did you miss me?

68
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,210
Fang Fang, what do you think is inside this little black box?

69
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,670
I can't hear a thing inside.

70
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,950
It's quite heavy, too.

71
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:25,390
I wonder what's inside.

72
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,610
Fang Fang.

73
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,210
I can tell you've already eaten.

74
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,450
What is this? Help me open it!

75
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:39,140
Your brother is calling.

76
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,189
Why are you back so early?

77
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,300
They didn't send you home?

78
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,260
No, I had dinner with my friend today.

79
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:51,230
I told them not to send me.

80
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:53,330
Were you with a boy or a girl?

81
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,530
I'm not telling you.

82
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,739
Ye Shaowen?

83
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,230
How can that be possible?

84
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:05,290
I told you before that I'm a female swan.

85
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,800
Swans are monogamous, right?

86
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,790
Anyway, the male swan is coming back next week.

87
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,460
Really?

88
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,020
Are you serious?

89
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,090
Hold on! I'll get Fang Fang to dance for you.

90
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,739
Fang Fang, your brother's coming back, are you happy?

91
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,739
Come! Dance for your brother.

92
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,529
Stand! One. Two.

93
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,850
Isn't he good at dancing?

94
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,290
Your brother is coming back.

95
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,539
Was the operation for the dog successful?

96
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,539
It was very successful, the dog was very obedient.

97
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,220
That's good.

98
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,969
- Can you open it for me?
- All right.

99
00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:58,170
Thank you.

My boyfriend will come back in a few days.

Boyfriend? You rented one?

102
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,040
You're the one who rented one.

103
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,190
Aren't you single?

104
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,909
Where is he from?

105
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,570
What's his name? How tall is he?

106
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,470
I'm not telling you; take a guess!

No! Rehabilitation training is done.

Don't tell me you forgot the password.

Only ten thousand combinations for me to try.

- You reek of sweat. Go now!
- I don't reek of sweat.

Yes, you do! I can smell it. Quickly!

00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:54,010
Oh, no! I have an evaluation exam today.

166
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,800
Oh, no! I'm done for, I'm going to be late.

167
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,900
Why didn't you wake me earlier?

168
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,320
By the way, I'm going to go see Coach Liu this afternoon.

169
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,280
I'll go find you when I'm done with training.

170
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:09,620
All right.

171
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,530
Fang Fang, good morning!

172
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,970
- I'm leaving.
- Be careful!

173
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,760
This again?

174
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:57,110
Fang Fang, let me clean up the table.

175
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,020
Isn't it messy?

176
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:16,500
June 20th. Clear. Xu Fang left today.

177
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,099
My most important wish for the upcoming days

178
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,940
is to successfully find work

179
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,440
so Fang Fang won't have to worry.

180
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:32,080
July 31st. Cloudy. I've worked at the hospital for some time now,

181
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,120
but no one believed me when I told them I have a boyfriend.

182
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,510
August 15th. Clear.

183
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,050
I miss everyone.

184
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:49,069
I miss the times when I ate at the stalls outside the university

185
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,410
with Nie Yue.

186
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,240
I wonder how they are now.

187
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,140
September 1st. Clear.

188
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,930
Watching a movie alone.

189
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:03,650
Eating alone.

190
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:06,030
Sleeping alone.

191
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:09,910
But I have someone inside my heart.

192
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,720
Straighten the arrow. Keep it straight. That's wrong!

193
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,220
Lower your shoulder! Is that how I taught you?

194
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,999
Coach, I feel more comfortable like this.

195
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:53,400
I heard our university's sharpshooter shoots like this.

196
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,280
Master the basics before you try to learn someone else's method.

197
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,540
I would call you my mentor if you hit the gold ring every time.

198
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:06,300
Straighten your arrow!

199
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,560
Xu Fang?

200
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,120
Come here!

201
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,860
When did you come back?

202
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,190
Just last night.

203
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:27,139
You brat! Can't you give me a call?

204
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,600
I didn't have the time.

205
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,990
I've been waiting for this day for so long.

206
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,529
Come here! Let me introduce you to my new team members.

207
00:18:38,529 --> 00:18:42,300
Stop for a while, come here! Come here!

208
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,810
Do you all know who this is?

209
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,359
The famous athlete from our university, Xu Fang.

210
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,150
Xu Fang?

211
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,270
The national champion?

212
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,020
Senior Xu Fang, show us some shots.

213
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:05,289
Forget about it! He just came back from rehabilitation training.

214
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:09,600
It's tiring and he needs rest, he will show you another day.

215
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,740
All right.

216
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:14,539
See! This is your goal.

217
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:17,870
Your future is in your hands! Are you all confident?

218
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,630
Yes!

219
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,190
Keep training.

220
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,470
Thank you, Coach.

221
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:34,100
What for? They idolize you; make sure to act mysterious.

222
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,150
Xu Fang.

223
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:42,800
The next competition will be a real challenge against yourself.

224
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,920
That version of yourself is the true Xu Fang.

225
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,800
Hello. I...

226
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,990
Is there anything I can help you with?

227
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:29,219
I'm sorry! We were just playing around.

228
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:31,020
- I'll take him back.
- That's okay.

229
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,020
I'm looking for Doctor Lin Xichi.

230
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,270
Do you have an appointment?

231
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:37,430
I'm her boyfriend.

232
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:43,199
The legendary boyfriend! I finally get to meet you today.

233
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:46,589
I'll call her. So handsome!

234
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,220
- What do you want to eat?
- What do you want to eat?

235
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,290
Anything.

236
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,270
Follow me then!

237
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:07,570
You have had a plan all along, why asked me?

238
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,379
Did you do that on purpose? You could've just called me.

239
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:18,520
How would your colleagues know that your boyfriend isn't imaginary then?

240
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:21,840
Xu Fang, did you read my diary?

241
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,270
- It hurts!
- Tell me! Did you read it?

242
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:26,469
It hurts! Hold on. Hold on. Stop.

243
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,299
It was meant for you to write your wishes to me, why couldn't I read it?

244
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:36,250
And from now on, I'll fulfill every wish for you.

245
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,800
Let's take a plane ride!

246
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,789
Take off!

247
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,210
It's so lively here now. There are so many snack shops.

248
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,080
There are so many snack shops.

249
00:22:18,089 --> 00:22:20,640
Do you want to try them all?

250
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,590
My dream is to eat everything in the world.

251
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:29,470
Sure! Let's eat everything here for today.

252
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,020
Look!

253
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,930
- Is that Nie Yue?
- I think so.

254
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:39,970
Jiang Zhengxu and Xin Zidan are beside her.

255
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:41,570
Nie Yue!

256
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:48,660
- Brother Chi.
- Brother Chi.

257
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,319
Why is everyone here? Everyone's here.

258
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:01,049
- I missed you.
- I missed all of you.

259
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:02,290
How is everyone?

260
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,229
- We're good.
- Everyone's good.

261
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:07,490
Everyone's good. Not bad!

262
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,719
- You two got married?
- No! We got engaged.

263
00:23:13,719 --> 00:23:16,820
We'll get married later.

264
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:21,130
You got engaged without telling me? I can cheer for both of you.

265
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,969
Well, Xu Fang isn't here, you might be sad if you saw.

266
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:27,180
Won't you be jealous?

267
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,580
That's enough! Since you didn't call me,

268
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:34,250
this meal is on you.

269
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,469
This meal doesn't count! You promised to pay.

270
00:23:37,469 --> 00:23:38,620
- That's right.
- That's right.

271
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,700
Me? Why?

272
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,710
Xu Fang said you'd treat us.

273
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,650
You're here?

274
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:55,779
It's because of someone's wish to eat with everyone at the stalls near the university.

275
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:57,350
Right?

276
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,100
I'll pay.

277
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,770
All right! Sit down.

278
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,160
It's a simple wish, we can fulfill it for you.

279
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,800
When will you two get married?

280
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,780
We are not in a rush.

281
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:17,159
Brother, just endure it! Women are like that.

282
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,589
- Why did you hit me?
- What are you talking about?

283
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:24,859
Chi-chi waited for Xu Fang for so long, she can't wait until he retires.

284
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:28,659
You'll have to leave for competitions often if you become professional.

285
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,000
You two will often be separated.

286
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:38,990
It will be like last time when you couldn't take care of Chi-chi or if there's an emergency.

287
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:42,509
- Let's not talk about that today.
- Yes, let's not.

288
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:44,779
This is a reception party for Xu Fang.

289
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,489
- Come! Come!
- Bottoms up!

290
00:24:46,489 --> 00:24:47,269
- Cheers, Xu Fang!
- Bottoms up!

291
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:50,860
You can't use that, use this!

292
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,190
- Everyone is using the can?
- You can really drink.

293
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,100
Come! I'm using the can too.

294
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,169
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

295
00:24:58,169 --> 00:25:01,000
Drink more! Lin Xichi is paying today.

296
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:10,570
Didn't you have a wish to reserve a hall and watch movies with me?

297
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:13,290
There's no one here.

298
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,240
- It's the whole hall.
- Good!

299
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,190
No one's here.

300
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,190
Then can we...

301
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,040
What are you doing?

302
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,109
I mean you can take off your shoes and put your feet up.

303
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,310
There's no one here! It's starting.

304
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,379
- Look at your little hand!
- Look at yourself!

305
00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:53,200
Holding your hand is like holding a dog's paw.

306
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,220
You're the dog.

307
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,650
What do you want to eat today?

308
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:02,710
Time flies when I'm with you.

309
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,940
I need to think about what to eat every day.

310
00:27:04,949 --> 00:27:07,150
Meal by meal.

311
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:12,369
People say you're set for life once you marry a man but it's still early for you.

312
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:18,090
Jiang Zhengxu and Nie Yue are already engaged.

313
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:23,070
They might get married soon.

314
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,490
You're right.

315
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,290
Tired?

316
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:34,160
Yes, just a bit.

317
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:38,000
Why don't we take a break at the Civil Affairs Bureau up ahead?

318
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,220
They have benches and vending machines.

319
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:45,250
Let's not go there, we'll be home soon.

320
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:50,840
When do you plan to marry me?

321
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:54,340
What?

322
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,419
No, that's not like that, right.

323
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:01,910
You're still a young and beautiful lady, and your future is bright ahead of you.

324
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,430
What do you mean?

325
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,500
State it clearly!

326
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:15,030
It's so embarrassing for you to propose to me in the public. Let's go!

327
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,590
How could you?

328
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,059
We've known each other for most of our lives and we've dated for so long.

329
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:28,480
I've waited for more than a year.

330
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,580
Now, you are saying that I'm proposing to you?

331
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,420
Am I wrong?

332
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,400
You're really angry?

333
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,239
All right, all right! It's my fault.

334
00:28:47,239 --> 00:28:51,149
Don't be angry! Don't cry.

335
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,470
So your agreeing?

336
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,450
I'll consider it.

337
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,290
My efforts were wasted.

338
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:06,209
The supermarket is just in front, I'll cook you anything you want to eat today.

339
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:07,570
I'm not eating anything.

340
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:10,590
I'll cook everything myself, how's that?

341
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,110
This is a once in a lifetime chance.

342
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:16,120
You only care about eating.

343
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,270
Let me do it!

344
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:29,079
It's not your job! Your job is to hug me.

345
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:44,850
You're so good at cooking.

346
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,990
I won't eat takeout ever again.

347
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,540
Why don't you cook while I get the ingredients for tomorrow?

348
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,590
I'm going to Beijing tomorrow.

349
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:02,350
Do you have to go?

350

The National Championships are coming up.

352
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,910
Coach Liu got me an entry to the competition.

353
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:16,540
I'll get the chance to join the national team if I perform well.

354
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:29,350
Is it alright for you to join a competition?

355
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:36,450
I know you came back from your training abroad.

356
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,220
You must be confident.

357

But...

358
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,990
I don't know what will happen, either.

359
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,200
But I have to go.

360
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:52,230
So I will know the results of my year-long training.

361
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:06,380
Fang Fang, I'm leaving.

362
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,990

Xu Fang, after we were separated,

00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,070
I feel that I've grown up.

367
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,520
Growing up means

368
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:32,120
not feeling sad about being all alone,

369
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:37,110
because there's something immovable in my heart.

370
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,459
- Driver, to the airport.
- All right.

371

Watching you work hard,

372
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:20,240
I'll need to become the best version of myself, too,

373
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,240
so I can be a match for the best version of you in my heart

374
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,480

Why are you here?

380

She insisted because she missed it the last time, she won't miss it again.

381
00:35:39,299 --> 00:35:41,099
It'll be hard to watch Brother Fang's match again.

382
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,959
If he does join the national team, he'll have to go abroad.

She has screws in her legs now.

386

It's an awesome mechanical leg.

We almost missed the plane because of you and you're still dallying.

- You won't become successful.
- Your bag is too heavy.

Why did we end up running instead of taking a taxi this morning?

- It's not expensive.
- We are trying to be thrifty.

All right, be thrifty!

♫ Not so difficult! ♫

409
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:20,740
♫ Making a choice is not so difficult. ♫

410
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:27,340
♫ It’s all warm and scattered expectations. ♫

♫ Nothing more than day and night mediocre bravery. ♫

414

♫ People hesitate so they've missed many fulfillment, ♫

415
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:55,120
♫ always at a loss and in a hurry but feel terribly upset. ♫

♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫
