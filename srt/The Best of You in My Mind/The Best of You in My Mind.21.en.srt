6

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,850
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,600
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,460
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,540
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

23
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,529
- Dad.
- Chi-Chi, I heard you wanted to work at a veterinary hospital.

24
00:02:46,529 --> 00:02:49,939
I've asked around and found that there's an internship.

25
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:53,979
The pay isn't that bad and you'd become a permanent employee after graduation.

26
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,280
Really? Where is it?

27
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,000
It's nearby our place, about ten-minute car ride.

28
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,400
Chi-Chi, are you listening?

29
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,160
- Yes.
- Then what do you think?

30
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,119
I'm thinking that it's not very stable for a girl to stay in Rong City.

31
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,320
Come back to Luo City, I'll take care of you.

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,100
Dad, I know what you're worried about.

33
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,540
However, you do know about my plan.

34
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,040
I want to stay here right after graduation.

35
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,000
I knew you'd say so! Give your mother a call.

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,400
I think she has something to tell you.

37
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:47,550
Sure.

38
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,119
Chi-chi, here you are! Have a seat.

39
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:07,910
What do you want to drink?

40
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,939
- The same as yours.
- Okay.

41
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:13,119
Waiter, we'll have one more cup of this.

42
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,720
Sure.

43
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,900
Chi-chi, I asked to see you today because...

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,180
If you want to ask me about Xu Fang, then I'll tell you that he's gone abroad

45
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,799
and I don't know when he'll be back. That's it!

46
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,460
Then he wants you to keep waiting for him?

47
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,000
It's my decision to wait for him.

48
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,020
My colleagues and I also know something about it.

49
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,879
Even though he's gone abroad for treatment, will he be able to recover from target panic for certain?

50
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:50,380
I don't know, either, but this is our problem. Don't worry about it!

51
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,280
I know you've been blaming us for the divorce.

52
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,699
But now you need to calm down, this is your own problem.

53
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:06,820
You're at an important turning point in your life, there's no way we're leaving you alone.

54
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,640
It's not that we don't like him but that's a different story.

55
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,739
He's an athlete, so his career depends on his age.

56
00:05:15,739 --> 00:05:19,600
Now he's got target panic, he'll very likely need to quit.

57
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,580
Does he have any other skills? Does he?

58
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,739
What will he do after entering society? How will he gain a foothold? How will he support you?

59
00:05:27,739 --> 00:05:29,979
How will he give you happiness? Have you thought it through?

60
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:32,350
Do you know what happiness is?

61
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,940
Why can't you let go of the past and forgive me?

62
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:42,200
I'm truly worried about you!

63
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,160
I couldn't forgive myself!

64
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,020
I always thought you abandoned me because I wasn't good enough!

65
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,939
I always felt guilty! I was so scared!

66
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,599
I even became shameless enough to fake your WeChat ID and talk to dad.

67
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:03,040
But it was useless!

68
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,300
I thought I didn't deserve happiness and love.

69
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,580
No, no! It's not what you're thinking.

70
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,860
It's because of Xu Fang.

71

When I needed him the most,

72
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,980
he's always there for me.

73
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,420
He made me realize that

74
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,250
I deserve to be loved and happy.

75
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,330
That's how I could forgive myself.

I'm being considerate of you, I want to take care of you.

I don't need you to care about me now!

82

One last time! I'm begging you for one last time!

83

Don't interfere with the problem between me and Xu Fang!

84
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,820
When I was having a hard time, it's Xu Fang who held my hand tightly!

85
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,800
When he needs me the most, I will never let go of his hand.

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,700
Please take a look at my cat.

322
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,800
We're not open for business yet.

323
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,800
The doctor will be here later.

324
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:14,900
- I'm just an intern.
- Then when do we need to wait until?

325
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,100
Ten o'clock.

326
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,600
No, I... I'm afraid it won't make it until then.

327
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,000
Doctor, it's been throwing up and having diarrhea for the whole night.

328
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,500
I'm afraid it won't make it, could you take a look at it first?

329
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,400
I'm begging you.

330
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,400
It seems to be having mild dehydration.

331
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,600
- How about I give it a check-up first?
- Sure.

332
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600
That's great! Thank you so much.

333
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,500
Give it to me.

334
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,800
Stop looking at it! Go for lunch now.

335
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,400
I don't feel like eating.

336
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,200
You don't seem quite well.

337
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,600
No one is taking it home?

338
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,200
Its owner doesn't pick up his phone at all.

339
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,800
I guess he's abandoned it.

340
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,000
You applied for leave yesterday.

341
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,500
Did you go to see your boyfriend?

342
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,500
I had to do some business.

343
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,400
You've been working here for a while.

344
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,000
Why doesn't he come here at all?

345
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,100
He's overseas.

346
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,300
Overseas?

347
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,200
Could he be some imaginary boyfriend?

348
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,500
Why would I lie to you?

349
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,800
Stop being nosy! Get back to work.

350
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,500
Are you sick?

351
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,300
- I'm fine, just feeling a bit unwell.
- Then stop working.

352
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,800
I'll help you apply leave from the Chief.

353
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,300
I'm at Tianfu Great Wall Station.

354
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,900
See you later!

355
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,500
Chi-chi?

356
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,300
It's really you!

357
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,300
Chi-chi, what's wrong?

358
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,900
Chi-chi!

359
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,200
How do you feel?

360
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,800
Much better.

361
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,560
If it hadn't been for me,

362
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,500
you'd have fallen on the road.

363
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Is it because of Xu Fang?

364
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,600
What are you smiling for?

365
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,200
I don't understand you at all.

366
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:02,000
No matter what happens, you always smile.

367
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,700
If crying made me fine, I'd cry here and now.

368
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,900
Fine, you win!

369
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I'll get your medicine first before sending you home.

370
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
And I'll make you some porridge.

371
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,500
It's okay! You should get back to work.

372
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,100
The doctor has prescribed my medicine.

373
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,800
I'm fine now.

374
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,700
Xu Fang's not with you, I'm worried because you're all alone.

375
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,400
I'm an adult, don't worry!

376
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,300
Take good care of yourself.

377
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,200
I'm off now.

378
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,000
Don't worry!

379
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,100
Take good care of yourself.

380
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,900
Who's that?

381
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,100
Coming.

382
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,800
Someone's knocking on the door. Who is it?

383
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,500
Don't be afraid!

384
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,900
It's me!

385
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Come on in.

386
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,600
- Why are you here?
- Fang Fang.

387
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,100
Xin Zi Dan gave me a call.

388
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,800
How are you doing?

389
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:45,100
Look at how excited he is!

390
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:47,300
Let me see! So hot.

391
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,400
Have you taken your temperature yet?

392
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,600
39.2 degrees Celsius.

393
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,300
How did you get a fever this high?

394
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,400
What are you doing?

395
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,600
- Put this towel on your forehead.
- But I used it to wipe my feet.

396
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,300
You're dying. Stop minding such a petty thing!

397
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,730
- Fine!
- Where are the test results?

398
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,200
On the table.

399
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,300
Do you understand them?

400
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,000
- You see.
- High white blood cell count.

401
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,000
You're something.

402
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,400
- You learned it?
- You have inflammation.

403
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,000
In my bag.

404
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,500
My phone, get it for me!

405
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,200
Here you go.

406
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,500
Why aren't you answering it?

407
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,600
[Ending OST: "It's not that Difficult!"]
[ Melody by Qiao Lin - Lyrics by Xueran Chen and Qiao Lin]

408
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,200
♫ Not so difficult! ♫

409
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,400
♫ Making a choice is not so difficult. ♫

410
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:25,060
♫ It’s all warm and scattered expectations. ♫

411
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,820
♫ Not so difficult! ♫

412

♫ Making a choice is not so difficult. ♫

413
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:40,160
♫ Nothing more than day and night mediocre bravery. ♫

414
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,880
♫ People hesitate so they've missed many fulfillment, ♫

415
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,850
♫ always at a loss and in a hurry but feel terribly upset. ♫

416
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:56,250
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

417
00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:00,700
♫ A smile is really not that difficult. ♫

418
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:06,440
♫ Unconsciously, we will eventually dry our tears. ♫

419
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,080
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

420
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,330
♫ A promise is really not that difficult. ♫

421
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:20,350
♫ How could the regret of the past represent today? ♫

422
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:23,780
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

423
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:28,080
♫ A hug is really not that difficult. ♫

424
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:33,970
♫ Our time isn't worthy to be entangled with loneliness. ♫

425
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:37,400
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

426
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,870
♫ Loving someone is really not that difficult ♫

427
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:45,250
♫ Even if it hurts, being together or not, ♫

428
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:53,030
♫ those are all the best moments of life! ♫
