♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,228
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

5
00:00:13,228 --> 00:00:16,990
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,550
♫ or pretend to be indifferent. ♫

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,819
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:27,650
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,490
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:39,530
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:46,515
♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

♫ You are like summer night, ♫

♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

17

♫ Deliberately, I hit your shoulder, ♫

18

22
00:01:33,286 --> 00:01:36,449
Are you throwing tantrums now?

23
00:01:36,449 --> 00:01:41,110
I know you don't want to clean cages, but everyone new starts from here.

24
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,130
No one gets a special treatment around here, you got it?

25
00:01:44,809 --> 00:01:46,869
Being passionate is not enough for a career.

26
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:49,390
You need to be responsible, too. Understand?

27
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,930
Lin Xichi!

28
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,210
Lin Xichi!

29
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,269
Lin Xichi! Don't get upset.

30
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:06,689
She is straightforward, please don't take it seriously.

31
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:08,610
She's right!

32
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,668
I thought I was here to play with animals.

33
00:02:12,668 --> 00:02:17,209
I never thought I would need to do these things.

34
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:19,910
I actually feel disgusted.

35
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,149
I'm not sure if I truly like this job.

36
00:02:23,149 --> 00:02:25,570
I... I understand.

37
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,528
When I first came here, I started with cleaning cages, too.

38
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:30,070
I felt disgusted, too.

39
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,708
But think about it! Once you become a vet,

40
00:02:32,708 --> 00:02:36,788
you'll have to deal with many dirtier and harder things.

41
00:02:36,788 --> 00:02:41,010
I guess that's the difference between a profession and an interest.

42
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,589
I'm sorry, Senior Ye!

43
00:02:44,589 --> 00:02:48,170
I don't think I'm ready to enter this profession yet.

46
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,350
what's wrong?

47
00:03:37,029 --> 00:03:41,250
Can I go to the archery practice with you together tomorrow?

48
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:44,650
What about the pet shop?

49
00:03:47,789 --> 00:03:51,729
I'm glad you asked to go with me.

50
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:56,529
But you were so excited to go to the pet shop back then.

51
00:03:56,529 --> 00:04:01,169
Right now, you... what happened?

52
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,789
I'll wait for you there tomorrow.

53
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:14,530
Have some milk!

54
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,369
My laundry is done, I'll go get it.

Have you eaten yet?

60
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:53,949
I don't feel like eating.

61
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,109
What happened?

62
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:07,169
Someone bullied you?

63
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:11,309
It's not a big deal.

64
00:06:11,309 --> 00:06:13,909
It's just that I feel incompetent.

65
00:06:13,909 --> 00:06:17,050
I'm always late to the pet shop and dropping things.

66
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,550
I'm so clumsy.

67
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,570
I feel like I'm always others' burden.

68
00:06:23,269 --> 00:06:26,609
Lin Xichi, you lost the arm wrestling,

69
00:06:26,609 --> 00:06:28,930
but you insisted on working at the pet shop.

70
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,030
Do you have any idea how pissed off I was?

71
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:37,089
That was the first time you broke our game rule and ran away.

72
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:40,169
Now you're quitting just because you're not happy?

73
00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:43,910
You're going to break your promise for those petty things?

74

I'm sorry!

75

Don't apologize to me!

76

You're responsible for your choice.

77
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:55,790
Don't do something you might regret.

78

Since you've made up your mind, you should stick to it.

They've fallen sick but I can't manage the shop all by myself.

Poor little things! No one's taking care of them.

Should I call the manager?

I was the one trimming my dog's claws when I'm home.

But be careful, don't cut their quicks.

Tell the coach I have something pressing and need the day off.

Press it.

Why are you here?

What's wrong with you? Why didn't you look after her?

124

And you! You're working at the pet shop, you should protect yourself.

125
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:55,300
- Why were you being so careless?
- That's none of your business! And I was dealing with dogs and cats.

126
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:58,249
It's inevitable! Aren't you here out of concern?

127
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:00,190
Why are you questioning me?

128

If this happens again,

129
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,650
I'll teach the dog owner a good lesson.

130

- I'll take you back to school.
- I want to go back to the pet shop.

Both of you are rarely on the same page.

And these are the dates for the four injections, get them on time!

Let me take it!

136

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,929
Yeah! Initially, I didn't plan to come to the shop.

138

But I've read the book you gave me, "All Things Bright and Beautiful.

I must become an interesting and caring vet.

141
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:55,769
Then, before I knew it, I was already in front of the shop.

I wish that animals would find it lucky to have me as their vet.

You have a copy, too.

145
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:17,649
Yeah, it's a good book.

146

I see.

149
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:36,229
Yes, luckily, I came today! I got to take care of Xiang Xiang and Qi Qi.

150
00:13:36,229 --> 00:13:39,500
I got a minor injury, but it was worth it.

151
00:13:39,549 --> 00:13:41,849
You're an animal lover,

152
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:44,750
I'm sure you're ready to be a vet.

153
00:13:45,989 --> 00:13:51,169
Tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, the days after that, I'll wait for you at the shop.

Let go of my hand.

Wait for me!

Can you be more sympathetic? I'm a patient after all.

160

I shouldn't have gifted you that book.

Had I known it was so dangerous, I wouldn't have let you study veterinary medicine.

00:14:17,609 --> 00:14:22,300
It's more dangerous than treating humans. What if you get rabies?

163
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,130
If I get rabies, I'll bite you first.

164
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:30,108
It's too late to regret it! I've made up my mind... I'll take care of animals, forever.

Fine, you never listen to me after all. Forget it!

Aren't you supposed to get off work at five?

170
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,930
Oh, yeah, Xu Fang left without finishing practice today.

171
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,169
He came to see me.

172
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:04,740
I thought these things are all from Senior Ye.

173
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,990
What a disappointment!

174
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,929
I never thought it's Xu Fang.

175
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,008
You're not happy with Xu Fang giving them to you?

176
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:17,209
That's not what I meant.

177
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:20,430
Just that, I was reading the book

178
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:24,430
with Senior Ye on my mind and I did the same while drinking water.

179
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:27,009
I even sent him a picture.

180
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:30,050
And I was wrong.

181
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,970
Besides, I've been so mean to Xu Fang recently.

182
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:37,809
- It feels as if I've done wrong and owe him something.
- I think it should be fine.

183
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:42,909
You can just get Xu Fang something for his birthday.

184

That's doable!

Look at your test paper! You didn't do this big question at the end.

00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:07,568
I've explained every question for so many times in class.

188
00:16:07,569 --> 00:16:10,729
I've always said that these were all basics.

189
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:13,250
And you really don't know how to answer them?

190
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:18,709
When my daughter was at Grade Three, she only slept for four hours every night.

191
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:23,969
When I went to bed, the light in her room was still on, and she woke up way before me.

192
00:16:23,969 --> 00:16:26,390
You're sure she was studying?

193
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,869
What else could she do?

194
00:16:28,869 --> 00:16:33,030
Maybe she's doing what she likes when you're not looking.

195
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,709
She likes studying.

Is your mother Teacher He who teaches Mathematics at Luo City High School?

What do you want?

200
00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:53,089
You're right! I should learn from her.

201
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,630
Okay! Go back to your class.

202

Why does this question look so familiar?

207

I was wondering why this question looks so familiar?

When you begged for studying it, I was secretly happy about your decision for a while.

It seems that it's worse to be a vet.

It's a dirty and tiring job, and you get bitten by animals.

You said you'd come after you recovered.

I was worried, so I came to check on them.

They're barking all the time.

279
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:59,688
Especially at nights. When I leave, the light is off, the door is locked,

280
00:21:59,688 --> 00:22:03,160
they would start barking as if the world had abandoned them.

281
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,709
They behave when you're around; look! they've stopped barking.

282
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:10,400
And they're embarrassed to see you here as though they've done something wrong.

- They're like kids.
- I know, right?

284
00:22:13,348 --> 00:22:16,188
They're kids with fur and IQ of a three- or four-year-old.

285
00:22:16,188 --> 00:22:19,208
They were separated from their mothers when they were small.

286
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:24,249
They're afraid of getting separated and their fears get worse at night.

287
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:28,650
Then, why did their owner leave them here?

288
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,010
And they've been staying here for long.

289
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,389
I think their owner's a writer.

290
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:35,550
She lives alone and she's gone somewhere for inspiration.

291
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:38,269
They're sent here because no one could take care of them.

292
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:41,449
She called yesterday and said they'd stay here for two more weeks.

Your mother's a writer.

They're busy working.

00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,830
Be good and wait for your mother to pick you up, okay?

297
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:26,088
- What?
- Don't litter here! Or else, I'll punch you!

298
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,870
You're so uncultured.

I wanted to buy her milk tea but she asked me to buy it for you all.

00:24:01,469 --> 00:24:05,080
And I listened to her. Here, help yourself!

309
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,130
- You're not pursuing her anymore?
- We're brothers now.

310
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,068
Good brothers!

311
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:17,070
But we seldom see each other now.

312
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,209
And I feel quite down.

313
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:21,530
Then, why didn't you ask her to come here?

314
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:24,130
I did! But she just got off work.

315
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,570
She was tired, so she went back to the dorm.

316
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,690
You... reserved a cup for me.

317
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:39,750
You heard that?

318
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,769
Come here.

319
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,328
Let me have a bite!

320
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,300
- Brother Fu, me too!
- Me too!

321
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:49,529
You saw that, didn't you? Come here!

322
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:53,210
You get it now? I've given you all my advice.

323
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:55,489
Can you think of a way yourself?

324
00:24:55,489 --> 00:24:59,609
You're going to let her mingle with Ye Shaowen all the time? You'll lose her, eventually.

325
00:24:59,609 --> 00:25:03,509
She has the right to make her choice and she's doing things related to her major.

326
00:25:03,509 --> 00:25:06,529
I shouldn't blame her for working hard towards her profession.

327
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:09,309
No.

328
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:12,609
If you like her, you should go see her more often.

329
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:14,689
Take the initiative.

330
00:25:16,569 --> 00:25:19,949
She spends most of her time with Ye Shaowen.

331
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:22,889
Brother, you know how slow she is.

332
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:25,490
If she gives in and get together with Ye Shaowen, what will you do?

333
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,169
Are you going to cry? I don't think there would be any tears left for you to cry.

334
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,730
A forcefully picked melon isn't sweet!
(TN: I can't force her.)

335
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:39,488
Did you even try to pick it? You're not confident with yourself?

336
00:25:39,488 --> 00:25:43,600
We've been friends for so long, didn't you learn something useful from me?

337
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:52,170
- Yue-yue.
- Why are you here again?

338
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:56,088
What day is today? Fu Kuankuan bought us milk tea and you bought us snacks.

339
00:25:56,088 --> 00:25:57,590
Thanks.

340
00:25:59,709 --> 00:26:02,049
I'm going there, carry on with your work!

341
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,690
Xu Fang.

342
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:19,210
Have some snacks!

343
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:23,229
It's cold these days, you should eat more to replenish your energy.

344
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,350
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it!

345
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:31,690
- I...
- I...

346
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,989
You go ahead.

347
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,969
I have a question.

348
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,669
Has Lin Xichi recovered from her injury?

349
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:46,389
She... She didn't say much about it.

350
00:26:46,389 --> 00:26:49,090
I think there're two more injections.

351
00:26:50,329 --> 00:26:53,030
I also need to ask you for a favor.

352
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:57,470
I think she has a serious injury and you're her roommate after all.

353
00:26:57,470 --> 00:27:03,110
If possible, can you take care of her more often and keep her arm dry?

354
00:27:07,769 --> 00:27:09,669
Is that okay?

355
00:27:10,449 --> 00:27:12,708
Sure, don't worry.

356
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:14,389
I got it.

357
00:27:14,389 --> 00:27:17,600
Thank you! I'll carry on with practice.

358
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,069
Why are you here?

359
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:05,828
It's late! It's not safe for you to walk back to the dorm alone.

360
00:28:05,828 --> 00:28:07,469
I'll walk you back.

361
00:28:07,469 --> 00:28:10,149
But what's this posture for?

362
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:15,750
Isn't this what they do in dramas?

363
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:31,188
What a good day! There're so many stars.

364
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:33,669
I know, right?

365
00:28:43,869 --> 00:28:45,569
What's this?

366
00:28:45,569 --> 00:28:47,310
It's for you.

367
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:53,208
Today's not my birthday or some special occasion, why are you giving me a present?

368
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:55,530
I wish that we...

369
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,890
can be friends forever.

370
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,470
I can't accept it for no reason; I don't want it.

371
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,769
You know very well what's on my mind.

372
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:14,869
I don't know what's on your mind.

373
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:19,789
Then, can I know what's on your mind?

374
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:29,449
Have you seen the movie yet?

375
00:29:29,449 --> 00:29:31,470
What's the title?

376
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:33,610
Tangled.

377
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,070
- I'm going to see it now.
- You're not sending me back?

378
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,090
Oh, yeah,

379
00:29:41,269 --> 00:29:43,009
here's your present.

380
00:29:43,009 --> 00:29:45,949
I'm talking about sending me back to my dorm.

381
00:29:53,969 --> 00:29:57,530
Brother, we've seen it three times.

382
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,630
Let's do something else!

383
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:03,588
Not until we get what it's about! Analyze it for me.

384
00:30:03,588 --> 00:30:06,328
I don't find it meaningful at all.

385
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:08,509
Isn't it for kids below twelve?

386
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:12,410
- Am I not intelligent enough?
- Then, let's watch it one more time.

387
00:30:13,610 --> 00:30:16,770
I'm not this attentive even when I'm playing games.

388
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,510
Should we play some game first?

389
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:22,810
Get lost! We're not playing a game until we get what it's about!

390
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:34,090
What are you all doing? Three men watching a movie, that's disgusting!

391
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,589
Captain Fang, you're finally back.

392
00:30:36,589 --> 00:30:38,309
Jiang Zhengxu confessed to Nie Yue.

393
00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:41,468
She asked him to solve a difficult puzzle by watching this Barbie animation.

394
00:30:41,468 --> 00:30:45,489
We've seen it four times and we still don't get what this girl's trying to say.

395
00:30:45,489 --> 00:30:47,870
I'm so sick of watching it.

396
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,469
Tangled?

397
00:30:50,469 --> 00:30:52,310
You've seen it?

398
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:57,189
Lin Xichi used to force me to watch Disney animated movies with her when we were young.

399
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,408
I told you! Xu Fang's our savior.

400
00:31:01,408 --> 00:31:03,370
Analyze it for me!

401
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:09,269
Then, was Nie Yue in a relationship?

402
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,770
No.

403
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,389
Weren't you in the same high school as her?

404
00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:17,050
- Did anyone pursue her?
- Of course, not!

405
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:22,049
She had this serious look and always pulled a long face.

406
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,310
Go to bed now, I don't need you anymore.

407
00:31:27,329 --> 00:31:30,030
That makes sense!

408
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:33,669
Look, Nie Yue is excellent and she is a class president.

409
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:37,889
She the kind of person where teachers see her as a good student.

410
00:31:37,889 --> 00:31:41,348
Parents see her as a good kid, am I right?

411
00:31:41,348 --> 00:31:45,149
So, she asked you to watch this movie and wanted to tell you that

412
00:31:45,149 --> 00:31:49,809
she's torn because two people are fighting one another in her head.

413
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,890
How did you find that out?

414
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,769
Look at this movie!

415
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:58,588
Rapunzel has been living in this small cabin up in a high tower.

416
00:31:58,588 --> 00:32:00,309
Why doesn't she come down?

417
00:32:00,309 --> 00:32:03,889
First, she's trying to maintain her image as a good kid

418
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,549
and a good student.

419
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:09,569
Second, she's curious about the prince down at the bottom of the tower.

420
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:14,430
She's considering to let down her long hair for the prince.

421
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:18,730
I think this is the psychological state Nie Yue's going through.

422
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:23,529
That's enough! Stop watching.

423
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,930
Trust me! Just chase after her, it's definitely correct.

424
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:53,469
L1 is always perpendicular to L2.

425
00:32:53,469 --> 00:32:57,677
Find the chord length of the intersection between the straight line and conic curve.

426
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:04,869
Lin Xigeng, what are you looking at?

427
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:08,710
Me? I was listening to the question.

428
00:33:09,449 --> 00:33:11,228
That's very unusual.

429
00:33:11,228 --> 00:33:14,210
You're actually paying attention to my lesson?

430
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,390
Here.

431
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,770
Come and solve this question.

432
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,069
He's dead meat!

433
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:26,957
What a boot-licker!

434
00:33:35,816 --> 00:33:37,976
[Passion as the fuel of exam, hard work earns success.]

435
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,310
I came across this question before.

436
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:10,049
It looks like as long as you're willing to work hard, it's never too late.

437
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:24,930
Can you lend me your secret scripture?

438
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,469
- Me, too!
- Sure!

439
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:31,850
Coach, when will we start our winter break?

440
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:36,509
I've forgotten to tell you, our school has arranged a winter training for us.

441
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:39,449
- Winter training?
- It'll be about two weeks.

442
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:41,888
We'll go to the shooting and archery center in the neighboring province.

443
00:34:41,888 --> 00:34:45,130
Learn from others and improve ourselves.

444
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:47,328
You'll go home for the New Year after the winter training.

445
00:34:47,328 --> 00:34:49,649
Two weeks, Coach!

446
00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:51,609
It's not a long holiday to begin with.

447
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:55,270
We will be home for less than ten days now.

448
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,290
Yu Tong, pull yourself together!

449
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:59,149
Can you be more manly?

450
00:34:59,149 --> 00:35:01,089
Practice in ten minutes!

451
00:35:01,089 --> 00:35:02,808
Let's start practice.

452
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,108
- Let's go for practice.
- Okay.

453
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:09,889
Captain, what do we do?

454
00:35:09,889 --> 00:35:12,870
I was thinking about going home for a good rest.

455
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:14,490
I think it's good.

456
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:16,529
It's a rare opportunity.

457
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:20,249
I'll go practice now.

458
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,010
What's so good about it?

459
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,749
Have you gone crazy?

460
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,069
You can go home and see Lin Xichi.

461
00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:31,249
What for?

462
00:35:37,049 --> 00:35:39,869
Let me pet you, let me pet you!

463
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:43,069
Lin Xichi, take a break!

464
00:35:43,069 --> 00:35:44,970
I'm fine.

465
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,789
It's been a month, why hasn't their owner come to get them?

466
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:51,728
Their mother called today.

467
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:53,288
She said she can't get home for New Year.

468
00:35:53,289 --> 00:35:56,849
It seems that they're going to celebrate it here.

469
00:35:56,849 --> 00:35:59,049
That's so pitiful!

470
00:35:59,049 --> 00:36:00,969
Just like when I was small.

471
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:05,949
My brother and I were waiting for our mother to come home every day.

472
00:36:05,949 --> 00:36:07,609
But this year is different.

473
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:11,348
We'll celebrate it with our mother. Are you happy?

474
00:36:11,348 --> 00:36:15,109
But I'll come and see you two.

475
00:36:15,109 --> 00:36:17,350
You're going to miss me, aren't you?

476
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:29,009
Geng-geng, you're doing homework?

477
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:32,148
I have something to tell you.

478
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:37,029
New Year's in a few days and we're going to Rong City.

479
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:38,649
What for?

480
00:36:38,649 --> 00:36:41,528
It'll be crowded everywhere, why don't we just stay at home?

481
00:36:41,529 --> 00:36:44,829
- I'm not going.
- You have to!

482
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:48,248
We're going to celebrate it with your mother and sister.

483
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:51,030
Wait! What's going on here?

484
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,728
- Did you suggest that, dad?
- No.

485
00:36:53,728 --> 00:36:58,369
- My mom?
- Cut your crap and just come.

486
00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:00,749
Can't they just come back here?

487
00:37:00,749 --> 00:37:05,008
We never celebrated New Year in another city all these years; and, it's so cold out there.

488
00:37:05,008 --> 00:37:09,068
You're not coming? Then, you'll stay here alone.

489
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:24,568
Are you celebrating New Year at Luo City?

490
00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:27,969
My dad wants to celebrate it at Rong City.

491

492
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:34,429
I'm thinking of seeing you during the winter break.

493
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:38,128
Did you know, the exercise book you gave me is like a secret scripture?

494
00:37:38,128 --> 00:37:40,789
All my classmates asked me to lend them.

495
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:46,429
- You've done them all?
- Yes, I've done a quarter of them.

496
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,889
Let's do this instead!

497
00:37:48,889 --> 00:37:51,609
Finish them all and I'll see you.

498
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,940
I'll give you one for another subject.

499
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:58,349
Then, I need to work hard and finish six books before the exam.

500
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:00,230
I need to master all subjects.

501
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:02,909
That's a bit late!

502
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:05,929
Do it in this winter break, or I won't see you.

503
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,450
Sure!

504
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:41,120

♫ Not so difficult! ♫

506
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,900
♫ Making a choice is not so difficult. ♫

507
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:56,570
♫ It’s all warm and scattered expectation. ♫

508
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:00,200
♫ Not so difficult! ♫

509
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:04,800
♫ Making a decision is not so difficult. ♫

510
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:11,570
♫ Nothing more than day and night mediocre bravery. ♫

511
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:18,280
♫ People hesitate so they've missed many fulfillment, ♫

512
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:24,330
♫ always at a loss and in a hurry but feel terribly upset. ♫

513
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:27,730
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

514
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:32,000
♫ A smile is really not that difficult. ♫

515
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,920
♫ Unconsciously, we will eventually dry our tears. ♫

516
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,510
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

517
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:45,880
♫ A promise is really not that difficult. ♫

518
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:51,680
♫ How could the regret of the past represent today? ♫

519
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,190
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

520
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:59,490
♫ A hug is really not that difficult. ♫

521
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:05,390
♫ Our time isn't worthy to be entangled with loneliness. ♫

522
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,840
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

523
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:13,400
♫ Loving someone is really not that difficult ♫

524
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,620
♫ Even if it hurts, being together or not, ♫

525
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:24,930
♫ those are all the best moments of life! ♫
