♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:09,750
♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,250
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

5
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:16,940
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,550
♫ or pretend to be indifferent. ♫

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,910
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,620
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,490
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:39,510
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:46,480
♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

17

♫ Deliberately, I hit your shoulder, ♫

18

[Episode 16]

22
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,980
Today's the first day of my relationship.

23
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,430
So this is the feeling of being in love.

24
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,690
It's so beautiful!

25
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:22,770
You just blew out my candles.

26
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:26,930
Now, you need to be my girlfriend.

27
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,229
It's the first day of my relationship, I'm going to gently seize his heart by getting him breakfast.

28
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:39,589
I won't let Xu Fang leave me ever again.

29
00:02:39,589 --> 00:02:44,110
I need to keep doing it so as to make him crazy about me.

30
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,910
Xu Fang, come down now! I bought breakfast.

31
00:02:51,529 --> 00:02:53,670
Go back to your dorm first.

32
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,089
You're still sleeping, aren't you?

33
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,089
If you don't come down now, I'll finish them all.

34
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,690
I'm hanging up now.

35
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,290
What a lazybones!

36
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:50,030
Are you hungry? I bought you breakfast.

37
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,690
I bought yours, too.

38
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,690
- How many did you buy?
- Ten.

39
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,109
I really won't steal them! You can have them all.

40
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,270
Lin Xigeng and I love eating buns.

41
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:29,370
That's why I know what makes a delicious bun.

42
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,630
Buns with folded and thick layers don't taste good at all.

43
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:36,130
I only bought you those with thin layers and full of fillings.

44
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,650
They're buns full of fillings.

45
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,990
Why are you looking at me? It doesn't taste good?

46
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:17,330
Xu Fang, your mother told me that,

47
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:22,130
starting from your generation, your family was cursed.

48
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:26,789
If the eldest son unreasonably breaks up with his first love,

49
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:32,370
his farts will become very stinky and loud.

50
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,390
Are you mad?

51
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,230
Lin Xichi, I've heard of this curse.

52
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:50,609
Once the eldest son of the Xu family finds his first love,

53
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,930
the curse will start working.

54
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:58,110
In order to be fair and balanced,

55
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,710
this curse also works on the eldest son's first love.

56
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:05,789
That means if I break up with you, it will happen to me?

57
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:10,290
Not that! Only if you say vulgar things.

58
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,580
Who taught you all this?

59
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,370
It's okay, as long as the curse works.

60
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,830
Silly girl! I'll never break up with you.

61
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:30,590
Are those buns enough for you?

62
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:42,850
- Taste good?
- Yes, but it's a bit small.

63
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:47,510
- You're so demanding.
- What I bought you is so practical! There are ten buns.

64
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,949
Fang-fang!

65
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:19,989
Lin Xichi, you... Stop calling me Fang-fang!

66
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:23,510
- You've been waiting for long?
- I just arrived.

67
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,530
Come, let's go!

68
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:29,069
Any place you want to go?

69
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:32,769
- Yes, I want to go to many places.
- Such as?

70
00:07:32,769 --> 00:07:36,650
I need to think about and plan it.

71
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,289
Captain Fang, I was wondering why you disappeared right after practice.

72
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:43,690
You came here to fetch Demon Chi.

73
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:46,929
- Stop calling her that! Call her Sister-in-law.
- Sister-in-law!

74
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:50,489
Fang Sister-in-law, Fang Sister-in-law! When can we have some wedding candy?

75
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:54,010
Did I say something wrong again?

76
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,290
Let's go!

77
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,810
Did I say something wrong again?

78
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:33,490
What are you hiding?

79
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,950
I'm writing notes.

80
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:56,269
What notes? What's so mysterious about it that you're smiling while writing?

81
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,050
I'm not telling you.

82
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,910
It's a secret.

83
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:42,610
Did we just kiss indirectly?

84
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:51,970
No, we didn't! I can't lose my first kiss just like that.

85
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,749
I wish we'd kiss next year. Three years!

86
00:09:56,749 --> 00:10:01,170
I wish we'd kiss after three years.

87
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,490
I'm going to the restroom.

88
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,390
I've made up my mind on what I want to do.

89
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,590
Say it!

90
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,789
I want to go to the zoo and see elephants, hippopotamuses, and monkeys.

91
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,700
I also want to go to the aquarium to see stingrays and dolphins.

92
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,329
- I also want to ice skate.
- You didn't do so when you were small?

93
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,469
Not really! My father was busy working.

94
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,200
While your parents took you to the zoo, Lin Xigeng and I could only watch Animal World at home.

95
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:22,549
Stop looking around! Keep your eyes on me.

96
00:11:26,210 --> 00:11:27,690
What's wrong with you?

97
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,750
I promise! We're going to spend our weekend at the zoo.

98
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,289
- Really, Fang-fang?
- Really!

99
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:36,830
- Why are you being so nice?
- Isn't it great?

100
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,630
- Yes.
- Then smile.

101
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,170
You're so nice.

102
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,270
Let's eat!

103
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,709
Why are you eating my meat? Are you a dog?

104
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:00,429
You can't finish the rice, can you? I'll finish it.

105
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,029
What's wrong? You're so excited to come here, why do you look unhappy now that you're here?

106
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:25,790
Nothing.

107
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,750
I was excited to come to the zoo.

108
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,930
But I feel sad seeing them

109
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,430
being locked in the cages,

110
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,370
especially large animals.

111
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,550
They're supposed to live on grasslands or in jungles.

112
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,450
Fine! Then, we won't come here anymore.

113
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,650
- Okay.
- Let's go!

114
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:12,150
It's said that ostriches are the largest birds in the world.

115
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,150
But they have no wings.

116
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:18,029
That's why they bury their heads in the ground when they face problems.

117
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:19,529
They pretend not to see anything.

118
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,690
Just like you!

119
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,330
No, I'm a strong person.

120
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,569
Who broke the cup four times?

121
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,330
Who cried in the karaoke room after getting bullied?

122
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,990
That's different!

123
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:40,670
Look! It's written that it wouldn't bury its head in the ground.

124
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,830
It would run away.

125
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:48,190
Because it's not only the largest, but also the fastest bird in the world.

126
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,929
It has strong legs.

127
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,550
It has no wings, that's why it runs faster than lions and tigers.

128
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,710
Really?

129
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:01,790
What's your favorite animal?

130
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:03,920
I'm mostly a dog person.

131
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,210
For thousands of years, dogs have always been man's loyal friend.

132
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:11,770
Trust and loyalty are in their genes.

133
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,490
But humans are different.

134
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,370
They don't show what's on their mind.

135
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,850
They know how to pretend and lie.

136
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,790
How about me?

137
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,089
You're different! You're Fang-fang.

138
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,910
How about you?

139
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,310
Me? I'm Fang-fang's girlfriend.

140
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,510
My father's a cow who doesn't talk much.

141
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:44,830
My mother's a rabbit who has several homes.

142
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,470
How about Lin Xigeng?

143
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:55,009
Lin Xigeng? He's the monkey who jumps around.

144
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,610
Let's take a photo with Lin Xigeng.

145
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:06,530
Let me!

146
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,250
I never thought someone like me would get a boyfriend.

147
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:32,610
When I was small, I used to fantasize my life as an adult.

148
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,530
What does it look like?

149
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:37,690
A house.

150
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,711
It doesn't need to be very big and there will be two people and a dog.

151
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,990
T-that's it?

152
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,790
It's my ultimate goal.

153
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,089
I'll be the big boss, Fang Fang will be the second, and you'll be the third.

154
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:54,150
You're getting more and more outrageous.

155
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,010
Just say if you agree on that arrangement or not?

156
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,070
Yes, I do. I do!

157
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,970
I'll take you home in a few days.

158
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:08,470
Valentine's Day is in a few days.

159
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,590
Let's go.

160
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:36,000
[Rong City - Luo City]

161
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:41,930
Should I buy something for your parents?

162
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,390
You never did that, why should you this time?

163
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,050
This time is different.

164
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:52,390
I used to go play at your place and I'd get food and gifts.

165
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,490
- Now...
- Isn't it the same this time?

166
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,550
However, you've stolen their precious son.

167
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,230
Yes, I have, I have, I have.

168
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,450
Okay, there's still a long way to go, let's take a nap!

169
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,470
Dad, mom, we're back!

170
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:26,710
You're back! Chi-chi, come here.

171
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:30,509
- Hello, Uncle and Auntie.
- I miss you so much.

172
00:17:30,509 --> 00:17:34,250
Do you know how long I've been waiting for this day to come?

173
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:39,589
Xu Fang told me that he's in a relationship and I asked him immediately whether it's you.

174
00:17:39,589 --> 00:17:41,770
Had he told me it's not you, I wouldn't have said yes.

175
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:45,190
I watched both of you growing up together.

176
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,090
And I've been thinking of making you my own daughter.

177
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:51,570
You caught my eye when we first met.

178
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,750
I think your mother wasn't around at the time.

179
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:58,190
And your father was taking care of you and your brother by himself.

180
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,910
Both of you didn't eat well and your clothes were always dirty.

181
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,230
I felt so heartbroken.

182
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:12,170
Why did you bring that up again? They're both fine now, aren't they?

183
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,810
You know nothing.

184
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,710
So great! Chi-chi, you're now part of this family.

185
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:23,689
I'll leave you two to it.

186
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:28,049
I'm going to make your favorite squirrel-shaped fish and spicy chicken.

187
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:30,570
- Thank you, Auntie.
- Don't mention it.

188
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,409
- Let's go now.
- Watch TV! Have some fruit.

189
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:35,290
Sure, Dad!

190
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:45,310
Have some fruit!

191
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:48,990
Stop pretending!

192
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,750
Do you feel like you grew up here?

193
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:27,110
I feel like you've been my dog since I was small.

194
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,670
Can you not...

195
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,990
Forget it! I'll let you go today.

196
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,690
Do you want to go to a place with me tomorrow?

197
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,830
Where?

198
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,650
Run!

199
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,170
This way.

200
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,350
It's so high.

201
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:03,929
Isn't there supposed to be a fireworks show on Valentine's Day? Why hasn't it started yet?

202
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,090
Maybe we're here too early.

203
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:11,969
- It's snowing.
- It is!

204
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:14,030
It's snowing.

205
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,930
It's snowing.

206
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,890
It's really snowing.

207
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:21,089
It's been years since it snowed in Luo City.

208
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:22,910
It's really snowing.

209
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:29,650
Will the fireworks show be canceled because it's snowing?

210
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,029
I don't know! But snow is beautiful too.

211
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:37,370
I need to stand on higher ground so I can see it clearly.

You idiot! Preserved potherb mustard is what we eat during winter.
(T/N: preserved potherb mustard has the word 'xue' meaning snow in it)

00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:22,790
What's this?

321
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:24,610
A gift!

322
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:35,909
I can't open it! Why is there a password? What's the password?

323
00:28:35,909 --> 00:28:37,830
I can't tell you now.

324
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,889
You can keep the password for the rest of your life.

325
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,370
You don't want it? Then give it back to me.

326
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:46,030
It's my gift! You can't take it back.

327
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,230
When will you tell me the password?

328
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,910
That depends on my mood.

329
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,630
In that case, I'll get a locksmith to open it tomorrow.

330
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:02,570
I'm telling you, if you break the packaging, I'm taking the gift back.

331
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:03,870
You...

332
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,970
I'll teach you a good lesson.

333
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,010
Be good and wait for the password.

- Let's go! Or we'll be late for the bus.
- What bus?

335
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,640
Bus 419. The last ride is at midnight.

336

Let's go!

337
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,730
Sit here!

338
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:59,290
No! I can't let others see us sitting together.

339
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:02,100
I'm Big Brother Chi after all, I need to take care of my name.

You're acting like an idol.

- Feeling sleepy?
- I'm okay.

342
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,409
I'll lend you my shoulder, go back to sleep.

343
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:33,450
No need! I'm not sleepy.

Three!

348
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,390
I want you to keep doing it.

349
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:45,490
Keep playing archery and being a captain.

350
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,950
Be a role model for your team members.

351
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:51,210
Xu Fang, you can do it! You're number one!

352
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,170
Why were you being so careless?

It feels good, doesn't it?

355
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:31,890
Xu Fang, if I were abandoned by all,

356
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:34,610
could I really depend on you?

357
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,650
What you said at the restaurant,

358
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:41,810
do you really mean it?

359
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,770
Did I hurt anyone?

360
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,770
Of course!

361
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:00,270
If you were to become a homeless, I'd take you in.

362
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,510
Have you had a crush on me?

363

It's the fireworks!

Come here!

00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:24,810
Come closer!

Look!

368
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:34,870
The things I planned to do in 3 years initially

369
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:38,610
were all completed in one night.

370

Then, what should I do next?

371
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:53,290
Stop overthinking!

372
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,750
Why are you talking to yourself?

373
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:00,649
- Why didn't you knock?
- I did, but you ignored me.

What do you want?

Can I have your revision notes from third year of high school? Give it to me!

This is a miracle indeed.

- Then, just give it to me.
- You've started working hard.

- Do you have it? I need it now.
- You're being possessed?

Do you have it?

Yes, but I need to find it.

00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:16,169
If I never realize that I like you, what would you do?

387
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:21,690
I might stay single for a while.

388
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,890
Only for a while?

389
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:29,490
You want me to be single forever?

390
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:35,409
Then, later, you would date with Senior Li-li, Senior Jing-jing, or any other girl, right?

391
00:38:35,409 --> 00:38:40,270
Couldn't it be Junior Jing-jing?

397
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:34,690
♫ Not so difficult! ♫

398
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:39,930
♫ Making a choice is not so difficult. ♫

399
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:46,560
♫ It’s all warm and scattered expectation. ♫

400

♫ Not so difficult! ♫

401

♫ Making a decision is not so difficult. ♫

402
00:39:54,830 --> 00:40:01,580
♫ Nothing more than day and night mediocre bravery. ♫

403
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:08,380
♫ People hesitate so they've missed many fulfillment, ♫

404
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:14,350
♫ always at a loss and in a hurry but feel terribly upset. ♫

405
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:17,820
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

406
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:22,110
♫ A smile is really not that difficult. ♫

407
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:27,860
♫ Unconsciously, we will eventually dry our tears. ♫

♫ A promise is really not that difficult. ♫

♫ How could the regret of the past represent today? ♫

♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

♫ A hug is really not that difficult. ♫

♫ Our time isn't worthy to be entangled with loneliness. ♫

♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

♫ Loving someone is really not that difficult ♫

♫ Even if it hurts, being together or not, ♫
