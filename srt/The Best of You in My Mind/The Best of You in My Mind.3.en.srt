2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,400
♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,900
♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,400
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,000
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,600
♫ or pretend to be indifferent. ♫

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,000
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,600
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,700
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,600
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,600
♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,000
♫ Love is like a migratory bird waiting for the season. ♫

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,800
♫ How long does it take for them to be aware of each other? ♫

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,400
♫ You are like summer night, ♫

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,200
♫ I'm like a little star in the sky, ♫

16
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:13,000
♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,600
♫ Deliberately, I hit your shoulder, ♫

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,200
♫ and then, listen to your reprimand. ♫

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,800
♫ The caring feeling is so sweet! ♫

20
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,400
The Best of You in My Mind

21
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,000
Episode 3

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,100
You're such a trouble-maker, are you really graduating this year?

23
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,000
When will your exam scores be good enough for you to graduate?

24
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,400
How can you get into university with this kind of attitude?

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,000
Our school's 2013 top science student was my daughter.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,100
She ranked first in math and got into Rong University.

27
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,600
- Right now, she still has to study diligently and work hard.
- Teacher He.

28
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,500
Since you've raised such a great daughter already,

29
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,900
then you should be satisfied already.

30
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,800
Don't waste your efforts on a lousy student like me.

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,100
Tell your parents to come to school tomorrow.

32
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,700
My parents aren't around.

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,500
- They're truly busy.
- What is more important than their own child's study?

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,000
Where'd they get this equipment from? Such poor quality!

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,430
If they didn't have the finances, why did they even form an archery team?

36
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,100
I don't want to use such lousy equipment.

37
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,900
This kind of trash is dragging down my skills!

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,800
Captain Fu, the new teammates in our dorm are all from surrounding cities.

39
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,100
I'm thinking they're going to elect a new captain.

40
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,900
Elect another captain?

41
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,400
But of course, the new captain won't be as good as Captain Fu.

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,500
For me! I only listen to Captain Fu.

43
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,100
- What Captain Fu? (TN: Fu is a homonym for negative)
- No, no! It's Captain Zheng. (TN: Zheng means positive)

44
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,500
We're not teammates for nothing.

45
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,900
Get into line!

46
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:23,400
- Count off!
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10

47
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,000
You 10,

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,200
do you know how you are different from all the other students?

49
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,900
- We know.
- We do know.

50
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,500
Why are we not together at all?

51
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,800
- Do you know?
- We know!

52
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,100
Good!

53
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,400
As Rong University's first archery team,

54
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,300
you guys could say this is a historic movement.

55
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,900
Bringing everyone together from all around,

56
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,400
is an attempt to achieve good results with this new team.

57
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,800
To earn honor for Rong University.

58
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,700
I knew he'd say that but just how are we going to bring honor to the school?

59
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,400
Be quiet!

60
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,200
I know that these expectations might put a lot of pressure on some of you.

61
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,600
But I don't want to hear any complaints!

62
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,700
Because until you have achieved good results, you have no grounds to be picky.

63
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,100
Right now the entire school, from top to bottom,

64
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:21,800
all eyes are looking at you guys.

65
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,000
Your grades are part of your diploma.

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,800
So studying and practicing hard!

67
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,600
I won't let you do poorly in either.

68
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,500
- Understood?
- Understood!

69
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:39,430
In our team, we have some veteran players from Rong City's team.

70
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,800
We also have some new players.

71
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,700
I want to choose a new captain.

72
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,810
You are Xu Fang?

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,200
Your old coach was my teammate.

74
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,000
We competed in the world championships together and he recommended you to me.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,900
What do you think? Do you want to try?

76
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,800
Coach, I think Fu Kuankuan would be a good captain.

77
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,400
Coach, I can't be captain.

78
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,200
- I'm not suitable.
- I'll say whether you're suitable or not.

79
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,000
I trust your coach's judgment.

80
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,200
Okay, keep practicing! Spread apart.

81
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,220
Start with shoulder training.

82
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,400
Veterinary medicine is a practical science.

83
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,000
Just now, I've demonstrated the techniques to perform the dissection.

84
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,300
I will now randomly select a student to demonstrate.

85
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,800
Xin Zidan, come and try!

86
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Hurry and go!

87
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,100
- I don't dare.
- It'll be fine.

88
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,970
Go for it!

89
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,600
Teacher, is it too late for me to switch my major?

90
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,500
You can switch but you have to finish this dissection first.

91
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,500
Teacher, I'll do it!

92
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,200
Chi-chi, it's too disgusting.

93
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
Then you do it.

94
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,000
Just you wait!

95
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm sorry!

96
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,100
I really don't want to be the captain.

97
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,900
Brother, I understand,

98
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:50,800
Since it's like this, I'll do it.

99
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,400
Whenever heaven is about to confer a great responsibility on any man

100
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,500
it will first exercise his mind with suffering, subject his sinews and bones to hard work,

101
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,000
and expose his body to hunger.

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,400
I think you can do it but Coach won't agree.

103
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,000
You think so?

104
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,400
Then he hasn't any intuition?

105
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm so happy. Look at my dissection!

106
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,800
What is this?

107
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,900
Lin Xichi sent it to me.

108
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,600
This is too strong for my taste.

109
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,900
You can still eat?

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,800
Speaking of the devil!

111
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,000
Time flies when you're having fun.

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,100
We don't even know when we get to have dissection class again.

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,900
Do you guys want to eat anything?

114
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,600
Beef, lamb,

115
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,500
- No, no, enough! I can't eat anything right now.
- I can't eat anything, either.

116
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,300
I feel gross just thinking about it.

117
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,000
But you can't starve, we have class later.

118
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,700
Just take a look and order something.

119
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,300
Wait for me.

120
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,600
I-I-I'll go get some food! What do you guys want to eat?

121
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,500
- What do you want to eat?
- Sweet and sour pork, garlic pork belly, lamb with spring onions!

122
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,600
And an 8-treasure porridge for me.

123
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,400
Okay.

124
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,100
Thank you.

125
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Fang-fang, I knew that you wouldn't treat me like that.

126
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Since I'm your best friend.

127
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,200
I never said I would let you eat some.

128
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,300
But, if you want to eat, it's not like you are not allowed.

129
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,200
However, I have a requirement.

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,900
What requirement?

131
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,600
Let me think!

132
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,500
It's not that difficult!

133
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,100
As long as you can say 100 things that are good about Xu Fang,

134
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,800
I will let you eat some.

135
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,500
- I'm not eating.
- It's also fine if you don't eat.

136
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,300
They are here!

137
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,800
I just have to say 100 good things about Xu Fang.

138
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,900
Put this here!

139
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
What are they saying?

140
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,500
Number 1, you are so accomplished.

141
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,600
Number 2, your facial features are so perfect.

142
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,600
Number 3, your forehead is clearly full of knowledge.

143
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,200
Number 4, your two eyes are big and mesmerizing.

144
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,800
You can't tell that you had nearsightedness surgery at all.

145
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,200
Number 5, your nose bridge is tall and straight.

146
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,600
It's a work of art.

147
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,350
Number 6, this jacket looks so good on you.

148
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,840
It makes you look young and fair.

149
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,520
If Jiang Zhengxu were to wear this jacket,

150
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,940
he would look dark and old.

151
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,690
This watch is so much more fashionable

152
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,480
than Jiang Zhengxu's watch.

153
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,540
You guys wait for me!

154
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,790
Stupid Xu Fang, stupid Xu Fang! There's nothing good about you, and you still want to make me say 100 good things about you!

155
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,090
How am I supposed to do this?

156
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,930
The world is so beautiful, and yet I'm so angry.

157
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,820
This isn't good!

158
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,930
As soon as I entered the cafeteria, I saw you.

159
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,740
You stand out in a crowd because you're so beautiful.

160
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,940
You have such thick and shiny hair; it's so unlike Jiang Zhengxu's hair.

161
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,010
Your earlobes are so thick, you can tell you'll have good fortune.

162
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,080
Your complexion is so fair.

163
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,280
Your eyebrows are also really nice.

164
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:11,160
Your dimples are so even, one on each side.

165
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,410
Your fingers are so long.

166
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,600
Your skin is fair and youthful.

167
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,220
Your socks look so fashionable on you.

168
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:25,110
- You said this already.
- No, this time I'm saying they look so good on you, especially.

169
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,010
They would look terrible on anyone else.

170
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,620
Fine!

171
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,450
Number 51

172
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:36,750
Let's sleep!

173
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:40,070
Your eyelashes are long and thick.

174
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,600
They even curl upwards.

175
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,410
Number 99,

176
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,630
you have just the right amount of facial hair.

177
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:12,840
Number 100, you're such a kind person.

178
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,750
You're even treating me to a meal like some God descended to the mortal world.

179
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,030
Worse than a pig or a dog.

180
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,040
It's me!

181
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,850
I didn't say I would give you some.

182
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:34,400
I said 100 good things about you! Didn't we agree that if I said 100 you would let me eat some?

183
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:38,010
I did say I would let you eat something but not these.

184
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:41,090
Here! This one!

185
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,450
Eat up! Can't let you starve.

186
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:49,320
Xu Fang!

187
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,260
Xu Fang, you bastard!

188
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:05,400
Jiang Zhengxu is such a running dog.

189
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,040
This is such a waste.

190
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:21,130
Later, you have to listen or I will send this to our high school's group chat.

191
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:24,810
Let them see how much Big Bro Chi has changed...

192
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,930
Brother Fang, take care of my sister!

193
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,420
- Don't let her starve! 
- I got it!

194
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,410
Relax! I won't let her starve.

195
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,810
- Remember that! 
- I know!

196
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,670
Okay, bye-bye.

197
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:43,560
- What's the meaning of this? You're going to return 180?
- You're overthinking it!

198
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,110
Then what were you just doing with Lin Xinchi?

199
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,230
You shouldn't go overboard like that.

200
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,040
You guys are buddies.

201
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,810
- You don't understand how she bullied me when we were little.
- That was when you were little, how old are you now?

202
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,740
Don't go overboard, okay?

203
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,270
I just want her to know that time has changed.

204
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:03,140
She'd better not to treat me the way she did before.

205
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,060
Seeing her mad makes me happy.

206
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:14,990
Grandpa, your grandchildren are calling!

207
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,400
Grandpa, your grandchildren are calling!

208
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,720
Grandpa, your grandchildren are calling!

209
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,820
Grandpa, your grandchildren are calling! 
Chi-chi.

210
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,770
Chi-Chi!

211
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:31,100
Grandpa, your grandchildren are calling!

212
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:35,600
- Where are you? 
- What do you want?

213
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,040
- I have a dinner mission for you.
- Go away!

214
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,590
Think about your wallet!

215
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,470
Coming!

216
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,230
Are you Senior Jingjing?

217
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,600
Xu Fang asked me to come.

218
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,820
- You are?
- I'm Lin Xichi, Xu Fang's childhood friend.

219
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:12,160
If you have anything to tell him, you can tell me and I'll definitely pass it on for you.

220
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,020
Sit down!

221
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,560
Are you guys just childhood friends?

222
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,330
Yeah! We have known each other for a long time.

223
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,300
So, it's like that.

224
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,690
Then talk to me about him.

225
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,540
I... I'll tell you the truth.

226
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:33,140
The first time I saw him

227
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:37,040
I thought that he was really handsome.

228
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,450
What do you want to eat? Order whatever.

229
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,100
[Menu]

230
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,210
No need to be polite! I want to be friends with you,

231
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:54,310
as long as you help me!

232
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:01,240
Senior, let me make a call first! I'll be right back.

233
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,250
Wait for me!

234
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,170
What did she say?

235
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:17,520
She said "I really want to know Xu Fang."

236
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:22,260
"From the first time I saw him, I thought that he was really handsome."

237
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,440
So, it's like that?

238
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,550
Why did you make me come? Is it not enough for me to compliment you every day?

239
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,750
I have to listen to our senior compliment you, too?

240
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,200
I have something I need you to do for me.

241
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,840
- Just tell me what it is already.
- Senior Jingjing has been clinging to me since school started.

242
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,090
I already said that I didn't like her but she would wait for me at the entrance of my dorm.

243
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,270
So just tell her that I like you and make her give up.

244
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:48,270
Did you hear it? Don't hang up, I want to hear it!

245
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,170
Will Xu Fang come?

246
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,960
I have some stuff to do later.

247
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,590
If you have anything to say, just tell me!

248
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,750
I guarantee to definitely tell him.

249
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,260
Okay.

250
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,360
Then can you ask him

251
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,630
if he likes someone who is a little older

252
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,760
like a senior.

253
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:23,160
Senior.

254
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,060
It's like this, I think

255
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,360
being a little older is great.

256
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,590
But Xu Fang...

257
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,660
Xu Fang wants to tell you that he doesn't like you and only likes me.

258
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,440
It's over!

259
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,180
- We just started school and I've already offended a Senior.
- A senior?

260
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,160
Which Senior? What did you do to her?

261
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,570
All because of Xu Fang! Senior Jingjing wanted to see him.

262
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,880
He didn't go but made me go.

263
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,970
Later, when Senior was confessing,

264
00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:00,010
he made me tell her that the person he likes is me.

265
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,000
Are you stupid? Did you really say it?

266
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,350
Xu Fang was using hands-free.

267
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,930
You guys don't even know how adrenaline-filled that situation was.

268
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:10,420
Good thing I run fast; otherwise, Senior would have killed me.

269
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:15,210
How come when I look at Xu Fang, he looks so cool.

270
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,540
He doesn't seem like someone who would mess with people.

271
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:22,060
When I met Xu Fang, he was 8.

272
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,190
That time I already knew that he wasn't a good dog.

273
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,320
Back home, I was the Senior.

274
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,240
He just followed me around like a younger brother.

275
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,880
You were the Senior? How could you be Senior like this?

276
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:38,030
You guys don't know! Back then,

277
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,990
I climbed trees, harvest bird's nests, picked pomegranates; I could do whatever!

278
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,560
When I climbed trees, he would give me a leg up; when I harvested bird's nests, he would let them free after;

279
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,930
I picked pomegranates while he picked them up from the ground.

280
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,210
What do you two mean? Don't you believe it?

281
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,310
Seeing Xu Fang now,

282
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:59,720
I completely can't imagine him following you around.

283
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,750
I can't imagine it either! How did he grow up to be this wicked?

284
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,740
But that's good! He rejected Senior.

285
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,830
There should be a lot of people who like him.

286
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,470
When did those people become blind?

287
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,680
Speaking of Seniors, do you remember the teacher telling us about a Senior who skipped class?

288
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,290
I don't remember.

289
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,030
I remember! Her name is He Liyao.

290
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,530
I remember her! In our school, she placed first in the high school entrance exam for science.

291
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,280
She got into our school but because she's always playing video games,

292
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,090
she failed all her classes so she was held back a grade.

293
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,380
She sounds like a legend.

294
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,350
If she stayed a grade then she would be in our grade.

295
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,280
Maybe this is her bed.

296
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,110
How is that possible?

297
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,330
Then, who is this empty bed for?

298
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,670
What do you come in here for?

299
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,900
Stealing or robbing?

300
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,220
Catch him!

301
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,640
I couldn't tie him up.

302
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,470
Hit him!

303
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,460
Hands off!

304
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,810
It's a girl!

305
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,970
What now? You're disappointed I'm not a handsome guy?

306
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,040
This is my bed!

307
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,840
Then why did you come at midnight and dressed like this?

308
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,660
My friend called me to help act as an extra.

309
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:26,990
I came back and you all thought I was a thief. What a luck!

310
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,150
What's your name?

311
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,800
He Liyao.

312
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,660
You're the one who skipped class and got held back a grade.

313
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,670
It's not that I skipped class.

314
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,960
I missed the exam.

315
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:46,890
Oh really?

316
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,270
Senior Liyao, that—

317
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:55,320
Are you okay? I was too nervous before.

318
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,850
It's fine.

319
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:00,390
Let me introduce everyone! I'm Lin Xichi; this is Nie Yue and that is Xin Zidan.

320
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,200
You are Lin Xichi?

321
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,820
What is that expression on your face?

322
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:06,710
You've made quite a name for yourself, Lin Xichi!

323
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:10,500
Do you know a senior called Jingjing?

324
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,370
She's got her eye on you now.

325
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:18,280
Good luck!

326
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,920
Just kidding!

327
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,600
But she really does hate you quite fiercely now.

328
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,080
I want to see how you made her become like that.

329
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,230
It's a long story.

330
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:34,560
There are 5 more years until graduation, how can I survive?

331
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,480
We'll let you get settled in.

332
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,970
W-w-we're going to sleep.

333
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,390
We are about to be late. Hurry!

334
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,090
Teacher Yan's class, get over here!

335
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:18,040
Here, Xin Zidan'er!

336
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,630
Why did you come so early today?

337
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:30,430
I've heard this teacher, Yan Zhibin, is extremely strict.

338
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:33,160
Who dares to be late? I don't!

339
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,060
Look! Everyone's so eager.

340
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,370
Stop talking about it. Isn't it just because there wasn't any other teacher available?

341
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,840
We're already here, so we might as well take it seriously.

342
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,390
Mr. Yan can really get upset.

343
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,520
He even looks scary.

344
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,010
I heard that this Mr. Yan never smiles.

345
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:49,790
- Really?
- Yeah, it's really scary.

346
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,610
Why isn't the teacher here? He can't possibly be late on the first day of class.

347
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,750
How will he keep his reputation?

348
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,860
Everyone is here!

349
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,740
Student, pass this around! Everyone signs in for attendance.

350
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,250
- Do you all think that University is a place where you can mess around
- We have class today, hurry over here.

351
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,370
and do whatever you want to do?

352
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:26,150
Skipping class because you feel like it?

353
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:31,180
If you really think that way, I'll leave you with this phrase.

354
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,860
Deader than dead!

355
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:51,390
Senior, what does he mean?

356
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:57,960
If you don't study properly, you'll be thoroughly dead.

357
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:02,300
I just woke up; tell him that I'm in the bathroom, I'll come soon.

358
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,140
Hurry up to come over!

359
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:07,270
Disguise yourself! I'll be there in a second.

360
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,730
- Don't cause trouble for me!
- Think about your wallet!

361
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:42,140
I will be calling attendance now.

362
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,440
Those are called will come up front. No sitting together!

363
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,430
This will be the seating arrangement in my class from now on.

364
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,220
Tong Ting.

365
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,650
- Wan Huanzhong.
- Here.

366
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:55,910
Wan Liang.

367
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:57,650
He Liyao.

368
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,300
Here.

369
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,720
- Dao Honglin.
- Senior has to retake English class, too?

370
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:06,400
With this teacher... it must be hard not to retake the class.

371
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,740
Deng Yue.

372
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,820
Zhong Maomao.

373
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,130
- Tang Hongruo.
- Here.

374
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,680
- Yang Yu.
- Here.

375
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,840
- Yi Guoyu.
- Here.

376
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,140
Deng Yuxia.

377
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,500
Wei Zhao.

378
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,140
- Tong Tiangua.
- Here.

379
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,740
- Tong Qing.
- Here.

380
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,400
- Zhang Ting.
- Here.

381
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,540
Heng Ho.

382
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:34,700
- Lin Xichi.
- Here.

383
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,760
- Xin Zidan.
- Here.

384
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,860
Da Mahou.

385
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,860
- He Nong.
- Here.

386
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:46,470
- Xu Fang.
- Here.

387
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,970
Did you think that I wouldn't notice you if you change your outfits?

388
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:58,460
His eyesight is really what people described it.

389
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:05,190
You think that my eyesight is pretty good, isn't it?

390
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,710
- What's your name?
- Lin Xichi.

391
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,720
- Where is Xu Fang?
- Pooping!

392
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,470
He's in the bathroom.

393
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,120
You're such a good friend! Why don't you go to the bathroom for him?

394
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,340
You must be Xu Fang.

395
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,850
What time is it?

396
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,710
- I had diarrhea.
- Why didn't you wait till after class?

397
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,620
Go ahead and sit down! You'll be marked late.

398
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:46,490
Impressive! You just started school and you're already letting other students fake attendance for you.

399
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:03,680
What are you doing? If you didn't want to come, don't come! Don't get me in trouble.

400
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,890
I only wanted you to cover for me.

401
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,030
You're not afraid of failing this class?

402
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:15,720
As long as I'm competing for the school, my grades don't matter.

403
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,500
Tonight our department is holding a meeting with old and new students. After dinner, we'll play mafia.

404
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,270
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

405
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:38,260
Thanks, but I have dinner plans already.

406
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:53,040
Okay. Are you ready?

407
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,340
It's night time, please close your eyes.

408
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:00,280
Werewolves, please open your eyes! Werewolves, please choose who to kill.

409
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,620
Werewolves, close your eyes!

410
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,210
Detective, open your eyes!

411
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:12,000
Detective, who do you want to check?

412
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,650
She's... It's night time, close your eyes.

413
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,590
It's so late and they are still training.

414
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:26,180
Chi-Chi, stop talking! You're meant to be dead.

415
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,480
Nurse, wake up! You have one antidote, do you want to use it?

416
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,140
Nurse, close your eyes. Okay, it's the next morning now.

417
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,540
The game has ended! The werewolves win.

418
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,640
We shouldn't have lost that round.

419
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,980
Lin Xinchi, it's your fault! You kept talking.

420
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,850
My fault! I'll take the punishment.

421
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,590
- Truth or dare?
- Choose one.

422
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:51,660
- Truth!
- That's so boring.

423
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:57,730
- Dare, dare, dare!
- Dare!

424
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,440
Let's think about it!

425
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:12,010
Chi-chi, how about you go to the archery team and ask for someone's WeChat ID?

426
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:17,320
There are so many people and they are in training; how about—

427
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,120
Hurry and go! Hurry up! Go now!

428
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,710
Go on!

429
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,540
Student, give me your WeChat ID.

430
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,030
Give me your WeChat ID.

431
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,430
Dream on!

432
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,640
Forget about it! Let's go.

433
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:14,540
What's wrong? Are you okay?

434
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,220
I'll go get you some water.

435
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,100
What's up, are you okay?

436
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,020
What are you looking at? Just give her your WeChat ID.

437
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:26,650
None of your business!

438
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:34,130
- Xu Fang!
- Lin Xichi!

439
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,740
You dog! Are you trying to cause trouble?

440
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:41,390
Lin Xichi, get off!

441
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:46,380
- Lin Xichi!
- Let me go!

442
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,020
Lin Xichi, put your legs down!

443
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,830
Lin Xichi, were you born in the year of Dog?
(TN: Dog is one of the twelve annual signs in Chinese zodiac)

444
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:56,100
Lin Xichi, hurry and take me to the school nurse.

445
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,960
- What? Are you trying to fake an injury?
- For real, hurry up!

446
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:06,450
Let me see! Let's go to School Infirmary.

447
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,620
Let go of me!

448
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,400
This fight cured her hiccups.

449
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,780
- You don't understand right? Xu Fang pressed Lin Xichi's pressure point.
- Pressure point?

450
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:24,070
Here! It helps to stop hiccups.

451
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,890
My dad's a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner.

452
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:38,430
Serves you right! How dare you refuse to give your WeChat ID to such a pretty girl like me.

453
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:41,500
If I didn't know you, the target wouldn't be you.

454
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:45,420
Don't you think that I made you look good in front of your teammates?

455
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,020
Tell me! Besides me, who else would ask for your WeChat ID?

456
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,540
A lot of people!
[Infirmary]

457
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:58,380
There is no doctor here so you can only count on me.

458
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:02,850
Even though I'm an aspiring vet and I'm only supposed to treat animals,

459
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:06,210
I don't mind treating an animal like you.

460
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:08,820
l'll take my leave now!

461
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,670
- If you don't disinfect it, it'll get infected.
- Do it quickly, then!

462
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:17,540
How should I charge you for this medical treatment?

463
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:23,320
How come you're not screaming in pain?

464
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,070
This is nothing.

465
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,850
- You're braver than our Fang fang.
- Lin Xichi, you—

466
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:33,530
No need to thank me! Doctors are meant to save people.

467
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:38,220
- What happened here?
- Where?

468
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:47,530
- Did I attack you that aggressively?
- What do you think?

469
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:50,850
I'm sorry! It was an accident.

470
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:56,040
If this gets infected, what should we do?

471
00:33:56,040 --> 00:34:00,240
After all, you're my only friend.

472
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,930
Chi-chi, why are you so anxious?

473
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:15,820
Is it because you've realized how dumb you are and you can't live without me?

00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:22,060
I was afraid that if something happened to my creditor, I wouldn't be able to afford my meals.

475
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,390
S-S-Sorry!

476
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:29,120
Fang-fang, why don't we stop fighting?

477
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,310
- Dream on!
- Sit down!

478
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:37,700
- Why?
- I don't want to talk to idiots.

479
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:57,270
Aren't I obedient? I immediately stopped talking to an idiot.
- You—

[Breaking News! Freshman asks campus handsome for WeChat ID, gets rejected and causes a fight that leads to the infirmary!]

481
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,650
After being rejected by Xu Fang, she got angry and beat him up so bad that he was sent to the infirmary.

482
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:23,880
What is this? What is going on?

483
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:28,480
- What are you looking at?
- Chi-chi.

484
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,510
Someone took a picture of what happened and sent it to the school newspaper.

485
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,690
It said that you asked for Xu Fang's WeChat ID and got rejected.

486
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:39,170
You got angry and beat him up so bad that he had to go to the infirmary.

487
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:44,910
Can I say that it's not me?

488
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:48,050
I don't think there is enough time; the picture is very clear.

489
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:52,870
Also everyone knows you're a new student in the Veterinary Medicine Department and you're known as Big Bro Chi.

490
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,740
- Who said it?
- Don't cry Chi-chi.

491
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,960
Who said it?

492
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,800
Now, everyone at the university knows about what happened between you and Xu Fang.

493
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,280
What should we do?

494
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:18,760
You two knew that we were just playing and you guys were there.

495
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,030
But when did he become campus handsome?

496
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,060
That's hilarious!

497
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,260
- Lin Xichi, you have a new nickname.
- What?

498
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:31,380
Chi Demon!

499
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:38,210
Don't lie down on the floor!

500
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,580
Why don't the two of us explain it?

501
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:48,540
The university has more than 10,000 students, how will you two do it?

502
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,590
I heard that Chi Demon is our Junior sister.

503
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:03,140
But I've never seen her before.

504
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,630
Wow! Your department has another celebrity.

505
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:10,220
What do you mean celebrity? She's an embarrassment.

506
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:15,140
- What do you want?
- An egg and a bowl of congee.

507
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:19,140
- What?
- I want an egg and a bowl of congee

508
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,090
Talk clearly!

509
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,460
- This one, this one, this one! One of everything!
- Okay.

510
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,180
I was wondering which famous celebrity this was.

511
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,850
Turns out, it's Chi Demon!

512
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:31,280
It's Chi Demon! Everyone come look at her!

513
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,320
I'm taking it to go.

514
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:41,900
Who said the good looking ones are the best ones?

515
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:46,460
Looks can be deceiving!

516
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,950
You all are clueless.

517
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:56,610
I'm the victim here! Also, how is he good-looking?

518
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:10,160
Lin Xichi, I support you; persistently chasing your true love. Never give up!

519
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,330
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:30,760
♫ Not so difficult! ♫

522
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:36,010
♫ Making a choice is not so difficult. ♫

523
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:42,510
♫ It’s all warm and scattered expectation. ♫

524
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:46,340
♫ Not so difficult! ♫

525
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,900
♫ It's not that difficult to make a decision. ♫

526
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:57,620
♫ Nothing more than day and night mediocre bravery. ♫

527
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:04,460
♫ People hesitate so they've missed many fulfillment, ♫

528
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:10,570
♫ always at a loss and in a hurry but feel terribly upset. ♫

529
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:13,830
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

530
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:18,240
♫ A smile is really not that difficult. ♫

531
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,170
♫ Unconsciously, we will eventually dry our tears. ♫

532

♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

533
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:32,040
♫ A promise is really not that difficult. ♫

534
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:38,000
♫ How could the regret of the past be so felt today? ♫

535
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,290
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

536
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:45,610
♫ A hug is really not that difficult. ♫

537
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:51,570
♫ Our time isn't worthy to be entangled with loneliness. ♫

538
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:55,020
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

539
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:59,480
♫ It’s really not that hard to love someone. ♫

540
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,670
♫ Even if it hurts, being together or not, ♫

541
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:11,390
♫ those are all the best moments of life! ♫
