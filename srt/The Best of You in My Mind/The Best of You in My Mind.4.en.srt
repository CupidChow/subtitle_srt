00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:06,470
♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:09,810
♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:13,110
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,950
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,590
♫ or pretend to be indifferent. ♫

7
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,820
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,570
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,450
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:39,530
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:46,650
♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

12
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:53,030
♫ Love is like a migratory bird waiting for the season. ♫

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,930
♫ How long does it take for them to be aware of each other? ♫

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,360
♫ You are like summer night, ♫

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,940
♫ I'm like a little star in the sky, ♫

16
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:13,110
♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

17
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,520
♫ Deliberately, I hit your shoulder, ♫

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,240
♫ and then, listen to your reprimand. ♫

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,700
♫ The caring feeling is so sweet! ♫

[Episode 4]

22
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,598
Main area of oral cavity examination.

23
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,999
Oral cavity examination.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,878
Chi-chi, I brought you some food.

25
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,259
Don't rush! Put it here to eat.

26
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:50,340
All of you are so good to me.

27
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,460
- Put it on the chair!
- I don't think I can survive a day without you.

28
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,598
You look terrible!

29
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:00,080
No wonder everyone sides with Xu Fang.

30
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,899
It'll be the same if it happens to Xin Zidan.

31
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,999
It won't! We'll give the compatible couple a round of applause.

32
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,498
Who is your roommate now? Who are you siding with?

33
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:15,059
Why do you care so much about others' opinions? Aren't you tired?

34
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:18,160
I'm not as amazing like you.

35
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:22,000
I have an idea to help you

36
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,980
if you do care so much.

37
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,000
- What is it?
- Even if you say a hundred sentences right now,

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,600
it's still not comparable to him saying one.

39
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,240
Him?

40
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:01,839
Do you need toilet paper?

41
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,739
You're still alive?

42
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,759
I said I'm tired, why are you still here?

43
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:23,698
- I have something to tell you.
- Say it!

44
00:03:24,279 --> 00:03:28,039
Right now, there's a rumor that I'm pursuing you.

45
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,838
Really? How come I don't know about it?

46
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:37,439
They all say that I failed to get your WeChat and resort to violence.
 (TN: WeChat is a Social Media like Line, Sky)

47
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,079
They also said that you are way out of my league

48
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:43,459
and I was drooling over your beauty.

49
00:03:44,119 --> 00:03:46,020
I think they are correct.

50
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:50,098
Xu Fang, are you out of your mind? I'm pursuing you?

51
00:03:50,098 --> 00:03:54,119
Let me ask you! Did you ask for my WeChat?

52
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:57,140
Isn't it true that you hit me because I refused?

53
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,538
- Is there a problem?
- You knew it was a game.

54
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:06,258
No one can be sure! Maybe you have some ulterior motives.

55
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:09,038
I only have one motive towards you.

56
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,840
Lin Xichi! You still claim it's not...

57
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,118
Cut it out!

58
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:26,500
Go to Tieba and tell everyone the truth, right now!
(TN: electronic message board; online forum)

59
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,739
What do you want me to say?

60
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:34,720
Tell everyone that I'm a scoundrel?

61
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,999
How did you know?

62
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:41,360
Just clear the rumors!

63
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,719
Think of it as a favor.

64
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,920
Fang-fang!

65
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,820
Let me tell you! You won't succeed in getting anyone if you pursue them like this.

66
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,480
- Go back and have a good makeover!
- You...

67
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,480
Xu Fang! This means war.

68
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,240
Fang-fang, good morning!

69
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,640
I'm going to class.

70
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:25,779
Xu Fang, is this you when you were little?

71
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:28,320
You were so full of yourself.

72
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,139
- So full of yourself!
- Lin Xichi!

73
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:35,499
Hello! When will my delivery arrive?

74
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:38,079
Your delivery has already been received.

75
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,039
It's sent to Miss Lin in the female dorm 107.

76
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:44,020
Got it! Thank you.

77
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,719
You think I won't realize that you took my phone and changed my delivery order?

78
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,839
Don't choke on the food!

79
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,558
Chi-chi, when did you get to be rich?

80
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,518
You are treating us Yoshinoya.

81
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:05,319
This isn't me, it's Xu Fang's treat.

82
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:11,279
I added two extra orders and changed the delivery address.

83
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,860
Won't he discover it?

84
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,639
That's true! Won't he find out when he made the payment?

85
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,359
His calculations have always been bad anyway.

86
00:06:22,359 --> 00:06:24,659
He's so generous!

87
00:06:26,359 --> 00:06:29,080
You can't finish your meat?

88
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:33,959
Finish your own before you look at other's.

Where did you buy it?

It's cute!

She's cute, right?

Is your pink shirt beautiful?

Lin Xichi! Lin Xichi again, right?

00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,340
This is too much.

Brother, someday, I'll tie her up during a dark night and

throw her to the hills to scare her.

105
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,559
Throw her to the hills? The boars on the hills will be cursed if you throw her there.

106
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,838
You're still protecting her!

107
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,519
You are out of your mind!

108
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:25,159
But you are.

109
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,679
Maybe give it to me?

110
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:31,760
I'll put it on my bed.

111
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,379
Do you like it?

112
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:36,200
Yes.

113
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,679
You're crazy!

114
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,020
You will experience my wrath

115
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,800
if you dare to cross me.

116
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,460
Do you think she has become crazy?

117
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,919
What made her so happy?

118
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,339
It seems that Xu Fang has putting up a fight.

119
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,740
- What?
- See for yourself!

120
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,818
I was indeed harassed by someone.

121
00:09:12,818 --> 00:09:16,378
She went mad because she had a crush on me but failed to get my WeChat ID.

122
00:09:16,378 --> 00:09:18,520
It's really from him.

123
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,158
Isn't this his verified account? This is his picture.

124
00:09:22,158 --> 00:09:24,940
He's too cruel.

125
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:29,118
Chi-chi, he's talking about you, isn't he?

126
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:32,359
That's undeniable proof.

127
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,820
A crush on him?

128
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,380
What a joke!

129
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,259
The imposing and fine-looking Fang-fang.

130
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,860
What are you doing?

131
00:10:10,239 --> 00:10:13,080
You misunderstood me!

132
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,459
I don't have a secret crush on you.

133
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:18,700
It's liking you in broad daylight.

134
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,800
Senior Ye.

135
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,600
You're here to feed cats?

136
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,800
Join me!

137
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,300
Sure.

138
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,000
Is that really you on the internet?

139
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
I thought it was a joke.

140
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,400
I didn't think that you really like him.

141
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
That's not it!

142
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,100
How could I like him?

143
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,400
Back in the day, he used to be my underling.

144
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,900
You knew him when you were little?

145
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,300
But the group said...

146
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,300
It's all part of my plan for revenge.

147
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,000
Didn't he say that someone calls him every day?

148
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,200
So I used that against him and let him know

149
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,200
how it feels to be pursued.

150
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,700
Let's go!

151
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,500
Let's go!

152
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Taking a break?

153
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,700
Of course. I'm not training with him.

154
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,200
He's the captain

155
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,000
but he can't even get the basic stance correct.

156
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,200
I'm not satisfied.

157
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,500
Why did he get to be the captain?

158
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,000
Lin Xichi's Tieba has been updated.

159
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,100
Changed her name, too.

160
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,200
This name is good.

161
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,500
Fang-fang's cutie.

162
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,800
There's a hundred types of sweetness.

163
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,000
Eating sweets, cakes,

00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,900
and missing you 98 times a day.

165
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,000
Xu Fang who was buying

166
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,200
egg crepes for breakfast in front of the university

167
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,600
at 7.30 a.m.

168
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,600
You had egg crepes for breakfast?

169
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,400
No...

170
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,600
Even I don't know what you ate.

171
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,100
You must be a soda in your previous life

172
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,000
because my heart feels bubbly when I see you.

173
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's enough!

174
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,600
Her information is more specific than mine.

175
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,100
This is good.

176
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,600
I found that I liked you a lot yesterday.

177
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,800
I like you a lot today as well.

178
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:39,200
I have a feeling that I will still like you a lot tomorrow.

179
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,800
You can just say it.

180
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,000
Why did you take my phone away?

181
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,300
- Give it back to...
- Your phone...

182
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,700
Am I interrupting something?

183
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,700
Keep practicing!

184
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,800
You...

185
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,100
The stunning and elegant Chi-chi.

186
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,400
What are you doing?

187
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,100
The show must go on!

188
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,800
No need!

189
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,400
I can just do it

190
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,100
alone!

191
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,800
Why don't you get angry at me?

192
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,200
I'm not used to you being like this.

193
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,700
Besides, you started it.

194
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,200
A truce!

195
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,200
On your conditions.

196
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,200
Deal!

197
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,000
Archery team is looking for an assistant.

198
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Come to the interview!

199
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,500
What does that have to do with me?

200
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,200
Use the salary

201
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,800
to compensate for my recent mental tortures.

202
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Nothing good will come from working with you.

203
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,800
I'm, not, going!

204
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,900
It's not like you have a choice.

205
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,200
You...

206
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
You agreed to a truce?

207
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,300
Isn't that a surrender?

208
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,400
Is it useful to delete all these posts?

209
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,600
Everyone will still talk about it.

210
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,800
Exactly!

211
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,200
I think you suffered more losses than what you gained.

212
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,000
You think so?

213
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,200
A lucky tea for you to bless you.

214
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,200
I'm thinking how you'll be able to find

215
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
a boyfriend at school in the future.

216
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,300
You are too open.

217
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,100
Everyone knows it's your account.

218
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,400
Maybe there are guys who like open-minded girls.

219
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't think so!

220
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,800
What will you do if you have someone you like and he knows

221
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,400
about this?

222
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,400
I don't have anyone I like.

223
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,600
What if you have one?

224
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,700
I can't even eat properly right now.

225
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,700
I have no time for that.

226
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,400
You guys must eat more.

227
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,700
This is the last bag that I can afford.

228
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,600
Where's Mao Mao?

229
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,000
She's pregnant.

230
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,800
Senior Ye.

231
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:07,500
She hides herself because she's afraid of strangers.

232
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,600
What should we do?

233
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Should we get her a nest or buy her some cat formula?

234
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Unfortunately, I don't really have...

235
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,789
What's wrong?

236
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Your plan is not working?

237
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,600
I thought you had tons of ideas.

238
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,800
I'm tired so I'm giving him a break.

239
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,600
It's better to think of a way to earn money first.

240
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,500
Earn money? Are you short on money?

241
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Senior Ye.

242
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,000
Do you know of any work-study jobs?

243
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,400
I need one.

244
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,800
Well,

245
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
first year courses are very packed.

246
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,600
How do you have time?

247
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,200
Why don't you consider scholarship?

248
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,800
Scholarship?

249
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,000
The scholarship is high for veterinary medicine course.

250
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's enough to cover your tuition and living expenses.

251
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,600
They use a point system for scholarship application.

252
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
80 percent is for academic performance.

253
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,800
20 percent for club activities.

254
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,200
You get 4 points for joining the student association.

255
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,800
2 points for joining the class committee.

256
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,400
You'll get the full 20 points

257
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,000
if you join a sports club and have an outstanding

258
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,500
performance representing the university.

259
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,900
Does being a university team's assistant count?

260
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,400
It counts.

261
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,600
I heard the assistant gets a high allowance, too.

262
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Senior Ye, I'm busy.

263
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,700
I need to leave.

264
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,500
[Resume]
[Strength: taking care of dogs]

265
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm good at taking care of people.

266
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,200
I have a younger brother.

267
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,600
I also have a dog.

268
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
He grew from this size to this size under my care.

269
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,800
He is now a healthy, cute and lovable dog.

270
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,700
I'm responsible for taking care of his daily routine.

271
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,000
Because of my dog, I went into veterinary medicine.

272
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
My dog is like my own child to me.

273
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,800
If I become the assistant of the archery team,

274
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,200
I'll treat the team members the same like how I treat my dog.

275
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,300
You're done?

276
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,000
I like your personality.

277
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,100
Thanks for your compliment.

278
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,400
A female in the medical course.

279
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,800
It's suitable!

280
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,800
Our team is indeed looking

281
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,000
for an assistant at the moment.

282
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
But you need to know that this isn't an easy task.

283
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,200
No problem?

284
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,800
No problem!

285
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,500
Alright, I'll show you around.

286
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:53,769
Take a look at their training!

287
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:56,809
It's important not to move towards

288
00:19:56,809 --> 00:20:00,388
the targets before arrows are removed when entering the archery range.

289
00:20:00,389 --> 00:20:02,489
Understand?

290
00:20:02,489 --> 00:20:03,970
Safety is the top priority!

291
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,989
I'll leave the rest of the briefing to the captain.

292
00:20:07,989 --> 00:20:11,049
Xu Fang, don't move!

293
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:19,110
Know what it means to line the draw with the nose?

294
00:20:23,749 --> 00:20:26,549
See! You'll hurt yourself if your stance is wrong.

295
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:28,068
Does it hurt?

296
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:31,350
So, you know it hurts.

297
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,669
The stance will be affected if your body hurts.

298
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,069
Your shots won't be accurate.

299
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:37,168
Understood, coach.

300
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:38,588
I really don't think you understand.

301
00:20:38,589 --> 00:20:42,929
The main reason that you couldn't draw properly is due to a lack of upper body strength.

302
00:20:42,929 --> 00:20:44,988
You're slacking.

303
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:48,990
You're here when we train.

304
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:52,108
Coach, is he the captain?

305
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:54,170
A captain never slacks.

306
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:58,170
How can a captain set an example if he is slacking?

307
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:02,169
He should do better because he is the captain.

308
00:21:02,169 --> 00:21:04,329
Rework on your stance!

309
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,310
Pick one!

310
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:21,809
Don't you have other colors?

311
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:25,069
No.

312
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:28,130
How can a guy use such a feminine band-aid?

313
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:32,128
I only have this and you're lucky that I still have this. Keep quiet!

314
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:38,409
Can you do it gently?

315
00:21:38,409 --> 00:21:40,650
That was gentle.

316
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:43,270
It's great that it hurts.

317
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:46,217
I think it's a good thing that you recommended me here.

318
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:49,710
Now I get to see your miserable side.

319
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,330
It's because Coach Liu is strict.

320
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:56,309
A captain with a pink band aid.

321
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,830
A captain with a wrong stance.

322
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,709
A captain who is lacking upper body strength.

323
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:04,729
It's normal to hurt your chin in archery.

324
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:07,130
Is it normal?

325
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,930
It is.

326
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:11,310
- Is it?
- It is.

327
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,210
Ask Jiang Zhengxu.

328
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:21,270
20 reps each set, 5 sets to start.

329
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,029
Start!

330
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,650
Higher!

331
00:22:32,329 --> 00:22:33,829
Good.

332
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,950
What are you doing? Chest out.

333
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,109
Lower your waist!

334
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,589
Very good.

335
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:44,289
Lift your...

336
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:48,349
Tired?

337
00:22:48,349 --> 00:22:51,589
I was right that you lacked upper body strength.

338
00:22:51,589 --> 00:22:55,410
You should aim for a perfect stance as the captain.

339
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,388
Watch him for me! I'm going on a toilet break.

340
00:22:59,349 --> 00:23:01,350
Don't worry, coach!

341
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:09,069
I made wolfberry water at the office.

342
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,650
Go and drink it when you're done.

343
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,750
Your standard is worse than a middle school student.

344
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:20,349
Train more!

345
00:23:20,349 --> 00:23:22,010
Let's go!

346
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,889
You're the middle school student.

347
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:26,070
Why didn't you say it to his face?

348
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,910
Eighteen.

349
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:30,710
Nineteen.

350
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,169
Twenty.

351
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,709
That's good enough.

352
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:40,550
Are you getting all fired up because I laughed at you just now?

353
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:43,150
It's not because of you.

354
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,090
Why are you blocking my way?

355
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,229
- I'm going to go drink the wolfberry water. Get lost.
- You...

356
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:51,730
Come and have a drink!

357
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:53,769
Go on! Leave!

358
00:23:54,989 --> 00:23:56,789
You're good?

359
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:18,368
Yes, yes, yes. I get it, I get it!

360
00:24:18,368 --> 00:24:21,689
We'll get a good result, I promise.

361
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,710
I understand everything you said.

362
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,509
Give me another year.

363
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:30,930
I'll disband the team if we don't get a good result.

364
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,309
Alright. Sure! I got it.

365
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:42,309
Why are you here?

366
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,569
I'm helping out with moving things.

367
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:49,689
Coach, what you said just now,

368
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,689
was it all true?

369
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:57,190
- Do the members know?
- Not yet.

370
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:01,989
Don't tell them! I don't want them to have too much pressure.

371
00:25:01,989 --> 00:25:03,930
Why not?

372
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:06,989
The archery team is already a minority team.

373
00:25:06,989 --> 00:25:10,128
We can't compete with a popular sport like football and basketball.

374
00:25:10,128 --> 00:25:12,030
They look down on us.

375
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:15,189
I want Xu Fang to be the catalyst of my team.

376
00:25:15,189 --> 00:25:16,929
But look at him, right now!

377
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,310
He's hopeless.

378
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,310
Coach!

379
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:26,508
- What are you doing?
- I'll get your hopes up.

380
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:29,989
- How about...
- There's one on the floor. Pick it up!

381
00:25:30,629 --> 00:25:32,029
You...

382
00:25:37,258 --> 00:25:41,789
I told you because I don't think Coach Liu should

383
00:25:41,789 --> 00:25:43,970
hide it from everyone.

384
00:25:44,729 --> 00:25:48,369
He didn't tell the team because it will affect the morale.

385
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:50,409
Don't tell everyone!

386
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,769
Let's go, everyone!

387
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:24,868
Keep it up!

388
00:26:24,869 --> 00:26:28,090
Focus, everyone!

389
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,170
Bullseye!

390
00:26:33,349 --> 00:26:35,249
Keep it up!

391
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:39,330
Is it heavy?

392
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,869
You try it.

393
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:43,468
It's heavy! I'm using two hands.

394
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:47,770
They are quite alike.

395
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:59,790
How come these jokers are everywhere?

396
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,009
How unlucky!

397
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:03,910
We are still training.

398
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:07,192
Archers can just take it easy! It's no big deal for you.

399
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:10,790
Your small build can resist a gust of wind.

400
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,290
Enough training!

401
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,649
- You looking for trouble?
- Jiang Zhengxu.

402
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:16,348
I've long hated you.

403
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:17,628
- Same here!
- Looking for a fight?

404
00:27:17,629 --> 00:27:19,790
Come on!

405
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:21,550
Captain.

406
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:24,288
Calm down! It's an accident.

407
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,450
Stop fighting!

408
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,469
Come on! Stop it!

409
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:40,629
- Lin Xichi, are you alright?
- I'm fine!

410
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:41,950
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

411
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,090
- Let me have a look!
- Hurry! Stop them!

412
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,990
Get up first!

413
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,590
Great!

414
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,750
You fight well for someone who can't shoot an arrow.

415
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,990
Go and fight outside!

416
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,409
Show me how you fight!

417
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:17,990
Coach, they provoked us first.

418
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,790
You, too!

419
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:23,710
You're here for work-study.

420
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,850
The university pays you, yet this is how you work?

421
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,997
Xu Fang, come out!

422
00:28:30,997 --> 00:28:34,988
[Challenge yourself.]
[Surpass your dreams.]

423
00:28:34,989 --> 00:28:37,510
You led a fight as their captain.

424
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,920
You neglected your duty!

425
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:42,009
Go out there and shoot 1000 arrows!

426
00:28:42,009 --> 00:28:44,910
Don't go anywhere until you're done!

427
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,190
How long will 1000 arrows take?

428
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:52,148
It's the afternoon now. It'll be midnight when he's done shooting.

429
00:28:53,469 --> 00:28:57,329
Coach, I don't think it's fair.

430
00:28:58,489 --> 00:28:59,750
Who is the coach here?

431
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,788
They provoked us and said some really mean things.

432
00:29:02,788 --> 00:29:06,330
Furthermore, Xu Fang is not the one who started it.

433
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,310
Did he fight?

434
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,250
Did his teammates fight?

435
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:20,050
Coach, it's not fair.

436
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,750
He tried to stop them but the situation was uncontrollable.

437
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,130
If you were there, you'd have—

438
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,030
Be quiet!

439
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,010
Stand here and reflect on your actions!

440
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:17,930
Not bad, Brother Chi! You're the only one who stood up for us today.

441
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:20,309
What I said was the truth.

442
00:30:21,289 --> 00:30:24,589
You already have a sense of honor for the team when you've only been here a few days.

443
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,130
I'm just afraid that...

444
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:29,429
I don't want you to lose too badly.

445
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:32,109
How about Xu Fang?

446
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:35,310
You sided with him for the whole day.

447
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:38,110
My Fang-fang can only be bullied by me.

448
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:40,389
No one else is allowed.

449
00:30:40,389 --> 00:30:43,409
Coach Liu is so unfair.

450
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:45,849
I think everyone should be punished.

451
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:48,249
Why only punish my Fang-fang?

452
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:55,630
I take back what I said about your sense of honor for the team.

453
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,449
This is the men's changing room.

454
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:26,748
I know.

455
00:31:26,749 --> 00:31:29,588
I used to see you naked at your house when we were little.

456
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:31,289
Be quiet!

457
00:31:33,769 --> 00:31:36,329
I know it's hard on you.

458
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:39,030
You don't want to be the captain anyway.

459
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,670
You got punished for a wrong stance.

460
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,729
You also got punished when your teammates fought.

461
00:31:43,729 --> 00:31:45,370
They didn't even appreciate it.

462
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,230
Troubles are coming from everywhere.

463
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,169
I feel that I'm neither

464
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:52,269
suitable for the sport,

465
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:54,589
nor the captain of the team.

466
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:58,190
I even think I shouldn't be here.

467
00:31:58,190 --> 00:31:59,849
I don't think so.

468
00:31:59,849 --> 00:32:02,510
At least, you met me.

469
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:03,870
How is it good meeting you?

470
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,389
You're always talking back to me.

471
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:08,229
That's because you started everything.

472
00:32:08,229 --> 00:32:09,830
I...

473
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:16,869
The coach treats you that way

474
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:20,989
because he feels pressured and has high hopes for you.

475
00:32:20,989 --> 00:32:22,329
How does it relate to me?

476
00:32:22,329 --> 00:32:24,950
I don't want him to have hopes on me.

477
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,689
Coward!

478
00:32:27,629 --> 00:32:29,329
Say it again!

479
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:30,669
Stop acting!

480
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:32,288
You shot a thousand arrows.

481
00:32:32,288 --> 00:32:35,350
You can't even lift your arms.

482
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:40,070
I don't believe you can defeat me in an arm wrestling match.

483
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,649
You want to lose another month of pocket money?

484
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:43,929
Perhaps, I can get it back.

485
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,029
I'm in a bad mood.

486
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,008
I won't give you a handicap.

487
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:48,710
You're on! No handicap for you either.

488
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:56,410
I'll do the countdown.

489
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,810
One.

490
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,149
Two.

491
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:03,129
Three.

492
00:33:04,989 --> 00:33:06,910
You cheated!

493
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,550
Our rules never states no cheating.

494
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:13,950
This is my request.

495
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:17,389
A month's pocket money, right?

496
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,730
I want you to continue.

497
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:26,430
Remain in the archery team. Remain as the captain.

498
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:28,710
Remain as the team's example.

499
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:32,169
You can't do that.

500
00:33:33,769 --> 00:33:35,989
Whoever refuses is a puppy.

501
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:41,250
Fine!

502
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:51,749
There's still hope after all.

503
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:56,930
Still hurts?

504
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,368
Still hurts?

505
00:33:59,368 --> 00:34:00,228
I have no strength.

506
00:34:00,229 --> 00:34:02,129
You took advantage of me.

507
00:34:02,129 --> 00:34:03,349
It's quite stable.

508
00:34:03,349 --> 00:34:06,269
Peanuts, beverages, beers, water.

509
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:20,028
A bad teammate is worse than a strong opponent.

510
00:34:20,029 --> 00:34:21,548
Who brought in such a newbie?

511
00:34:21,549 --> 00:34:23,490
He's dragging our clan down.

512
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:26,270
Who is he talking about?

513
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,670
You think you're great because you're the clan leader?

514
00:34:31,249 --> 00:34:34,530
Don't play games with your IQ!

515
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:38,009
- My IQ is 140.
- Leader, calm down!

516
00:34:38,009 --> 00:34:40,049
I think he's still a third year student in high school.

517
00:34:40,049 --> 00:34:42,269
He lacks game time and experience.

518
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:43,728
A third year is still playing games?

519
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:46,589
Come back after you get into university.

520
00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:50,450
Everyone, listen to me! No one is not allowed to play with him until after June 8.

521
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:54,129
What about June 8? Trying to boycott me?

522
00:34:54,729 --> 00:34:57,249
I'll definitely find you.

523
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:04,128
Hello! Do you know who Big Li is in our area?

524
00:35:04,128 --> 00:35:05,709
Tell me his address.

525
00:35:05,709 --> 00:35:07,629
I must find him and beat him up.

526
00:35:07,629 --> 00:35:10,910
Otherwise, my surname isn't Lin!

527
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,789
You really can't meet him.

528
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:14,269
His house is at Rong City.

529
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:15,688
That's another city.

530
00:35:15,688 --> 00:35:17,448
You're going to find him at Rong City?

531
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,049
Rong City?

532
00:35:19,049 --> 00:35:21,550
Mom, do you still remember?

533
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:25,470
This is my birthday present when I was a kid.

534
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:28,729
On the day you left, both my front teeth fell out.

535
00:35:28,729 --> 00:35:31,869
I put them inside and always carry them.

536
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:35,348
Grandfather told me that children should throw their top teeth

537
00:35:35,348 --> 00:35:37,730
in a drain and the bottom ones on the roof

538
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:40,488
if their teeth ever fell off.

539
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:44,150
Can I give them to you later so you will throw them for me?

540
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:46,770
Here we are! Have a look inside.

541
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:48,909
Come!

542
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:00,729
Mom, you live here?

543
00:36:01,650 --> 00:36:03,450
Yes.

544
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:05,750
It's a bit too simple, right?

545
00:36:06,549 --> 00:36:09,288
There's no kitchen here, how can you cook?

546
00:36:09,288 --> 00:36:10,989
There's the cafeteria.

547
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:12,969
I can order delivery, too.

548
00:36:12,969 --> 00:36:15,070
Chi-chi, what's wrong?

549
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:18,250
You don't like that I can't cook for you?

550
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:25,110
Mom, it's too hard for you to stay here alone.

551
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:28,610
Why don't you come back and stay with us?

552
00:36:29,249 --> 00:36:30,789
Here! Have a seat.

553
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:36,589
I bought you a present.

554
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:39,749
That's so cool!

555
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,429
You like it?

556
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:43,548
- I like it very much.
- I knew it!

557
00:36:43,548 --> 00:36:46,749
You love animals and now you're studying veterinary medicine.

558
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,650
I hope that you can become a great veterinarian.

559
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,589
Wait for me!

560
00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:54,870
Also, here!

561
00:36:55,610 --> 00:36:57,410
Your pocket money.

562
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,070
I don't want it!

563
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,429
I have money.

564
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,409
How could you have money? You're just a student.

565
00:37:02,409 --> 00:37:03,849
Just take it!

566
00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:06,629
I have more money than I need.

567
00:37:06,629 --> 00:37:08,550
Is that so?

568
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,790
Mom.

569
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:16,829
Actually, everyone is worried about you.

570
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:19,509
I was always thinking how great it would be

571
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:22,030
to come to Rong City and stay with you.

572
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,369
Now, my wish came true.

573
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:28,410
We can always meet up and eat together.

574
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,870
I even get to see where you're staying.

575
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:33,670
I'm satisfied.

576
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:44,969
Mom, if you can't leave your work here,

577
00:37:44,969 --> 00:37:47,009
let's bring Geng-geng and

578
00:37:47,009 --> 00:37:51,208
dad over to Rong City when I become independent

579
00:37:51,208 --> 00:37:53,230
after I graduate.

580
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,008
We'll stay in Rong City, the whole family.

581
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:57,709
How's that?

582
00:38:04,209 --> 00:38:06,909
At that time, I'll come and visit you often.

583
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:23,800
[Ending OST: "It's not that Difficult!"]
[ Melody by Qiao Lin - Lyrics by Xueran Chen and Qiao Lin]

584
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,310
♫ Not so difficult! ♫

585
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:32,620
♫ Making a choice is not so difficult. ♫

586
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:39,330
♫ It’s all warm and scattered expectation. ♫

587
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:43,000
♫ Not so difficult! ♫

588

♫ Making a decision is not so difficult. ♫

589
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:54,380
♫ Nothing more than day and night mediocre bravery. ♫

590
00:38:54,380 --> 00:39:01,100
♫ People hesitate so they've missed many fulfillment, ♫

591
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:07,020
♫ always at a loss and in a hurry but feel terribly upset. ♫

592
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:10,500
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

593
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,950
♫ A smile is really not that difficult. ♫

594
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:20,590
♫ Unconsciously, we will eventually dry our tears. ♫

595
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:24,190
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

596

♫ A promise is really not that difficult. ♫

597
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:34,390
♫ How could the regret of the past represent today? ♫

598
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:37,960
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

599
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,280
♫ A hug is really not that difficult. ♫

600
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:48,150
♫ Our time isn't worthy to be entangled with loneliness. ♫

601
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:51,550
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

602
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:55,930
♫ Loving someone is really not that difficult ♫

603
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:59,440
♫ Even if it hurts, being together or not, ♫

604
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:07,700
♫ those are all the best moments of life! ♫
