Oh right! I need to toast to you individually.

You need to be careful
now that I'm in Rong City.

168
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,919
I have time to play games now.

169
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:03,460
You'll never overtake the top player, because I'm the top player.

170
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,900
Anything delicious?

171
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,310
I'll get it for you! The shop's specialty is very good.

172
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,489
- I want duck blood, too.
- No.

173
00:12:10,489 --> 00:12:12,430
I'll find one for you.

You... What's wrong?

176
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,390
Nothing, I'm waiting for my sister.

177
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,659
Are you going to class? Why don't I go with you?

178
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:46,120
I'll look for her there.

179
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,070
Your sister and I aren't in the same class.

180
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,970
We take different courses..

181
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,360
Then... it's time for me to go to my class, too.

182
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,220
Let's go to the academic building together?

183
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,510
Which way?

184
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,750
I'm...

185
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,120
going that way.

186
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,220
Then, I'm going this way.

Then, I'm going this way, too.

188

Our team has been established for three years now.

189

During these past three years,

190
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,060
everyone experienced rigorous training

191
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,430
and overcame harsh weathers.

Our morale is never damaged by sickness and injuries.

193

We will face our toughest competition now,

194

which is the Nationwide College Archery Invitational.

195
00:13:57,210 --> 00:14:01,060
Coach, does this mean that we will face Huaqing again?

196
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,420
- Are you scared?
- Scared? That's impossible.

197
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,170
We have trained for so long.

198
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:10,800
and let them suffer a heavy defeat.

199
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,700
That's the reaction I want.

200

This is my ideal team.

Will you face Ding Yi again in this competition?

206
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,160
It's possible.

207
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,810
I believe that you can defeat him.

208

Who is this?

The silent caller again?

I'm still getting it once in a while.

212

What if it's really from a girl who has a crush on you

213
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,260
and she's still doing this for so long.

That's so scary!

Eat more, talk less!

216

Brother Fei, what took you so long?

220
00:17:16,461 --> 00:17:18,510
- Just in time.
- I've run a few laps already.

Why are you here?

You don't know anything about motorbikes and you don't race.

224

I can do anything which includes carrying water and boxes,

225
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,040
washing motorbike and also refueling.

226

Don't think of it as a competition!

Think of it as your usual training.

Excuse me. This is a competition behind closed doors.

- She isn't a family member.
- Yes.

- She's the team assistant.
- Yes, I'm the team assistant, not a family member.

00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,500
Keep it up!

343
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,350
It's alright. Keep it up!

344
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,570

Xu Fang of Rong University and Ding Yi of Huaqing University.

347
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,419
Xu Fang!

348
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,680
Ding Yi!

349
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:04,200
- Xu Fang!
- Ding Yi!

350
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,940
My video is lagging so much, it's almost like a PowerPoint.

351
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,770
Did Xu Fang advance to the finals?

352
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,679
Can you hear me? Xu Fang advanced to the finals!

353
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,009
Did he advance?

354
00:30:16,009 --> 00:30:17,559
Yes, he did!

355
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:20,570
The coach is so happy that he went mad!

356
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,510
He didn't go mad. I did.

357
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:26,810
Who is the opponent?

358
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:29,450
It's still his rival, Ding Yi.

359
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:43,730
Xu Fang, I have faith in you.

360
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,520
You will definitely win.

361
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,160
Nine points.

362
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,100
Not bad!

363
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,500
Keep it up!

364
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,340
Alright!

365
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,000
It's fine! It's not the end yet.

366
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,310
Chi-chi, Xu Fang will be the champion if he wins this round.

367
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,690
Not bad!

368
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,440
Ten points!

369
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,969
Keep going! Ten points!

370
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:40,320
Ding Yi, keep the pace. That's good!

371
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:55,989
Nice! Keep it up!

372
00:32:55,989 --> 00:32:57,420
Ten points!

373
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:14,970
Xu Fang will win if he gets more than nine points.

374
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:20,070
I don't think Ding Yi can beat Xu Fang at all!

375
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:36,590
Champion, do your best.

376
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:39,640
So I can take you further in your career.

377
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:52,590
- Coach.
- It's fine.

378
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:55,519
Something doesn't look right with him. There won't be an accident, will there?

379
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,720
You'll be the champion if you nail this shot.

380
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,489
This year's champion for the

381
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:47,720
National College Archery Invitational is born after an intense match.

382
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,690
The champion is Xu Fang of Rong University.

383
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,390
My boyfriend, Xu Fang is the champion!

384
00:34:56,390 --> 00:34:59,899
Champion! Champion!

385
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,170
We won!

386
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,209
All events for today have ended.

387
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:11,820
We'll have team events tomorrow.

388
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:53,539
I saw a Weibo post today saying that you are this generation's Li Guang.

389
00:35:53,539 --> 00:35:58,610
Sharpshooter! The future hope of China's archery team.

390
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:03,509
I shared the post. I wrote "This is my boyfriend" as my caption.

391
00:36:03,509 --> 00:36:05,180
I'm proud.

392
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,990
I'm joking! That's not what I wrote.

393
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,899
It's all right, you can write that.

394
00:36:12,899 --> 00:36:16,810
But I heard that once you joined the national team,

395
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:20,030
we won't have much time to see each other anymore.

396
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:23,340
It's still a long way to go. Don't overthink it!

397
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:28,290
But I want you by my side and be my dog.

398
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,609
All right, I need to go! I'm off to practice.

399
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:36,429
Let's talk later! Bye.

400
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:37,990
Bye.

401
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,910
Congratulations.

402
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,240
Thank you.

403
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:10,280
Sorry, I didn't mean to eavesdrop on your call just now.

404
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,000
What's wrong with Xu Fang today?

405
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,660
I don't know.

406
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:41,099
Got too excited for the champion?

407
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,360
Something's not right with him.

408
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,019
Why are you here? What's wrong?

409
00:37:45,019 --> 00:37:46,349
- Coach.
- Coach.

410
00:37:46,349 --> 00:37:49,289
Xu Fang keeps practicing, he wouldn't leave.

411
00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:51,600
- I wonder what happened.
- Yeah.

412
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,030
Leave it to me.

413
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,230
Go back!

414
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,699
Xu Fang, stop training! You're tired.

415
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,840
Let me do a few more shots.

416
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,520
You're not going to listen to me now? You can't perform well under pressure.

417
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,130
You can't perform well under pressure.

418
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,449
It's useless to train more, I've told you many times.

419
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:09,920
Archery is a sport that trains our mentality.

420
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,550
Go back and rest if you understand.

421
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,690
Get ready for the team event tomorrow.

422
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:18,440
Xu Fang, I have high hopes for you.

423
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,019
Get good results tomorrow. Understand?

424
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,620
Look at me! You are the best.

425
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,530
What's with me?

426
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,510
What's wrong with me?

427
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,790
