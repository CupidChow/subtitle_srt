00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,350
♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

3
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,800
♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,260
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:17,020
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,630
♫ or pretend to be indifferent. ♫

7
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,900
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,630
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,450
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:39,510
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:46,450
♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

12
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:53,080
♫ Love is like a migratory bird waiting for the season. ♫

13
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:58,900
♫ How long does it take for them to be aware of each other? ♫

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:02,360
♫ You are like summer night, ♫

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,010
♫ I'm like a little star in the sky, ♫

16
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:13,080
♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,600
♫ Deliberately, I hit your shoulder, ♫

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,270
♫ and listen to your reprimand. ♫

19
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,700
♫ The caring feeling is so sweet! ♫

[Episode 18]

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,959
We're now beginning the group category of

23
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,480
the National College Archery Invitational.

24
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,000
Rong University, you can do it!

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,810
You can do it!

26
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,119
Participating teams, please check your targets.

27
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,500
Athletes, on your marks.

28
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:06,978
- For the group category, there are three athletes in each team.
- Captain.

29
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:10,219
According to their individual rankings, those qualified for the knockout round will be determined.

30
00:02:10,219 --> 00:02:13,959
- based on the overall result and rankings of the team members. 
- Go for it!

31
00:02:15,779 --> 00:02:18,478
You have ten seconds to prepare for the match.

32
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:21,079
And you are not allowed to enter the shooting line.

33
00:02:23,399 --> 00:02:26,018
Teams, please get into your lines simultaneously! Each team has six arrows.

34
00:02:26,018 --> 00:02:28,138
- You can do it!
- You can do it!

35
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:30,579
Jiang Zheng Xu, you can do it!

36
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:35,199
Each player will shoot two arrows, you will be given one hundred and twenty seconds to shoot them.

37
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:48,079
Once a team member has made his shot, he will have to get out of the waiting line.

38
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:51,499
The next member will then enter it.

39
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:19,199
- Nine points!
- Eight points. Good job!

40
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,320
Are you alright?

41
00:03:44,839 --> 00:03:47,360
Good job! Nine points.

42
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:50,459
The last arrow.

43
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:52,539
Xu Fang, you can do it!

44
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:54,379
We'll win.

45
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:06,559
Nice shot! Nine points.

46
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,900
Something's wrong with Xu Fang.

47
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,678
Don't worry! We're two points ahead.

48
00:04:11,679 --> 00:04:13,739
As long as Xu Fang plays it well,

49
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,038
we won't lose to Huaqing University team. Don't worry!

50
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:18,739
Xu Fang, you're my most favorite player.

51
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:20,859
You must perform well tomorrow.

52
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:23,960
Beat Huaqing University team in the group category!

53
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,370
Coach, Xu Fang wasn't like this before.

54
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,690
Something's wrong with him—

55
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:37,679
Xu Fang, you can do it!

56
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,659
Will you be seeing Ding Yi again in this competition?
- Congratulations.

57
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,020
Xu Fang, you're my most favorite player.

58
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,618
He wants me to make a great player out of you.

59
00:04:50,618 --> 00:04:53,740
Among all of your arrows,

60
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,300
this is the most ordinary one.

61
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,919
We're two points ahead.

62
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,440
As long as Xu Fang plays it well, we won't lose to Huaqing University team.

63
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:46,399
Where's the arrow?

64
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,999
- Rong University team missed the target.
- That's impossible!

65
00:05:47,999 --> 00:05:49,579
- What?
- That's impossible!

66
00:05:49,579 --> 00:05:52,578
- Xu Fang wouldn't miss the target!
- He's a great archery player!

67
00:05:52,578 --> 00:05:54,719
Is it a mistake?

68
00:05:58,159 --> 00:06:00,478
Captain, he missed the target.

69
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,359
Xu Fang is a great archery player!

70
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,580
Is it a mistake?

71
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,819
That's impossible!

72
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:10,240
Huaqing University!

73
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,698
Xu Fang, Xu Fang!

74
00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:28,139
What's the matter with you?

75
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,639
Why didn't you hit the target? You couldn't possibly miss it!

76
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,718
You wouldn't miss the target!

77
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:35,139
What's wrong with you today?

78
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:38,139
- I don't want to talk about it now.
- No.

79
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,800
Wait! It's just the two of us here.

80
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,400
What can't you tell me?

81
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,140
Tell me why you didn't hit the target.

82
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,079
Spill it.

83
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,559
Spill it!

84
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,558
You've never missed the target!

85
00:06:55,559 --> 00:06:58,400
Why did it happen today?

86
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,098
That's impossible! You couldn't miss the target. Tell me why!

87
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,460
What a pity!

88
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,500
I was still thinking of playing a few more rounds with you

89
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,399
but I'm still happy for you.

90
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,559
At least, you've become the champion in the individual category.

91
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,800
What did he mean?

92
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,999
The champion in the individual category?

93
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Did you miss the target on purpose?

94
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:42,620
I saw both you and Ding Yi talking together yesterday.

95
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,540
Did you?

96
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,000
Did you?

97
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,418
To become the champion in the individual category,

98
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:59,159
you decided to sacrifice our whole team?

99
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:01,819
Am I right?

100
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:04,679
Answer me!

101
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,320
Tell me!

102
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:11,619
Answer my question!

103
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:16,019
Tell me, did you do that?

104
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:18,200
You can think whatever you want.

105
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:30,419
Xu Fang, you jerk!

106
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,319
You jerk!

107
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:34,939
You are a jerk!

108
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:02,019
Coach, congratulations!

109
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,400
Good job!

110
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,760
Champion?

111
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,040
Congratulations.

112
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,259
What's happened?

113
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:39,160
Why does everyone look so sad?

114
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,879
We lost in the group category.

115
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,780
But they look unusually sad.

116
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:50,699
They probably didn't perform well.

117
00:09:50,699 --> 00:09:52,940
That's why they're feeling bad.

118
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:56,419
Okay, let's go!

119
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,578
- Scum!
- Rubbish!

120
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,500
Trash!

121
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,100
What? Yes, we're talking about you!

122
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,100
Did you do that on purpose?

123
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,000
So what if I did so?

124
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,700
Why did you do that?

125
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,200
For the ranking?

126
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,600
Since you're all here, I'll get things straight.

127
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,200
Yes.

128
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,000
I lost to Huaqing University on purpose.

129
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,300
I don't like archery.

130
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,400
I never like it.

131
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,000
We're here just to study,

132
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,100
why are you being so serious?

133
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,800
We're graduating soon.

134
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,500
Did you think you could beat Huaqing University?

135
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,000
Stop dreaming!

136
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
You want to die?

137
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,900
You want to die?

138
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,300
Since I knew I'd lose,

139
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,200
why would I play with you all?

140
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,500
I might as well

141
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,000
graduate as a national champion.

142
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,700
Sacrificing my study for you all?

143
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,500
Is it worth it?

144
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,800
You mean it?

145
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Yes, I mean it.

146
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,500
Xu Fang.

147
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,800
Do you remember I told you why I was fond of the archery?

148
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,600
Because it's a very fair sport

149
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,600
in which no one can cheat.

150
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,200
The arrows determine the number of points.

151
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,900
We grew up in the same archery team.

152
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,700
I wanted to fight alongside with you.

153
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,500
But I never thought you'd be the one

154
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,200
who betrayed me.

155
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,800
You don't deserve to play this sport anymore.

156
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,800
You don't need to hold the bow anymore, because you don't deserve it.

157
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,200
Why are you here? I've been looking for you!

158
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,400
- What's wrong?
- Xu Fang has quit the team!

159
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,000
- Why?
- I'm not sure why, either.

160
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,900
He fought with other team members in the locker room, then he told the coach he wanted to quit.

161
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,400
Knock some sense into him!

162
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,400
Xu Fang!

163
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
Why are you sitting here?

164
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,000
Nie Yue told me you quit the team.

165
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
Why?

166
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,700
No reason! I gave it a thought.

167
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,300
But you didn't tell me about it.

168
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,500
It's been so long since you left the team, you've nothing to do with all this.

169
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:41,000
How could you say so? You didn't tell me about this big decision.

170
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,000
Then what do you need me as a girlfriend for?

171
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,200
Tell me now! Why did you quit all of a sudden?

172
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200
What's on your mind?

173
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,500
I don't want to play it anymore.

174
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,100
I started playing archery because I wanted to study here.

175
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,800
Now that I've become a national champion and I'm a fourth-year student.

176
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,900
It's the right time to quit.

177
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
I don't buy it! (TN: American way of expressing toward unbelievable reason)

178
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,000
That's probably what's on your mind, when you first came to Rong University.

179
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But I saw how you slowly became the captain

180
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,900
and took charge of the team.

181
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,600
I just can't believe it! You always work hard on the field, rain or shine.

182
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,100
You even have extra practice at night and now you're saying that

183
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:28,300
you joined the team for your study and graduation.

184
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,500
Think about whatever you want but this is my decision.

185
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,600
Now, I'm quite fine. Don't worry about me!

186
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,400
Xu Fang.

187
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
Xu Fang!

188
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,600
Time flies! We're already in our fourth year.

189
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,000
I saw someone moving out from the next room and the others were preparing for their theses.

190
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,400
Only veterinary medicine students need to stay here for five years.

191
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,800
I find it quite nice.

192
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,800
I'm quite enjoying my life as a student.

193
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,300
Once I step out of university, I won't know what to do.

194
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,000
But you can't run away from it.

195
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,200
This year is sort of like death sentence with reprieve.

196
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,900
Didn't the teacher say that we're having our internships in fifth year.

197
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,600
Chi-chi, where are you going to work?

198
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,200
I've no idea at all.

199
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,600
Haven't you been working at the pet shop?

200
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,900
It's just a temporary job, I don't think that'll work.

201
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:43,600
I still need to find a job at an animal hospital or any job related to our field of study.

202
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,000
But Xu Fang's graduating soon.

203
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,600
He only has four years of study.

204
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,200
At least, you don't need to find a place, Xu Fang will take care of it.

205
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,200
We haven't talked about this yet.

206
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,400
But I heard

207
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,700
many campus couples would break up

208
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,800
upon the graduation season.

209
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,100
Eat your chips!

210
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,500
By the way, Chi-chi.

211
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,400
Xu Fang's been in a bad mood.

212
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,300
You should talk to him more.

213
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Got it!

214
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,400
Let's get back to the movie! You always talk during movies.

215
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,800
[Ward]

216
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,000
I've been lying here for a month, when am I going to be able to walk?

217
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,500
How is it? Does it smell good?

218
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,600
Bone soup again?

219
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:51,000
It's good for your body! Drink it and you'll recover quickly.

220
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,500
Get away from my leg! You've touched it.

221
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,800
Have some!

222
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,200
Is it hot?

223
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,500
Good girl!

224
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,100
I didn't see this day coming.

225
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:26,300
What day? The day you're served by me?

226
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,800
What? You want me to thank you?

227
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Of course! You must repay my kindness once you recover.

228
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,600
Thank you!

229
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,800
The doctor said it's good for your body, you should have more.

230
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Do you feel better now?

231
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,600
I find you so manly all of sudden.

232
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm greater than Superman, am I not?

233
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,300
But I want to see Batman now.

234
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,000
Sure! Have more and I'll show you.

235
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,300
Show me now.

236
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,400
Batman needs a cape.

237
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,800
- Peppa Pig will do, too.
- Sure!

238
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,200
- Louder!
- Try it yourself!

239
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,100
Eat it, don't make yourself choke!

240
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,000
You're graduating soon.

241
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Do you have any plans?

242
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,600
No, I don't.

243
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,800
Have you talked to Coach about your future?

244
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,400
- It's...
- Can you stop worrying about me?

245
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,900
How can I not be worried about you!

246
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:05,400
Since you quit the team, you should inform Coach of it.

247
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,900
Your field of study isn't like others.

248
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,600
If you want to be a coach or a PE teacher in the future

249
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,900
Coach will recommend jobs to you.

250
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,600
Didn't I tell you to not to worry about me!

251
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,500
I don't want to play archery and I don't want to work in this field!

252
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,700
If I can't find a job, I'll just go back to Luo City.

253
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,900
Go back to Luo City?

254
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,000
You still have me.

255
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,900
Didn't we plan to live together in Rong City?

256
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,000
You will find a job here.

257
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,500
I'll do the same.

258
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,400
After you get off work, I will make you dinner.

259
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:00,400
Later, we will bring Fang Fang here.

260
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,300
A couple with a dog!

261
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,400
- My dream life...
- We'll talk about this later.

262
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,500
I want to be left alone.

263
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,300
- Where are you going? I'll come with you.
- No!

264
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,400
I want to go to the mountain alone.

265
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,400
You should go back to class.

266
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,800
Have you talked to Xu Fang yet?

267
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,000
It didn't go well.

268
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
He's been acting weird these days and he's ill-tempered.

269
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,000
I really want to know what happened in the locker room.

270
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,300
Jiang Zheng Xu didn't tell me anything, either.

271
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:38,600
Xu Fang's been in a bad mood these days, so he's gone to the mountain to relax.

272
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,400
Just wait for him to come back!

273
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,000
Hello.

274
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,200
Who is that? Can you stop it?

275
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,400
Stop calling me!

276
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,400
I've no time for such childish games!

277
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,000
Hello?

278
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,100
- This is Chen Ding.
- Who?

279
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,500
I'd like to see you.

280
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Who exactly are you?

281
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
So, it's you.

282
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,500
Why did you call me?

283
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,000
I wanted to know how you've been doing.

284
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,200
Sometimes you picked up the phone and said hello.

285
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,600
Sometimes you sounded cheerful.

286
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,400
Sometimes you sounded annoyed.

287
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,100
There are also times you didn't pick it up.

288
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,200
That made me want to keep calling you.

289
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,400
What exactly do you want?

290
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,600
Because I want you to live an unfortunate life.

291
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,800
If you're unfortunate, I'll be happy.

292
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,000
How could you be so evil?

293
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I'm evil?

294
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:34,000
I think revenge is like a shell.

295
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,900
And I'm like a tortoise.

296
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:42,300
I felt safe only by staying in my shell.

297
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,900
But I suddenly realized that I lost my shell,

298
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,900
as well as my hatefulness and my revenge.

299
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,900
Still, I don't know

300
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,500
how to live without my shell.

301
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,880
I wanted to see you and tell you how I hate you.

302
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,200
to tell you how I hate you.

303
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
But when I see you,

304
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I can't bring myself to hate you.

305
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,000
I think I'm like an ungrateful traitor.

306
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:33,200
I'm doing my mother wrong.

307
00:30:26,639 --> 00:30:30,018
- Coach Liu.
- Do you know where Xu Fang went?

308
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:34,379
Xu Fang? He's been in a bad mood for the last two days,

309
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:36,338
so he's gone to the mountain to take his mind off things.

310
00:30:36,338 --> 00:30:38,279
The mountain?

311
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:40,659
Okay, I get it.

312
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,959
Turns out, in the past ten years in Rong City, mom

313
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,320
has been living a hard life.

314
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,519
She has silently been bearing it all on her own

315
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,559
and I didn't know anything about it.

316
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:26,519
Xu Fang, how have you been doing the last two days?

317
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:28,640
I met Chen Ding today.

318
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,598
She's my mother's daughter, too.

319
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:34,100
She's told me many things.

320
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,579
Her dissatisfaction with my mother.

321
00:31:36,579 --> 00:31:39,939
The breakdown of their family.

322
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,399
I suddenly realized that

323
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,260
although I held a grudge against my parents

324
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:48,699
for lying to me,

325
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:51,239
it was really all my parents could do.

326
00:31:51,239 --> 00:31:54,100
It was biggest protection for me and my brother.

327
00:31:55,699 --> 00:31:58,519
I was being too selfish

328
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:01,160
in asking them to be so honest with me.

329
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,279
I have to take some of the blame,

330
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:06,199
I think

331
00:32:06,199 --> 00:32:10,299
had I faced the reality of my parents splitting sooner,

332
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:12,580
and stopped running away from it

333
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,120
by not anticipating a complete family,

334
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,839
everyone including myself

335
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:22,079
would have lived a better life.

336
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:27,920
Just like what you told me many years ago.

337
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,280
Xu Fang, I really want you by my side.

338
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,860
How have you been these last few days?

339
00:32:37,699 --> 00:32:39,939
Please, come back soon.

340
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,099
Hello, Sir.

341
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:26,319
May I know if you've seen a man in his twenties?

342
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,720
He's as tall as me.

343
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,080
I'll show you his photo.

344
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,838
- This man! Have you seen him?
- I saw him just now.

345
00:33:35,838 --> 00:33:37,838
You did? Where?

346
00:33:37,838 --> 00:33:40,519
I think he is over there.

347
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,300
- Over there?
- That house.

348
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,499
Fine! Thank you, Sir! Thank you, thank you.

349
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,200
Why are you here?

350
00:34:50,979 --> 00:34:53,079
You saw it, too.

351
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:56,839
I can no longer play archery.

352
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,079
Come with me!

353
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:33,459
Don't think about anything else.

354
00:35:33,459 --> 00:35:35,439
Shoot that down!

355
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,619
Forget it, I can't do it!

356
00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:41,639
Try it!

357
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,839
Here, try it.

358
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,460
Good job!

359
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,899
It's not that you can't hit the targets.

360
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:37,200
Your body and mind have been captured by your fear.

361
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:40,219
It's called target panic.

362
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,519
That's why you can't hit the target.

363
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,899
An archer learns the technique and movements first.

364
00:36:50,899 --> 00:36:55,520
And then, he'll have to train his mind.

365
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:59,119
In short, he needs to train his heart.

366
00:37:00,479 --> 00:37:03,999
For a skilled and successful archer,

367
00:37:03,999 --> 00:37:07,960
his mind is more important than his technique.

368
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:14,640
I noticed this problem of yours a long time ago.

369
00:37:15,339 --> 00:37:18,518
But I never thought it would happen this soon and would have a huge effect on you.

370
00:37:18,518 --> 00:37:21,260
So what if we know it?

371
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:25,880
Now, I don't need to keep going.

372
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:32,999
Xu Fang, listen to me!

373
00:37:32,999 --> 00:37:35,039
I know an archery coach.

374
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:39,400
He runs a world-class rehabilitation-training center.

375
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,759
If you're up for it, I'll send you abroad after your graduation.

376
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:45,820
You'll accept your further treatment there, okay?

377
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,718
Xu Fang, you must listen to me.

378
00:37:50,718 --> 00:37:54,059
You're having a psychological condition, not a death sentence.

379
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,240
I'll think about it.

380
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,560
Fine, I'll wait for your answer.

381
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:40,270

382
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:43,880
♫ Not so difficult! ♫

383
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:49,150
♫ Making a choice is not so difficult. ♫

384
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:55,820
♫ It’s all warm and scattered expectation. ♫

385
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,570
♫ Not so difficult! ♫

386
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:04,040
♫ Making a decision is not so difficult. ♫

387
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:10,750
♫ Nothing more than day and night mediocre bravery. ♫

388
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:17,650
♫ People hesitate so they've missed many fulfillment, ♫

389
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:23,560
♫ always at a loss and in a hurry but feel terribly upset. ♫

390
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,060
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

391
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:31,340
♫ A smile is really not that difficult. ♫

392
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:37,160
♫ Unconsciously, we will eventually dry our tears. ♫

393
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,780
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

394
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,190
♫ A promise is really not that difficult. ♫

395
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:51,040
♫ How could the regret of the past represent today? ♫

396
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,490
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

397
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:58,780
♫ A hug is really not that difficult. ♫

398
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:04,640
♫ Our time isn't worthy to be entangled with loneliness. ♫

399
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,080
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

400
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,280
♫ Loving someone is really not that difficult ♫

401
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,860
♫ Even if it hurts, being together or not, ♫

402
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:24,060
♫ those are all the best moments of life! ♫
