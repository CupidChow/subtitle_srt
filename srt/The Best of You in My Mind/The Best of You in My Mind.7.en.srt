♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:39,440

[Episode 7]

22
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:17,479
I haven't used a bow for years.

23
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,459
But you can still maintain this skill level.

24
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:21,120
Amazing!

25
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,060
Your first coach was my teammate

26
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,300
and my best friend, too.

27
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,920
He's also the seeded player in our province.

28
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,499
He was talented and always worked hard.

29
00:02:39,499 --> 00:02:44,059
Although he was excellent, he missed the last shot

30
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:46,980
in the competition

31
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,779
because he was emotionally unstable.

32
00:02:49,779 --> 00:02:52,719
It was a pity that he didn't join the national team.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,039
Back then, he was thirty years old.

34
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:02,359
He had no choice but to quit with a heavy heart.

35
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:05,900
But I know what he wants the most.

36
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,320
He wants his student

37
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,360
to fulfill the dream he couldn't finish.

38
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,540
Xu Fang, that person is you.

39
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:20,340
Do you know why he sent you here?

40
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,760
He wants me to make a great player out of you.

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,099
But he never talked about these to me.

42
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:32,540
That's just his personality.

43
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,420
The scariest thing is that I can see his shadow in you,

44
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,460
hard-working, talented, and energetic.

45
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,950
But that's exactly what I worry about the most.

46
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:47,278
- Coach!
- Archery

47
00:03:47,278 --> 00:03:52,180
isn't entirely about confronting power or technique,

48
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,139
but yourself.

49
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,479
You must always stay calm,

50
00:03:56,479 --> 00:03:59,320
without being affected by any external influences.

51
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,020
Understand?

52
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,879
- Yes.
- Great!

53
00:04:08,839 --> 00:04:12,800
This target paper proves that

54
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,660
you can not only do well but can also achieve excellence.

55
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,200
Coach Liu.

56
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,620
Why are you here? What's up?

57
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,140
Coach Liu, could you allow Xu Fang to continue in the competition?

58
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,019
Xu Fang's too stubborn.

59
00:04:32,019 --> 00:04:36,759
I need to teach him a lesson; otherwise, he might get into trouble in the future.

60
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,299
Please hear me out!

61
00:04:44,299 --> 00:04:47,799
In the past, Xu Fang didn't take things seriously.

62
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:50,340
But ever since you made him become the captain,

63
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,120
I realized that he's changed.

64
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,218
He's become serious and responsible.

65
00:04:55,218 --> 00:04:56,998
It's not that he didn't want to change his technique.

66
00:04:56,998 --> 00:05:01,339
He's afraid that he can't play well enough to show how skillful our archery team is

67
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:03,639
and save the team from the current situation.

68
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:06,299
He's doing all this for the team.

69
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:08,400
It's exactly because of his pressure.

70
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,160
If he can't follow the rules and just plays as he wishes,

71
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,300
he may lose the competition in the end.

72
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,220
Just like his former coach! Understand?

73
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:19,858
Then, allow me to ask you this!

74
00:05:19,858 --> 00:05:24,340
What if Xu Fang is able to perform well under pressure?

75
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,780
Can he?

76
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,699
Xu Fang shot this after arguing with you.

77
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,660
Your result has proven to me that

78
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,419
you can play well no matter what techniques you use.

79
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,260
- It was I who has been too stubborn and narrow-minded.
- Coach.

80
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,660
Show them what you got during the competition!

81
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,459
You can do it!

Of course, I have to come support our team.

Yeah, let's cheer them up!

That's nice, Yao Wang!

- So professional.
- Binoculars.

I don't know how to use it; it's newly bought.

98

- Hello!
- It's so clear!

99
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,880
It's worth every penny.

100
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,260
- It's useful.
- Try it!

101

- We'll take turns using it.
- Sure, let's!

102
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,659
It's worth my money.

We can take turns using it.

Why are you here? You're supposed to be studying.

105

It's Brother Fang's game; I have to be here to watch it.

Honestly, our team is no match for them.

111
00:08:24,558 --> 00:08:28,019
- Since we're going to lose, why are we still doing this?
- So true!

112
00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,358
We're even doing it at our place and in front of so many people. How embarrassing!

113
00:08:32,358 --> 00:08:34,019
They're a team of rookies.

114

You're already here! What are you nervous about?

I know all of you feel you're less skillful than they.

Welcome to the archery competition between Rong University and Huaqing University.
<[Start Shooting Line]

122

First is the qualifying competition.

123
00:09:26,659 --> 00:09:29,400
There will be two rounds: First and second.

124
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:32,638
- Brother Fang.
- Seventy-two arrows for each player, so the full score is 720.

125
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:36,378
You'll be divided into twelve groups with six groups for each round.

126
00:09:36,378 --> 00:09:39,358
Each group will be given six arrows and two hundred and forty seconds.

127
00:09:39,358 --> 00:09:42,239
You have ten seconds to get ready.

128
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:45,520
Ten to fifteen minutes for rest in between.

129

Wait!

131
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,020
Well done!

132
00:10:23,979 --> 00:10:28,918
The qualifying competition is done! Athletes, please count your ring numbers and take down all the arrows.

133
00:10:28,918 --> 00:10:31,320
Your rankings will be announced later. After the interval, we'll have the elimination tournament.

134
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,550
After the interval, we'll have the elimination tournament.

135
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,620
How could that happen?

136
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:47,598
Can you pull yourselves together? Fangirls are waiting for you out there.

137
00:10:47,598 --> 00:10:50,130
I think they're waiting to see us get humiliated.

138
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,780
The opponents are way stronger than us.

139
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,540
We might not win this competition.

140
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:59,520
We're likely to lose it, but why are we doing it?

141
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,519
It's because if we don't push ourselves, we won't ever improve.

142
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:09,580
Fu Kuankuan, you used to have low stamina.

143
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,850
Now, you can even perform very well until the end.

144
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,980
Yu Tong, you used to find excuses for your bad aiming skills.

145
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,144
But now, you can reflect on your problems.
[Rong University Coach]

146
00:11:20,144 --> 00:11:24,580
Yao Wang, you used to eat junk food during breaks.

147
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,980
But you haven't done so for a week.

148
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,520
These are your improvements.

149
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,459
Xu Fang is right.

150
00:11:33,459 --> 00:11:36,759
Archery isn't a confrontational sport.

151
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:41,019
Throughout your whole lives, the real opponent you keep confronting is yourselves.

152
00:11:41,019 --> 00:11:45,519
Before defeating your opponents, you all must confront yourselves.

153
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,559
So, all you need to do now is to conquer your fear.

154
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,119
Fight with yourselves.

155
00:11:54,119 --> 00:11:59,180
In order to become a champion, one must have a champion's heart.

156
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,760
Go to the field now!

157
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,560
We can do it!

158
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,920
You can do it!

159
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,400
For the elimination tournament, each group will be given three arrows.

160
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,879
The winner gets two points. If it's a tie, each group will be given a point.

00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,910
The loser gets no point. Who gets six points first wins.

162
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,210
Who gets six points first wins.

163
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,260
During the finals, each arrow must be shot within twenty seconds.

164
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,879
- Bullseye again.
- So accurate.

165
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,518
- What's going on?
- Bullseye!

166
00:12:58,518 --> 00:13:00,920
- That's great!
- Well done! Bullseye.

167
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:17,358
- Bullseye.
- Xu Fang!

168
00:13:17,358 --> 00:13:20,619
Xu Fang, you can do it! You're number one!

169
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,066
Bullseye.

170
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,800
Bullseye.

171
00:13:45,239 --> 00:13:46,939
Nine points.

172
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:56,740
Nine points. Keep it up!

173
00:13:58,099 --> 00:14:02,238
Xu Fang, relax! Don't get distracted.

174
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,760
Nine points.

175
00:14:23,219 --> 00:14:25,019
He lost!

176
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:32,259
Round one, Ding Yi wins.

177
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:39,340
How could that happen?

178
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,139
Brother Fang, be steady!

179
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:57,640
Bullseye!

180
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,758
- Well done.
- Bullseye.

181
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:08,719
Bullseye!

182
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,939
- Look, Xu Fang is going to win.
- Great!

183
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:27,199
I knew he could do it. Don't worry!

184
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,120
Nine points!

185
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,640
Don't worry, he'll win!

186
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,300
Xu Fang, clear your mind!

187
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,180
Do what you do best.

188
00:16:20,537 --> 00:16:22,162
Bullseye!

189
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,899
I'm so nervous. How many rounds will there be?

190
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:41,480
Who gets six points first wins.

191
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,460
Ding Yi has four points already.

192
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,680
Xu Fang will catch up.

193
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,860
Well done!

194
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,560
Bullseye!

195
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:04,719
Bullseye!

196
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,919
Rong University caught up.

197
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,839
During the finals, when there's a tie, there's a tiebreaker.

198
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,519
Two arrows, one winner! Each player will shoot one arrow.

199
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,120
Each arrow must be shot within twenty seconds.

200
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,199
The arrow nearest to bullseye wins.

201
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,180
It's the final shot.

202
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,980
Bullseye!

203
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,260
Bullseye. Awesome!

204
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:37,219
Xu Fang, what are you doing?

205
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,710
Listening to music now?

206
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,710
He's finally taking it seriously.

207
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,080
What is Brother Fang doing?

208
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,850
Xu Fang, you'll win.

209
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:02,170
Xu Fang, you can do it!

210
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:08,079
Xu Fang, you'll win. Xu Fang, you can do it.

211
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,800
Rong University's Xu Fang's arrow is nearer to the bullseye.

212
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,200
Rong University team wins!

213
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,900
Does Teacher He know you had to repeat a year?

214
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,100
Isn't your mother, Teacher He who teaches math at Luo City Middle School?

215
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,200
- What do you want?
- It seems that you didn't know.

216
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,800
I need to think of a way to keep my mouth shut.

217
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,600
Are you threatening me?

218
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,900
You should really give it a thought, Brat.

219
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,400
Come on! Let me toast our sister university.

220
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,600
Here, thank you for your support.

221
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,600
- Friendship first,
- Coach sounds so diplomatic.

222
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
Here, cheers!

223
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,100
Enjoy yourselves! Sit down.

224
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,400
Here, let's drink!

225
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,200
- Here.
- Careful.

226
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,600
- Let's drink too.
- Sure.

227
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,860
- Cheers!
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

228
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,800
- Here, cheers!
- Cheers!

229
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,000
It's such a happy day.

230
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,800
I'm going to tell you how I feel.

231
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,600
I'm feeling so relieved.

232
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,600
I think you all are the best.

233
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,400
Just keep it this way.

234
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,200
Surely we can deal with any opponents in the future. Am I right?

235
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,000
Yes!

236
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,900
Enjoy your food.

237
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,800
My family needs me, I'll leave first.

238
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,500
- Coach, are you leaving?
- It's okay, enjoy your food.

239
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,200
- But control yourselves! Do not go too overboard.
- See our coach off.

240
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,400
- Enjoy your food! Goodbye.
- Take care, Coach!

241
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,800
- Goodbye.
- See you, Coach.

242
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:10,400
- Goodbye, Coach.
- Goodbye.

243
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,400
- Okay. Let's eat!
- Here!

244
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,700
You're not bad! But when we meet again,

245
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,000
we'll have our real match.

246
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,100
I can't wait.

247
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,300
Have some food!

248
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,100
Why am I feeling that he's a sore loser?

249
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,400
Forget about him! Come on, let's drink!

250
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,800
- Does the food taste good?
- Let's enjoy it today!

251
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,000
- Here, cheers!
- Here, cheers!

252
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,100
- Excuse me!
- Cheers!

253
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,300
- Cheers!
- Here! Here!

254
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,100
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

255
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,500
Here, cheers!

256
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,200
Xu Fang, you were great today.

257
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,200
Who are you?

258
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,100
I'm Lin Xichi's roommate.

259
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,200
We're in the same English class.

260
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,600
My name is Xin Zidan.

261
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,400
Thank you all for coming.

262
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,200
Don't mention it!

263
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,000
You're such a big eater.

264
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Stop stealing my meat!

265
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
There are so many, why did you steal mine?

266
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,900
Eat more vegetables! It's good for you.

267
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,500
Here, eat more!

268
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,000
People who don't know might think our team has been mistreating you.

269
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,800
Are you that hungry?

270
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,100
Don't you love eating this?

271
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,700
Eat more!

272
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,800
But the meat is all gone.

273
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,000
All that's left is chili.

274
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,300
Lin Xichi, you have no idea how Xu Fang bullies me.

275
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,900
He always bullies me.

276
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,700
- Let's go.
- Why did he drink so much?

277
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,400
I'm full, too! I'll go get the bill.

278
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,800
- Go on!
- It's on the team! Finish everything.

279
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,500
Sure.

280
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,600
There are so many dishes, why are you fighting over this with me?

281
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm sorry, people call me Prawn Hunter.

282
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And prawn is my favorite.

283
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,700
Sorry, my nickname is Prawn Huntsman.

284
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,400
This is mine!

285
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Give me a reason first.

286
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,400
I made those posters.

287
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,500
You made them?

288
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
I'm sorry! I didn't know that.

289
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,000
It's okay.

290
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,300
So, you're the one who made them.

291
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,000
I was wondering who made such beautiful posters.

292
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,800
I never thought I'd see the maker today.

293
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,100
- What's your name?
- I'm Nie Yue.

294
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,700
What a good name.

295
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,000
- I'm...
- Jiang Zheng Xu. Your father is a Chinese medicine practitioner.

296
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,400
- I remember you.
- Do you?

297
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,800
Well, when I made your poster, your face was my source of inspiration, you know?

298
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,300
Because you look like

299
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
a Chinese medicine practitioner.

300
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,400
You have a sense of humor.

301
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,700
Nie Yue, I have a request.

302
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,500
I'd like to keep those posters.

303
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,100
But Lin Xichi wanted me to pay for them.

304
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,000
I still have them! I have many copies in my room, I printed more than we needed.

305
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,400
- You have them?
- I'll give them to you later.

306
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,200
Sure, just give me all of them.

307
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,800
I'm going to paste them on my wall.

308
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,300
So cool.

309
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,698
Let's have five more plates.

310
00:27:09,698 --> 00:27:11,400
Lin Xichi went to pay for the bill.

311
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,600
Why did she do so? I said that I'd pay for it.

312
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,600
You should go before she does, she's just went to the counter.

313
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,400
Sure, I'll go find her now.

314
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,800
- I'll have five more plates of prawns without corns.
- No, one plate is enough.

315
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,300
No, five plates! Bye.

316
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,300
Wait for me!

317
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,700
Slowly.

318
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,300
I'm not done drinking.

319
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,100
- Keep drinking.
- Taxi!

320
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,600
We'll leave first!

321
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,400
Let's go!

322
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,500
- We're off!
- Bye-bye.

323
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,400
Xu Fang,

324
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,100
do you like Lin Xichi?

325
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,300
I take your silence as denial.

326
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,800
What does that have to do with you?

327
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
It does.

328
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,600
Because liking someone doesn't depend on who met them first.

329
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,000
Try it then!

330
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,600
Lin Xichi, it's late, where have you been?

331
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,300
Where have you been? You disappeared from the meal.

332
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,300
Fang-fang, you smell like alcohol.

333
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,200
Did you drink?

334
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,000
It seems that the archery team has had fun tonight.

335
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,900
Chi-chi,

336
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,400
I want to apologize to you.

337
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,900
Sure, you owe me one hundred thousand apologies.

338
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,000
Which one are you going to say first?

339
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,900
When we were in high school.

340
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,200
That's a long time ago.

341
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,600
It's the night we were looking for Fang Fang.

342
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:36,400
It was a rainy night and I said many horrible things.

343
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,600
Looking back,

344
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:43,800
I realize that I didn't stand in your shoes.

345
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,900
I was trying to comfort you using my own way,

346
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,600
but that method didn't suit you.

347
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,800
and hurt you instead.

348
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,700
It's all in the past, why do you bring it up now?

349
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,300
Chi-chi,

350
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,900
I'm sorry.

351
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,900
Actually, I've long forgiven you.

352
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:10,800
Did you know I went to find you the next day?

353
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,300
But you weren't home.

354
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,200
I went to find you, too!

355
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,600
But you moved to your grandfather's and I was downstairs at his place...

356
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,200
but I felt ashamed to call you.

357
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,800
Then, we're even now.

358
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,000
Chi-chi,

359
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,540
I...

360
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:43,080
I... I... I like-I like...

361
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,439
The bike is new, you don't need to wash it.
(TN: "like" and "wash" have the same homonym.)

362
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:49,459
Let me ride it!

363
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:51,560
Let me ride it.

364
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:54,258
Let me ride it.

365
00:30:54,258 --> 00:30:56,399
What? Forget about it!

366
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,120
You've always been petty when it comes to bikes.

367
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,539
You said you wanted to apologize to me.

368
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:03,499
Let me ride it

369
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:05,298
and I'll forgive you.

370
00:31:05,298 --> 00:31:06,799
I don't need your forgiveness.

371
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,998
But you were asking for it! Give me the key.

372
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:11,680
- No.
- I was the one who chose the prize.

373
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,200
Come and get it.

374
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,200
Do you like it?

375
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,679
I'll gift it to you.

376
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,049
- Really?
- If you don't want, then just forget about it.

377
00:31:28,049 --> 00:31:31,259
- Don't want?!
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

384
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,578
What an awesome bike!

385
00:31:49,578 --> 00:31:51,999
- One can even change the speed!

Lin Xichi, are you okay? Get up, get up!

396
00:32:33,579 --> 00:32:35,378
- Is your bike okay?
- Are you hurt? Let me check!

397
00:32:35,378 --> 00:32:38,459
Who cares about the bike. Get up first!

398
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,619
I'm fine.

399
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:44,780
I'll send you back.

400
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,699
- What about this?
- I don't want this shabby bike.

401
00:32:48,699 --> 00:32:52,300
No, you can't throw away your prize. I like it!

402
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:55,410
Carry it.

403
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,920
Why are you looking at me?

404
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,980
I carry it?

405
00:33:01,866 --> 00:33:03,666
I'll carry it.

406
00:33:05,019 --> 00:33:07,119
Hurry up!

407
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:10,159
Although I'm limping, I can walk faster than you.

408
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,440
- You...
- Can you carry it?

409
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,500
You should try to carry it.

410
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,060
It's so tiring, I'm exhausted!

411
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,620
I can't walk anymore.

412
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,740

Are you still letting people sleep?

418
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,340
Lower your voice!

419
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,300
So, how did it go?

420
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,539
How did it go?

421
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:09,440
Did you confess to her in the middle of the night?

422
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,880
What?

423
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,560
She didn't accept you?

424
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,639
It's okay.

425
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:26,740
She doesn't like you.

426
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,760
That's her loss, isn't it?

427
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,160
Where could she find a good childhood friend like you?

428
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:38,580
When I see her one of these days,

429
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,380
I'll scold her.

430
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,120
Don't get upset!

431
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,860
Yeah.

432
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:49,040
Since you've confessed to her,

433
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,760
you'll feel awkward meeting her.

434
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,000
You might even lose her as a friend.

435
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,380
I didn't confess to her.

436
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,200
What?

437
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,620
You didn't do it?

438
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,440
Then, what did you do?

439
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,920
You went for a walk? You–

440
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,119
It was a good opportunity, why didn't you confess to her?

441
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:16,760
I didn't know how to do it.

442
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,059
What are you talking about?

443
00:35:19,059 --> 00:35:21,630
It's not hard at all.

444
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:25,200
Just be casual, close your eyes, and tell her you like her.

445
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,080
Isn't that easy?

446
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,520
What's so hard about it?

447
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:39,160
Look! I saw it extremely clearly during the meal.

448
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,160
Ye Shaowen has intentions towards Lin Xichi.

449
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,979
You're able to deal with one Fu Kuankuan.

450
00:35:45,979 --> 00:35:49,220
But you can't deal with another one.

451
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,920
That guy is evil.

452
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,080
You understand?

453
00:35:56,780 --> 00:36:00,300
Having a crush on someone sounds like a beautiful thing.

454
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,740
Actually, it's like eating wax.

455
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:06,480
Listen! If someone gets her before you do,

456
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,760
it's like killing yourself by swallowing wax.

457
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,740
You're usually a smart guy.

458
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,680
But when it comes to relationship, you act like an idiot.

459
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,880
I'm so worried about you.

460
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,380
Lin Xichi?

461
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,400
Senior Ye.

462
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,840
That is... I have a question.

463
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,559
What is it? Just say it!

464
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:18,720
Tomorrow is the weekend.

465
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,660
I'm wondering if you're available.

466
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,400
Then, I'd like to treat you to a meal.

467
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,640
Just spit it out!

468
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:49,060
What kind of girl do guys usually like?

469
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,939
Why are you suddenly asking me this?

470
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:55,679
Don't bother knowing why! Just tell me now.

471
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:04,200
Guys usually prefer to use some numbers,

472
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,319
girls with long hair,

473
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:08,600
girls who wear white dresses,

474
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,440
and know how to be coy.

475
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,920
Do all guys like that kind of girl?

476
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,340
In short, it's the ones that are the complete opposite style of yours.

477
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,299
- What are you doing?
- You don't deserve to eat a meal but only dog food.

478
00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:26,680
You deserve only cat food.

479
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:31,180
- Why are you suddenly asking me this?
- I'm not telling you!

480
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,300
My mea-meal!
