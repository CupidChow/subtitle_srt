Xu Fang is not his usual self.

318

So, I think...

Actually, how Xu Fang feels about Chi-Chi,

320
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,939
- it's impossible for me not to see.
- Right?

If she likes Ye Shao Wen, I also...

323
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,250
She-she-she can't... If she likes Ye Shao Wen, Xu Fang...

324
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,719
it would kill him, he'd spend the rest of his life alone.

325
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:45,458
No, I just believe that

326
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:48,619
you'll see if we can come up with something,

327
00:26:48,619 --> 00:26:50,580
so Lin Xichi can be here more often?

328
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,580
She can help you with your work.

329
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:57,459
It's important to let them see each other,

330
00:26:57,459 --> 00:27:00,679
so they won't forget each other, right?

331
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,339
I get it!

332
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,400
It's done basically.

333
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,019
- Your skill is getting better.
- Good boy, good boy!

334
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,100
It's all right!

335
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,300
He's getting impatient.

336
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,540
It's done!

337
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:28,139
Good boy, good boy! We're done.

338
00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:38,480
The archery team will laugh at me if they see me.

339
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,800
Thank you, senior.

340
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:03,479
I didn't think that she'd ask you to clean cages.

341
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,059
Maybe she thinks I'm new to this.

342
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,719
Let me help you.

343
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,639

I... just want to have a look.

355
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,279
- It's dangerous to go inside during their practice.

Yue Yue, does the archery team still have any vacancies?

359
00:29:20,738 --> 00:29:23,579
Let me join as well; I want to help, too.

360
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:25,239
One is enough, Miss!

361
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:27,738
My princess, don't get into Lin Xi Chi's troubles.

362
00:29:27,738 --> 00:29:29,899
It's tiring.

363
00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:34,300
I said I'm here to help, actually,

364

Zi Dan, let me tell you the truth.

368
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,819
I knew that you have feelings for him.

369
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:56,950
However, I suspect that

370
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,200
Xu Fang won't yield.

371
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,700
You will get hurt if you insist on it.

372
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,880
Both you and Chi-chi are my friends, so I'm not being biased.

373
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,999
Just that...you are sensitive but you should know

374
00:30:11,999 --> 00:30:14,880
that the person Xu Fang likes...

375
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,899
is Lin Xichi.

376
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,280
Xi Chi already has Senior Ye.

377
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:47,218
- I'm back.
-Chi-chi.

378
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,530
Chi-chi?

379
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:53,259
How do you feel about working with Senior Ye?

380
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,200
Have there been any developments?

381
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,779
I'm not sure if there have been any developments.

382
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:03,200
I just know that I'm exhausted.

383
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,639
Sit up straight! Let me give you a massage.

384
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,140
Zi Dan, tell me!

385
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,879
Will you feel tired when you're getting along with a guy?

386
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,439
When I'm with Senior Ye I feel really tired

387
00:31:25,439 --> 00:31:29,158
but when I'm with Xu Fang I feel very relaxed.

388
00:31:29,158 --> 00:31:30,960
I can do whatever I want.

389
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,759
That's how it is.

390
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:36,160
Senior Ye treats you so nicely.

391
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,880
He does! He sent me back

392
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,470
and bought me some chestnuts.

393
00:31:41,479 --> 00:31:43,480
Do you want one?

394
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,580
So why did you say that there were no developments?

395
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:52,039
Because I was so tired that I wasn't in the mood to do anything.

396
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:54,700
Even if he is so handsome.

397
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:57,239
Actually, I think what you felt is correct.

398
00:31:57,239 --> 00:32:00,599
But it's normal to get nervous

399
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:03,060
when you're with the person you like.

400
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,999
You want to present yourself in the best way

401
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:08,219
and not to disappoint him.

402
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:10,990
That is why you feel restrained,

403
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:13,990
unnatural and cautious.

404
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,719
It's totally fine.

405
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:19,620
Is that so?

406
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:23,059
Ask anyone! They'll give you the same answer.

407
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,019
What's wrong with you?

408
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:31,460
Why do you feel tired, too?

409
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,700
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

410
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,080
I'm not going to the archery team anymore.

411
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,859
Xu Fang is a devil.

412
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:39,678
What? Did he bully you?

413
00:32:39,678 --> 00:32:43,758
He exploited me and used me as a slave, asking me to do everything.

414
00:32:43,758 --> 00:32:45,899
I did way more than you.

415
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,300
I'm not going anymore

416
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,758
It's fine! Wait for me! I'll get even with him for you.

417
00:32:50,758 --> 00:32:53,559
- You said it!
- I said it.

418
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,020
Give me a massage in return for my love to you.

419
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,240
I'm in a rush, so I'm heading out.

420
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,239
It's going to rain.

421
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:09,519
She came back sad and went out happy?

422
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,799
Is she up to something?

423
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:19,878
Nie Yue, you're so smart.

424
00:33:19,878 --> 00:33:22,540
You knew it would rain and brought an umbrella.

425
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:25,160
The weather in Rong City is changing.

426
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,519
- I always have an umbrella with me.
- Smart!

427
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,659
Oh, let me tell you! My plan worked well.

428
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:35,138
I told Chi-chi that Xu Fang was exploiting me.

429
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:38,318
- She'll find Xu Fang tomorrow.
- So smart!

430
00:33:38,318 --> 00:33:40,080
You're great!

431
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,079
Let me find some friends.

432
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:44,198
I'll pay and get you a signed picture of Hei Yu.

433
00:33:44,198 --> 00:33:46,699
No-No need! You don't have to.

434
00:33:46,699 --> 00:33:48,979
I have many.

435
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:54,118
- You already have it?
- Thank you, anyway.

436
00:33:54,118 --> 00:33:55,860
You're welcome!

437
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,899
It's raining heavily.

438
00:33:59,899 --> 00:34:02,579
There's only an umbrella, how will I go back?

439
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,059
- That's right.
- Right.

440
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:10,018
Why don't I leave the umbrella for you?

441
00:34:10,018 --> 00:34:12,019
- I'll run back, it's nearer.
- No.

442
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:13,599
Let's forget it. Forget it!

443
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,579
Why don't I send you back first before I go back?

444
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:19,460
That works!

445
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,059
Let's go!

446
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:35,100
Lin Xichi, you come back!

447
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,860
Xu Fang, did you exploit Nie Yue?

448
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:43,538
Did you get angry because I left?

449
00:34:43,538 --> 00:34:47,178
Vent your anger on me! Why did you bully Nie Yue?

450
00:34:47,178 --> 00:34:50,639
I'll beat you up if you bully her again.

451
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,559
How's work at the pet shop?

452
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,919
2,000 yuan a month.

453
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,498
The manager hired me right away because I'm passionate,

454
00:34:58,499 --> 00:35:00,400
love small animals and

455
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,460
have the necessary qualities.

456
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,332
- You're not suitable.
- Why is that?

457
00:35:05,332 --> 00:35:07,439
You have no qualities.

458
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,079
You can't step on me. Enough, enough!

459
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,120
Come here!

460
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:29,460
I left the archery team and helped someone else.

461
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,419
I helped your brother and granted Nie Yue's wish.

462
00:35:32,419 --> 00:35:34,700
Talking nonsense again?

463
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:41,058
The relationship is getting better between my serious roommate

464
00:35:41,059 --> 00:35:43,299
and the carefree Jiang Zheng Xu.

465
00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:45,120
Are you blind?

466
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:48,919
Focused and sincere.

467
00:35:48,919 --> 00:35:52,038
You need to be focused in a relationship, right?

468
00:35:52,038 --> 00:35:54,839
No, I'm talking about archery.

469
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,060
Lin Xichi!

470
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,819
Wait!

471
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:15,419
Wait! Can you quit the job in the pet shop?

472
00:36:15,419 --> 00:36:17,980
I've promised Senior Ye.

473
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:21,719
Defeat me and I'll let you go.

474
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:23,598
Can you not joke around?

475
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,520
Do you think I'm joking?

476
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,260
Come here!

477
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,740
Come on!

478
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,459
Three, two, one, start!

479
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,559
Even my dog gave me a handicap when we used to play games.

480
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,099
You...

481
00:36:51,919 --> 00:36:54,079
You... What you?

482
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,940
Don't forget that you lost.

483
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,058
I'll work there even if I lost. Move!

484
00:37:01,058 --> 00:37:03,339
Make way! Don't block me.

485
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,239
Do you know what time it is?

486
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:36,058
I'm sorry! I had something at school.

487
00:37:36,058 --> 00:37:39,299
It's only your second day, yet you came so late to work.

488
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:41,679
There are strict rules in the company.

489
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:46,619
Don't think I would be lenient because the son of our boss introduced you.

490
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:49,600
- The son of the boss?
- Yes.

491
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,400
Ye Shao Wen is the son of our boss.

492
00:37:53,919 --> 00:37:55,600
One last chance!

493
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,979
I hope you cherish it.

494
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:03,200
I'm sorry! I'll work hard.

495
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,080
Get to work!

496
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:29,719
[Lin Xichi, since you left, Xu Fang has been in a bad mood.]

497
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:31,879
[What's going on between the two of you.]

498
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:40,579
Lin Xichi! What's the meaning of this?

499
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:42,519
- I'm sorry!
- I can't scold you for being late?

500
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:45,720
Are you throwing tantrums now?

501
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,279
I know you don't want to clean cages but everyone starts from here.

502
00:38:50,279 --> 00:38:53,899
No one gets a special treatment around here.

503
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:56,039
Being passionate is not enough.

504
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:58,760
You need to be responsible, too. Understand?

505
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,439
Lin Xichi!

506
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,770

507
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:22,420
♫ Not so difficult! ♫

508
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:27,700
♫ Making a choice is not so difficult. ♫

509
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:34,330
♫ It’s all warm and scattered expectation. ♫

510
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:38,010
♫ Not so difficult! ♫

511
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:42,580
♫ Making a decision is not so difficult. ♫

512
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:49,410
♫ Nothing more than day and night mediocre bravery. ♫

513
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:56,140
♫ People hesitate so they've missed many fulfillment, ♫

514
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:02,180
♫ always at a loss and in a hurry but feel terribly upset. ♫

515
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,450
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

516
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:09,810
♫ A smile is really not that difficult. ♫

517
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:15,570
♫ Unconsciously, we will eventually dry our tears. ♫

518
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:19,290
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

519
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:23,580
♫ A promise is really not that difficult. ♫

520
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:29,420
♫ How could the regret of the past represent today? ♫

521
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:32,950
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

522
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:37,370
♫ A hug is really not that difficult. ♫

523
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:43,170
♫ Our time isn't worthy to be entangled with loneliness. ♫

524
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:46,550
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

525
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:50,820
♫ Loving someone is really not that difficult ♫

526
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:54,480
♫ Even if it hurts, being together or not, ♫

527
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:02,340
♫ those are all the best moments of life! ♫
