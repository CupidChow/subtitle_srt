It's so ugly! I've never found this sort of childish shirt to be attractive.

But it's so cold outside.

Wait, Lin Xichi, did you put on lipstick?

Why did you scold Lin Xichi today?

If a tough girl starts flattering herself and dressing up,

that means she's into someone.

Did she tell you where she's going?

She said she passed by there on her way to work.

His exam is around the corner.

162
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,090
Here! You need to eat more.

163
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,260
Sister, I think you should talk to our parents.

164
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:49,879
Eat faster, Lin Xi Geng! Your sister's going to finish them all.

165
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,070
How's your recent result?

166
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:57,750
Can you not talk about my studies while we're eating?

167
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,250
Just like Brother Xu Fang said, your exam is around the corner.

168
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,869
Many people redo the exam, so it's okay if you redo it.

169
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,649
What are you saying? Just don't say anything if you don't know how to comfort me.

170
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:14,850
I'm telling you, I'm a different person now.

171
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,440
In what way? You eat more nowadays?

172
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,990
I'm not telling you.

173
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:32,639
Sister, I have something to do later so I'll go to the train station now.

174
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,640
You should go back first.

175
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,700
Go home and study well!

176
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,159
Don't worry! See you after the exam.

177
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:48,439
I'm off.

178
00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:49,730
Bye-bye.

179
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,350
I'll take you back.

180
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:05,139
No, thanks! I hurt your arm during our last ride.

181
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:07,310
I'm not doing it again.

182
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:11,129
I'm recovered. See!

183
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,170
All good!

184
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:18,070
Why are you suddenly being so nice? I'm not used to it.

185
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,580
Let's go!

186
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:24,250
Sit tight!

187
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,850
-I'm sorry.
-Go slowly.

188
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,760
- Watch your way.
- I didn't see them.

189
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,540
Are you alright?

190
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,970
I'm fine.

191
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,190
You're alright? Your arm...

192
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,820
I'm fine.

193
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,380
I'll go slowly.

194
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,580
I'm sorry!

195
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,950
Is anyone here?

196
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,760
Is anyone here?

197
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,020
[Jiang Zheng Xu] I think she likes me.

198
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,700
You're really something! You've been working hard during the holiday.

199
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,700
I'm planning to finish two more papers on my way home.

200
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,540
Why are you here?

201
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,700
I came here because of my sister.

202
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,699
It has to do with my future brother-in-law, that's why I came here.

203
00:17:36,699 --> 00:17:41,250
Brother-in-law? Are you talking about Xu Fang or Ye Shao Wen?

204
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,080
You know about it all?

205
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:48,040
I can't jump to conclusions now.

206
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:51,489
You must help me to keep an eye on my sister.

207
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:54,240
Let me know if something happens.

208
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,299
This is my stupid sister's first relationship.

209
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:00,130
I can't help but worry about it.

210
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:03,960
I need to help you with that?

211
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:10,620
If you're not willing to do so, I'll go to school and tell Ms. He

212
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,700
in very details about her daughter.

213
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:17,960
What's wrong with her daughter?

214
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,210
Are you going to help me?

215
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,939
You brat! You win.

216
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:29,590
I need to go now! Tell me if you come here again. Oh, right!

217
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:33,560
What's this?

218
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,480
You can look at it after I leave.

219
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,790
What's the situation? What's the situation?

220
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:12,850
I heard her saying 'Xu Fang's way better.'

221
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:21,790
Tell me! Under what circumstance would a girl compare two guys?

222
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:25,660
For a girl, unless she likes one of them,

223
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,080
only then would she do so.

224
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,560
Brother, well done!

225
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,770
My ex-girlfriend used to compare me and Daniel Wu.

226
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,520
You have an ex-girlfriend?

227
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,310
Seriously?

228
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,790
What's so strange about it?

229
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,070
Captain Fang, who are you talking about?

230
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,010
Don't you have a girlfriend? You're thinking of cheating on her?

231
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,050
It's Lin Xichi.

232
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,730
Lin Xichi?

233
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,610
You still haven't confessed to her?

234
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:06,770
Even if she likes you too, if you don't confess you'll end up being friends only.

235
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:09,410
Why are you being such a coward?

236
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,599
Enough! Stop discouraging him.

237
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:13,840
Brother.

238
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:18,790
There's just a piece of paper between you two.

239
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,750
One of you needs to get rid of it.

240
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:31,059
My monthly salary! It's time to say goodbye to you.

241
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,620
Fang-fang's birthday plan.

242
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:43,930
One, buy a cake.

243
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:48,470
Two, buy a present.

244
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:54,640
Third, confess to him by candlelight.

245
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:04,090
But what should I buy for his present?

246
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,959
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

247
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:18,520
How can I help you?

248
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,519
I want to buy a birthday cake.

249
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:23,629
Okay, a birthday cake! Here's the menu.

250
00:21:23,629 --> 00:21:25,620
Have a look at it.

251
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,740
- I want this.
- Sure, please wait for a while.

252
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,780
Hi! here's your cake.

253
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:14,250
It's done?

254
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,560
How much?

255
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,020
Altogether, 278 yuan.

256
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,919
Okay. Including the bread?

257
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,870
Yes.

258
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:35,210
[CCTV in operation]
[Boys' dorms, no girl allowed]

259
00:24:24,590 --> 00:24:26,080
I can't get mad.

260
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,649
I like her! I shouldn't get mad.

261
00:24:29,649 --> 00:24:32,250
Gentle! I need to be gentle.

262
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,570
It'll be over soon.

263
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,170
Oh gosh! Why isn't it coming off?

264
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:48,220
He's going to beat me to death.

265
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,090
This time I'll teach you a good lesson!

266
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,989
Hurry up! What kind of internet is this?

267
00:25:47,989 --> 00:25:50,590
The speed is so slow.

268
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,270
Hurry up!

269
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:59,900
You're going to break the screen.

270
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,350
- Lin Xichi!
- Wrong person.

271
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,210
No matter how you hide, I can still recognize you.

272
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,420
Fang-fang, Happy Birthday!

273
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,610
Why don't you say something?

274
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,840
Didn't you wish me a happy birthday?

275
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,820
I'm pretty sure it's your birthday.

276
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,770
Do I look happy now?

277
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,790
Stop laughing!

278
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,450
Today's my birthday!

279
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,690
Stop laughing.

280
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,989
- Are we even now?
- No.

281
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,140
I've had enough of this!

282
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:51,000
Hurt! Hurt, hurt, hurt!

283
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,339
- Why are you pulling my hood?
- Stop talking! This is a male dormitory.

284
00:26:54,339 --> 00:26:56,200
I can't see!

285
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,040
Quick!

286
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,470
Xu Fang, who's that?

287
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:02,889
- Wait! what's the matter with you?
- It's none of your business.

288
00:27:02,889 --> 00:27:05,429
I've used up my shampoo. Lend me yours!

289
00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:08,040
No, no, no!

290
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,130
No!

291
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:23,100
I've looked it up! It's said that essential balm can get rid of the ink.

292
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,160
Do you have some?

293
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,030
I'll do it for you.

294
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,710
Am I hurting you?

295
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,930
Fang-fang, you're nineteen years old.

296
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:43,320
You must learn to be mature... and control your temper.

297
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:46,490
Don't get mad at cute and kind people!

298
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:48,720
Can you shut up?

299
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,550
Done! Go and clean your face.

300
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,340
Today's my birthday, I can't get mad.

301
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,470
I can't get mad!

302
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,510
Make a wish first!

303
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:10,860
I wish Lin Xichi would be less troublesome this year.

304
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,210
Can you make a wish related to yourself?

305
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,560
This is your birthday gift!

306
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,950
You're calling me a dog again?

307
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,889
Of course, not! I spent a night making this.

308
00:30:39,889 --> 00:30:42,690
And I embroidered this myself.

309
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,530
I wish it could protect you

310
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:50,850
from injuries

311
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:54,100
while you're having matches or training.

312
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:08,600
I think, sometimes I don't know what's on your mind.

313
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,600
- What are you doing?
- But I think, this time I got it right.

314
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,400
Lin Xichi.

315
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,600
Do you have a crush on me?

316
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,800
You still need to make a wish first.

317
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,100
Then

318
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:46,700
I wish you could forget what I just said.

319
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,300
Why did you blow out my candles?

320
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,600
Be-Because...

321
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,400
Because I don't think I can do that.

322
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:19,300
I...

323
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:24,600
