Xu Fang, if I never realized that I liked you,

22
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,860
what would you do?

23
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,180
I would've been single for a while.

24
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,600
A while?

25
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,570
What, you want me to be single my whole life?

26
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:06,300
Haven't we already known each other for our whole lives?

30
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,170
Hey, Brother Chi.

31
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,640
Attention, everyone!

32
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,450
Next math class our teacher will start from the end and work towards the beginning.

33
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,110
He'll talk about the last major question first.

34
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,600
Teacher's here, teacher's here.

35
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,390
You're about to take your College Entrance Exam.

36
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,340
What's with your studying attitudes?

37
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,860
Can you guys start paying attention?

38
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,400
During today's class, we'll start from the end.

39
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,600
This question was the hardest question on last year's exam.

40
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,730
It was also worth the most points, 12 points.

41
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,850
One point eliminates 1,000 people, and twelve points eliminate 10,000 people.

42
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,050
Let me write the question on the board.

43
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,280
I've already told you all of the importance. Learn diligently!

Listen!

00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:21,040
What did he just say?

47
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,500
He told you to erase the board.

48
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,470
I've already given up on Classmate Xu Fang.

49
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,100
I don't even know why,

50
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,810
but he's been sleeping for the entire math class.

51
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,220
Is he that sleepy? Am I a sleeping pill?

52
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,080
I'll say... Xu Fang!

53
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:11,730
Okay, we'll end class here. Class dismissed!

54

Lin Xichi, you're a coward!

57
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,570
- If you need to say something, spit it out!
- I want to challenge you!

58
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,830
- How?
- The way that we've always done it.

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,860
Time to move the tables!

60
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,500
Wow!

62
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,510
Big Bro Chi, just admit defeat!

63

Don't act dumb!

64
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,330
What do you want? Tell me!

65
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,400
I don't know yet! I'll tell you when I do.

66
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,360
I'll only give you a week to decide!

67
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,310
Chi-chi, wake up!

68
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,280
I'm going to work, I prepared your breakfast already.

69
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,180
Hurry and wake up, okay?

70
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,480
Wake up, be good! I'm leaving now.

71

Why is it instant noodles again?

72

What, you want abalone? Stop dreaming!

73
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,330
Of course, I do.

74
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,920
I can't believe you can even swallow that.

75
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,980
Be grateful! Dad already changed our beef noodles to chicken noodles.

76
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,360
I want spicy chicken.

77
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,620
Isn't Mom coming home from Rong City tomorrow?

78
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,840
Then, tell her what you want to eat! If you ask nicely, she'll even make you a braised moon.

79
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,910
You can have both noodles.

80
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,180

Sorry, Lin Xigeng!

84
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,530
I'm done for, I'm done for! I'm going to be late again.

85
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:14,570
Lin Xichi! Why are you still playing such an immature prank at your age?

86
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:21,380
Xu Fang, you've really grown. You even dare to remove the bicycle seat of "Dad"?

87
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,420
You're the one who has grown. Did you have nothing better to do last night, so you took my seat?

88
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,470
Don't you think that you're going a lot faster now that you have my seat?

89
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,420
It's stuck! Here, take this.

90
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,560
It probably already cooled down on your way here.

91
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,350
- How come they're not meat filled?
- Be grateful that you even have something to eat. Don't be picky!

92
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,710
Don't forget about the promise you made me.

93
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:53,860
Got it, got it! I admit defeat.

94
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:56,560
As long as it's not against the law, I'll do it.

95
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,880
Okay. Look!

96
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,070
Don't forget... keep your promise!

97
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,090
Lin Xichi, just wait!

98
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,190
- The teacher will definitely call the parents for wearing that.
- Yeah.

99
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,440
Hey, Lin Xichi!

100
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,950
How could she dress like this?

101
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,210
- Pay attention when you're walking.
- What happened?

102
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,760
Isn't that Lin Xichi?

103
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,270
What is she wearing?

104
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:25,490
What is she wearing?

105
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:36,750
Big Bro Chi, your black stockings are pretty.

106
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,450

Lin Xichi! You must bring your parents here today!

111
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:16,360
Teacher, I'll go stand outside by myself as punishment.

112
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,350
What are you looking at? Go to class!

113
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,070
Older Sister, what are you doing here?

114
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,760
You're being punished?

115
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,480
You shouldn't have removed my bike seat. You deserve it!

116
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,640
We'll settle it when we get home, I'm telling you.

117

- Fellow,

119
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,830
if you ever fall into my hand again, I'll slam you into the wall and you won't even be peeled off.

120
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,630
What are you saying? I can't hear.

121
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,680
Peel...

122
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,250
Xu Fang, come back to class!

123
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:35,300
These stockings look pretty good on me.

124
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,500

00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,910
Fang Fang!

127
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,180
Look, do Sister's stockings look good?

128
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:51,330
Fang Fang, here!

- Who is it?
- It's me, Mom.

132
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,670
You're home?

133
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,290
What are you doing?

134
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,570
Mom, weren't you coming back tomorrow?

135
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,400
I missed you, so I came back earlier. Are you happy?

136
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,170
I missed you, too.

137
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,030
Look! Mom bought so much food for you.

138
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,020
We'll eat your favorite spicy chicken tonight. How is that?

139
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,560
- I've been wanting to eat spicy chicken.
- You're such a glutton.

140
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,740
If Mom sees my stocking, she'll definitely think I've learned to be bad.

141
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,580
Chi-chi, come here!

142
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,360
I'm coming!

143
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,510
Did your dad not make you good food again?

144
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,630
He gives us instant noodles every day.

145
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,540
I knew it!

146
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,530
Mom,

147
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,240
you've been in Rong City for almost ten years.

148
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,480
Are you still able to come back and live with us two?

149
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,770
Because when you're home, we can eat some good food.

150
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,810
Where's Geng-geng? How come he's still not home yet?

151
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:16,760
Him? He's probably being kept after school by a teacher again.

152
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,300
This child!

153
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,290
Mom, I'll help you.

154
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:32,180
What's wrong with you? Did Mom put something in the spicy chicken?

155
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,410
You're so annoying. Stop singing!

156
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,990
Stop eating! Save some for Dad.

157
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,920
I'm full.

158
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,850
What is this?

159
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,750
You're home!

160
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,580
Disgusting!

161
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,150
What's wrong with her?

162
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,210
What did I do?

163
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,430
- What did you say?
- Why are you accusing me out of nothing?

164
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:34,100
- You still won't admit it.
- I didn't bring anyone home. Just based on these stockings?

165
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,740
You know it in your heart!

166
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,720
I don't care about your matters, but you can't bring people home.

167
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,460
Can you consider the children?

168
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:44,440
This is Chi-chi and Geng-geng's living quarters! What are they going to think?

169
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,960
What did I do wrong? I take care of them very well.

170
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,710
Yeah right!

171
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,180
Mom, Mom.

172
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,190
Why aren't you wearing shoes?

173
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,990
I have something at the hospital.

174
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:08,420
I have to go back to Rong City tonight.

175
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,880
Mom, you only just came back today.

176
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,100
- It's rare for you to come home. Come home with me.
- Chi-chi.

177
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,470
The hospital has a difficult case.

178
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:24,210
They need me to diagnose it.

179
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,850
Mom.

180
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,080
- Those black stockings—
- Chi-chi.

181
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,980
Don't think nonsense! Your most important task now is the college entrance exam.

182
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,890
Don't mind adult matters.

183
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,050
Hurry and go in! Don't catch a cold.

184
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,990
I'll leave now, okay?

185
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,950
The black stockings are mine.

186
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,350
You're still mad?

187
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,900
You created a disaster for me!

188
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,820
I'm very sorry!

189
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,540
Get lost! Those stockings were found by my mom.

190
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,240
What's wrong with that?

191
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,710
My mom thought my dad was having an affair.

192
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:59,490
You—

193
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,130
Xu Fang.

194
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:11,960
Stand up. Stand up!

195
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:18,250
- I'm asking you, do you hate me?
- No.

196
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,830
Then why are you always messing around in my class?

197
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,390
I wasn't.

198
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:25,920
- You weren't? Did you listen to me?
- I didn't—yes.

199
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:30,880
What do you mean yes? You listened? Come! Solve this question. Hurry up!

200
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,370
- How do you do it?
- I don't know!

201
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,390
What are you looking at her for? Come up and solve the question.

202
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:02,720
Teacher, I don't know how to do it.

203
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,750
Then what do you know what to do?

204
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,730
I know how to do archery.

205
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:11,420
Why can't you learn properly, why?

206
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,850
I can't teach this class anymore.

207
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,010
Fang Fang. Fang Fang.

208
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,290
Lin Xigeng, what are you doing out in the middle of the night?

209
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,320
Our door wasn't closed properly and Fang Fang ran out himself.

210
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,070
I'll see if he ran to Xu Fang's.

211
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,550
Sister, I'll go with you.

212
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:40,990
Don't go, stay at home! What if he comes back, himself?

213
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,960
- Call me if he comes home!
- Then, be safe!

214
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,030
- Who is it?
- It's me!

215
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,450
I can't find Fang Fang! Is he at your house?

216
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:03,560
No. Hey!

217
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,520
Fang Fang!

218
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,140
Fang Fang, Fang Fang!

219
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:22,050
Lin Xichi, Lin Xichi!

220
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,220
Don't worry! He's a pretty big dog, there's no way he'd get lost.

221
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,160
In addition, he knows this area pretty well. Take this umbrella first!

222
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,460
Then you go look over there, and I'll look over there.

223
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,520
Use the umbrella!

224
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,340
Fang Fang!

225
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,020
Fang Fang!

226
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:48,760
Fang Fang, Fang Fang!

227
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,930
Fang Fang!

228
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:54,140
Fang Fang, Fang Fang!

229
00:21:57,530 --> 00:22:01,500
Fang Fang, Fang Fang!

230
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,430
Fang Fang!

231
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:11,230
Fang Fang, Fa—

232
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,380
Dad—

233
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,450
Lin Xichi.

234
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:52,800
Lin Xichi!

235
00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:55,460
Lin Xichi!

236
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,570
Lin Xichi, hey! Xichi!

237
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,750
Are you stupid?

238
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:23,050
Watch out when you cross the road! What if they had hit you?

239
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:25,330
Xu Fang.

240
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,160
Tell me! In this world,

241
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,540
is there no love that never changes?

242
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,690
Are there no lovers who won't be separated?

243
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,380
I just saw...

244
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,340
my Dad in the car.

245
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,160
It's all my fault!

246
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,090
What's this got to do with you?

247
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:58,320
If I hadn't brought the stockings home, my mom wouldn't have left.

248
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,170
Not really!

249
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,710
They've already been living separately for such a long time.

250
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,770
Splitting up in the end is very normal.

251
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,820
It's not like that! My mom loves us a lot!

252
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:13,720
She really wants to come home, but she has work.

253
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,150
But every time she comes home, she's always happy.

254
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,120
She would treat me and my brother well, and she would take good care of my dad.

255
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,730
Except this time.

256
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,790
Is it really like that?

257
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,400
They've already separated for so many years.

258
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,860
Many things happened during those years, things that we can't even imagine.

259
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,660
You can't require them to be the same as before, can you?

260
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:42,890
Why can't I? I won't let them separate!

261
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:46,990
We can't solve the problems between adults.

262
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,210
My family's matters are none of your business!

263
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:54,220
- You don't have the right to talk about my family's matters!
- Lin Xichi!

264
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,190
Am I supposed to watch you blame yourself?!

265
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:58,860
It's none of your business!

266
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,850
Can you stop being so immature?

267
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:05,330
So you're not immature? You made me wear the stockings!

268
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:09,880
I never want to arm wrestle or see you again!

269
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:43,140
Lin Xichi, when I met you, I was eight.

270
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,030
When my dad's business started making money,

271
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,380
we moved to a new house.
[2005, Luo City]

272
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,110
We became best friends.

273
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,160
But your family seemed to always have

274
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,580
an inexplicable feeling of sadness.

275
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,520
Someone said, a child must experience many obstacles

276
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,140
in order to grow up.

277
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,440
But if they aren't able to get past a certain obstacle,

278
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,680
part of themselves will always be a child,

279
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:15,350
even though their body has already grown up.

280
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,210
Mom! Mom!

281
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,210
You found Fang Fang?

282
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:56,520
Why are you so soaked?

283
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,730
Fang Fang, what's wrong with you? Why were you running around out there?

284
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:02,370
Look how you got Sister all soaked! Are you going to do it again?

285
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,880
You—

286
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:10,610
Brother Fang, why are you soaked too?

287
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,320
Close the door!

288
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,580
What happened between you two?

289
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,390
- It's so late at night—
- Close the door!

290
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:27,260
Sorry, Brother Fang! My sister's making me close the door.

291
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,550
What happened? You guys got in a fight again?

292
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:40,110
We're not friends anymore!

293
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,840
You guys are fighting really seriously this time.

294
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,600
Why?

295
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,300
Did he bully you or did you bully him?

296
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,440
- You guys—
- If you keep talking, I'll tear off your mouth!

297
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:02,400
Why are you guys just standing here?

298
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,060
It's so late already, you guys aren't going to bed?

299
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,370
What are you doing out so late at night?

300
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,860
I was discussing something with my coworker.

301
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:13,780
What did you need to discuss that was so important it couldn't wait until tomorrow?

302
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:17,230
Next time, don't feed us instant noodles to muddle by!

303
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,470
Lin Xichi, you...

304
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,140
Are you trying to stir up trouble?

305
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,770
Chi-chi, it's so late already! Did something happen?

306
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,990
No. I-I...

307
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,870
just wanted to hear your voice.

308
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:52,420
Are you and Geng-geng okay?

309
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,050
The most important thing to me right now, is your College Entrance Exam.

310
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,540
That your dream will come true.

311
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:02,450
Didn't you always want to study veterinary medicine at Rong University?

312
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,430
You have to keep working hard, okay?

313
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,150
Mom.

314
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,030
When are you coming home?

315
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:13,260
Are you ever going to come back?

316
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:16,650
Are you ever going to come back to live with us?

317
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,550
Chi-chi.

318
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:21,420
Didn't we talk about this before?

319
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:26,520
You have to understand! I really can't leave my work right now.

320
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,310
I need to do a surgery in a bit.

321

You should go to bed, you still have class tomorrow.

322
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,160
We'll talk again when I have time, okay?

323
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,560
Mom...

324
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,100
Mom.

325
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,600
Sister, Dad told me to give you to some brown sugar water.

326
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,640
Why are you packing up?

327
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,770
I'm going to stay at Grandpa's house for a few days.

328
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,870
Why are you going there so suddenly?

329
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:51,880
Did that brat Xu Fang really bully you?

330
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,020
Not really! I've thought about it for a while now.

331
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,870
I'm about to take my College Entrance Exam.

332
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,120
I want to focus on my studies.

333
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,800
You can leave now, don't bother me when I'm packing.

334
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,560
Dad told me to give this to you.

335
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,700
You can have it, I don't want it.

336
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:16,210
Xu Fang, here's a graduation present.

337
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:21,130
That's the war of the century.

338
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:24,680
Xu Fang, why didn't Chi-chi come with you today?

339
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,750
I saw her brother come to excuse her for today at the office.

340
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:30,460
He said she wanted to go home to study.

341
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,060
Really?

342
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,710
Lin Xichi.

343
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,140
Lin Xichi!

00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,760
Lin Xi—

345
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,720
- Where's your sister?
- She's not here!

346
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,270
What do you mean she's not here?

347
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,260
She moved to Grandpa's house.

348
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:35,330
She will probably only be back after the exam.

349
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:37,020
She wants to get into veterinary medicine at Rong University.

350
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,200
She's focusing on studying.

351
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,570
I never want to arm wrestle you again! I don't want to see you ever again!

404
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,150
♫ Not so difficult! ♫

405
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:39,290
♫ Making a choice is not so difficult. ♫

406
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:45,870
♫ It’s all warm and scattered expectation. ♫

407
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:49,640
♫ Not so difficult! ♫

408

♫ Making a decision is not so difficult. ♫

409
00:39:54,220 --> 00:40:01,060
♫ Nothing more than day and night mediocre bravery. ♫

410
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:07,770
♫ People hesitate so they've missed many fulfillment, ♫

411
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:13,760
♫ always at a loss and in a hurry but feel terribly upset. ♫

412
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,250
♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

413
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:21,550
♫ A smile is really not that difficult. ♫

414
00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:27,330
♫ Unconsciously, we will eventually dry our tears. ♫

♫ How could the regret of the past represent today? ♫
