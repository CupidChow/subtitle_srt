00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,400
♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,770
♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

4
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:13,180
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:17,040
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,550
♫ or pretend to be indifferent. ♫

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,860
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,570
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

9
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,570
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:39,550
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:46,590
♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:53,050
♫ Love is like a migratory bird waiting for the season. ♫

13
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:58,850
♫ How long does it take for them to be aware of each other? ♫

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,360
♫ You are like summer night, ♫

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,980
♫ I'm like a little star in the sky, ♫

16
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:13,080
♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

17
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,510
♫ Deliberately, I hit your shoulder, ♫

18
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,270
♫ and then, listen to your reprimand. ♫

19
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,740
♫ The caring feeling is so sweet! ♫

[Episode 6]

22
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,250
What do you want?

23
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:46,049
Your dorm's not bad.

24
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,150
Of course!

25
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,550
- Quick, what's up?
- I want to ask about someone.

26
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:56,530
- Who is it?
- Your roommate that I met a few days ago, He Liyang.

27
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,269
Why do you ask?

28
00:01:58,269 --> 00:02:01,388
What's her background? You said she's a top student in science.

29
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:04,210
She was admitted here with the best grades.

30
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,809
It is an honor for me to share a room with her.

31
00:02:07,809 --> 00:02:11,108
Didn't you say she's a year older than you? Why are you sharing a room with her?

32
00:02:11,108 --> 00:02:13,310
Do you share dorms with seniors?

33
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,650
- Well, she's a... special case.
- I'm a repeat student!

34
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,389
When did you come back?

35
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,290
Way earlier!

36
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,868
I see! So you are a repeat student.

37
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:28,209
A top student is a repeat student.

38
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:30,688
Didn't you lecture me the other day?

39
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:34,769
She missed her exams because she played games, not because she has bad grades.

40
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:36,829
I'm hanging up.

41
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:42,410
A repeat student dares...

42
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,069
to lecture me?

43
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,370
Let me have a look at... a repeat student's notes.

44
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:01,692
[Jin De Building]

45
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,828
Had a good nap?

46
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,050
You're drooling all over the notebook.

47
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:32,030
I was up... studying all night.

48
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:36,089
Do you even believe what you just said?

49
00:03:36,089 --> 00:03:38,709
Let's see what you're studying.

50
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,350
My daughter's notes?

51
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,890
Your daughter?

52
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:48,728
Isn't her daughter that top student?

53
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:51,470
How did you get this?

54
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:56,349
I got the notes from... an online seller.

55
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:01,909
These unethical vendors! I'm sure someone stole her notes and sold it.

56
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:04,408
- Give it to me!
- I can't!

57
00:04:04,408 --> 00:04:07,728
I bought it with my money, so I have to protect my legal rights.

58
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:09,788
It's not your rights if this is a stolen item.

59
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:12,850
How can this be a stolen item? This...

60
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,769
Furthermore, she is not using it anymore.

61
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:17,548
And I'm your student, too.

62
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,708
My grades aren't great

63
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,909
but I have the right to improve my results, haven't I?

64
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:27,909
I hope that you sincerely want to improve.

65
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,289
- Can I buy that with ¥500?
- No way!

66
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:40,409
- How about ¥1,000?
- It's my treasure and it's not for sale.

67
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,470
There's good news.

68
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:51,650
We will have an archery match with our affiliated university next week.

69
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,507
We will represent Rong University.

70
00:04:53,507 --> 00:04:55,869
Which university are we competing with?

71
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,909
Huaqing University.

72
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,589
Huaqing?

73
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:01,508
They are way above our level.

74
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,089
Train hard if you know that your opponent is strong.

75
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:08,470
I want you to compete as if it's your last match next week.

76
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,190
Dismiss!

77
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,229
Tell me about Huaqing.

78
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:17,848
Huaqing is strong.

79
00:05:17,848 --> 00:05:20,568
They have the best archery team nationwide among all of the universities.

80
00:05:20,568 --> 00:05:25,649
They have someone in their team with national athlete potential called Ding Yi.

81
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:30,350
For example, if Ding Yi is up to this level,

82
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:33,190
ours will be at this level.

83
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,049
I want to see the team compete but not lose.

84
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:39,310
Why would we lose?

85
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,329
- That's nice of you.
- What?

86
00:05:49,329 --> 00:05:52,569
Give it to Lin Xichi. Go for it!

87
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,169
Are you serious?

88
00:05:54,169 --> 00:05:55,850
Of course, I am!

89
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,290
Let me tell you!

90
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,030
She is interested in me, too.

91
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,370
It's mutual.

92
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,709
- Are you sure?
- Of course!

93
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:08,649
Brother, I'm counting on you.

94
00:06:08,649 --> 00:06:11,068
Go for it! Go!

95
00:06:11,068 --> 00:06:12,869
Go for it.

96
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,330
I'm not going to be single anymore.

97
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:29,209
Thank you.

98
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:32,980
It's not bad but I don't like sweet chocolates.

99
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,929
- Chocolate.
- Chocolate?

100
00:06:34,929 --> 00:06:38,689
Brother Fu, Xu Fang gave you chocolate? Give me a piece!

101
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,490
I want one, too.

102
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,050
Get lost!

103
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,149
Keep it up!

104
00:06:57,149 --> 00:06:58,829
Alright.

105
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,010
How is it? Is the milk tea sweet?

106
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,550
It's sweet.

107
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:11,229
- She's blushing?
- Brother Fu!

108
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:14,789
- You're finally here.
- Here! This is your milk tea.

109
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:20,750
I asked Jiang Zhengxu to give it to Lin Xichi.

110
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,049
- Why is it here?
- No This is Captain Fang's treat.

111
00:07:24,049 --> 00:07:28,089
Oh right! He also told us that this is specially made for you.

112
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,149
How nice of you, Jiang Zhengxu!

113
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:34,469
What did you just call Xu Fang?

114
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,450
Xu Fang! This is his treat.

115
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:42,408
Brother Fu, I think Xu Fang is nice.

116
00:07:42,408 --> 00:07:44,330
He bought milk teas for the team

117
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:47,980
and said he would share his food and drinks with everyone.

118
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,670
Yes.

119
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:52,750
I hope you choke!

120
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,969
He bribed you two with only a cup of milk tea, traitors!

121
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:00,910
What's wrong with him?

122
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:05,609
Why is he so angry?

123
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:11,909
Hello, Lin Xichi.

124
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,650
Are you going to a class?

125
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:15,989
I can take you there, I have a bike.

126
00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:18,869
- Sure! Let's go.
- Let's go!

127
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,449
- It's here!
- This is perfect, I'm late.

128
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:27,270
It's right here!

129
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,489
It's deflated? It was fine before.

130
00:08:32,489 --> 00:08:36,470
I'm going to be late, so I'll run there.

131
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,329
Lin Xichi.

132
00:08:42,829 --> 00:08:44,970
Xu Fang?

133
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:49,189
Xu Fang! I'll kill you!

134
00:08:49,189 --> 00:08:51,069
Xu Fang!

135
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,449
Are you crazy?

136
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,107
Why did you deflate my bike?

137
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:58,047
I can do what I want, I don't need a reason.

138
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,349
- Xu Fang.
- Fu Kuankuan, what's wrong?

139
00:09:00,349 --> 00:09:02,629
- What are you doing?
- Why do you sabotage me every time?

140
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:04,190
I won't let you go!

141
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,789
I'm telling you! I won't forgive you if you keep bothering Lin Xichi.

142
00:09:06,789 --> 00:09:09,389
- I won't forgive you either!
- I'll definitely beat you up!

143
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:12,469
- Hit me! Come and hit me!
- Brother Fu, calm down!

144
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,568
- Let me go!
- Calm down!

145
00:09:13,568 --> 00:09:15,448
Let go of me! Hit me!

146
00:09:15,448 --> 00:09:18,629
Listen to me! You don't have to fight with the captain. That's enough!

147
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:22,528
- His skill is good and the coach likes him. Why are you—
- Get lost!

148
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:27,329
What are you doing?

149
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:29,290
Get lost!

150
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,649
Xu Fang!

151
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,109
- Brother Fu.
- Brother Fu!

152
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:38,010
Fu Kuankuan! What are you doing?

153
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:47,689
Coach, please don't confiscate my bow.

154
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:51,129
I beg you! Don't confiscate my bow.

155
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:53,829
Coach, I know I was wrong.

156
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,249
Do you know the taboo in an archery range?

157
00:09:58,249 --> 00:10:00,050
I do know.

158
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,909
Never aim at a person.

159
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,948
Not even if it's a blank.

160
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:07,068
An arrow is a weapon that kills.

161
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:08,909
You tried to dry fire at Xu Fang.

162
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:12,049
If I hadn't stopped you, you could've shot anyone with that bow.

163
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:15,388
I wouldn't have! I just got too emotional.

164
00:10:15,388 --> 00:10:17,788
- I was angry.
- That's enough!

165
00:10:17,788 --> 00:10:20,608
The bow is the university's property, so I'm taking it back.

166
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:23,508
- Write me a resignation letter.
- Coach!

167
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:26,349
Coach, don't expel me.

168
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,789
I still want to compete.

169
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:31,388
I still want to be the national champion.

170
00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:34,709
You should know what would happen when you decided to draw the bow!

171
00:10:34,709 --> 00:10:36,409
Xu Fang, Xu Fang—

172
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,830
[Unite and help each other] [Always achieve the best result]

173
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,950
Why are you here?

174
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,168
Why do you think Xu Fang went to see the coach?

175
00:10:47,168 --> 00:10:48,768
The coach is so angry.

176
00:10:48,768 --> 00:10:50,329
Isn't he going into a lion's den?

177
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:51,930
What do you mean?

178
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,400
Xu Fang did all this to Fu Kuankuan

179
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,380
because he doesn't want others to take his fruit of labor.

180
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:01,129
- Is the fruit Brother Fu?
- It's Lin Xichi.

181
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,830
What does this have to do with Lin Xichi?

182
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,310
Yeah.

183
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,369
Did I say Lin Xichi?

184
00:11:08,369 --> 00:11:10,768
- You did.
- You said it.

185
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:15,409
Coach, I'm responsible for his actions.

186
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:18,410
I'll take the punishment with him.

187
00:11:20,069 --> 00:11:22,589
Do you know what mistake he has comitted?

188
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:25,350
Can you bear the responsibility?

189
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,049
I don't need you to.

190
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:36,390
I still need to apply for your expulsion.

191
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:40,230
But I will make the both of you exhausted!

192
00:11:53,849 --> 00:11:56,880
Tell me! Why did you take the punishment...

193
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,200
with me... on such a hot day?

194
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:02,070
Tell me! Are you crazy?

195
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,349
You're the one who's crazy.

196
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,949
How can you dry fire a bow?

197
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:09,008
You'd be expelled... if we weren't out here running.

198
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:10,889
You have to thank me.

199
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:12,969
I didn't ask for it.

200
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:20,569
Let's continue!

201
00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:23,550
I get angry... when I see your face.

202
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,009
I'm sorry that you... have to see me till graduation.

203
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,169
Yes, captain.

204
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:34,929
What did you call me?

205
00:12:34,929 --> 00:12:38,069
Yes, captain!

206
00:12:42,289 --> 00:12:44,040
Since you acknowledged me,

207
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,100
will you obey... your captain?

208
00:12:47,109 --> 00:12:50,009
You saved my career as an archery athlete.

209
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:53,209
Tell me! How can I not obey your words?

210
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:55,109
I only have one request.

211
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:58,209
- Say it!
- Stay away from Lin Xichi!

212
00:12:59,409 --> 00:13:03,450
You've tortured me because of Lin Xichi?

213
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,330
- Let's go.
- Coming!

214
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:34,828
Captain Fang!

215
00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:36,949
- Captain Fang.
- Captain Fang.

216
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:29,349
Now, since everyone is happy today, I suggest that we have a feast.

217
00:14:29,349 --> 00:14:32,490
- My treat!
- It's good being a rich kid.

218
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,109
It's my dad's money, it has nothing to do with me.

219
00:14:35,109 --> 00:14:37,629
I'm paying today, don't fight with me about paying.

220
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:39,968
- I'll get angry if you do.
- We won't.

221
00:14:39,968 --> 00:14:44,808
I know of a hotpot restaurant; their meat is fresh, tender, and very delicious.

222
00:14:44,808 --> 00:14:47,289
Watch where you're going!

223
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:54,030
I was wondering which group of idiots is making so much noise.

224
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:58,230
I heard that you have a match with Huaqing.

225
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,349
Huaqing is a powerhouse in sports.

226
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:02,249
We never had the chance to play with Huaqing...

227
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:05,316
even though our team was established for so long.

228
00:15:05,316 --> 00:15:08,417
Try not to get thrashed.

229
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:11,129
I also heard that the archery team will disband

230
00:15:11,129 --> 00:15:14,589
if you guys don't show any results in a year.

231
00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:18,489
- What?
- Don't you know that you team is going to disband?

232
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:20,528
If Huaqing wins the match,

233
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:23,150
it will definitely speed up your disbandment.

234
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,110
I want to see it so bad.

235
00:15:32,989 --> 00:15:35,669
I hope you can keep up the good work.

236
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:38,889
Move!

237
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:48,769
Xu Fang, is what he just said true?

238
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:51,269
Yeah, is it true?

239
00:15:53,629 --> 00:15:58,169
Tan Ya Xue Hotpot wishes you a prosperous meal.

240
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:19,869
Yao Wang, the intestines are done. Here!

241
00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:25,130
Eat the meat! It's going to get overcooked.

242
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,369
Shouldn't... everyone be happy today?

243
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:34,769
We are here to celebrate Fu Kuankuan remaining in the team.

244
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:37,188
Still celebrating? Remaining here?

245
00:16:37,188 --> 00:16:39,469
It's going to disband in a year.

246
00:16:39,469 --> 00:16:43,048
Don't jinx it! Eat!

247
00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:46,349
We are going to disband with no results.

248
00:16:46,349 --> 00:16:49,269
But how can we beat Huaqing?

249
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:51,569
Why is everyone so worried?

250
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:53,449
It's just Huaqing.

251
00:16:53,449 --> 00:16:56,370
Exactly! It's just Huaqing.

252
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:00,789
Are we going for a second round?

253
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:03,189
How about karaoke?

254
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:07,530
Forget it! No one's in the mood.

255
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,069
Let's go back!

256
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:15,208
- I'm leaving.
- Me, too!

257
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,760
We haven't finished eating.

258
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,969
The legend of Ding Yi of Huaqing.

259
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:30,389
Mr. One.

260
00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:32,408
When he was only 12 years old,

261
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:34,970
Ding Yi joined the World Junior Archery Olympics.

262
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,730
He became the men's individual champion.

263
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,409
At that time, he said that, his name is One, so no second place for him.

264
00:17:42,409 --> 00:17:44,030
No second place?

265
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:46,469
What a joke!

266
00:17:46,469 --> 00:17:49,809
He held the record for consecutive victories in youth archery competitions.

267
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:51,769
It's still unbeaten.

268
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,830
The second legend of Ding Yi.

269
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:57,490
Ding Yi was shortlisted for the national team

270
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,490
but he said he was going to study.

271
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:02,268
He joined the prestigious Huaqing after passing

272
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:04,210
the admission exam with flying colors.

273
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,550
He is well developed in sports and academics.

274
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,229
I even failed in math.

275
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,910
The third legend of Ding Yi.

276
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:17,610
He did a telescope on a bullseye.

277
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,850
What's a telescope?

278
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,729
It means the second arrow

279
00:18:22,729 --> 00:18:25,710
hits the first arrow on the target

280
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:28,150
and splits the first arrow in half.

281
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,650
What level of skill is he on?

282
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,830
Meanwhile our level is consistent in getting arrows unscathed,

283
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:37,408
but not on the bullseye.

284
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,488
It's not doable; it's our loss.

285
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,989
Can you stop your nonsense?

286
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:50,308
Yao Wang, can you stop eating?

287
00:18:50,308 --> 00:18:53,129
You just lost weight, the coach will drag you to training again.

288
00:18:53,129 --> 00:18:55,329
I'm stressed! I eat when I'm stressed.

289
00:18:55,329 --> 00:18:58,930
Stop eating! Give it to me.

290
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,730
I'm stressed.

291
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:06,630
Me, too!

292
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:10,829
Chi-chi, did you find anything? Tell me if you find something.

293
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:14,069
Ding Yi is just a little rusty nail.

294
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:14,888
[Legend of Ding Yi]

295
00:19:14,888 --> 00:19:19,589
The team will be demoralized if they see all these.

296
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:24,260
No way! I need to come up with something.

297
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,930
They can't be affected by all these fancy stories.

298
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,750
What did you say?

299
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,849
There's a nail legend in Huaqing.

300
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:35,189
We need Rong University legends.

301
00:19:35,189 --> 00:19:38,429
Chi-chi, I forgot to bring toilet paper, can you give it to me?

302
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:41,549
Why did you do that again?

303
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:30,910
Let me tell you the legends of Rong University archery team.

304
00:20:31,549 --> 00:20:34,709
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

305
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:36,569
Who is that?

306
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,710
Lin Xichi?

307
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,409
The archery team's first legend.

308
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:49,909
Yu Tong! Although he looks gentle and harmless,

309
00:20:49,909 --> 00:20:55,567
but he is actually the vicious elite on archery ranges.

310
00:20:55,567 --> 00:21:00,128
He challenged and defeated an archery range's owner.

311
00:21:00,128 --> 00:21:02,409
He was awarded free games there.

312
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:04,729
- What an achievement!
- You're great!

313
00:21:04,729 --> 00:21:08,989
Of course! He needs to be good to follow me to Rong University.

314
00:21:08,989 --> 00:21:12,129
Yu Tong, can we get free games, too? When we go out in the future?

315
00:21:12,129 --> 00:21:15,070
- You don't have enough training?
- Point taken!

316
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:18,288
The archery team's second legend.

317
00:21:18,288 --> 00:21:21,170
Fu Kuankuan.

318
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,869
Rong City's ace archer.

319
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:29,529
He is the champion of every single archery competition of Rong City.

320
00:21:29,529 --> 00:21:33,988
- A champion.
- He would've been promoted to the district team

321
00:21:33,988 --> 00:21:36,109
if it wasn't for his studies.

322
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:40,390
You could not see him here anymore if he did.

Low profile!

324
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,429
Let's keep a low profile.

The archery team's third legend.

326
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,768
Yao Wang!

327
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:57,089
As his name suggests, he is the hope of his village.

328
00:21:57,089 --> 00:22:00,470
It's his childhood dream to own a bow.

329
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:04,509
So, his dad sold the pig in his house to buy him a bow.

330
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:09,950
He made his way up from his village to the city,

331
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:12,768
and finally became part of the archery team of Rong University,

332
00:22:12,768 --> 00:22:15,689
and also his village's first university student.

333
00:22:15,689 --> 00:22:18,530
You are awesome, Yao Wang!

334
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:22,809
Let me tell you! I'll compete with Huaqing even with an old bow.

335
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:25,669
You're ambitious.

336
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:27,850
My turn!

337
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:31,970
The archery team's fourth legend.

338
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:34,870
Xu Fang, team captain.

339
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:38,709
He looks serious

340
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:42,609
and pretends to be strong, usually.

341
00:22:42,609 --> 00:22:46,450
But he always got bullied

342
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,589
by a little puppy.

343
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:51,930
He became the captain that he is today

344
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,008
because of my protection.

345
00:22:54,008 --> 00:22:56,250
Lin Xichi, you want a beating?

346
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,288
You don't have to talk about me anymore! It must be something bad.

347
00:22:59,288 --> 00:23:04,310
Which girl is causing a ruckus at the male dorms at midnight?

348
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,350
The girl over there. Don't run!

349
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,510
- Senior Ye.
- Lin Xichi?

350
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,300
Stand there!

351
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,129
Here! Hide inside.

352
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:16,129
Be careful!

353
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:18,129
Where did she go?

354
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,429
I'll definitely catch you!

355
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:32,590
Why are you here... causing a ruckus?

356
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,989
You're looking for Xu Fang?

357
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:45,430
I'll distract her.

358
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,309
I'll catch you and make sure you get demerits.

359
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,210
Ma'am.

360
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:09,188
Xiao Ye, perfect timing!

361
00:24:09,188 --> 00:24:13,329
Did you see a girl here just now?

362
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:15,530
I didn't! What's wrong?

363
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,970
What's wrong?

364
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,549
A girl came to the male dorms at night.

365
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:23,090
It's unacceptable!

366
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:27,090
When I catch her, I'll definitely give her demerits.

367
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,369
Maybe she ran upstairs?

368
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,709
Upstairs! Thank you.

369
00:24:42,889 --> 00:24:44,950
You can come out, now.

370
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,790

Hi!

374
00:25:23,089 --> 00:25:24,930
Senior Ye.

375

Thanks for yesterday.

376
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:29,629
You saved my life.

377

But the dorm Auntie was so scary.

378
00:25:32,709 --> 00:25:36,530
I'm curious to know who you're risking your life for though.

379
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:41,109
You know that our team has a match coming up, right?

380
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:44,749
I know! I read the news on the university website.

381
00:25:44,749 --> 00:25:50,310
Their opponent is Huaqing.

382
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:53,230
I heard that they are very strong.

383
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:00,289
Do you also think that our team will lose?

384
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:07,110
But I don't think so!

385
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,528
I see how everyone is training hard every day.

386
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:13,368
So I know that if another team can do it,

387
00:26:13,368 --> 00:26:15,690
they can do it as well.

388
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:20,930
That is why I went to cheer them up yesterday.

389
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:25,648
How can they compete with a low morale before the match even starts?

390
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:32,420
Let's do something if you want to help them.

The two of us?

392
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:40,430
I can't really help them with training.

393
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,749
But we can let more people know about the archery team.

394
00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:45,969
We can get them to cheer for the team.

395
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:50,649
We'll get everyone to see the match?

She left?

486
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:02,657
How can she take money from me? That's too much!

487
00:32:02,657 --> 00:32:04,630
She even charged 100 yuan.

488
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,930
I'm taking 70% of the cut. Let's go!

489
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,488
I think it's worth it.

490
00:32:08,488 --> 00:32:10,589
Think about it.

491
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:24,449
Xu Fang, what's wrong?

492
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:28,789
- Have you practiced your stance as I asked?
- I have.

493
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:31,868
- With this result?
- I have!

494
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:34,090
What's with your attitude?

495
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,348
You don't have much time till the match.

496
00:32:36,349 --> 00:32:40,189
Can I let you embarrass yourself with this result?

497
00:32:40,189 --> 00:32:42,990
Let me see your stance, draw the bow!

498
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,470
Where's your arrow?

499
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:08,570
You missed?

500
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,350
Why is your arrow here?

501
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,489
Xu Fang! Come here!

502
00:33:31,489 --> 00:33:33,549
- Did you do it on purpose?
- Coach!

503
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:35,649
- Calm down!
- You saw it!

504
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:38,109
I missed with the proper stance so I'm not suitable.

505
00:33:38,109 --> 00:33:41,388
- You did it on purpose!
- Coach! Calm down, calm down!

506
00:33:41,388 --> 00:33:45,089
Can I calm down? How can I calm down?

507
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:47,988
- Do you want to be dropped?
- I don't want to do the stance.

508
00:33:47,988 --> 00:33:49,910
You need to change your stance.

509
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,469
I missed with the proper stance.

510
00:33:51,469 --> 00:33:54,009
It's better if I used the one before.

511
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:56,968
- I'll ask you! Will you change it?
- No.

512
00:33:56,968 --> 00:33:59,430
- I'll ask you again! Will you change it?
- No!

513
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,569
Quickly apologize to the coach!

514
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,630
You won't change it?

515
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,130
Then you are dropped!

516
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:23,250
Alright, you thief!

517
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:25,549
I caught you red-hand now!

518
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:27,649
- That's not true!
- Why did you remove his poster?

519
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,040
I-I... Someone from management

520
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,270
asked me to remove his poster.

521
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:37,628
- What management?
- Someone from the sports department.

522
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,949
Chi-chi, what happened to Xu Fang?

523
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,990
He's really dropped from the match?

524
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:48,450
- I'm not sure.
- His name was removed from the team list for the match.

525
00:34:57,069 --> 00:35:01,269
Xu Fang, your name was removed from the team list.

526
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:03,370
What happened?

527
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,910
You really don't want to join the match?

528
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,169
Is this your decision?

529
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,728
Didn't you promise to never give up?

530
00:35:14,728 --> 00:35:17,109
You want to become a puppy?

531
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,390
You...

532
00:35:20,789 --> 00:35:22,489
I...

533
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:25,050
I'm talking to you!

534
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:09,830
Are you alright?

535
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:14,449
I was thinking about the time I started archery for the past few days.

536
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,688
Here! Over the line.

537
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:31,150
Parallel to it.

538
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:33,889
Feet at shoulder width.

539
00:36:33,889 --> 00:36:35,870
Stand straight.

540
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:37,809
Relax your shoulders.

541
00:36:37,809 --> 00:36:39,770
Aim at the yellow ring.

542
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,310
Release!

543
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,229
Not bad! Keep training.

544
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,490
♫ Even though I have yet said a word ♫

545
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:11,750
♫ you should be able to guess ♫

546
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:17,460
♫ The days pass, one by one. ♫

547
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:24,428
You never told me your stories of learning archery when you were young.

548
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:27,230
That coach taught me

549
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:30,290
what it feels like to focus on something.

550
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:35,010
Like archery, you only need to live in your own world.

551
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:38,729
Believe in yourself and free your mind of other thoughts.

552
00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:40,929
Speak only with the arrow!

553
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,230
You sound so mature.

554
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,710
But that feeling...

555
00:37:54,321 --> 00:37:56,510
is not there anymore.

556
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,988
Do you still remember "Toy Story" that we watched when we were young?

557
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:11,648
Buzz Lightyear thought he was an intergalactic leader from another planet.

558
00:38:11,648 --> 00:38:14,209
He wanted to save the Earth.

559
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:19,429
But he found out that he was only a toy.

560
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,569
I also thought that I could become a hero

561
00:38:24,569 --> 00:38:27,129
if I picked up the bow when I was young.

562
00:38:29,029 --> 00:38:31,000
But then I found out that

563
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,550
I was just a faulty toy in the end.

564
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,850
I don't know

565
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:42,489
if I'm working hard in the wrong direction.

566
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:07,529
Jiang Zhengxu, tell me immediately what happened to Xu Fang and the coach.

567
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,730

♫ Making a choice is not so difficult. ♫

♫ Nothing more than day and night mediocre bravery. ♫

574

♫ People hesitate so they've missed many fulfillment, ♫

♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫
