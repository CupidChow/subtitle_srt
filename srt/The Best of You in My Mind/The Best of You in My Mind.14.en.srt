00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,360
♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,800
♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,240
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:16,930
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,500
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,850
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:27,540
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

9
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,480
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,520
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:46,470
♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:53,030
♫ Love is like a migratory bird waiting for the season. ♫

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,890
♫ How long does it take for them to be aware of each other? ♫

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,410
♫ You are like summer night, ♫

15
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:06,040
♫ I'm like a little star in the sky, ♫

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:13,090
♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

17
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,610
♫ Deliberately, I hit your shoulder, ♫

18
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,200
♫ and listen to your reprimand. ♫

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,690
♫ The caring feeling is so sweet! ♫

[Episode 14]

22
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:38,460
It's not like that.

23
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,860
I know you've been blaming me for leaving you.

24
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,600
But, I have my own dream.

25
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:53,000
You know that one faces many choices in life.

26
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,680
This...

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,360
Sometimes we might have to sacrifice something for our dreams.

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,340
But why did you have to sacrifice me and Geng-geng?

29
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,540
Chi-chi, it's not what you think.

30
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:11,790
It's hard for me, too.

31
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:15,090
It was not easy for me to leave both of you.

32
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:18,780
But... Don't cry!

33
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:27,160
So now you have a new husband and daughter.

34
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,540
Did you decide to leave us after you had them?

35
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,039
No, no, no. It's not what you think; it's really not.

36
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,579
Listen to what I have to say.

37
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:42,659
No matter what happened between your dad and me,

38
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,630
you are always my daughter.

39
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,190
That will never change.

40
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,300
I've always loved you guys.

41
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,660
Mom, Pizza Hut is not offering fruit salad buffet anymore.

42
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm not the little girl who is happy after eating here anymore.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,020
You were not here when I missed you.

44
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,110
You were not here when I needed you.

45
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:12,160
I've grown up now, I also can live independently.

46
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,060
I won't miss you that much anymore, either.

47
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,500
Hence,

48
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,700
I can't forgive you.

49
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,400
You're back? That was quick!

50
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,220
I left

51
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,880
after eating and saying what I wanted to say.

52
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,980
Then... did you cry?

53
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,160
Of course, not.

54
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,360
Xu Fang.

55
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,860
Do you like white...

56
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,500
or do you like pink?

57
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,920
- White.
- Then I'll smash the white one.

58
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,520
What?

59
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,180
Hey.

60
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,360
Hey.

61
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,160
That's strange!

62
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,520
- Hello?
- What are you doing?

63
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,039
I'm listening to you and I'm following my heart.

64
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,140
Blame whom I want to blame.

65
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,000
It's broken.

66
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,460
I'm going to come find you. See you later!

67
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,720
- Let's go. Hurry!
- Why are you running?

68
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,980
I did a bad thing, so I need to escape.

69
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,560
Did you know that I finally smashed her mug after 4 tries?

70
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,780
Are you hungry?

71
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,540
A bit.

72
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,880
Let's go.

73
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,880
Are you full?

74
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,360
- What time is it?
- Around 8 p.m.

75
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,560
8 p.m.?

76
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,619
It's too early! Xin Zidan shouldn't be back yet.

77
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,940
What do you think of this one?

78
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,580
So tacky!

79
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,159
- Wrap them up for me, please!
-

80
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,560
All right.

81
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,800
- Here you go!
- Thank you.
- Please, come again.

82
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,720
Let's go.

83
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,960
What are you doing?

84
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,300
I need a mug, too.

85
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,940
Didn't you say it was tacky?

86
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,400
What's wrong?

87
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:58,680
Someone smashed my mug.

88
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,570
My mug was smashed two days before the holidays, too.

89
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,940
You should know who did it.

90
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,940
Maybe we forgot to close the door and someone came in.

91
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,359
A few stray cats behind the cafeteria always run around every time.

92
00:08:16,359 --> 00:08:19,160
Maybe they came in and knocked the mug off the table.

93
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,080
Let me clean them up, so no one gets hurt.

94
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,080
I'll do it myself.

95
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,180
I'm the one who smashed your mug

96
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,520
but you need to clean it up yourself.

97
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,280
What do you mean by that? You think I smashed your mug?

98
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,700
She won't think that without a reason.

99
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,060
Can't she speak for herself?

100
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,820
Lin Xichi, if you need to tell me something can't you just speak directly?

101
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,519
You smashed my mug, right?

102
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,300
Chi-chi.

103
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:04,880
Of course, it wasn't me! Why would I do that?

104
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,180
Didn't you just ask me to speak directly?

105
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,100
Stop crying!

106
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,919
Don't pick up with your hands! There's a broom there!

107
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,380
I'll do it.

108
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,820
Okay.

109
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,719
All right, clean up everything! Wash up and go to sleep.

110
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:33,140
I'm going to sleep.

111
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,100
Qi Qi! Xiang Xiang!

112
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,619
Both of them started to run when they heard someone coming.

113
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,140
They are tame in the cage but become wild once they are out of the cage.

114
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,600
They must miss home.

115
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,600
Any updates from their owners?

116
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,560
It's all right, I'll play with you.

117
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,720
Hello, who is this?

118
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,260
Hello! This is the person who is taking care of Qi Qi and Xiang Xiang.

119
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,880
Did something happen to them?

120
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,180
Nothing's wrong, don't worry!

121
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,320
It just that since you did not come to pick them up, I wonder

122
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,440
if something happened.

123
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:19,299
I'm sorry, I still need some time, please take care of them.

124
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:21,059
This book is very important to me.

125
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,739
I need to finish it in a quiet environment.

126
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,640
I'll settle the fee once I go back.

127
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,400
I'll add your WeChat to send you a red packet.

128
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,559
It's all right! I'm not calling for the fee.

129
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:36,320
I just feel that they are lonely

130
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,660
and they need your company.

131
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,000
Take your time! It's all right.

132
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,540
When you finish, remember to come and pick them up.

133
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,959
I understand! I also want to do that.

134
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,940
They are like my children; please take care of them.

135
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,740
Don't worry! I'll take good care of them.

136
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,500
Thank you.

137
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,760
Isn't it right for parents to stay with their children?

138
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,079
My dears, we are going to catch a flight soon. Excited?

139
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,580
I know you miss me.

140
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,920
You finally came back.

141
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,120
Yes. I'm bringing both of them back this time.

142
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,379
These are their vaccine records.

143
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,540
You'll need it for your flight.

144
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,020
Thank you.

145
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,620
Actually, I've always been feeling guilty when I was apart from them.

146
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,140
All right, all right, you both don't be too excited.

147
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,480
I know you miss me.

148
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,880
I always dreamt about them at night.

149
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,860
You are right! Perhaps, I'm the one who couldn't leave them.

150
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,240
Thank you.

151
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,339
Okay, let's go! We're coming home.

152
00:13:12,339 --> 00:13:13,619
You're going home.

153
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,260
Let's go!

154
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,140
They look so happy.

155
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,820
Have a taste!

156
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,660
You're so great!

157
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,659
Don't praise me! I've had enough of praises.

158
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,740
Not bad, right?

159
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,500
Does the coach know you work here?

160
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,100
Don't let him know about it!

161
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,740
Fine! Each of you has got your own secrets.

162
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,340
What's wrong?

163
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,140
Chi-chi and Zidan had a fight.

164
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,840
Because of Xu Fang?

165
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,100
I knew it!

166
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,480
Well, if you have time to care about them,

167
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,640
why don't you care

168
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,980
about both of us?

169
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:36,580
Both of whom?

170
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,780
Come here!

171
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,939
I'll get angry if you don't! I'll ignore you.

172
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,560
I have work to do here.

173
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:07,100
Tell me, how many days has it been now?

174
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,800
Why are you here?

175
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,440
I wanted to come back but I don't know what I can do.

176
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,480
Just stay here!

177
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,460
It's been a while since I came back, can't you give me a break?

178
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,640
Captain Fang?

179
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,040
Lin Xichi, you're back?

180
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,559
We are leaving. Goodbye!

181
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,440
I don't get it! You're so mean, how do you still have friends?

182
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,780
The same as you! I got them in exchange for food.

183
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,740
I befriended you because I'm exceptional.

184
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,760
I sacrificed myself, so you don't harm someone else.

185
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,540
How did I harm someone else?

186
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,060
You... Why are you so close to me?

187
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,420
Lin Xichi, why are you feeling nervous?

188
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:40,160
He is just Xu Fang.

189
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,280
I forgot my key.

190
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,060
This place should be high enough.

191
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,700
Hello, Nie Yue.

192
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,040
Can you come to the roof?

193
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,380
I have something to tell you.

194
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,940
Okay.

195
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,760
Chi-chi.

196
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,940
- You scared me.
- Have you eaten?

197
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,880
I...

198
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,520
have.

199
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,760
I'm sorry.

200
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,860
It's my fault that I smashed your mug.

201
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,100
I'll pay you back.

202
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,940
Why did you do it?

203
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,640
I thought you knew.

204
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,920
I like Xu Fang.

205
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,500
I want you to help me with it.

206
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,620
I can't help you.

207
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,440
Why?

208
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,100
Didn't you say that Xu Fang is just a friend?

209
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,600
But I feel like you're using him as a backup.

210
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,840
What do you mean that I used him?

211
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,100
Don't you like him?

212
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,659
I asked why you smashed my mug, why do you care whom I like?

213
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,320
Amazing, right?

214
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,479
- What an inconsiderate person.
- Who did that?

215
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:20,000
Didn't you see someone below?

216
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,300
Isn't that Jiang Zhengxu?

217
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,080
- Why is he sitting there?
- Jiang Zhengxu!

218
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,899
Don't stand down there! Nothing to see here.

219
00:19:33,899 --> 00:19:35,459
Come down! What are you doing?

220
00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:36,819
Call the coach!

221
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:38,700
I can't hear you!

222
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,940
Hurry, talk to the coach!

223
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,459
- Jiang Zhengxu, come down! What are you doing up there?
- Coach, this is bad.

224
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,520
Go away!

225
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,819
Go away! It's none of your business, all of you!

226
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,520
Jiang Zhengxu, come down!

227
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,360
What's he doing?

228
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,179
I won't forgive you if you don't come down. Stop waving and come down now!

229
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:07,880
Nie Yue.

230
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,160
Go away!

231
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:15,979
- I said, go away!
- What is he saying?

232
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:18,860
Why is it so hard to confess?

233
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,980
Jiang Zhengxu!

234
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,380
I can't shout anymore.

235
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,020
Go away!

236
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,079
- Nie Yue is there.
- That's Nie Yue!

237
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,099
- What are you doing?
- You're here?

238
00:20:32,099 --> 00:20:34,840
Do you want to die?

239
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,999
- I don't.
- Why are you sitting there then?

240
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:40,799
- I was waiting for you.
- Why did you sit there while you were waiting, then?

241
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,300
What's bothering you?

242
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,119
So, you do care about me! I have something that's bothering me, indeed.

243
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:49,960
What is it?

244
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,380
Hasn't it been 100 days already?

245
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,940
I came to this tower to pick up my Princess Rapunzel.

246
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,560
Nie Yue.

247
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,420
Will you be my Rapunzel?

248
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,520
Will you be my girlfriend?

249
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,279
You scared me! I thought you were going to commit suicide.

250
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,260
Just because of this...

251
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,860
Should I jump down to show my resolve?

252
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,579
- It's so dangerous.
- Back off from there!

253
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:29,960
Where did you learn this attitude from?

254
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,580
Aren't you supposed to sacrifice a lot for someone you like?

255
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,899
I want to rip your mouth off.

What are you even thinking?

296
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,739
Did you fall in love with Xu Fang?

Chi-chi, Chi-chi!

299
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,979
Why are you up so early? Or did you not sleep at all?

300
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,700
I did sleep.

301
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,560
Tell me.

302
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:01,700
If you dreamed about someone confessing to you,

303
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,499
what does that mean?

304
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,899
- Confess?
- Don't laugh! I'm serious.

305
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:11,840
I can only say that your dream reflects your desire.

306
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,360
That's impossible.

307
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,680
What's wrong?

308
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,400
It's someone you can't accept?

309
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,460
Think about this.

310
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:28,459
If that person kissed someone else, would you be upset?

311
00:25:28,459 --> 00:25:30,580
Close your eyes and think about it.

312
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,600
No way, no way!

313
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,099
There's no way that's happening.

314
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:55,300
Who did you dream of?

315
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,180
Xu Fang.

316
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,320
You finally understand your heart.

317
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,500
But, does he like me though?

318
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,459
- Senior Ye.
- Hello, Chi-chi.

319
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:32,279
A dog just ran away.

320
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:35,539
Where are you? I'll come over immediately.

321
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,379
- What's wrong? Going to find Xu Fang?
- Going to find a dog.

322
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:41,859
- Slow down!
- I'm going.

323
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:43,580
Take your time!

324
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:46,479
Why is it so noisy? I'm still sleeping.

325
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:50,040
I... I-I had a nightmare.

326
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,920
Can you be quiet?

327
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:00,860
- Can you find me?
- I see you.

328
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,859
- How did you lose him?
- I took a walk with Harry.

329
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:10,359
I tied the leash on a bench, after I bent to tie my shoes and looked up, he was gone.

330
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:13,559
You go that way, I'll go this way; call me if you find him!

331
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:15,140
Alright.

332
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,779
Harry, Harry.

333
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:23,539
Excuse me! Did you see a big dog, about this height.

334
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:25,699
- I didn't.
- Thank you.

335
00:27:25,699 --> 00:27:27,420
Harry.

336
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:32,879
Excuse me! Did you see a big dog with white fur?

337
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:35,399
- We didn't.
- No.
- Thank you.

338
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:37,280
Harry!

339
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,660
Harry!

340
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,480
Harry!

341
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,980
Harry!

342
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,139
- You found him?
- I found him.

343
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,899
That's great! I'll wait for you at the place I met you just now.

344
00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:58,420
All right.

345
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:34,720
Fang Fang! Fang Fang!

346
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,200
Lin Xichi! Calm down.

347
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,479
Such a large dog won't get lost easily; take the umbrella first.

348
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:44,479
You look for him there; I'll go this way.

349
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:46,900
Take the umbrella!

350
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,759
Are you stupid?

351
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:52,059
You crossed the road without looking, what if the car hit you?

352
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,740
Xu Fang.

353
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,080
Tell me!

354
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:04,120
Is there no relationship that will never change in this world?

355
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,640
Everyone will be separated at some point.

356
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,660
Chi-chi, what's wrong?

357
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:33,220
No... Nothing!

358
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,580
You haven't been yourself since you came back after the holidays.

359
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,000
You... Are you alright?

360
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:52,160
Actually, I have something to tell you.

361
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,679
We are so close, you can just tell me at any time. Right?

362
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,860
I like you.

363
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,300
I like that you're blunt.

364
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,280
I like your courage, mischief,

365
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,379
and your weakness.

366
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:14,900
I liked it even more when you wore a white dress for me.

367
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,180
I looked ugly in that white dress.

368
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,460
No, I thought you looked beautiful.

369
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,600
Senior, I'm sorry.

370
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,620
I think that you are excellent

371
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,320
and you have always been a role model to me.

372
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:38,460
My life in Rong City is different because of you.

373
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,660
But

374
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,310
I realized recently that

375
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,700
there's someone very important to me.

376
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,380
I... I already have someone I like.

377
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,980
Is it Xu Fang?

378
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,899
Senior, thank you.

379
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,739
If it bothers you, I'll leave the pet shop immediately.

380
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,079
No, no, no! You don't have to.

381
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,319
They are unrelated and you love animals.

382
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:18,420
You even remember all the dogs' name.

383
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,220
Where can I find such a wonderful employee?

384
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,180
Congratulations!

385
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,800
It is very difficult to find out what you want.

386
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,970
Then,

387
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:38,250
we can still be good friends.

388
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,000
Right?

389
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,780
Of course.

390
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,440
Let's go, my wonderful employee!

391
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,160
My wonderful boss.

392
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,280
What do you think of Brother Fang?

393
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,380
What do you think of Brother Fang?

394
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,300
What do you mean? That's a strange question.

395
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,940
I mean, what do you think of him as a person?

396
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,800
Bad temper! Always has a long face.

397
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,060
You didn't fall in love with Brother Fang right?

398
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,199
You've known each other for so long.

399
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:03,479
How could it happen suddenly, if you never liked him before?

400
00:33:03,479 --> 00:33:05,359
You're at the age where love blooms,

401
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,580
so you might have mistaken your relationship with him for love.

402
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,080
Tell me then, how will I know if I like him?

403
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,400
Does your heart beat faster when you see him?

404
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,680
It does when he's close to me.

405
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:37,180
Do you feel happy when you see him?

406
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,020
Yes.

407
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:47,740
Are you in a bad mood when he's with another girl?

408
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,480
Of course!

409
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,740
Do you think he likes you?

410
00:33:56,380 --> 00:34:01,260
What does it feel like to like a fool?

411
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,240
Do you think I'm a big fool?

412
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,200
Of course not!

413
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,180
Why did you ask?

414
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,300
Do you think he will like me?

415
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:30,159
Sister, don't you know other guys at Rong University?

416
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,000
Aren't there a lot of handsome guys at Rong City?

417
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:37,459
Let me tell you! You must think twice on this.

418
00:34:37,459 --> 00:34:40,979
It's an important matter and it's related to my happiness as well.

419
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:43,160
I'll have to keep you in check.

420
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,620
Plan to conquer Xu Fang.

421
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,939
No way! I can't be so obvious.

422
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:27,620
What if someone sees this?

423
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:46,580
Plan to conquer Fang-fang.

424
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,639
First step: Treat him well.

425
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:12,760
Treat him so well that he gets used to it and can't bear to leave you.

426
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,060
Praise him! Don't stop praising him.

427
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:20,579
Dress up! Men are visual animals.

428
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,920
Keep him interested!

429
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,480
Chi-chi.

430
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,120
I bought this when I went out at night.

431
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,480
I couldn't find the same mug you had before.

432
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,320
I'm sorry.

433
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,280
I don't want it.

434
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:05,000
I smashed one of yours, too.

435
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,939
So, let's call it even.

436
00:37:06,939 --> 00:37:10,920
I'll be in your debt if I take your mug.

437
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,720
So, we are good now?

438
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,760
On one condition.

439
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,880
Can you teach me how to do makeup?

440
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,420
No problem.

441
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,719
Can I use your makeup?

442
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,499
Of course.

443
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:35,980
Which lipstick suits me?

444
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,059
I think the one you're using is nice.

445
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,699
- Pink?
- Pink.

446
00:37:39,699 --> 00:37:42,600
You made up with each other?

447
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,840
Quick, round of applause!

448
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:59,700
