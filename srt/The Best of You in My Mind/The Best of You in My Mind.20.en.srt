00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,410
♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,870
♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,150
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:17,070
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,580
♫ or pretend to be indifferent. ♫

7
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,870
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:27,600
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,520
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,500
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:46,430
♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

12
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:53,100
♫ Love is like a migratory bird waiting for the season. ♫

13
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,860
♫ How long does it take for them to be aware of each other? ♫

14
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,430
♫ You are like summer night, ♫

15
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:06,020
♫ I'm like a little star in the sky, ♫

16
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:13,110
♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

17
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,650
♫ Deliberately, I hit your shoulder, ♫

18
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:21,240
♫ and listen to your reprimand. ♫

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,600
♫ The caring feeling is so sweet! ♫

[Episode 20]

22
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,810
Hello, Uncle. Let me!

23
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,590
Dad.

24
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,690
I want to stay and work at Rong City after graduation.

25
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:55,770
I'll rent a house there and bring Fang Fang over.

26
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:59,870
- You...
- Dad, don't worry!

27
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:02,030
I can take care of myself.

28
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,370
Come here!

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,460
Call... Call me if you need anything.

30
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,100
I'll come back to see you.

31
00:02:19,034 --> 00:02:21,134
We'll be leaving now, Uncle.

32
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,440
Do you know how a seahorse reproduces?

33
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,860
The female seahorse leaves after depositing

34
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:55,860
its eggs in the pouch of the male.

35
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,820
The male is the one who is responsible for taking care of the offspring.

36
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:12,880
My parents are a pair of seahorses.

37
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,999
Lin Xigeng and I were raised in our dad's pouch.

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,519
Do you still blame him?

39
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,480
Not at all!

40
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,980
If I have a child in the future,

41
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,850
I'll never let go of my child's hand.

42
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:29,010
I'll stay with my child forever

43
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,970
just like what my dad did for us.

44
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:10,429
Get ready! Three, two, one.

45
00:04:10,429 --> 00:04:12,290
Cheese!

46
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,169
- Go over there, both of you.
- Let me! Go.

47
00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:17,130
Come quickly.

48
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:20,029
Ready? Five seconds. Five.

49
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,709
- Five.
- Four.

50
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,929
Three. Two. One.

51
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:26,530
Cheese!

52
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,260
All right.

53
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,919
Let me take a photo of you both.

54
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,600
- Let's do a selfie.
- Let's do it.

55
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,939
- Let's take photos.
- Come here! Here.

56
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:38,720
What's wrong?

57
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,260
I'm the only one left to study hard in my final year.

58
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,719
- No way. Take it again! No way.
- No way!

59
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:15,801
Looks like a wedding photo.

60
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,630
Da Li,

61
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,780
guess what I brought you?

62
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,860
- I don't know.
- Then close your eyes.

63
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,420
Close your eyes!

64
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,500
Are you done?

65
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,500
I know you can't go there now, so I got you a graduation robe.

66
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,639
Come! Put it on! I'll take a photo of you.

67
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,280
Let me take a photo.

68
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,540
- Do I look nice?
- Yes.

69
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,840
Here.

70
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,039
Give me a smile!

71
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:18,720
Congratulations on your graduation!

72
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,100
What do you want to do after graduation?

73
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,919
Initially, I planned to go on a motorbike trip for a year after graduation.

74
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,279
- But look at me now.
- What's wrong? You will definitely recover.

75
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:38,080
You can surely ride again when you recover.

76
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,280
Thank you.

77
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,080
My sister.

78
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,460
- Senior He Liyang, congratulations!
- Hello, hello!

79
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,900
Chi-chi, congratulations!

80
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,140
- Be quick!
- Everyone's there.

81
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,701
Congratulations.

82
00:06:56,701 --> 00:07:01,259
I've sent Lin Xigeng to take care of you since I can't be there with you.

83
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:04,719
What do you mean by that? I'd be here even if you hadn't sent me.

84
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,440
- It's so lively over there.
- I'll let you see everyone.

85
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,479
- Hello.
- Hello.

86
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:15,220
- Get well soon!
- Speedy recovery!

87
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:19,400
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

88
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,800
It's so lively.

89
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,480
- Doctor Liu.
- Doctor.

90
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,300
It's my graduation today.

91
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,840
Congratulations.

92
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,020
You're getting better, we can apply the cast soon.

93
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,500
- So you mean that she can get out of bed soon?
- Yes.

94
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,959
- Really?
- That's great! Thank you, Doctor.

95
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,539
- Thank you.
- That's great!

96
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:41,799
I can already feel that my leg is full of strength right now.

97
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,400
I told you so! You can definitely recover

98
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,420
and ride your motorbike again.

99
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,740
What should we do first when I get out of bed?

100
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,479
When your leg recovers, I'll definitely fulfill your wish.

101
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,340
First of all, we are to go on a motorbike trip.

102
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:00,420
I'll definitely fulfill this wish for you.

103
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,240
Yes! A motorbike trip!

104
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,680
Eat more.

105
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,900
Thank you.

106
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,560
Here.

107
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,179
Let's have a toast to celebrate Xu Fang's trip abroad.

108
00:08:20,179 --> 00:08:23,280
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

109
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,880
I want to have a few more words.

110
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,540
Xu Fang is my best brother.

111
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,719
I hope you can reprogram yourself abroad.

112
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,699
I mean recover. Recover well!

113
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:41,839
After that, the team will give you a reception party.

114
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,299
Although your not as handsome as me, don't get hooked to those branded clothes.

115
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:47,999
They're expensive. All right? Here!

116
00:08:47,999 --> 00:08:51,040
Let me give you a toast.

117
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,420
Good luck! I'll be waiting for you.

118
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,939
That concludes my speech, your turn, Lin Xichi.

119
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,720
This is specially made for you.

120
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,859
- Isn't it exquisite?
- Exquisite, indeed!

121
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,340
Let me wear it for you.

122
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,040
Wear it!

123
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,680
Why does it look like a dog tag?

124
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,580
You are correct! But my Fang-fang likes it.

125
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,019
Yes, I like it! I think he likes it, too.

126
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:37,940
Do you really like it?

127
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,640
Is this a farewell party?

128
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,319
- Coach.
- Coach.

129
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,620
They wanted to see you.

130
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,999
- You guys...
- What's wrong? Are we not welcomed?

131
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,180
Of course, you are!

132
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,619
Xu Fang, how could you?

133
00:09:52,619 --> 00:09:54,439
You're leaving without telling us?

134
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,359
If Coach hadn't told us about your illness,

135
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,519
none of us would've known what had happened to you.

136
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,980
Captain Fang, I'm sorry about what happened.

137
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,260
- Why don't you choke me?
- What are you saying?

138
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,639
Xu Fang, you must recover.

139
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,519
We'll wait for you to return.

140
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,840
All of us will be waiting.

141
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,000
Xu Fang, forgive me for nagging.

142
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,339
A person's experience is determined by the number of challenges he faced.

143
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:27,379
An old coach of mine told me that a great athlete must overcome three challenges.

144
00:10:27,379 --> 00:10:29,730
First, fatigue and tiredness.

145
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,650
Secondly, failure.

146
00:10:31,659 --> 00:10:33,739
Finally, sickness and injuries.

147
00:10:33,739 --> 00:10:36,860
You must overcome them all, understand?

148
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,500
Take care out there!

149
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,099
Just think of the pride that archery brings you, if you feel like giving up.

150
00:10:46,099 --> 00:10:48,479
Think of us if that doesn't work!

151
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,140
Yes! Think about us, too, and not only about Lin Xichi.

152
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,539
- We will miss you all.
- Think about us!

153
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
I won't disappoint you all.

154
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:59,400
Jiang Zhengxu, give him your blessings.

155
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,650
Blessings...

156
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,820
Waiter, bring me the menu!

157
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,519
- Here! Take a seat.
- Here here!

158
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,119
- Find a chair.
- Coach, sit here.

159
00:11:09,119 --> 00:11:11,299
- Sit here.
- Sit! All right.

160
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,499
Wait, wait! Give me a moment.

161
00:11:20,499 --> 00:11:22,380
What's wrong?

162
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,440
- For you!
- What's this?

163
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,640
Future plans with Fang-fang.

164
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,420
I'm going to the restroom.

165
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,520
Where did you go? What are you doing?

166
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,140
I went to the restroom.

167
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:18,100
Why didn't I see you?

168
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,580
It's over there.

169
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,719
Therefore, write what you want to do in the notebook after I leave.

170
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,440
I'll fulfill your wishes when I come back.

171
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,600
When did you find out about my notebook?

172
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,179
How else would we have held hands and kissed all in one night?

173
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:54,020
It would take three years according to your plan.

174
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,319
You... I... I even thought the plans worked well.

175
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,740
Turns out you knew about everything.

176
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,259
I didn't see it on purpose, you had my name on it.

177
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:07,860
- However, it's still my secret.
- You can't hide anything from me.

178
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,420
Furthermore, who taught you how to conquer someone?

179
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,080
Whatever! I still succeeded anyway.

180
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,770
It's because I like you, too; otherwise, from the day you started your plan,

181
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,910
we wouldn't have been friends.

182
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,830
So what Jiang Zheng Xu said was really true.

183
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,050
You had a crush on me for a long time.

184
00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:30,840
When did it start? Tell me!

185
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,600
- I forgot.
- You...

186
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,419
- Are you telling me or not?
- I'll tell you if you let go.

187
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:39,679
- Really?
- Really, really, really.

188
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,140
- Tell me.
- I really can't remember.

189
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:44,220
- You...
- Think about it!

190
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,000
Do you still remember the day you started liking Fang Fang?

191
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,300
Do you still remember the day you decided to become a veterinarian?

192
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,540
It's hard to give a clear answer.

193
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,860
I like you! I've always liked you.

194
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,140
So it's not important to remember when I started to.

195
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,639
♫ There are many stories. ♫

♫ We used to pretend it's all a coincidence. ♫

203
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:35,119
Look at this.
I solved it according to the example. Why can't I get the correct answer?

204
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:36,930

♫ I forgot when it all began ♫

208

What's wrong?

209
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,940
Why didn't you ask me?

210
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,800
Do you even know how to do it?

211
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,959

♫ It's brilliant fireworks and snow ♫

217

So there's not a particular moment for an important moment to happen.

218
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:19,240
Since the day I moved and became your neighbor,

219
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,860
both our fates started to change.

220
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,260
Then why did you ask to break up?

221
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,239
You're the one who wanted to break up.

222
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,680
You didn't even try to get me back, so I was sad about it for days.

You're so smart! You became smart after dating me.

Eat your meals on time and don't stay up too late.

Tell me if you need anything, I'll send it over to you.

I got it, that applies to you, too.

Don't underestimate me! Do you think I can't do anything alone?

Look for Jiang Zheng Xu if you get off work late.

I told him about it already. Call him if there's anything!

If you're in a bad mood, you can go to the karaoke or drink.

I'm starting to regret it now.

I'll find two kidnappers to kidnap you home.

Silly, be good!

265

It means that I have to take care of you, too.

We don't need interns at the moment, we'll give you a call when we need interns.

Hello, I'm Lin Xichi.

I'm sorry, we don't have any positions available.

You don't really fulfill our requirements.

I'm sorry, our hospital is not hiring anymore.

Please give me a call if you are hiring.

330

Sure!

331
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,680
How is it going with your internship search?

332
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,039
It's going well! I got an offer after I went for an interview.

333
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:33,180
There's also another one that my mentor recommended me to go to,

334
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,860
so I'm still considering my options.

335

That's great! My Nie Yue is the best.

Where have you been? Don't think that we can't find you after you've graduated.

340
00:28:05,639 --> 00:28:09,400
You have to shoulder your father's debts, shouldn't you know that?

341
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:14,299
Can you stop calling him? Can't you just collect your money?

342
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:16,080
Who are you?

343
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,500
I don't want them to bully you.

344
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,840
I'm alright, I just feel embarrassed that I can't

345
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,940
pay the money I owe.

346
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,980
I know you mean well

347
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,440
but I really can't pay them back now.

348
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,240
Get up! I said get up.

349
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,179
We can earn money, just don't give up! You hear me?

350
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:18,140
You are right! We can earn the money we need.

351
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,380
I can pay the debts.

352
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,510
I'm fine, what's with you?

353
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:28,050
What's wrong? What's wrong?

Let's go! I'm fine.

Hello! This is Sheng Chong Pet Hospital.

We regret to inform you that you didn't pass our interview.

We don't need an intern at the moment.

That's okay, thank you! I understand.

My furry friend,

370
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,440
I wanted to help you with the knowledge I learnt

371
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,400
but I haven't gotten a chance yet.

372
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,180
Not bad, right?

373
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:12,119
It's good! Very good, actually.

374
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,880
Guess the movie!

375
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,779
I don't have to, it's "The Motorcycle Diaries", my favorite!

376
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,080
I want to ride a motorbike so bad.

00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,600
Put it down!

Are you... Xu Fang?

379
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,620
Liu Xiaojiang, I know him.

380
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,560
You are Coach Jiang?

381
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,820
I know your coach from a match.

382
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,960
We had a drink.

383
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,060
He can really hold his liquor and even taught me Mandarin.

384
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,500
Our relationship in Mandarin should be

385
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,660
intimate friends.

386
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,519
What you are going to learn here

387
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,640
is to drop your bow and forget about your past.

388
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,400
Start from the beginning.

389
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,680
Forget about my past...

390
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,340
start from the beginning?

391
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,660
Yes.

392
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:50,460
You are now a clueless child.

393
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:52,980
You only have to listen to me.

394
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,159
What you need to do first is to train your fitness.

395
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,119
Keep running even if you can't go on.

396
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,940
Keep running until you can control your own body.

397
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,560
Bigger steps! Faster, faster!

398
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,000
Overtake me!

399
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,420

Come here!

401
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,780
Drink some water!

What a kid! You are really my thorough-bred horse.

403
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,039
Who taught you all these idioms?

404
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,539
Your coach! He taught me the last time when we went for a drink.

405
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,660
Do you think he was drunk?

406
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,559
- I think so.
- That fellow.

407
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,539
- Can you still go on?
- Yes.

408
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:29,440
Keep running!

409
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,940
All right.

410
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,820
Hello, my friend!

411
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:22,260
Why are you outside so late at night?

412
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,410
I'm just walking around and just now,

413
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:27,810
I saw someone walking with a zap racket in a park.

414
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:30,560
He was full of energy while swinging it.

415
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,139
Tell me honestly! Are you having trouble finding a job?

416
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,159
I've been to at least seven hospitals over the last two days.

417
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,819
I can't feel my feet anymore; still, none of them wanted me.

418
00:36:43,819 --> 00:36:46,419
Why is that? Your grades are good.

419
00:36:46,419 --> 00:36:48,480
They are not taking interns.

420
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,979
What about you? How have you been for the past few days over there?

421
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:56,310
The past few days, I haven't even touched the bow at all.

422
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,590
The coach doesn't allow me to shoot arrows, fitness training only.

423
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,900
I'm sure he has his own reasons.

424
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,460
However, he told me something very interesting.

425
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:12,639
He told me about a person named Lin Dongxian who is the champion of the World Archery Championships.

426
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:15,100
He only has a vision of 0.1.

427
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,199
How can even shoot on the target? He can't even see it.

428
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:26,079
He also said that archery is about one's feeling and not about one's vision.

429
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,880
One might clearly see the target while wearing glasses

430
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,250
but the eyes are deceiving.

431
00:37:31,259 --> 00:37:36,199
Only the right feeling, the feeling that is gained by years of experience, can be trusted.

432
00:37:36,199 --> 00:37:39,500
Target panic is actually caused by being deceived by one's eyes.

433
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,280
So, you are saying that Lin Dongxian can even hit his target

434
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,260
blindfolded?

435
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:52,879
I think what he meant is that target panic only exists psychologically.

436
00:37:52,879 --> 00:37:55,759
Lin Dongxian overcame his obstacle in terms of psychology.

437
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,799
I'm here to improve my body and mind,

438
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:04,479
so that I'm able to stabilize my body and mind when the arrow leaves the bow.

439
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:07,999
Why don't you try closing your eyes or blindfolding yourself?

440
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,799
Just like Guo Jing's master, Ke Zhen E.
[Role in the novel The Legend of the Condor Heroes]

441
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,960
He was still powerful although he was blind.

442
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:21,040
His famous line is: "Act according to my eyes."

443
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,839
All right, I get it! It's late, go back now.

444
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,720
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
