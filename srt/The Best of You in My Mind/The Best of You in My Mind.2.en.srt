00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,400
♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,800
♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,400
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,000
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,600
♫ or pretend to be indifferent. ♫

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,000
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,600
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,800
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,600
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,600
♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

12
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,000
♫ Love is like a migratory bird waiting for the season. ♫

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,800
♫ How long does it take for them to be aware of each other? ♫

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,400
♫ You are like summer night, ♫

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,100
♫ I'm like a little star in the sky, ♫

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:13,200
♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,600
♫ Deliberately, I hit your shoulder, ♫

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,200
♫ and listen to your reprimand. ♫

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,800
♫ The caring feeling is so sweet! ♫

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,800
[Episode 2]

22
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,400
Fang-fang, Coach Chen called again.

23
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,000
He asked if you want to join the Rong University team.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,600
He said that this is a rare opportunity.

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,900
Actually, your dad and I

26
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,580
don't really want you to be an athlete.

27
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,800
It's too difficult!

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,200
Fang Fang, Fang Fang.

29
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,000
Do you see this? This is the dog tag that I prepared for you.

30
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,000
Good boy! Let me put it on for you.

31
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,400
This way you won't get lost in the future.

32
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,800
Even if you do, we'll be able to find you.

33
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,400
Now stay at home and take care of your little brother, okay?

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,900
You're just going to leave like this?

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,100
You're really angry this time.

36
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,360
Today's the one day Dad can't make it home and you had to choose to leave today.

37
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,900
It's obvious that you don't want him to see you off.

38
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,900
It's not like I'll never see him again.

39
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,600
How about Brother Fang?

40
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,700
You're not going to stop by before you leave?

41
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:16,200
I don't really have much to say to him. Maybe I'll talk to him later when I get the chance.

42
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,900
Okay,

43
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,560
I'm leaving now.

44
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,340
Big Sister, be careful on your way there!

45
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,200
Call me when you get there.

46
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,400
Don't worry!

47
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,600
Fang Fang, take care of everyone well.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Bye-bye!

49
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,800
Rong University!

50
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,400
I'm finally here! I can finally study what I want to study.

51
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,200
Also, now I can live in the same city as Mom.

52
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,300
[You have been accepted into the Veterinary Medicine department.]

53
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,800
It's so nice here!

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,400
Dad, can you hurry up?

55
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,000
Let me help you!

56
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,600
Sorry, can I ask where the girls' dormitory is?

57
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,400
You're going in the wrong direction. It's over there!

58
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,200
- Thanks.
- No problem!

59
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,800
Come down here.

60
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,600
Come down!

61
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
Climb up and save her!

62
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,000
What are you guys doing?

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,400
I'm saving a cat.

64
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,600
But that's not what she thinks.

65
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,400
The only reason the cat climbed up was because you were here.

66
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,800
To her, you're the bad guy who's trying to catch her.

67
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,100
You're not a cat, how would you know what she's thinking?

68
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,400
It looks like you understand the cat more.

69
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,600
An animal's natural instinct is to hide from or attack humans.

70
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,200
You need time to gain trust.

71
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,400
Then how do you think we should save her?

72
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,200
I think we should put food and water under the tree,

73
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,590
and tell all the surrounding people to leave.

74
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:43,500
This way, the cat would come down by herself.

75
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,200
You're right.

76
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:49,480
You guys should leave. Don't scare the cat!

77
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,400
There are a lot of stray cats on our campus.

78
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,100
If only everyone could be like you, then these cats would be able to live peacefully.

79
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,370
It's still better to have a home though.

80
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:16,700
Then, at least they would have a place to go if it's dangerous.

81
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,100
You like animals too?

82
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,190
That's why I'm majoring in veterinary medicine.

83
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,900
There are a lot of little animals on campus.

84
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,000
Other than cats, there are a lot of dogs, too.

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The girls' dormitory is right up there. We're here!

86
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,500
- Is it this building?
- Yes.

87
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,200
Classmate.

88
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,600
You seem to have an accent.

89
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,000
Are you from Taiwan?

90
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,900
I'm from Fujian. My parents work in Rong City.

91
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,800
You're so nice. Thank you for today.

92
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,600
No problem! I can take this up for you.

93
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,200
It's okay, it's okay! I can do it myself.

94
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,500
Okay.

95
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,900
You don't need help?

96
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,600
It's okay.

97
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Oh right! I forgot to ask your name.

98
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,300
Ye Shaowen.

99
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,200
My name's Lin Xichi.

100
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,800
Lin from the word "forest", Xi from the word "return", and Chi from the word "late".

101
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,400
Goodbye, classmate.

102
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,600
Bye.

103
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Lin Xichi.

104
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,400
Mom! Stop making my bed, you're getting dust all over it.

105
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,200
A girl's body can't stand the cold for too long

106
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,600
or else, it'll be bad for your health.

107
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,200
Stop touching my stuff!

108
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,800
Look how you arranged my pens! The colors aren't even right.

109
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,400
It's so messy, I'm going to have to reorganize it.

110
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,100
Okay, okay! I won't interfere anymore, then.

111
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,200
My lucky tea, please bless me!

112
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,000
Please don't assign me a weird roommate.

113
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,600
Please don't assign me a weird roommate.

114
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Please don't assign me a weird roommate.

115
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,300
Lin Xichi?

116
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,300
I'm Nie Yue, she's Xin Zidan. We're going to be roommates.

117
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:35,000
That's right! In the future, you need to take care of each other.

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,600
Here, let me help you!

119
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,400
It's okay, I can do it.

120
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,200
- Which area is yours?
- Over there!

121
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,100
Why did you come up with your suitcase yourself? Didn't other students help you?

122
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:48,500
I only have one suitcase, I could bring up two if I had to.

123
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,300
Oh right, I was born on January 1st, none of you guys are older than me, right?

124
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,100
Then, in the future, I'll be your Big Sis. I'll be in charge of the dorm and taking care of you two.

125
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,500
Deal!

126
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,800
Yue-yue, your dad and I are really not going to be used to it when you're not at home.

127
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,000
Mom! I'll be home during break.

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,300
Lin Xichi, where are you from?

129
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,500
Lin Xichi?

130
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,400
Where are you from?

131
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,900
I'm from Luo City.

132
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,200
I'm also from Luo City.

133
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,700
Then, that's perfect! We can go home together during break.

134
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
That's great!

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,800
Mom! I don't have anyone to go with, you should come to pick me up.

136
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,900
Okay. Your dad and I will both come and pick you up.

137
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,800
My high-end equipment!

138
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,800
It was an emergency. I'll give it back one day.

139
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,000

[Stupid Little Brother]

141
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,800
Hello? Brother?

142
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,600
Lin Xichi, why'd you take my money?

143
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,370
Do you know how long it took me to save it all?

144
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:28,200
It was supposed to be for my gaming equipment!

145
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,000
Why are you petty? It's not like I'm never giving it back. I'll return double the amount once I get the chance.

146
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,400
You... I really don't understand.

147
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,700
Dad gave you a card and you didn't take it, why are you causing trouble for him?

148
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,400
Just take care of yourself!

149
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,900
With just my allowance money, you won't survive for long.

150
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,300
You should focus on your studies.

151
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,000
You're taking the College Entrance Exam next year.

152
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,600
In a bit, I'm going to tell Mom—

153
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,800
Stop talking about things I don't want to hear. Goodbye!

154
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:07,460
Mom, I'm here in Rong City.

155
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,520
I just got here.

156
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,030
Everything's fine, don't worry!

157
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,480
I wish I could see you right away.

158
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,760
Students, good afternoon.

159
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,370
This is our Veterinary Medicine department's first new student orientation.

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,870
Thank you for choosing Rong University's Veterinary Medicine department.

161
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,380
I'm sure that this is going to be

162
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,460
one of the wisest decisions you'll ever make in your lives.

163
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:49,220
I also believe that during your years in college,

164
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,860
you'll gain a great deal of knowledge and skills

165
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,280
through your hard work here.

166
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,410
Now I'm going to introduce to everyone your Senior Brother,

167
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:59,140
who will give you all a live speech.

168
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,180
Please welcome Classmate Ye Shaowen.

169
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,240
Welcome!

170
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,290
He's so handsome!

171
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,030
So handsome.

172
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:18,380
So he's in the Veterinary Medicine department, too.

173
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,770
Hello, everyone. I'm Ye Shaowen.

174
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,640
I'm here representing all seniors to welcome you all

175
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,980
to the Veterinary Medicine department.

176
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,050
I hope you can advance bravely and

177
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,350
have fun in the next five years.

178
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,130
Oh right!

179
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,560
This is my WeChat ID, you can add me.

180
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,750
If you have any problems regarding your studies or college life, feel free to ask me.

181
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,440
I'll answer them to the best of my ability.

182
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,860
♪ Smiles flying in the sky. ♪

183
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,280
You two, stop singing! What do you guys think about

184
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,620
Senior Ye? He's not bad, right?

185
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,690
Not only is he handsome, he's also gentle and approachable.

186
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:43,460
Also, let me tell you The people behind us kept gossiping

187
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,470
and saying he used to be campus king.

188
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,090
He's not only handsome, but his family's background is also pretty good, too.

189
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,900
Your heart has fluttered already?

190
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:54,260
No, Senior Ye is too gentle.

191
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,390
I like guys who are cooler.

192
00:13:56,390 --> 00:14:00,420
- What about you?
- I'm hungry! I want to eat.

193
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,000
- What do you want to eat?
- What about grilled fish?

194
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,650
- I know a restaurant with delicious grilled fish.
- Okay!

195
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,920
There's so much good food.

196
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,880
Then it'll be convenient for us! From now on, we can come for midnight snacks after class.

197
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,160
Then, are we still eating grilled fish? There is so much good food.

198
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,040
Look! There's barbecue, too.
- And hotpot.

199
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,890
And stir-fry.

200
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:27,450
There's ice cream, do you guys what some?

201
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,730
- Yes.
- My treat! Wait for me.

202
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,280
- Okay.
- I'll go with you.

203
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,550
Almost! Keep going.

204
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,630
Kid, I'll help you.

205
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,440
Okay.

206
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,560
I watched archery growing up.

207
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,430
I'm a pro.

208
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,550
I was just practicing. Don't worry!

209
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,730
Boss, give me another one!

210
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,420
This one will definitely hit the mark. I'll show you my real

211
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,390
ability.

212
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,410
Sister, I only have one chance left.

213
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:36,400
Then, give me one last chance.

214
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,960
I can definitely hit it.

215
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,480
Okay.

216
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:16,090
- Yes, you hit it!
- Xu Fang.

217
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,070
Boss, give him the prize!

218
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:24,290
Hurry! Give me my prize.

219
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,760
You... Why are you here?

220
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,910
- Give it to me!
- Here!

221
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:34,110
- Brother, you're so good! Thank you.
- Thank you, Boss.

222
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:43,170
Xu Fang, why did you come over here? You were—

223
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,140
You know each other?

224
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:50,370
This is the pretty girl you've always wanted to meet.

225
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,460
It's me!

226
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,040
You're Lin Xichi?

227
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,280
- Yes.
- This is the Lin Xichi you've told me about?

228
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,060
Hello!

229
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,050
Yes!

230
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:09,860
She's so cute! How is she as scary as you described her to be?

231
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,370
That one...

232
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:19,070
You-You two talk!

233
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,160
Chi-chi.

234
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,940
You're really good at acting now, aren't you?

235
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:29,480
What did you just say?

236
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,310
It's okay. You guys eat first! I'll be back soon.

237
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:10,530
Where are your glasses?

238
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,040
Did you get contact lenses?

239
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,930
I got surgery.

240
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,490
You're really Fang-fang?

241
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,780
I really didn't believe...

242
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,920
Are you done yet?

243
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:52,470
I can't believe you're here at Rong University.

244
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,870
The Rong University archery team especially recruited me.

245
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,730
Looks like we really are ill-fated.

246
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:12,640
Looks like you know we are ill-fated.

247
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:19,530
This happened so long ago, why are you so petty?

248
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,960
I know a really good restaurant, do you want to go?

249
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:28,130
It's just that it's a little expensive.

250
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:32,080
Didn't you agree to treat me to a meal?

251
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,330
I don't have money.

252
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,580
You really have grown.

253
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,120
Hurry up and order, I'm so hungry.

254
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,270
Why is that even after going to college, you haven't broken the habit of putting up your feet?

255
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,870
Why is that even after going to college, you haven't broken the habit of minding other people's business?

256
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,640
Is it this easy to get into Rong University these days?

257
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,320
With just your skills, you were especially recruited?

258
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,970
Do you really not want to see me?

259
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,960
I have to deal with another enemy.

260
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:09,890
- Do want to order?
- I want a spicy hot pot with beef, pig brain, duck blood—

261
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:13,260
People who don't know might think you haven't eaten since you got to college.

262
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,730
Petty!

263
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,750
I'd like one order of hotpot with two soups, one order of beef,

264
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,710
one order of mackerel,

265
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:22,080
a veggie platter, and an order of iced fruit jelly.

266
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,320
We have a promotion to give each table a free order of iced fruit jelly.

267
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,510
Can you give us two?

268
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,000
No, it's okay! One is okay. Thank you.

269
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,790
Hello, here's your iced fruit jelly!

270
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:38,050
Thank you.

271
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,060
I didn't say I would give it to you.

272
00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:48,570
There's papaya? Are you trying to look prettier?
(It is said that eating papaya makes you prettier.)

273
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:08,450
I think we should get together more often.

274
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,920
We can eat and reflect upon the past.

275
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,570
You just want me to treat you to meals, right?

276
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:17,480
Ever since I saw you this time, I was wondering why you smell.

277
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,360
I don't smell anything. What smell?

278
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,450
- The smell of poverty.
- You...

279
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,500
My money...

280
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,900
Never mind! Recently, I've been having financial issues.

281
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,900
No wonder you're not as arrogant as before.

282
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,500
You really have changed.

283
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,700
Someone actually said you're handsome!

284
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,500
Too bad they've never seen you before! When you were dark, skinny, weak,

285
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,000
and had glasses. You were bossed around by me all day.

286
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,800
How about... we arm wrestle again?

287
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,000
No! I told you before, I'm never arm wrestling you again.

288
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,400
I'll give you an advantage! You can use two hands.

289
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,700
And let's bet one month of our living expenses.

290
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,200
You better keep your word.

291
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,060
I'll count down.

292
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,600
1, 2— hey!

293
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,200
I haven't said "3" yet, stop cheating!

294
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,000
1, 2, 3.

295
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,700
Why'd you cheat?

296
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,700
Why'd you let go?

297
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,300
I'm fine!

298
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,400
Your wallet!

299
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,900
- I didn't bring it.
- According to our promise before,

300
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,000
whoever doesn't keep their word is a dog.

301
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,900
And a dog eats poop.

302
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,200
You eat poop!

303
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,600
I don't have any money.

304
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,600
There's no way! There's no way you don't even have—

305
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,800
You see? I told you I didn't have any money.

306
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,900
You really don't?

307
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,400
Your phone!

308
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,070
What's the password?

309
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,200
Still as smart as before.

310
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,600
You haven't even changed your password.

311
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,400
Only ¥800? (around $113)

312
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,800
That's all I have.

313
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,100
Since my living expenses add up to ¥2,000 per month, you owe me the rest.

314
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,200
Why are you so rich?

315
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,500
My ¥800.

316
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,000
Here! Read it aloud for me.

317
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:07,600
"Lin Xichi owes Xu Fang exactly ¥1,200."

318
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,000
"She can work to pay back her debt."

319
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,500
From today on, I am your creditor.

320
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,600
You have to do whatever I tell you to do.

321
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,300
Leave some for me.

322
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,300
I only have this little left?

323
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,400
Make sure to eat a lot when the food's served.

324
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,700
I don't think I can eat anything anymore.

325
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,400
They've updated their Weibo, let me check it out.

326
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,200
Chi-chi, tell me honestly!

327
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,800
What's with you and that handsome guy?

328
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,200
What handsome guy?

329
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,900
The one in black.

330
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,000
Does he go to our school?

331
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,100
- Xu Fang!
- Xu Fang?

332
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:56,100
Fang from the word "f*rt."

333
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,900
How about the other one? Is he also on the archery team?

334
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,700
The other one's Xu Fang's teammate.

335
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,000
His name's Jiang Zhengxu.

336
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,800
How do you know them so well? When did you guys meet?

337
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,900
We've known each other for so long already.

338
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,200
We grew up together. He lived in the building next to mine.

339
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,600
Are you guys childhood sweethearts?

340
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,700
What sweetheart? He's like a marsh.

341
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,800
Whoever touches him won't be able to get out no matter how hard they try.

342
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,900
A constant enemy!

343
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,100
What do I do? I only have ¥20 left.

344
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,600
Why are you suddenly so poor? How are you going to get by this month?

345
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
How else would I get by?

346
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,370
Follow his orders and wait for my salary.

347
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,600
I'll have to live frugally.

348
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,900
Does he like you?

349
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:47,900
- Why would you have such weird thoughts?
- Just tell me!

350
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,200
For some guys, the more they like a girl, the more they'll bully her.

351
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,800
Just open the door!

352
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,000
- Open the door.
- He seems to have a good stature.

353
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,800
I'm sure he wouldn't try to make it hard for you.

354
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,500
Okay, okay, let's stop chatting!

355
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,500
It's already 10PM, and we're going to have to wake up early to enroll in classes tomorrow.

356
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Oh right! Don't blame me for not reminding you. Our school has four teachers we can choose.

357
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,000
Don't choose Professor Yan! The Senior Sister next door said he's a demon,

358
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
always failing students.

359
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,460
What happened between you two?

360
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,000
Sign up for classes for me tomorrow. I don't want Professor Yan.

361
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,500
Think about your wallet.

362
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,200
- Tell me!
- Open the door.

363
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,400
- What?
- Open the door!

364
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,600
Will you tell me?

365
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,100
Tell me!

366
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,500
Let me tell you, Xu Fang! I'm not joking.

367
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,400
If you don't tell me, then you can just stay up on the balcony all night.

368
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:27,600
Just tell me! I feel terrible.

369
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Don't be curious!

370
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,500
I'm too... I'm too curious! Just tell me!

371
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,400
Nie Yue!

372
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,200
Wake up! It's time to enroll!

373
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,000
Hurry up!

374
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,600
Zidan, you too. Hurry up!

375
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,600
15 seconds left.

376
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,200
I need to enroll into anyone but Professor Yan's class.

377
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,300
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

378
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,800
[Restarting]

379
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,600
Thank the heavens!

380
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,200
It crashed!

381
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,200
What is this trash?

382
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
What happened?

383
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,900
It crashed!

384
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,400
What's the name of the professor you talked about?

385
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,200
Yan Zhibin.

386
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
You got Professor Yan?

387
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,400
It's okay, it's okay! Let me give you one of my lucky teas.

388
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,200
If you bring it with you to class, you'll definitely start getting lucky.

389
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Did you get me the class I wanted?

390
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,000
I guess not.

391
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I even woke up at 8:50AM.

392
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,200
So?

393
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,800
So what?

394
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,800
If the computer hadn't crashed, I would've been able to enroll even with my foot.

395
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,000
Good thing your computer saved your mouse's life then.

396
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,800
Then how about your own class?

397
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,600
How did this happen?

398
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
What?

399
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,900
I don't want to have class with you.

400
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,800
You act like I want to.

401
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,000
Who'd you get?

402
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,100
Not Yan Zhibin.

403
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,200
Who'd you get?

404
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Yan Zhibin.

405
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,200
That teacher is really strange.

406
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,600
As strange as you?

407
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,400
Not really!

408
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,800
Chi-chi... I didn't get any of the other teachers for English, either.

409
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,290
I got the same as you.

410
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:15,900
When the time comes, we can go to class together.

411
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Then I'll give you one of my lucky teas, too.

412
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,200
Maybe it'll change your luck.

413
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,900
Thanks!

414
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
Why are you eating so little?

415
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,900
I'm poor.

416
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,900
Your buns... what's the filling?

417
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,300
I'll give you one.

418
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,500
Meat filled ones are the best!

419
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,100
It's that good?

420
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,800
You guys don't understand the feeling of having no money in your pocket.

421
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,100
It makes me hungry when I see food.

422
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,600
I'll give you an egg, too.

423
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:38,600
If only I was a camel, then I could survive for months with just one meal.

424
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,900
You... We just started the semester and you're already this poor.

425
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,490
Can't you talk to your parents about it?

426
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,000
Didn't you say your mom lives here?

427
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,720
My mom hasn't responded to me in months.

428
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,340
But don't tell my mom and dad this.

429
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:58,350
As long as I get through this month, I'll be fine.

430
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:03,400
- Poor you!
- I won't ever talk to that dog Xu Fang again.

431
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,240
If you're hungry, I can treat you to buns every day.

432
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,350
The environment here is pretty nice.

433
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,210
Mom, look over there!

434
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,760
If you turn right, it's the library.

435
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,490
You need to focus on your studies, and if you miss home you can call us, okay?

436
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,420
Okay, I know, Mom.

437
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,060
- Let's go! I'll take you to the main campus to look around.
- Okay.

438
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,390
Hey, Senior Ye.

439
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,510
Hi.

440
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:12,440
I want to ask you something.

441
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,350
I don't have a boyfriend.

442
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,810
Have you ever had a cat?

443
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:22,020
No, I've never had a cat.

444
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,670
But I've had a dog ever since I was little.

445
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,410
He's now ten years old.

446
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:29,870
When I'm walking him, he'd try to run off the leash.

447
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,270
Then, do you have time right now?

448
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,020
I'll take you to a place, I guarantee you'll like it.

449
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,660
Follow me!

450
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:49,570
I didn't know there was a place like this at school.

451
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:54,080
The school staff often brings the cafeteria's leftovers to feed them and they kept doing it.

452
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,090
After a while, this became heaven for stray cats.

453
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:00,800
That's so nice! I love petting them.

454
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,610
I had a cat before.

455
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:10,990
I really, really liked him.

456
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:14,430
One day, he left the house and never came back.

457
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,880
I was sad for a long time.

458
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,810
After I saw these cats, I realized that even though they're stray, they're free.

459
00:34:20,810 --> 00:34:22,720
I think that's pretty nice too.

460
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:27,150
I think all the cats and dogs in the world are our friends.

461
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:35,560
Then... we're also friends.

462
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,030
Look, look over there,

463
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,920
I named that one Big White.

464
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:49,660
Come here! I've got something good for you.

465
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:54,360
- Hello, Mom?
 - Chi-chi, I've come to see you at school.

466
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,620
Wait for me!

467
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:59,750
Senior Ye, I'm sorry! I've got to get going.

468
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,240
Lin Xichi!

469
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,570
Mom!

470
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:21,770
- Come in!
- It's pretty nice here.

471
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,630
- Our dorm is very clean.
- Which one is your bed?

472
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,460
Take a guess!

473
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,650
This one?

474
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:31,750
It's this one.

475
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,860
- Have a seat!
- Here, look!

476
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:36,980
I bought all the snacks that you like to eat.

477
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,930
So much good food.

478
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,620
Mom, have a seat!

479
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:58,060
That was a taken on your and Dad's seventh anniversary.

480
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,480
Mom.

481
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:05,080
I missed you.

482
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,770
Can I come over to eat at your place every Friday? The weekends, too.

483
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,220
I want to taste your cooking.

484
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,960
You don't even know how Xu Fang tricked me.

485
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:23,920
I-I live in the hospital's dorms.

486
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,390
- That's how it is?
- Didn't you-you just say

487
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:31,450
something about Xu Fang?

488
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,870
Is he the boy who lived in the building next to ours?

489
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:37,180
He-He's here too?

490
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:39,160
How did he trick you?

491
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:44,000
It's nothing really. He's the same way he was when we were little, he's my sidekick.

492
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:52,040
Mom...

493
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,970
I need to tell you something.

494
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,730
Go ahead and tell me!

495
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:11,150
Do you remember... Do you remember... the black stockings?

496
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:12,990
The stockings... they were actually mine.

497
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,960
Chi-chi, didn't I tell you before?

498
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,010
It's all in the past.

499
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:21,060
Take a look at what I bought for you.

500
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,190
Which one do you want to eat? I'll open it for you, okay?

501
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,250
Call me anytime!

502
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,980
Take care of yourself and don't eat too much junk food.

503
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,940
Look how skinny you are!

504
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:42,710
When I'm free, I'll come see you.

505
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:46,310
Okay, you don't need to see me off. Go on back!

506
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:47,850
All right?

507
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,020
- Lin Xigeng.
- Hello, Big Sister.

508
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,850
Can you stop surprise attacking me?

509
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:14,620
Did you know I'm in my third year of high school? The teacher doesn't let us bring our phones.
(TN: In China, there's only three years of high school.)

510
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:16,760
Then, how did you pick up phone?

511
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,920
I was afraid something happened to you.

512
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:22,500
If you don't want to contact Dad, of course you'd contact me.

513
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,620
Can't you wish something good on me?

514
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:28,780
Okay, okay. If you need to say something, say it! I need to take a mock exam in a bit.

515
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,090
I saw Mom today.

516
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:40,070
Why are you so cold?

517
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,840
Then return my money and I won't be cold anymore.

518
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,020
Even if I return it to you, you'd have no use for it.

519
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,690
Right now, the thing you need to focus on is your studies.

520
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:53,460
Stop playing games! Once you come to Rong City,

521
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,530
I'll take you hang out with Mom.

522
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,950
Brat!

523
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,270
How do you do this one?

524
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,010
Oh, it's a triangle, so...

525
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,470
You're still explaining problems? It's too late at this point.

526
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:14,000
If you got this problem on the test, with your luck, you'd be able to win the lottery.

527
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,070
Just because you don't want to take it, doesn't mean you can stop other people from asking.

528
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:21,150
I won't take it then. But in a bit, my score will be higher than yours, do you believe me?

529
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,030
Just keep bragging!

530
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,370

531
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,200
What are you doing?

532
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,020
Just keep studying.

533
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,220
Come back here!

534
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:43,440
The teacher's coming.

535
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,600
Today, we're taking a mock exam.

536
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,040
You have 40 minutes for the exam. You may begin now.
