♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,140
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,010
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,650
♫ or pretend to be indifferent. ♫

7
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,900
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,560
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,490
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:39,580
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11

♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

[Episode 24]

22
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:37,040
Welcome everyone to the venue for the National Archery Championships

23
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,019
where the nation's elite archery athletes gather.

24
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,349
The first qualifying round will start soon.

25
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,020
Please look forward to their performances.

26
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,470
[Rong City Team will win]

27
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,420
Let me see!

28
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,909
Your aim is neither the target nor the gold ring,

29
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:46,970
but an accurate shooting movement.

30
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:51,569
Forget about winning! Forget about the result!

31
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,510
You just need to

32
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,740
find the correct feeling to complete a perfect shooting.

33
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:07,650
Forget about the past! Start from the beginning.

34
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,939
How is it? What's his score?

35
00:03:16,939 --> 00:03:20,049
Don't bother me! There is too much going on.

36
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:23,099
Let him have a look, he knows better.

37
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,650
8 points.

38
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,620
Xu Fang's form is looking poor today.

39
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,650
It's just the beginning.

40
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,350
9 points just now.

41
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,320
I knew you'd be here

42
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,420
practicing so late after the qualifying round.

43
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,590
Why did you bring Fang Fang here?

44
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,360
Fang Fang, you came to cheer for me?

45
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,800
He is here to cheer for you.

46
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,420
Do you know how much effort I had put in to bring him here?

47
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:18,140
I barely qualified for the finals today,

48
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,530
but my result wasn't good enough.

49
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:25,290
If I don't train hard, I'm afraid that...

50
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:28,579
If you joined the national team, you'll need to prepare

51
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,650
for the next World Championships.

52
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,700
If you get a good result at the World Championships,

53
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:39,420
you'll qualify for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

54
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:43,220
If that happens, you'll stay in the national team for 3 years.

55
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,880
Including the year that you went abroad,

56
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,490
I would've waited 4 years for you.

57
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,700
We've known each other for 16 years

58
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,739
and I have to wait 4 years for you.

59
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,950
You might as well stay here.

60
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,470
But we can all live for a hundred years.

61
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:15,920
I'll be 28 years old in 4 years.

62
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:19,470
We still have 72 years to be together.

63
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:22,360
If so, four years is just a short period.

64
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,750
You frighten me.

65
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,610
I haven't finished yet.

66
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,800
If you're still performing well,

67
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,940
you'll still be in the national team

68
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,780
when I am pregnant, when I'm giving birth,

69
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,320
and also during my confinement period,

70
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,629
that's not allowed,

71
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:52,859
You need to take care of me by my side when I'm pregnant.

72
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,530
Serve me like how you serve your dad.

73
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,860
Did you see me serve my dad before?

74
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,540
Of course, I did.

75
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,389
Do all the chores for me.

76
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:08,459
I can't bend down when I'm pregnant, so you need to wash my feet, too.

77
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,330
You'll also wag your tail at me.

78
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,490
Keep it up!

79
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,410
I'll support you by your side no matter what.

80
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,110
I want to rest for a while.

81
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,150
Look! Fang Fang is getting some rest, too.

82
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,440
Be with the two of us.

83
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,930
I'll be with both of you forever.

84
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:06,419
Today's event is

85
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,659
the individual elimination tournament of the World Championships.

86
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,060
All the best!

87
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,390
You can do it!

88
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,339
You can do it!

89
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,990
Good luck!

90
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,870
Ten points.

91
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,830
Xu Fang!

92
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,370
Calm down, family members of the future champion.

93
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,989
Calm down! The champion's family.

94
00:09:46,989 --> 00:09:50,170
Let's be civilized when watching the competition.

95
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,860
How could you call yourself an archery athlete?

96
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,690
I told you so. There's nothing wrong.

97
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,629
- Nice!
- Another one.

98
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:21,439
- Xu Fang is back on form today.
- That's good!

99
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:24,730
Brother Fang will definitely play well.

100
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,570
Ten points.

101
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,290
- Ten points.
- He'll surely move on to the finals.

102
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:39,079
Xu Fang, my brother! We used to play together.

103
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,110
What are you doing?

104
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,730
Too excited!

105
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,979
He's performing well today.

106
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:53,100
Not bad!

107
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,629
Look at him! He is so handsome.

108
00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:16,930
It's true.

109
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,899
It's normal! In my opinion as an expert,

110
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,840
he won't get 10 points consecutively.

111
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,050
He'll get it for the next one.

112
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:33,249
Let me tell you, it's all about the mentality. Just...

113
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,400
Nice!

114
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,269
This year's rookies are not bad.

115
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,390
They're all in the finals.

116
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:59,860
He knows nothing, tell him more.

117
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,170
Come over here.

118
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,389
After an intense elimination tournament, the last two athletes

119
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:09,859
will enter the gold medal match of this year's World Championships.

120
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,419
They are Xu Fang from Rong City and Ding Yi from Hai City.

121
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,800
Who will be the one to lif the championship trophy?

122
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,590
Let's look forward to it.

123
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,170
It's bad! It's getting windy.

124
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,190
The strong winds will affect the result.

125
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:04,150
Focus on the match!

126
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,020
It's raining.

[Shooting Line]
[1-meter line]

128
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,830
Such heavy rain will definitely affect their performance.

129
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:31,510
How's it going?

00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:14,949
The finals is coming to its final round.

131
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,690
Xu Fang is currently trailing behind Ding Yi.

132
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:20,100
It's the last shot. Xu Fang only has one last chance.

133
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,320
Xu Fang!

134
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,659
Remember to have a target in your heart!

135
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,880
Xu Fang, everyone from Rong University is rooting for you!

136
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,120
Brother Fang, be my brother-in-law after your victory!

137
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,980
Xu Fang! All the best!

138
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,959
A telescoping. Xu Fang has hit a telescoping.

139
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:45,589
He proved himself with a perfect shot and becomes the champion.

140
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:49,960
The National Archery Championships' winner is Xu Fang!

141
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,899
Xu Fang! You're the greatest!

142
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,020
I love you!

143
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,651
Xu Fang! Champion!

144
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:03,829
Xu Fang! Xu Fang! Champion!

145
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,749
Xu Fang! Champion!

146
00:18:05,749 --> 00:18:07,779
Xu Fang! Champion!

147
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:10,130
Xu Fang! Champion!

148
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,709
Nice! Xu Fang!

149
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,720
Nice! You're awesome!

150
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,669
- Xu Fang!
- Good job!

151
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:17,419
- Brother Fang!
- Xu Fang!

152
00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:19,300
Champion!

153
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,540
That's so awesome!

154
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,070
Chi-chi, I finally did it.

155
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:41,040
I've been thinking.

156
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,540
That last shot by Xu Fang was so cool.

157
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,090
He looks like me in my prime.

158
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,130
You know me the best.

159
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,499
Does he look like me in my prime?

160
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:57,419
Just eat! Here!

161
00:18:57,419 --> 00:18:59,480
All of you...

162
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,330
You didn't get to see me.

163
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:05,069
- No spring onions?
- That's enough.

164
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,520
Why are you sighing?

165
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,300
It's not interesting without Xu Fang here.

166
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,979
It's alright! Let's have a toast to celebrate Xu Fang's victory.

167
00:19:20,979 --> 00:19:22,949
- To his victory!
- Cheers!

168
00:19:22,949 --> 00:19:25,150
A toast to celebrate Xu Fang's victory.

169
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:27,280
Also a congratulation

170
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,520
to the future wife of the champion.

171
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,809
That's right! Sister-in-law, cheers!

172
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,040
Another toast.

173
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,700
This is to celebrate our reunion here in Beijing.

174
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:46,909
- That's good. Cheers.
-Cheers.

175
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,890
A final toast by you.

176
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,590
Suddenly?

177
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,990
How about a toast

178
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,539
to taking our friendship to a greater height?

179
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,301
This is good! Let's cheers to this.

180
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:07,900
- Here.
- Cheers.

181
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,550
Have some.

182
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,440
You too.

183
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,020
I'll wrap it for you. Just eat.

184
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,589
I haven't finished this one.

185
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:24,020
Just eat! I'll make the wrap for you.

186
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,900
It's not for you.

187
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,810
Thank you.

188
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:32,720
Make your own wrap.

189
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:35,630
I want one, too.

190
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,830
Me too.

191
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,890
Go away!

192
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,499
You are getting full of yourself now.

193
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,060
They are so loving.

194
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,890
Senior.

195
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,930
Lin Xi Geng's performance for the past year is not bad, right?

196
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,229
He's better than that.

197
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,880
I'm not sure what I'll do without him.

198
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,619
I never heard from both of you so I thought you went abroad to study.

199
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:02,790
It's easy for you to study abroad with your GPA.

200
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:05,349
I'll wait for a while.

201
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,150
What for?

202
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,070
For someone to grow up.

203
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,229
A top student will still be

204
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,139
a top student even after repeating and dropping out.

205
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,619
Glad that you're aware of that.

206
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,920
My brother.

207
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,399
- A toast to you! Cheers!
- Cheers!

208
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:24,509
Nie Yue, a toast to you. Together!

209
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:26,519
- How about me?
- Cheers together.

210
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,039
- Join us!
- Here!

211
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,890
I have another suggestion.

212
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,410
The champion's future wife should give us a speech.

213
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:38,270
- Tell us the love story between you and Xu Fang.
- Yes, sister.

214
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,780
We don't know anything about you and Xu Fang.

215
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,680
Thank you for your support for Xu Fang.

216
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,189
That's such a formal statement.

217
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,070
Again!

218
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,460
Here's a serious one.

219
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,750
I would like to say something from the bottom of my heart.

220
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:10,300
Recently, I kept thinking about

221
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,880
my former self

222
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,500
and memories of the past.

223
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:24,280
We used to have laughter

224
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,260
and tears.

225
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:33,300
We had expectations and disappointment.

226
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:40,400
We gathered

227
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,540
and we parted.

228
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:50,740
But we never forget our resolution,

229
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,899
no matter what difficulties we faced.

230
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,119
Stand up! Stand right up!

231
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,780
I think that's how youth is supposed to be.

232
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,770
When we get old,

233
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:13,730
we will thank ourselves

234
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:16,460
for working hard in the past.

235
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,690
I think life is like archery.

236
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:28,570
A released arrow won't return.

237
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,690
So, we need to work hard,

238
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,690
to strive and become

239
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,710
the best of ourselves.

240
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,910
Because of that,

241
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,950
I got to meet

242
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:47,260
the best of everyone here.

243
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:50,259
A toast to the best of everyone here.

244
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,000
Cheers.

245
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,190
What a turn of events!

246
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:05,190
I can't get used to it.

247
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,810
[Xu Fang]

248
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:15,489
Hello, you're done?

249
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:17,020
Where are you?

250
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,790
Xu Fang.

251
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,359
Turn on the speaker. The speaker!

252
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:22,390
Speaker.

253
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,090
We are having roast duck.

254
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,469
You wanted to make me drool?

255
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,220
You know I can't eat it for a few days.

256
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,850
It's alright! I can eat your share.

257
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,420
I miss you.

258
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,300

I'll wait for you.

261
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,820
I want you to meet someone.

262
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,370
Who is it?

263
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,419
You'll know by then! At our hometown.

264
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,309
Sure! No problem! I'm going back soon anyway.

265
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,000
Remember to dress up properly and remember to bring the black box.

266
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,189
I'm not the one who's supposed to open the box?

267
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,690
It's for someone else?

268
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,090
What do you think?

269
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:19,959
Xu Fang, do you have to make me angry every day?

270
00:25:19,959 --> 00:25:22,349
All right, I'm hanging up!

271
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,439
Remember what I told you!

272
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,340
Bye-bye.

273
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:31,830
Who does he want me to meet? Why is he acting mysteriously?

274
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:35,890
I think there's something going on.

275
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:38,070
Mind your own business!

276
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:45,300
Let's have a toast since Xu Fang is not here.

277
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,399
Jiang Zheng Xu, what's wrong with you?

278
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:50,659
You know I can drink by looking at my cup.

279
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,720
- Sure! Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up!

280

281

Jiang Zheng Xu, come on!

282
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:08,930
- Jiang Zheng Xu, bottoms up!
- Jiang Zheng Xu, bottoms up!

283
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:11,379
Keep it up!

284
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,470
Almost there!

285
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,219
- You're great.
- Jiang Zheng Xu, how's that?

286
00:26:16,219 --> 00:26:18,270
You finished it?

287
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,900
Are you alright?

288
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,510
Slow down!

289
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,380
What's bothering you?

290
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,160
Should I wear this

291
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,590
or this?

292
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:58,260
Anything's fine as long as it's not mine.

293
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,830
This one! It shows your feminine side.

294
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,920
Who do you think he wants me to meet?

295
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,439
- His grandfather?
- How would I know?

296
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:17,520
Just be well-behaved.

297
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,869
All right, get out! I'm changing.

298
00:27:22,869 --> 00:27:25,749
- Return my apple.
- It's mine now.

299
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,830
What took you so long?

300
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,500
Why didn't you wait for me?

301
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,130
Why are you spacing out?

302
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,779
It's nothing.

303
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:29,040
I thought of the times when we used to prank here.

304
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,110
It feels just like yesterday.

305
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,910
Did you bring what I asked you to?

306
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:39,449
- Yes.
- Get on!

307
00:28:39,449 --> 00:28:42,719
- Where are we going?
- No questions asked!

Still remember this place?

310

It's been so long since we last went up.

311
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,190
Do you want to go up?

312
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:31,070
But there's a guard here.

313
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,590
It's still him on duty?

314

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,569
- The little black box.
- It's here.

333
00:31:17,569 --> 00:31:19,080
Take it out.

334
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,949
You're finally giving in,

335
00:31:20,949 --> 00:31:23,089
you're telling me the password, right?

336
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,970
That's impossible, of course.

337
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,990
Take a guess! You can ask for help.

338
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,019
I think it's 520. (T/N: in Chinese, the numbers 520 sound like the words I love you)

339
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,200
There are 4 numbers.

340
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,799
Chi-chi, 1314. (TN: sounds like the Chinese for the rest of my life/forever)

341
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,259
I tried it before.

342
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,019
I know! It's your ID. 9527.

343
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:46,869
- Yu Tong!
- Why do you know everything?

344
00:31:46,869 --> 00:31:48,490
You're doomed!

345
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,779
Chi-chi, 2046?

346
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:53,980
How could that be? That's way too stupid.

347
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,790
Sister, have you tried your QQ account password?

348
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:00,749
How about the very unusual QQ signature you used to have.

349
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:04,610
You used to tell me that your name sounds like a certain number.

350
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,460
Lin is zero.

351
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,850
Xi is seven. Chi is ten.

352
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,890
0710.

353
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:16,459
- It's open.
- It's open?

354
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,629
- You remembered this?
- You know your sister well.

355
00:32:20,629 --> 00:32:22,790
Of course!

356
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:32,379
Xu Fang, you really don't know me at all.

357
00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:34,569
This ring is not my size.

358
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:36,859
It's not for you.

359
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:38,900
It's for myself.

I finally understand after many years

397

that a wonderful relationship happens when we're young.

398
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,150
Good luck is when we are able

399
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:21,760
to be with the most important person even after we have grown up.

400
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,820
It's like holding hands

401
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:29,120
and never being separated from our childhood selves.

He just has to walk between us.

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,220
Slow down, slow down!

405
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,810
Fang Fang, go over there.

406
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,950
Fang Fang.

407
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:45,050
Fang Fang.

408
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,140
What's wrong?

409
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,200
You got hungry again?

410
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,600
Fang Fang, don't go too far.

411
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,340
He will come back later.

412
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,240
Say it! What do you want to eat?

413
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,480
This?

414
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,530
Not that.

415
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,800
I know what you want.

416
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,300
Is this the one?

417
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,320
Xu Fang.

418
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,820
Do you think I'm fictitious?

419
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,750
I'm wondering

420
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:19,450
if we do exist

421
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,510
in real life.

422
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,830
Is it possible that

423
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,090
we live in a drama

424
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:32,310
created by the scriptwriter?

425
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:42,400
Will you stop loving me

426
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,820
and leave me

427
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:47,100
when the drama ends?

428
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,060
Why would you think like this?

429
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:55,750
Because I am too happy.

430
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:59,220
Happiness makes me think

431
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,610
that something bad might happen next.

432
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:06,550
When did I deserve such happiness?

433
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,930
Chi-chi,

434
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:15,900
First of all, we do exist.

435
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,140
Our love is real as well.

436
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:24,620
We experienced many things and overcame many troubles.

437
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,870
You deserve this happiness.

438
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,720
You can see and touch happiness.

439
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,740
Chi-chi, I love you.

440
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,450
I love you, too.

441
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:00,270
Keep loving me even after the drama ends

442
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:05,619
Don't worry! I'll still love you after the drama ends.

443
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:19,979
[I will only deserve the best of you when I become the best of myself.]

[We hope everyone can be the best of himself.]
