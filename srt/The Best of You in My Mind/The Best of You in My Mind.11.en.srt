00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:06,460
♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

3
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,790
♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,260
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,880
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,530
♫ or pretend to be indifferent. ♫

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,920
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,590
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

9
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:32,530
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:39,500
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:46,510
♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

12
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:53,030
♫ Love is like a migratory bird waiting for the season. ♫

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:58,820
♫ How long does it take for them to be aware of each other? ♫

14
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,380
♫ You are like summer night, ♫

15
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:06,040
♫ I'm like a little star in the sky, ♫

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:13,020
♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

17
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,560
♫ Deliberately, I hit your shoulder, ♫

18
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,260
♫ and listen to your reprimand. ♫

19
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,690
♫ The caring feeling is so sweet! ♫

[Episode 11]

22
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,966
- Since Nie Yue is so busy, it's just us two now.
- Right.

23
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,470
- Is your hometown in Luo City, too?
- Yes.

24
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,746
- We can go home together during the New Year then.
- Sure!

25
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:59,286
I can't! I'm not going back this year, I'm staying here.

26
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,770
My brother and dad are coming here.

27
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,230
You're not going back? How about Xu Fang?

28
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,810
Him? I think he will go back.

29
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,910
- Why do you ask about him?
- Nothing! Just asking.

30
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:17,390
It's been a while since I met him because of my classes and my part-time job.

31
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,490
Have you made your decision?

32
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,330
We are going to the winter training soon.

33
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,030
You need to act soon with Lin Xichi.

34
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,940
What does it have to do with the training?

35
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:51,980
Brother, let me analyze it for you.

36
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,540
Look! Here in Rong City,

37
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,916
Ye Shaowen stays with Lin Xichi every day.

38
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,380
You don't even see her at all.

39
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,736
It's different back in Luo City where you have the "home" advantage.

40
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:07,116
You can put the familiar streets and memories to good use.

41
00:03:07,116 --> 00:03:10,340
The important thing is Ye Shaowen won't be there.

42
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,940
Isn't that great?

43
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,670
But I have winter training, I can't go back.

44
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,100
Then... Then you should do something before she leaves since you can't go back.

45
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:25,060
Tell her your feelings at least.

46
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,880
Give her a farewell hug or something.

47
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,540
Don't worry about me.

48
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,116
Nie Yue is going home soon, how about you?

49
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,120
I'm not you! Don't use me as a comparison.

50
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,020
Who am I?

51
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,340
Go for it!

52
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,540
Lin Xichi, I'm going to the winter training.

53
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,890
I can't go back home with you this time,

54
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:13,580
but I bought a ticket for you.

55
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,020
Don't fall asleep on the way.

56
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,840
Don't talk to strangers and

57
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,220
drink less water, so you don't go to the restroom too often.

58
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,640
Anyway...

59
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,520
This girl will surely sleep past her station.

61
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,210
Why are you here?

62
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,980
To send you off.

63
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,160
Here, get in.

64
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,980
Please.

65
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,500
I have the winter training this afternoon, so I won't be able to send you to the station.

66
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
I don't want you to.

67
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,300
Happy New Year!

68
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,200
It's still early.

69
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,496
Go on! To the train station, please.

70
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:29,780
- Alright.
- Thank you.

71
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,640
Then... see you next semester.

72

See you! Bye-bye.

That's it!

76
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,940
It's raining heavily but there's only an umbrella, how will I go back?

77
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,560
Why don't I send you back before I go back?

78
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,380

I heard from Chi-chi that your hometown is at Luo City, too.

00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,200
Initially, Chi-chi and I were going to go back together,

88
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,080
but she said she wouldn't go home this year.

89
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,100
She asked me to go with you, since you're going back, too.

90
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,500
I've never taken a train alone before.

91

- I'm scared, so...
- Hold on! I'll ask her.

Yes, I'm going to work at the pet shop.

How could you bathe them without tying them up?

Mom,

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,300
why do I feel that you never need me at all?

149
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,660
Is it because I'm not good enough?

150

I don't deserve your care?

She often couldn't see you for you're too busy.

159
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:59,180
I'm becoming farther and farther away from the archery team.

163
00:13:07,576 --> 00:13:09,780
- I think you and Lin Xichi would make a good couple.
- What?

164
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,800
- Xu Fang, what do you mean by that?
- Captain Fang, don't involve the innocent!

165
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,020
I wanted to find you...

166
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,916
I don't need your introductions! I want a boyfriend like Senior Ye.

167
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,200
Look at all your fat.

168
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,980
Don't tell Nie Yue about my fat!

169
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,400
A mug? It's a mug!

170
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,120
The first to get a boyfriend in our dorm is appearing.

171
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,940
- I wanted to find you...
- Didn't you want a relationship?

172
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,840
Let me introduce you to someone!

173
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,496
We're going to the winter training this afternoon, didn't you know?

174
00:14:02,496 --> 00:14:04,817
I'm becoming farther and farther away from the archery team.

175
00:14:04,817 --> 00:14:07,676
The dogs here are not your pets.

176
00:14:07,676 --> 00:14:10,860
How could you bathe them without tying them up?

177
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,880
Chi-chi,

178
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,620
I got a sudden notice to go on a business trip.

179
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,640
So I can't meet with you guys during the New Year.

180
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,840
Chi-chi, I have a surgery.

181
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,676
I need to go to the hospital tonight.

182
00:14:24,676 --> 00:14:27,140
Let's meet another day.

183
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,140
Who broke my mug?

184
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,720
Does everyone hate me?

185
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,300
Mom.

186
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,800
I still keep our old photos.

187
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,560
Hello.

188
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,540
Chi-chi, why are you here?

189
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,380
Is this your new husband and your new daughter?

190
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,920
Did you and Dad divorce already?

191
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:37,540
When did both of you do it?

192
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,040
Te-Ten years ago.

193
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,900
Ten years ago?

194
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,320
You told me you couldn't be with us because of work.

195
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,660
You asked me to take care of the family,

196
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,740
take care of Geng-geng and Dad.

197
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,200
You asked me to wait for you.

198
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,480
Listen to me! It's complicated.

199
00:17:12,036 --> 00:17:15,076
You already had a new family! You don't want us anymore!

200
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:18,616
No! That's not true. I-I...

201
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:21,096
I... I can explain it to you, okay?

202
00:17:21,096 --> 00:17:23,500
Why did you lie to me?

203
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,280
Why did you make me look like a fool?

204
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,920
Did you know that my biggest wish when I was little

205
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,840
was to live with you?

206
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,520
I know, I know.

207
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,800
I was still waiting for you to come back.

208
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,176
I was still waiting for you to come back!

209
00:17:45,176 --> 00:17:49,537
- Chi-chi, good girl! Listen to me.
- No, I'm not listening anymore.

210
00:17:49,537 --> 00:17:52,296
I... I know it's hard for you to understand right now.

211
00:17:52,296 --> 00:17:54,176
Let... Let me explain, all right?

212
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:56,656
You don't want us anymore!

213
00:17:56,656 --> 00:17:59,280
That... That's not true!

214
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,456
Because Geng-geng and I aren't good enough for you?

215
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,756
Not that, not that! You'll always be the best to me.

216
00:18:05,756 --> 00:18:07,796
Listen to me! Calm down, all right?

217
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:11,956
Who is she? Who are they?

218
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,020
They are better than me!

219
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,916
No, No! Chi-chi.

220
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,420
I...

221
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:13,080
Mom, do you remember... this is my birthday present that you gave me when I was a kid?

222
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,436
The day when you left, both of my front teeth fell out.

223
00:19:16,436 --> 00:19:19,860
I put them inside and always carry them around with me.

224
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,816
Slow down! Here!

225
00:20:12,816 --> 00:20:15,160
Pass it to the back.

226
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,756
Hello, Lin Xigeng.

227
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:19,236
Is this Xu Fang? This is Lin Xichi's father.

228
00:20:19,236 --> 00:20:22,516
- Is Chi-chi with you?
- Not really! What's wrong?

229
00:20:22,516 --> 00:20:25,537
So... something happened in our family.

230
00:20:25,537 --> 00:20:29,296
She's not picking up her phone and she's not at her dorm.

231
00:20:29,296 --> 00:20:32,460
I wanted to ask you if you know where she is.

232
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,076
Uncle, don't worry! I'll go and find her.

233
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:38,397
- What's up?
- Lin Xichi is missing! Tell the coach I'm leaving.

234
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,096
Well... You must find her!

235
00:20:45,096 --> 00:20:47,800
Tell her what you wanted to tell her!

236
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,960
- Mom.
- Good girl.

237
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,200
- Mom.
- Slow down, slow down.

238
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,396
Let's go!

239
00:22:58,396 --> 00:23:00,380
- Let's go home.
- Good girl.

240
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,996
- Mom, I'm hungry.
- You're hungry?

241
00:23:02,996 --> 00:23:04,616
- What do you want to eat?
- Meat.

242
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:07,120
Let's go and have something delicious.

I am dating a fool.

315
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:28,356

00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,560
They lied to me.

320
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:47,200
They lied to me for years.

321
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,900
They divorced years ago.

322
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,196
Divorced... Divorced years ago.

323
00:28:55,196 --> 00:28:57,116

♫ Not so difficult! ♫

414
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:53,600
♫ Making a choice is not so difficult. ♫

415
00:36:53,600 --> 00:37:00,120
♫ It’s all warm and scattered expectations. ♫

♫ Nothing more than day and night mediocre bravery. ♫

419

♫ People hesitate so they've missed many fulfillment, ♫

420

♫ always at a loss and in a hurry but feel terribly upset. ♫

♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫

♫ A smile is really not that difficult. ♫

♫ How could the regret of the past represent today? ♫

♫ It's actually not that difficult. ♫
