00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,380
♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

3
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,790
♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:13,290
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,990
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:20,560
♫ or pretend to be indifferent. ♫

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,840
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,580
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

9
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:32,590
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:39,460
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:46,520
♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,040
♫ Love is like a migratory bird waiting for the season. ♫

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,930
♫ How long does it take for them to be aware of each other? ♫

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:02,450
♫ You are like summer night, ♫

15
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,980
♫ I'm like a little star in the sky, ♫

16
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:13,110
♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

17
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,570
♫ Deliberately, I hit your shoulder, ♫

18
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,270
♫ and listen to your reprimand. ♫

19
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,750
♫ The caring feeling is so sweet! ♫

22
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,639
- Put this towel on your forehead.
- But I use it to wipe my feet.

23
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:42,980
You're dying, stop minding such a petty thing.

24
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,559
- Fine!
- Where are the test results?

25
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:48,430
On the table.

26
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:54,199
Even if you see then, can you understand?

27
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,540
High white blood cell count.

28
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,439
- You're something! Did you learn it?
- You have inflammation.

29
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,100
In my bag.

30
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,740
My phone! Get it for me.

31
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,520
Here you go.

32
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,830
Why don't you pick it up?

33
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,640
Don't tell him I've fallen sick!

34
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,860
Sure, got it.

35
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:36,076
Why didn't you pick up my call?

36
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:38,580
I came home late because I was working overtime today.

37
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,700
Your voice's very nasal, do you catch cold?

38
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,700
Lin Xigeng came today.

39
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,580
Brother Fang, my sister's fine.

40
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,999
- He even came to visit you and you lied that you didn't fall sick.
- No.

41
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,110
I simply got caught in the rain today.

42
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,560
Once I hang up, I'll go to bed. I'll be fine afterward.

43
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,169
Why do you act like a radar? I can't hide anything from you at all.

44
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:05,629
Since you know it's hard to hide things from me, then don't do it again.

45
00:03:05,629 --> 00:03:08,050
Brother Fang, don't worry! I'll take care of my sister.

46
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,270
How are you doing? Have you been eating well?

47
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,430
Let's not talk about it.

48
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,689
It's either salad or hamburger.

49
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:20,470
I'm sick of eating spaghetti and barbecue.

50
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:23,030
But the air here is not bad.

51
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,370
I'm glad that you're doing well.

52
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,130
Lin Xigeng, take good care of your sister.

53
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:31,469
I'm closer to her than you, right? Seriously!

54
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:34,930
If she remains single, I'd be doomed.

55
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,729
Okay, I got to go, I'm hanging up! Bye-bye.

56
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:49,790
I'll call mom later.

57
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,049
I'm a veterinary, I know what to do.

58
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:56,530
Stop being stubborn!

59
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,210
Don't tell mom.

60
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:04,209
Go to sleep! You might get well afterward.

61
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,809
- Hello, I'd like to send a parcel.
- Hello.

62
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,210
Please fill in the form.

63
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,810
Here you go.

64
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,210
Ninety-eight yuan. Please keep this!

65
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,610
Here you go.

66
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,270
Hello, Sister.

67
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,150
- It's settled.
- Got it.

68
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,089
Call mom when you have time, she's quite worried about you.

69
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,709
I'm hanging up. Rest well!

70
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,489
Yue-yue, your uncle Wang is offering a position that's suitable for you.

71
00:05:28,489 --> 00:05:31,699
- You should try it.
- Dad, mom! Can you stop making arrangements for me?

72
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,970
I said I have my own plan!

73
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:37,729
I'm calling you because I want to discuss something with you.

74
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:40,069
- What is it?
- I want to start a business.

75
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:41,950
I want to open my own shop.

76
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,150
Please lend me some money.

77
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,309
Nonsense! Did Jiang Zhengxu encourage you?

78
00:05:47,309 --> 00:05:49,919
Ever since you got together with him, you haven't come home during the holidays.

79
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,059
You haven't done well in your study or your job.

80
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:54,869
- I don't know what you want to do.
- I said he had nothing to do with this!

81
00:05:54,869 --> 00:05:57,969
Why do you always act like this? Why are you being such narrow-minded?

82
00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:01,470
Yue-yue, how could you talk to your father this way?

83
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:04,329
I need to go now. I'm hanging up. Goodbye.

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:28,390
Hello, who is this?

87
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:30,350
Is this Jiang Zhengxu?

88
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:32,530
This is Nie Yue's father.

89
00:06:38,090 --> 00:06:40,810
Why did you ask for money from your father?

90
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,049
Answer me! Why did you ask for money from your father?

91
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:48,049
I've told you so many times that I can earn money!

92
00:06:48,049 --> 00:06:50,620
I can pay off the debt!

93
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,590
There's no way you're paying it off for me!

94
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:58,530
I'm sorry for not discussing it with you.

95
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,250
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,990
I... I'm afraid your parents will look down on me.

97
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:13,110
They won't.

98
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,520
Actually, I want to buy this shop.

99
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,859
In this shop, I want to open an archery club and combine it with a cafe.

100
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:23,259
You've been working in a cafe for so long, you can definitely do it.

101
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:26,099
And you see, it's such a good location.

102
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,499
If we open an archery club and if it does well, we'll offer classes for kids.

103
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:33,359
By then, you can hire Yao Wang and Yu Tong to help out here.

104
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:36,760
And I'll be your lady boss and the cashier.

105
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:41,700
You can play archery and pay off the debt at the same time.

106
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,140
You asked for money from your father because of this?

107
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,579
How does that sound? It's a good plan, isn't it?

108
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,100
Not bad!

109
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,380
What's wrong?

110
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,669
You're too touched to speak?

111
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:14,919
- Are you crying?
- No.

112
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:16,900
Let me see!

113
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,660
No, I...

114
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,460
It's just that I no longer want to ask for money from my family.

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,300
I can give you a better life, I can earn money.

116
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,420
But I don't want you to suffer.

117
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,000
A man isn't a man if he can't endure hardships.

118
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,600
Am I right?

119
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,340
I promise you, three years!

120
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,440
Give me three years.

121
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,620
I'll pay off the debt

122
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,580
and marry you.

123
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,680
It seems that I need to help you earn money.

124
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,280
We'll be fine.

125
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,980
We'll be fine.

126
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,660
Don't worry, we'll be fine!

127
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,020
We'll be fine.

128
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,980
We'll become very rich in the future.

129
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,560
Chi-chi, have you ever thought about

130
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,340
how your mother would live her whole life?

131
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,090
If...

132
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,420
your parents were to get together because of you two

133
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,400
without loving each other,

134
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,740
you'd be happy.

135
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,300
But what about her happiness?

136
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,820
Who would accept her way of life?

137
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,700
Who would comfort her if she's not happy?

138
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,540
Actually, selfishness and selflessness are all one's doing.

139
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,920
Asking others to be selfless is to turn oneself into a selfish person.

140
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,760
Don't force yourself or others.

141
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,180
Spare yourself and others.

142
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,560
Chi-chi.

143
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,880
I wish you'd live a happy life.

144
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,080
Just like how you were in the past.

145
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:23,120
- Chi-chi.
- Mom,

146
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,120
I'm thinking of seeing you? Is that okay?

147
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,340
Of course, you can! Should we meet at that cafe?

148
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:33,820
Why did you enter my room?

149
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,100
I'm telling you, don't touch my stuff!

150
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,020
This is the last warning!

151
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,500
Chi-chi, I can't talk now.

152
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,239
Let's talk later, okay?

153
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:04,499
Mom, I want to visit you at your place.

154
00:12:04,499 --> 00:12:06,440
What?

155
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,740
I want to go to your house.

156
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,679
and eat my favorite spicy chicken. Can I?

157
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:15,780
It's been so long since you cooked for me.

158
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,600
Sure!

159
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,440
You can come later then.

160
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,380
You should come out for some fresh air.

161
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,860
I need to find you a new home. Let's go.

162
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,280
Let's go!

163
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,339
Chi-chi, stop working. We're having dinner soon.

164
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,840
They're all your favorite dishes.

165
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:45,199
Ding-ding, don't be afraid! She's not an outsider.

166
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,239
You should just mind your daughter! Leave me alone!

167
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,480
Chen Ding and I met before.

168
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,720
Let me talk to her.

169
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,660
Don't worry!

170
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,900
Chen Ding, it's me.

171
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,260
I know you're not willing to be my friend.

172
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,260
That's why I brought you another friend.

173
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,700
Its name is Little Watermelon.

174
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,140
It doesn't like going out, either.

175
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,960
I don't know how to deal with it at all.

176
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:46,480
But I'm sure you can.

177
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,140
I'll leave Little Watermelon at your door.

178
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,560
Go away!

179
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,640
Let's eat first!

180
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,860
When did you meet Chen Ding?

181
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,450
Chen Ding gave me harassing phone calls every day.

182
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,959
She also did many childish things and even invited me for a fight.

183
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,739
Both of us had a big fight at Rong University.

184
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:31,420
Then you...

185
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,460
I was teasing you.

186
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,680
Silly kid!

187
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,539
Chen Ding is different from other kids.

188
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:43,780
I'll talk to her later.

189
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,500
Mom.

190
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,900
Both of you will get along well.

191
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,760
This chili is quite spicy.

192
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,160
Slow down! They're all your favorite dishes.

193
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,559
Here! Have some vegetables.

194
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,000
Here you go! Look at how skinny you are.

195
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:06,400
I didn't find you handsome when you're small.

196
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,320
But now, I even can't take my eyes off you.

197
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Don't disturb me, I'm working!

198
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,520
I've never met such a serious intern like you.

199
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,400
I'm examining the infected cat with feline distemper from yesterday.

200
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,599
Its PCR test result isn't that good.

201
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:45,480
I don't know how it's doing.

202
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,119
This hospital doesn't care about lives! They killed my cat!

203
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,480
- What's up?
- My cat is my daughter!

204
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,199
It's this hospital! Come and check out this unethical hospital!

205
00:17:56,199 --> 00:17:59,540
- Calm down first!
- What will I do?

206
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:02,310
- I'll take a look at it.
- It's you!

207
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,139
It's you! You gave it the injection.

208
00:18:05,139 --> 00:18:07,179
You said to feed it, didn't you?

209
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:09,579
- I remember it's you!
- I told you not to feed it.

210
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,839
You... Now, it's dead! I spent so much money but you didn't heal it!

211
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:16,240
- Calm yourself down first.
- Tell me, what will I do?

212
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,799
I want to file a complaint against you! What's your name? Intern?

213
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,480
- My name is Lin Xichi.
- You're just an intern!

214
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,400
What right did you have to examine my cat?

215
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,199
I want my daughter back! You're so outrageous!

216
00:18:29,199 --> 00:18:33,640
I want my daughter back! What will I do now?

217
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,339
Now, it's lying here! It can't see me anymore!

218
00:18:37,339 --> 00:18:39,420
I want my daughter back!

219
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:43,139
There, calm yourself down, tell me anything you want.

220
00:18:43,139 --> 00:18:46,319
I am the chief physician of this hospital, my surname is Li.

221
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,180
I am also Dr. Xiao Lin's immediate superior.

222
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:52,460
- You're here to defend her, aren't you?
- Don't worry, I won't!

223
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,039
First of all, we're deeply sorry for the death of your beloved cat.

224
00:18:56,039 --> 00:18:59,770
We are upset, too, but I just looked into it.

225
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:02,510
This is a viral feline distemper case.

226
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:05,300
A test-paper detection was done for preliminary screening only.

227
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,750
The white blood cell count was only 0.2.

228
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:11,879
The fever kept coming back and the virus developed too quickly.

229
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:15,640
The younger the pet is, the higher the fatality rate is.

230
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,919
What you just said might be true but she doesn't have the right to be a doctor!

231
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,099
Dr. Lin studied medicine for five years.

232
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:28,119
In our hospital, she has the right to assist the chief physician by performing treatments.

233
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:32,859
Her diagnosis is reasonable, if I were her, I would do the same thing.

234
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,589
You just don't care about lives! What are you looking at?

235
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,860
Here, have some water!

236
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,160
I'm fine.

237
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,060
You're shocked just now, aren't you?

238
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,480
I didn't think it would die that soon.

239
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,300
I even thought that a few injections

240
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,360
or a hospital admission would cure it.

241
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,340
I shouldn't have let the owner take it home.

242
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,960
Viral complications and sudden deaths of animals

243
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,600
can be unpredictable.

244
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,500
As a doctor,

245
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:25,600
the least we can do is to prevent them from happening.

246
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,180
I'm not a doctor.

247
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,660
I find myself very useless.

248
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,860
When I was an intern

249
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,950
and faced this kind of problem for the first time,

250
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:42,020
I felt as guilty and anxious as you.

251
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:47,240
I thought those owners didn't understand us and I felt upset.

252
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,400
But there are many small animals which we treated successfully.

253
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,080
Seeing their liveliness and their owners' smiles of gratitude

254
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,159
made me feel so gratified and proud.

255
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:05,080
At the same time, I realized my responsibility as a doctor.

256
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,770
Don't burden yourself because of this incident.

257
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,330
You must have faith in yourself.

258
00:21:10,339 --> 00:21:14,719
Your diagnosis and the way you handled it were all appropriate.

259
00:21:14,719 --> 00:21:16,320
Really?

260
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,360
You're a doctor.

261
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,960
You have to be kind and determined,

262
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,060
so that the animals that need you can count on you.

263
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,530
You can do it.

264
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:35,420
Thank you, Chief Li.

265
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,560
Aren't we supposed to have a video call at eight every night?

266
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,830
It's late now, why didn't you answer my calls?

267
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,300
Today, Yu Ni told me that there was a robbery nearby where she lives.

268
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,559
She got so scared and couldn't stop talking about it.

269
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:43,539
It's dark out there, can't you come home early next time?

270
00:22:43,539 --> 00:22:46,140
Got it! I'll do so tomorrow.

271
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,479
I'm telling you! Today, I taught a few foreign team members to speak Chinese.

272
00:22:52,479 --> 00:22:54,220
What did you teach them?

273
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,719
The eight hundred fuglemen run to the north slope. The artillerymen stand abreast and run to the north.
(Chinese tongue-twister)

274
00:22:58,719 --> 00:23:02,159
The artillerymen are scared of being touched by the fuglemen. The fuglemen are scared of being attacked by the art.
(Chinese tongue-twister)

275
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,520
What do you think?

276
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,450
Look at this! It's a foreign snack.

277
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:10,750
It tastes so good! I'll bring you some when I come back.

278
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:12,380
Xu Fang.

279
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,220
I'm not in a good mood.

280
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,620
I know!

281
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,980
If not, I wouldn't be saying these trivial things, what's happened?

282
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,910
A kitten came to the hospital today.

283
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,730
It was infected with feline distemper.

284
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,920
But it died already.

285
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,500
I was the one who handled the case.

286
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:38,219
It was fine when it came to the hospital, but it went home and died the next day.

287
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,020
The owner wasn't happy about it?

288
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:46,880
But it's settled now.

289
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,900
The chief physician even boosted my morale.

290
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,940
Then what are you upset about?

291
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,190
I don't know, either.

292
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:00,320
Initially, I was fine.

293
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,220
But talking to you has reminded me of it.

294
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:08,779
What are you laughing for? Why aren't you saying something?

295
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:10,800
I'm waiting for you to stop crying.

296
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,720
I'm done upsetting.

297
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,039
Let's do this instead! Just resign.

298
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:23,660
I'll go back and beat that cat owner up.

299
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,630
No way! I love this job.

300
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,260
I want to keep doing it.

301
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,570
What if you're scolded by someone else next time?

302
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:36,879
Do that if they want to but they still have to be reasonable after scolding me.

303
00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:39,739
Moreover, I'm not the only one working in the hospital.

304
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,619
There are many doctors and nurses, and our chief physician.

305
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,910
That's good!

306
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,340
What about you? How's your training going?

307
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,360
I'm still the same but since you've been working so hard,

308
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,879
I have no reason to give up on myself.

309
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,030
I want...

310
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:08,600
to be a successful and respectable doctor.

311
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
What are you laughing about this time?

312
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,820
Nothing!

313
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:19,219
I think you've become much mature even though I'm not with you.

314
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:23,539
Of course! When I'm with you, I don't need to use my brain at all.

315
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:27,799
I just need to deal with you using the intelligence of a nine-year-old.

316
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:32,200
Since you're not here with me, my intelligence has been improving.

317
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,520
And my head has become bigger.

318
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,620
Look at my head! Is it bigger?

319
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:43,219
You don't have to worry about the rain because you're big-headed, you don't even need an umbrella.

320
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,830
Okay, it's late! We'll talk next time.

321
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,770
Go to bed early! Bye-bye.

322
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,160
Goodnight!

323
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,060
The noodle's burned, why didn't you call me?

324
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:10,379
Today, Yu Ni told me that there was a robbery nearby where she lives.

325
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,940
She got so scared and couldn't stop talking about it.

326
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:36,059
Ding-ding, you're home at the right time. Go wash your hands, and then have dinner!

327
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm not hungry.

328
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,520
Where's my tortoise?

329
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,000
Little Watermelon?

330
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,980
Little Watermelon?

331
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,440
You touched my tortoise?

332
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,490
I didn't! I fed it once today.

333
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,790
Didn't you ask me to do so? What's wrong?

334
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,400
It's missing!

335
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,079
That's impossible! It was there when I went in this afternoon.

336
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:31,379
That's strange! This...

337
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,850
You opened the window?

338
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,359
I noticed you never opened the window so I was thinking of airing your room.

339
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,170
Don't enter my bedroom again!

340
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:42,260
Did it fall down there?

341
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:53,450
Little Watermelon!

342
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,520
Little Watermelon!

343
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,900
Little Watermelon!

344
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,359
Little Watermelon, where are you?

345
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,540
My Little Watermelon is gone!

346
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:15,280
Little Watermelon! Come out!

347
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,899
Ding-ding! Ding-ding, it's here!

348
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,179
It fell down from up there. Is he...

349
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,940
Ding-ding!

350
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,859
Hello, I'd like to see Dr. Lin, Lin Xichi.

351
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:38,020
Okay, don't panic! Dr. Lin.

352
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,820
Don't panic!

353
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,080
Little Watermelon fell down from the upper floor.

354
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,300
Please help me examine it.

355
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,440
Don't panic! Get it a check-up first.

356
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,840
Okay.

357
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,230
How did it happen?

358
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,060
It's all my fault! She went to school during the daytime

359
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,420
so I decided to open the window and air her room.

360
00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:05,980
I didn't know the tortoise climbed up there and fell down.

361
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,600
It'll be fine. Every tortoise has a shell.

362
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,119
As long as the shell isn't broken, its organs aren't injured and there's no bone fracture, it'll be fine.

363
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,160
Then can I see it?

364
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,720
Go in now!

365
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,219
You two still don't get along well?

366
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,020
It's not so bad.

367
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:46,700
I'll treat her to a meal later and I'll talk to her.

368
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,800
Okay, that will be great!

369
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,539
Actually, she didn't open the window on purpose.

370
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,060
She did.

371
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,120
How about installing a window screen?

372
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,969
It's safer and helps to air your room, and the sunlight can get into your room.

373
00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:14,380
It's good for you and Little Watermelon.

374
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,359
I heard you'd been writing your thesis, how's it going?

375
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:29,710
It's okay! The result isn't the most important thing.

376
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,740
but the process is.

377
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:36,939
You just need to do your best and enjoy your life.

378
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,379
Let go of the past and don't be afraid of the future.

379
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,260
That's the highest state of life.

380
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,860
Look at how happy you are!

381
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,230
If you have things you don't want to tell anyone,

382
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:52,170
you can tell them to Little Watermelon, it's very understanding.

383
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:56,240
Really? Little Watermelon can understand what I say?

384
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,179
Of course! You see, it always lies there without moving.

385
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:03,960
It's because it pays attention to what you say and forgets to move.

386
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,440
Thank you.

387
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,300
Try this, it tastes good!

388
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,560
Thank you.

389
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,580
I also want to thank you for gifting me Little Watermelon.

390
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:28,060
By the way, for this Mid-Autumn Festival,

391
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:31,500
you and Lin Xigeng should celebrate it at my place.

392
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,839
How are you, Brother? Have you missed me?

393
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,860
How are you doing recently?

394
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,279
You've become darker!

395
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,940
- Is it the sun—
- Coach!

396
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,220
Could you show me the movement again?

397
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:40,919
Sure! Practice by yourself first, coach has some business to do.

398
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:43,340
- I'll teach you later, okay?
- Sure.

399
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,940
Go back there!

400
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,280
Where are you now?

401
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:53,140
I spend my nights at the archery club teaching kids archery.

402
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,759
Look! Look at these naughty kids. Look!

403
00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:00,700
What do you think? Does it remind you of our childhood?

404
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:04,759
I'm telling you! I have a clear goal now.

405
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:07,660
I just want to earn money and pay off the debt.

406
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:10,879
Then I'll set up an archery club and start a business with Nie Yue.

407
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:15,259
I've planned it all out! I'll cover the wall with our posters.

408
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,759
Your photo will be placed at the center. Yes! at the center.

409
00:33:18,759 --> 00:33:22,460
What say you? It's a good idea, isn't it?

410
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:25,740
You... Are you that touched?

411
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,580
What's the matter with you? You're really crying?

412
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:35,560
Wait! Why did you become so sentimental after going abroad? What's happened?

413
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,260
I want to go back.

414
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,580
Are you recovered?

415
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,920
No, you can't come back if you're not recovered.

416
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:47,159
Get yourself cured! Once you get well, you can come back.

417
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,740
Lin Xichi needs me

418
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,920
but I can't protect her.

419
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,220
Lin Xichi? What's wrong with her?

420
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,780
There was a robbery nearby the pet shop she works at.

421
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,520
I'm worried about her.

422
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,100
She lives outside all by herself.

423
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,260
When she was sick, I wasn't by her side.

424
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,540
I don't think I'm a good boyfriend.

425
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:17,179
Brother, just focus on getting recovered.

426
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:19,080
I'll take care of everything.

427
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,900
Stop crying!

428
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,960
Stop it now. What's wrong with you?

429
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,170
You're a man!

430
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:31,609
I'll deal with everything here, just tell me if you need any help.

431
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:35,180
I'll see after it. Enough already!

432
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,080
Look at these kids!

433
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,320
I'm telling you!

434
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,920
They are doing a better job, they're far better than us.

435
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,479
Look at them! They're more skilled than you.

436
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,180
Enough, stop being upset! I'll wait for you to come back.

437
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,320
See you tomorrow then.

438
