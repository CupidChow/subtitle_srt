♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:09,800
♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,178
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

5
00:00:13,178 --> 00:00:17,040
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,600
♫ or pretend to be indifferent. ♫

7
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,869
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:27,600
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,440
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:39,480
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,465
♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out. ♫

12
00:00:46,465 --> 00:00:53,000
♫ Love is like a migratory bird waiting for the season. ♫

♫ I'm like a little star in the sky, ♫

00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:13,091
♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

17

♫ Deliberately, I hit your shoulder, ♫

18
00:01:16,612 --> 00:01:21,231
♫ and listen to your reprimand. ♫

[Episode 12]

22
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,216
Sister, you finally picked up my call,

23
00:01:54,216 --> 00:01:57,020
do you know I was so worried about you?

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,036
Were you drinking with Brother Fang last night?

25
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:02,200
Drink what?

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,395
- How did you know?
- I heard you when he called me last night.

27
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:14,959
Sister, were you drunk?

28
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,019
Is Brother Fang alright?

29
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:23,516
- He...
- You're so scary when you're drunk.

30
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:27,340
You brat! I'm a gentle person.

31
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,520
Stop lying to yourself.

32
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,459
What happened to you yesterday?

33
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:35,455
I asked dad but he refused to tell me.

34
00:02:35,455 --> 00:02:37,179
Nothing,

35
00:02:37,179 --> 00:02:41,099
I just had a small row with a classmate.

36
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:43,336
I thought it was something serious.

37
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:45,215
I was so worried about you.

38
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:48,335
You're a big girl! You have to learn how to forgive.

39
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:52,200
I see, you're also a big boy who is lecturing me.

40
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,479
So, when are you coming back?

41
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,079
Ms. He said her daughter He Li Yang's back.

42
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,060
You're all-knowing.

43
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,660
It's a long story.

44
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,616
Did you know? Dad said...

45
00:03:07,616 --> 00:03:10,999
we're not celebrating New Year in Rong City.

46
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:12,960
It's because mom is on a business trip.

47
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,520
You should come back with Brother Fang.

48
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,160
Where's he?

49
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,796
- I'll hang up now.
- Sister, wait!

50
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:53,119
Lin Xichi.

51
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,839
Where are you going?

52
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:01,236
I'm not going anywhere.

53
00:04:01,236 --> 00:04:04,360
I want to wait for you here.

54
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,135
You're brushing your teeth? I'll wait for you in my room.

55
00:04:12,499 --> 00:04:14,620
Do you still have a headache?

56
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:21,835
- No, it isn't hurt.
- Then, I'll get changed. Let's eat something!

57
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:31,819
Wait for me!

58
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:56,235
- Geng-Geng.
- Mom.

59
00:04:56,235 --> 00:04:58,276
Dad asked me to tell you that my sister's alright.

60
00:04:58,276 --> 00:05:00,359
So, don't worry about her.

61
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:03,880
Xu Fang was with her for the whole night.

62
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,760
That's great!

63
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,740
How's your preparation for the exam going lately?

64
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,859
- Do you care?
- Of course, I care about you.

65
00:05:12,859 --> 00:05:17,400
Mom, you don't need to treat me like my sister.

66
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,739
When I was small, I used to look forward to you coming back home.

67
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:25,800
But when you stopped coming home so often,

68
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,660
I stopped looking forward to it.

69
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,880
If I didn't wish for it, I wouldn't get disappointed.

70
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,560
I... I... Actually, I let go a long time ago

71
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,519
what happened between you and dad.

72
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,240
I won't blame you or him.

73
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,779
I just want to say that I'll protect my sister.

74
00:05:47,779 --> 00:05:50,540
Neither of you can hurt her.

75
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,459
I'll hang up now.

76
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:23,056
You said someone broke your mug.

77
00:06:23,056 --> 00:06:25,000
Do you know who did it?

78
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,400
Someone might have broken it accidentally.

79
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,140
Your roommate with whom you attend the English class.

80
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:42,400
Yesterday, she told me that you asked her to go home with me.

81
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,360
I didn't.

82
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:47,079
Anyway, I ignored her.

83
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,980
Could it be her who broke it?

84
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,320
Enjoy your food!

85
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:02,016
Beef bowl! The marbled beef along with the perfect sauce.

86
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:05,660
It's definitely a first-class beef bowl.

87
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:09,160
You're also a first-class foodie.

88
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,000
It smells so good.

89
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,039
So, what will you do about it?

90
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,800
I can't do anything without evidence.

91
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,120
Then, you should break hers, too.

92
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,179
I dare not do that.

93
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,676
You're Big Chi! Of course, you can break it.

94
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:29,256
You dared to bully me after all, why are you being a coward when it comes to her?

95
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:32,339
I'm not being a coward!

96
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:34,837
Which one should we break? There is a pink mug and a white one.

97
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:36,420
Whatever!

98
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,200
Don't pull a long face or sigh while you're eating.

99
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,800
Xu Fang,

100
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:55,680
if you were a dog

101
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,640
that was abandoned by your owner

102
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,400
who told you that she loved and

103
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,460
missed you so much.

104
00:08:06,099 --> 00:08:10,319
And she promised to come back.

105
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,600
Everyday, you would stand on a high ground

106
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,720
and look forward to her coming back.

107
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,820
You'd do anything to make her happy.

108
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,539
You were an obedient dog who liked her very much.

109
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,720
You even entered the same profession

110
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,819
and university as hers.

111
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:37,200
That sounds good!

112
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,319
But one day, you found out that

113
00:08:43,319 --> 00:08:45,960
she'd long abandoned you.

114
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,580
And she even got herself a new dog.

115
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:53,620
She probably didn't want to upset you.

116
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,780
That's why she didn't tell you that.

117
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,219
But I don't understand.

118
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,159
Although you've told me that

119
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:10,060
they'd eventually separate

120
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,420
and my father might get a new girlfriend,

121
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,219
I still felt afraid of losing my family.

122
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,359
I never thought that would happen.

123
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:30,999
If that dog was to become homeless,

124
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,400
I'd take it in.

125
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,019
I can make her feel special.

126
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,200
Let's eat!

127
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,520
We're going home this afternoon.

128
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,315
I don't know where I want to go.

129
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:03,050
I just don't want to go back to my father's.

130
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:05,580
Then, we'll go to your grandfather's.

131

Xu Fang,

132
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,959
I want to be a swan.

133
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,360
A beautiful white swan.

134
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,559
Swans are the most loyal animal.

135
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:37,220
They love their loved ones forever,

136
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,360
until they die.

137
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,379
But you look like a duck.

138
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:47,355
Hi, here's your free dessert. Please enjoy it!

139
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:51,236
Didn't you time this at the right moment? Are you a crew member of some prank show?

140
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:53,260
Your director asked you to send me this?

141
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,520
Thank you! I'm sorry.

142
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,275
- I'm off now.
- Where are you going?

143
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:04,995
- Pet shop.
- Fine, call me later! I'll wait for you at the entrance of your hostel.

Senior Ye.

146
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,435
What are you doing here? Isn't your day off?

147
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,959
I'll go home soon.

148
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,039
I'm here to apply for leave.

149
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:32,339
And I've missed them.

150
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,959
Go home? You're not staying here for the New Year?

151
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,280
Did something happen?

152
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:55,359
Nothing!

153
00:12:04,659 --> 00:12:06,439
Have you made up your mind?

154
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,740
What?

155
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,740
Are you really going to your grandfather's?

156
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,579
Since we'll see each other during the New Year,

157
00:12:16,579 --> 00:12:19,140
why don't you stay at my place?

158
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,630
That's no different from going back to mine.

159
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,995
Do you remember? When you were small, you fought with your father and stayed at my place.

160
00:12:27,995 --> 00:12:32,236
And someone knocked on my door at midnight, you thought that it was your brother.

161
00:12:32,236 --> 00:12:34,080
But it was Fang Fang.

162
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:37,519
I do remember that.

163
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,080
So, you're really not going home?

00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,056
You couldn't even walk away from those puppies in the pet shop.

Why are you doing otherwise to Fang Fang?

166
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,380
Oh yeah, weren't you supposed to attend training?

I've asked Jiang Zheng Xu to apply for leave, I'll go back in a few days.

- Thank you, Xu Fang.
- No problem!

201
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,899
I have something to tell both of you.

202

Go ahead, I'm listening!

203
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:48,739
Your mother and I have divorced.

204
00:15:53,219 --> 00:15:55,620
We didn't tell you

205
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,500
because, at the time, you were both still small.

206
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,000
We didn't want to bother you with what happened between us adults.

207
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,920
We didn't want to upset you and affect your studies.

208
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,376
So, we decided to wait until you grew up

209
00:16:09,376 --> 00:16:12,379
and found the right time to tell you.

210
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,340
Do you think now is the right time?

211
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,899
You both should know that no matter what happens,

212
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,755
we still care about you the most.

213

But you lied to us!

214
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,860
Yes, we did lie to you.

215
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:34,696
But we're trying to minimize the damage.

216
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:38,259
We wanted to protect you from any harm

217

as much as we could.

218
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:48,240
So, you think telling us now won't do us any harm?

230

They wanted to be loved and cared.

237
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:05,259
I didn't want you to become like them.

238
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:07,639
That's why I lied to you.

239

Your mother and I,

240
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:16,460
we have tried our best.

241
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,519

245
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:50,230
this conversation won't affect your lives or studies.

259
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,680
What?

260
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,780
About what dad said yesterday.

261
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,579
I've forgotten that.

262
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,719
Then, that's such a relief!

263
00:21:04,719 --> 00:21:06,836
I was so worried about you.

264
00:21:06,836 --> 00:21:11,520
I was afraid you'd be very upset about it.

265
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,479
But it seems that you're quite strong.

266
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,499
You're worried about me?

267
00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:23,619
Yes.

268
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:26,499

269
00:21:26,499 --> 00:21:29,319
they never stop loving us.

270
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:32,879
You knew about the divorce all this time?

271
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:38,759
I...

272
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:40,660
knew...

273
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,800
I did not know...

274
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,380
You brought the motorbike back here?

275
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,840
I didn't want to leave it at Rong City.

276
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,480

278
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:06,819
You've answered them all?

279
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:09,980
There's nothing to do during the holiday.

280
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,199
This one... I saved this question for you.

281
00:23:17,199 --> 00:23:20,475
Didn't you call yourself a top student? Solve it and explain the answer to me.

282
00:23:20,475 --> 00:23:24,579
Stop pretending! You can't solve it, can you?

283
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:27,720
But it's the final question from the previous year exam.

284
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,439
It's unusually hard, so it's normal if you can't solve it.

285
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:35,316
I should be able to solve it, I'm unusually smart after all.

286
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,860
Look! Here's the solution to this question.

287
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:43,360
First, you need to find out the gradient.

288
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,479
Then, use this formula to find out the maxima and minima.

289
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:49,439
Get it?

290
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:53,300
This... Can you explain it again? I...

291
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:55,020
I'm talking to you in Mandarin.

292
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,080
I... I didn't get it.

293
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,579
Listen carefully! First, you need to find out the gradient.

294
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:08,260
Then, use this formula to find out the maxima and minima.

295
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:12,480
- Get it?
- So, it was like that?

296
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,556
Give me that! I'll solve it.

297
00:24:18,819 --> 00:24:21,855
It's a hard question but I only explained it twice.

298
00:24:21,855 --> 00:24:26,760
You're no longer that wimpy kid who fought with me at the cafe.

299
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,080
Did you just call me a wimpy kid?

00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:45,319
Yeah! And I found I don't hate Demon He as much as I used to.

304
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,160
- What?
- Please respect my mother.

305
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:54,977
Since you're rebellious, I think you don't like your old-fashioned mother.

306
00:24:54,977 --> 00:24:57,480
It's okay, we're all the same.

307
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,500
Didn't you say you'd give me another exercise book?

308
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,878
Is she really mad at me?

00:26:54,736 --> 00:26:56,679
I was afraid you'd kill yourself.

326
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:58,880
What if you really did that?

327
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,639
Kiddo, that's just an ordinary road, not a highway.

328
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:06,299
You ride on highways, too?

329
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:12,339
I'm sure you ride your motorbike as fast as lightning on highways.

330
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,500
Does it feel good?

331
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,739
How should I put it?

332
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:24,159
Once you feel the freedom

333
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,639
of riding a motorbike,

334
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,479
you won't give up on it.

335
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,639
I'm not trying to annoy you.

336
00:27:35,639 --> 00:27:39,615
It's just that I noticed how dangerous you ride your motorbike.

337
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:41,515
I was worried to death.

338
00:27:41,515 --> 00:27:43,620
You would've got yourself killed.

339
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,079
My mother said the same thing.

340
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,799
Demon H... Ms. He cares about you.

341
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,439
And she's very proud of you.

342
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,960
By the way,

343
00:27:57,699 --> 00:28:01,020
does Ms. He know about your grade retention?

344
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:07,636
I think you should stop keeping her in the dark.

345
00:28:07,636 --> 00:28:09,900
But I have to do so.

346
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:13,199
This is not what she wants me to be.

347
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:16,656
Why are you saying so? She always praises you in our class.

348
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:20,299
She calls you our role model.

349
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:22,916
- Really?
- Really!

350
00:28:22,916 --> 00:28:25,620
And she doesn't know you gave me this exercise book.

351
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:30,100
When she found out about it, I lied that I got it on Taobao.

352
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,339
And she almost seized it.

353
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:34,819
But she's so happy

354
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:37,335
to see my good results.

355
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,860
She said I'd improved a lot because of your exercise book.

356

Tell me! What's Ms He like when she's at home?

357
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,100
About the same when she's at school.

358
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,980
Quite demanding as well.

359
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,039
I remember when I was at Grade Three, I read a novel secretly.

360
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,870
When she found out about it,

361
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:03,620
she tore it in front of me.

362
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,399
I was thinking that

363
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:09,499
once I'd got into university, I could do whatever I wanted.

364
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,860
But, now, I don't know how to face her.

365
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:17,859
Why don't you ask for your father's help?

366
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:20,700
He passed away when I was small.

367
00:29:21,939 --> 00:29:25,556
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, you didn't know that.

368
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,173
Oh, yeah.

369

Finish this exercise book, then you can thank me.

370
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,020
It's easy-peasy.

371
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,919
To be honest, it's very lucky for me

372
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,939
to meet you.

373
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,820
Once I finish this exercise book,

I'll lead a free life.

392
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,880
my parents had divorced

393

for the sake of my sister.

398
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:34,195
Although my sister seems to be okay with it,

399
00:31:34,195 --> 00:31:37,059
deep inside she's very upset.

400
00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:40,140
But I don't know how to comfort her.

401

I find that you are more mature than her.

405
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,900
