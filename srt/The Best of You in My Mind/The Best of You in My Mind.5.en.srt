00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:06,424
♫ I hesitate to talk. ♫

3
00:00:06,424 --> 00:00:09,798
♫ Some words haven't been spoken yet ♫

4
00:00:09,798 --> 00:00:13,200
♫ but you are already laughing at something, ♫

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,020
♫ whether you understand or not, ♫

6
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,609
♫ or pretend to be indifferent. ♫

7
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,840
♫ If only I could remove your sadness. ♫

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,500
♫ Afraid some words would breakdown the mask, ♫

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:32,460
♫ suddenly, I found myself speechless. ♫

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:39,380
♫ You are chatting about the plot of a dream ♫

11
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:46,365
♫ and sadly, cry your eyes out.

12
00:00:46,365 --> 00:00:53,000
♫ Love is like a migratory bird waiting for the season. ♫

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,780
♫ How long does it take for them to be aware of each other? ♫

14
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:02,320
♫ You are like summer night, ♫

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,030
♫ I'm like a little star in the sky, ♫

16
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,990
♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

17
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:12,993
♫ accompanying you to blink until indispensable. ♫

18
00:01:12,993 --> 00:01:16,512
♫ Deliberately, I hit your shoulder, ♫

19
00:01:16,512 --> 00:01:21,155
♫ and then, listen to your reprimand. ♫

20
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:26,794
♫ The caring feeling is so sweet! ♫

[Episode 5]

23
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,810
Hey, what's up?

24
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,039
Lin Xigeng, what are you up to?

25
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,719
I'm at home, why are you calling me this late?

26
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:20,239
I went to mom's place today.

27
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:26,520
How's she doing?

28
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,099
Not bad!

29
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,240
I'll definitely work hard,

30
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:41,427
to reunite our family, just like old times.

31
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:46,259
Lin Xigeng, you have to work hard and get into a university.

32
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:48,340
Don't let our parents down!

33
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,419
Why are you lecturing me all of a sudden?

34
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,319
How have you been doing in your exams lately?

35
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,939
Have you decided which university you're going to yet?

36
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:56,340
What's the rush?

37
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,580
It's enough to have you as a university student in our family.

38
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,141
You didn't say bad things about me in front of mom?

39
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,640
No, I didn't.

40
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,200
I dare you to do so!

41
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,579
Do you still have enough money from what I gave you?

42
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:13,280
Dad said you didn't pick up his call.

43
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,020
I'm really worried about whether or not you have enough.

44
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,659
What's going on between you and dad? What's wrong?

45
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:21,938
Can you stop minding my business?

46
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:25,719
You're a kid but you nag a lot.

47
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:29,498
Where's your evaluation paper? Send me a picture of it so I can take a look.

48
00:03:29,498 --> 00:03:32,178
No, I'm running out of data. Bye!

49
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:47,639
- What are you doing?
- Dad, why didn't you knock?

50
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:51,058
There's only the two of us here, do I still need to knock?

51
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:52,778
You should respect my privacy.

52
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:55,399
This is my house, not yours!

53
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:58,978
Let me check your sister's credit card. Give it to me!

54
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:04,700
Dad, how did you know that I had it?

55
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,900
If I hadn't checked the transaction history,

56
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,240
I wouldn't have known that your sister's allowance was with you.

57
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,520
No transactions at Rong City.

58
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,359
But you used it several times to buy game cards.

59
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:22,819
I'm not stealing the money, dad.

60
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,059
That... she refused to accept the money you gave her.

61
00:04:25,059 --> 00:04:27,980
Besides, she took my cash.

62
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,800
There's no way your money can last long.

63
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,659
Since you're on holidays,

64
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:38,710
quickly go and take the card to your sister.

65
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,720
Good! You're finally online.

66
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,959
Let's have one round! I've been waiting for you for a few days.

67
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:01,878
Last time you humiliated me; I'll take revenge on you today.

68
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,778
Don't all talk to that kiddo who's a third-year highschooler called Xiao Xi.

69
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:08,519
Otherwise, you'll be my enemies.

70
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:10,658
I'm sorry! I can't play with you today.

71
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:12,058
Everyone knows you have the GaoKao (TN: Chinese university entrance exam)

72
00:05:12,059 --> 00:05:15,640
You should discipline yourself.

73
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,599
Big Li, come out now! I heard you're from Rong City.

74
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:21,759
- I dare you to fight with me face-to-face.
- Sure! I'm not scared of you.

75
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,279
Cut the crap! When and where?

76
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,598
The day after tomorrow, at 2 p.m. at Rong University.

77
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:29,419
Rong University? What a coincidence!

78
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:31,859
If you don't come, you're a coward!

79
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,994
[I'm here!]
[Waiting at the cafe near the gate!]

80
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,559
- Hello.
- Sister, let's have some dinner later!

81
00:06:25,559 --> 00:06:30,339
- What?
- I'm at the school gate; I'll treat you to a dinner later.

82
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:32,660
- Are you at Rong City now?
- That's right!

83
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,280
I won't stay long; I'll leave tonight.

84
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,819
Fine! Then I'll apply for leave from the archery team.

85
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:41,640
No rush! I'm meeting someone at Cygnus Cafe.

86
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:46,199
- Who?
- Stop asking! Just call me once you settle everything.

87
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,500
What a stupid boy!

88
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,399
I'm going out.

89
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:55,279
Where's my honey?

90
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,499
We're being your testers.

91
00:06:57,499 --> 00:06:59,980
It's quite sweet.

92
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:03,639
- I'm going out too.
- Where are you going?

93
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,000
What a cool girl!

94
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:59,460
Someone's sitting there.

95
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,379
Where are they?

96
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:05,698
- He's on the way here.
- I'll go once he's here.

97
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,639
Are you afraid of coming?

98
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:33,865
- Are you Xiao Xi?
- Are you Big Li?

99
00:08:33,865 --> 00:08:37,518
- You wanted me to call you dad?
- You called yourself a man?

100
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,760
You want to play games?

101
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,979
I'm telling you, I know every single game guru in this area.

102
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,139
No one dares to play with you anymore.

103
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:52,319
You're such a busybody! Who do you think you are?

104
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:53,979
In this case, I need to be a busybody.

105
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,359
Let's do this instead! I'll ask you some questions.

106
00:08:56,359 --> 00:09:00,200
If you manage to answer them all, I'll take back my words.

107
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,319
If not, you'll go back home and study.

108
00:09:04,319 --> 00:09:07,019
Fine, go ahead!

109
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,839
The change-of-base formula, Taylor's theorem,

110
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:11,479
and trigonometric function; so just tell me about one of them and I'll make you the winner.

111
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:14,599
Stop, what are they?

112
00:09:14,599 --> 00:09:19,120
- I don't understand.
- You're not smart enough to play games.

113
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:25,040
I dare you to have a match with me.

114
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:32,538
You can only fight with me after completing these exercise books.

115
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:35,400
You're not qualified to fight yet.

116
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:37,878
Do you two know each other?

117
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:40,059
- No.
- No.

118
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,620
If not, then why are you sharing this table?

119
00:09:44,259 --> 00:09:47,500
He's my brother, Lin Xigeng.

120
00:09:53,119 --> 00:09:55,220
This sister is something.

121
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,898
She got into our university as a top science student.

122
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,420
You must make her your role model.

123
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,380
How did you meet her?

124
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,440
She's my roommate.

125
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,619
She's not in your year group. Why is she your roommate?

126
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:11,480
- It's because I...
- I'm off now.

127
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,459
What happened?

128
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:21,940
- Answer me!
- What?

129
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,819
What happened?

130
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,300
- Here you go!
- Thank you.

131
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,900
Put that aside!

132
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,300
Drink the soup first!

133
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:41,300
What happened between you and that senior? I just saw that both of you were about to fight.

134
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,000
No.

135
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,700
You're leaving tonight, why are there so many exercise books?

136
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,700
That's very unusual of you.

137
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Dad asked me to give you this; take it!

138
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,800
I've been using it.

139
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Who allowed you to do so?

140
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,000
I couldn't help myself.

141
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,100
Moreover, how long is Brother Fang going to help you?

142
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,800
- What do you mean?
- Think about it!

143
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,200
It's been a while since the semester started, is it impossible for you to live on the eight hundred yuan I gave you.

144
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,700
I know, mom! I'm off now, dad.

145
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,000
- Sure, leave now!
- Go on!

146
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,000
Brother Fang!

147
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,900
I heard you got accepted by University Rong. Congratulations!

148
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,800
- I'm on my way there.
- My sister's studying there, too.

149
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,000
She doesn't know you got accepted.

150
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,400
We haven't talked for a long time.

151
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:44,059
She's fighting with my dad.

152
00:11:44,059 --> 00:11:45,898
She refused to accept any allowance from him.

153
00:11:45,898 --> 00:11:49,179
She doesn't have much money, so I'm not sure if she can survive long on her savings.

154
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,600
So, can you give this to her?

155
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,500
I know both of you are fighting.

156
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,300
But...

157
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,100
Don't worry! I have an idea.

158
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,300
I thought Xu Fang was trying to extort money from me.

159
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,700
He just pitted with you. (TN: antagonized)

160
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,458
He knew you're stubborn and sensitive.

161
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:17,079
If he had given it to you, you would have rejected it.

162
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:19,500
That's why he did the opposit.

163
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,400
I guess he's already spent more in this one month on your meals

164
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,200
and your pocket money than what he won.

165
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,600
Dad is worried about you, too.

166
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,500
He asked me to give you the card.

167
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,800
Can you stop fighting with him?

168
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,400
Isn't our family reunion your biggest wish?

169
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,300
You ignore him all the time,

170
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,200
Aren't I right?

171
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,500
- Where are you going?
- Seek out Xu Fang!

172
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,400
Fang-fang is so hardworking.

173
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,800
He's being punished by the coach.

174
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,900
He's too lousy to be Coach Liu's favorite player.

175
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,000
What kind of pro is he?

176
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,500
He can't even do the basics well, I think he should just go home.

177
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,300
It's hurt!

178
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,100
- Lin Xichi, why did you do that?
- You can't even admit that you hit him, Coward!

179
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,700
- I'm a coward?
- Go! Let's go!

180
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,600
- Lin Xichi, who are you calling a coward?
- Where are we going?

181
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,100
Dinner! I'll treat you to a meal.

182
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,000
Let's go!

183
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Lin Xichi, explain yourself!

184
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,059
Yu Tong, check out my injury.

185
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,900
- What's wrong?
- I'm hurt! It's painful!

186
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,500
Fang-fang, walk slowly.

187
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:58,000
I can't walk any more, I'm so full.

188
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,100
How much do you eat per day?

189
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,700
You should try to have two meals for lunch.

190
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,800
Moreover, it's on me; of course, I needed to eat more.

191
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
You're really something.

192
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,000
- With whom did you have your first lunch?
- Lin Xigeng.

193
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,800
He's here?

194
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,700
Otherwise, I couldn't have bought you lunch.

195
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,600
That kid is as heartless as you.

196
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,000
He didn't tell me that he was here.

197
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,700
He needs to go home and revise; his results are so bad.

198
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,500
He's not like you; he doesn't know how to play archery.

199
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
You must be feeling happy.

200
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,320
Nobody can oppress you again.

201
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,100
You do know that you're oppressing me.

202
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,000
Of course, I do! You have no idea how fun it was.

203
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,800
I was thinking if he gets into Rong University,

204
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,200
our family will be reunited.

205
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,300
Why are you still...

206
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,100
still thinking about things out of your control?

207
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,600
What should I do then?

208
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,100
I can't just sit and do nothing.

209
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,500
I'll put it this way.

210
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,800
The relationship between your parents is like these cars.

211
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,600
You can only be a lubricant.

212
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,700
It depends on them to start the cars.

213
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,800
What do you think Baby, do you like it?

214
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
Yes, it's so beautiful!

215
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,600
- That's great!
- Thank you Mom.
- You're welcome, Baby.

216
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,400
There's dad, mom, and me.

217
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,800
We'll be together forever.

218
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,000
Let's go home and play with it.

219
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,900
Are we leaving?

220
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,000
I want to lie here for a while.

221
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,600
Try it!

222
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,500
Look! It's so blue.

223
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,100
It feels so comfortable.

224
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,100
I'm back!

225
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,700
Where's everyone?

226
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,700
They even didn't lock the door; so careless!

227
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,559
[Ye Shao Wen]

228
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,100
Chi-chi, come here now! Mao Mao is giving birth soon.

229
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,300
Mao Mao, Really? Wait! I'll be there soon.

230
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,200
Where's Mao Mao?

231
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,200
She's probably looking for food.

232
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,900
Look!

233
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,600
You shouldn't touch them.

234
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,600
If your odour gets onto them, their mom won't recognize them.

235
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
I'm not trying to touch them.

236
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,300
I'm just pretending to do so.

237
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,000
Pretending?

238
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,200
You're funny!

239
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,200
When Fang Fang first came to our house,

240
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
his mom had long gone.

241
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:24,200
I didn't get to see how he interacted with his mom.

242
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
What Fang Fang?

243
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,400
Fang Fang is my dog.

244
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,600
When it came to our house, it was this big.

245
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,500
And he was still fed on milk.

246
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,100
Now, he becomes this big, old dog.

247
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,900
But I heard that his mom was hit by a car.

248
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:52,700
And I was sad for a long while.

249
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:57,200
I was thinking if we had got her treated,

250
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,800
then Fang Fang would have lived with his mom.

251
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,700
Is that why you're studying veterinary medicine?

252
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
My mom's a doctor.

253
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
She healed many kids.

254
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,900
But we need to take care of these animals too, right?

255
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,800
I see, your mom's a doctor.

256
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,600
She's far more amazing than me.

257
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,600
Five more pushups, come on!

258
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,100
Three more, two more, one more.

259
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,400
Your bottom.

260
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,800
Do another ten pushups.

261
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,100
Go.

262
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,500
Hey, why isn't Lin Xichi here today?

263
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,600
She has something to do.

264
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,400
I've applied her leave from the coach.

265
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,500
What could she do in the weekend?

266
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,700
A date with a handsome guy?

267
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,500
That's impossible! Who would date her?

268
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,300
You're angry.

269
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,800
I'm not.

270
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,400
Hurry up!

271
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,200
I'll visit them from time to time.

272
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,800
It's okay! You need to deal with the archery team.

273
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,100
I'll find them shelter in a few days.

274
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,800
Archery team.

275
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,300
My gosh! What time is it?

276
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,600
It's ten something; it's late!

277
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,700
- I need to leave now.
- Why is the door closed?

278
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,300
It was opened when I came in.

279
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,200
Anyone? We're still here.

280
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,800
Is there any other door?

281
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
No, this is the only one.

282
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,500
My phone's power is out, why this happened now?

283
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,400
Mine is still working.

284
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,000
Xu Fang, I'm locked at the school rooftop.

285
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,700
What?

286
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,900
Did he hear what you said?

287
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,000
It's cold, put this on.

288
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,700
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

289
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
They're sleeping.

290
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,400
Hurry up, Sir!

291
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,600
- They've fallen asleep.
- They're here!

292
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,100
That's quick.

293
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,200
What are you doing here?

294
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,400
They're newborns, so we can't move them around.

295
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,600
I get it! I won't chase them out.

296
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,900
Once they become settled, you need to send them away.

297
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,400
- Go down now.
- Thank you.

298
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,100
No problem.

299
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,400
Let me introduce you two

300
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,300
This is my childhood friend, Xu Fang.

301
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:34,700
And this is my course senior, Ye Shao Wen.

302
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,200
I know you! You looked as cool as this

303
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,800
when you refused to give her your WeChat ID.

304
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,200
- The coach wants to see us, we should go now.
- What for?

305
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,900
Bye, Senior and thank you. See you!

306
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,700
See you!

307
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,378
- Is Coach Liu mad at me?
- No.

308
00:22:00,378 --> 00:22:03,500
- That's impossible! I haven't been there for today.
- I've applied for your leave.

309
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,200
That's very peculiar of you.

310
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,800
- What does Coach Liu want to tell me?
- Nothing.

311
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,300
Why didn't you let Senior Ye send me back but say Coach Liu wanted to see me?

312
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,400
And you're rude to the senior.

313
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,300
What's wrong with you?

314
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,300
Are you feeling irritated because I asked for your help?

315
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,600
Or you don't like Senior Ye?

316
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,500
Let me tell you! Senior is a nice guy.

317
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,700
He's a kind-hearted guy who loves animals.

318
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,800
If it hadn't been for him, those kittens would have been killed.

319
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,500
Get it? You-

320
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,100
- What's wrong with you?
- Lin Xichi!

321
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,900
What?

322
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,600
Nothing.

323
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,600
Nothing? If so, I'm off now.

324
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,500
You're crazy!

325
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,100
No, you're crazy!

326
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,000
Whoever you are, I'm warning you.

327
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Get out of his body now.

328
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,800
Are you trying to pick a fight here?

329
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I think you're not possessed.

330
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,500
Listen here, just tell me whenever you're unhappy.

331
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,700
Unhappy your foot!

332
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,800
Idiot!

333
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,000
Thanks for your help.

334
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,300
Are you thinking about things between you and Senior Ye?

335
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,700
I don't know what's in my mind.

336
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,600
But I never like this before.

337
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,000
When I looked at him,

338
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I couldn't help staring at him.

339
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,710
Later, when he put his jacket on me,

340
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:06,100
I felt so warm.

341
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,819
Besides, when both of us were at the dark rooftop,

342
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:12,759
my heart would race.

343
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:15,800
You like Senior Ye.

344
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,300
- Do I like him?
- Absolutely!

345
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,200
My gosh!

346
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,000
He knows what happened between me and Xu Fang.

347
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You shouldn't you do something to save your image?

348
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,700
Do you think Senior Ye prefer a girl like this?

349
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,300
I don't think so.

350
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,000
What should I do?

351
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,800
I have an idea.

352
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,600
This.

353
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,700
It's blinking.

354
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,200
Senior Ye definitely prefers this kind of girl.

355
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,578
How do I look? Will he fall in love with me?

356
00:25:02,578 --> 00:25:04,300
Yes, he will!

357
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:08,400
I've told you so! I can get any man I want.

358
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,700
What's wrong with you?

359
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,900
You can play better than this.

360
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Look at yourself.

361
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,600
You look so grumpy.

362
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,800
Did Lin Xichi mess with you again?

363
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,800
Can you stop talking about her?

364
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,500
I'm worried about you.

365
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,600
Old Wang who lives next to us,

366
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,800
went to a girl's dorm and confessed to her.

367
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,200
Guess what? They're now a couple.

368
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,100
I saw them walking together.

369
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,000
None of my business.

370
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,400
No.

371
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,600
Xu Fang, stop pretending! Don't you know it?

372
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,300
What?

373
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,400
Don't you know you like Lin Xichi?

374
00:26:25,219 --> 00:26:27,500
Jiang Zhengxu, have you gone crazy?

375
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:31,500
I think you've gone crazy for you even didn't know you like her.

376
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
We've been friends for so long.

377
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,700
You've never acted this way.

378
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,800
I was taking revenge on her because she used to bully me.

379
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,800
Taking revenge on her?

380
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,000
Since that's the case, why did you solve her financial crisis?

381
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,400
Why did you let her work for the archery team?

382
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,800
And also, why are you acting jealous?

383
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,700
Jealous?

384
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,600
♫ We used to talk ♫

385
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,400
♫ We used to pretend it's all coincidence ♫

386
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,000
♫ We lost to a joke. ♫

387
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,700
♫ We used to hug in the rain. ♫

388
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,900
♫ I got sad because you're crying. ♫

389
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:18,600
♫ I still remember every little thing you told me. ♫

390
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,317
♫ It's the warm candlelight. ♫

391
00:27:20,317 --> 00:27:22,300
♫ It's our heartbeats and pulses. ♫

392
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,400
♫ It's the brilliant fireworks and snow. ♫

393
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:33,300
♫ Everything written in the diary has come true. ♫

394
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,379
- Get it now?
- Focus on your practice!

395
00:27:58,379 --> 00:28:02,500
Brother, you're obviously jealous.

396
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,800
Jealousy is a sign of love.

397
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,200
This is love!

398
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,800
Why you don't admit it?

399
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:14,400
Since you like her, you should chase after her and stop bullying her.

400
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,300
Listen up! Don't wait until she gets taken.

401
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,700
- That's impossible!
- Still impossible?

402
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,100
Don't be too sure of it! Impossible?

403
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,300
You... You said it's impossible.

404
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,600
Your "impossible", what—

405
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,200
Wait, what does "impossible" mean?

406
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,000
Does it mean it's impossible for you to be a couple?

407
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,100
Or, it's impossible for her to get a boyfriend?

408
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,800
What do you mean by "impossible"?

409
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,200
The principle of Marxism shows its revolutionary and uniform scientific views.

410
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,200
And this is the focus of this lesson.

411
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,000
The birth of Marxism was a great revolution in the history of human thinking.

412
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,600
This paragraph. Until here.

413
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,600
- From here to here?
- Right.

414
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,400
- What about this?
- It's the main point.

415
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,200
- Here.
- And here.

416
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,500
This paragraph! From here to here.

417
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:09,700
- All of these?
- You need to memorize them.

418
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,000
And for the previous part

419
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,200
Does the back of my head look good?

420
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
What are you drawing?

421
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,500
You should do more revision.

422
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,100
Okay, class dismissed.

423
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,600
Lin Xichi, I need to attend another class.

424
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,400
- Sure, Senior Ye.
- See you!

425
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,820
What's the matter with you?

426
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,759
What are you saying? It's none of my business.

427
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:10,000
- Why are you mad at me?
- What? Am I mad at you?

428
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,300
- It's so obvious, are you sick?
- You're sick!

429
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,600
You can't stop me from befriending him because you're my friend.

430
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
You're really sick.

431
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,600
You, stop right there!

432
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,400
- Let go of me!
- I won't.

433
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,600
Don't step on it!

434
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,800
What happened this time?

435
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,300
It's Xu Fang! I don't know why he's mad at me.

436
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:44,000
- You know that he's always been petty.
- But he wasn't like this.

437
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:48,398
- It was fine for him that I tortured him but something is wrong with him this time, he even called me a sicko.
- Lift your legs!

438
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:51,800
I don't feel like attending the archery practice later.

439
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,500
Can you do it for me?

440
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,500
No, I have a class this afternoon.

441
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,200
I'll do so next time.

442
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,800
Hang in there!

443
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,000
Let's eat after I clean the floor.

444
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,800
Your legs!

445
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,400
Xu Fang, you bastard.

446
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,600
Why is he mad at me all the time?

447
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,399
- Let's go!
- I don't feel like moving.

448
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:19,800
I'll buy buns for you.

449
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,600
Buns again?

450
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,700
- Eat more meat!
- You're such a nice girl.

451
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,000
Your future husband will be a happy man.

452
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,900
Come on!

453
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,000
- I don't want to.
- Join them!

454
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
What's wrong? You should take the lead.

455
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Just get over it.

456
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,400
Why is Xu Fang being so abnormal?

457
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,300
I've told you so!

458
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,700
You need to take the initiative.

459
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,600
She's looking at you.

460
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:16,079
Here's the practice plan for this afternoon.

461
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:21,018
Two hundred arrows, draw your bows three times for thirty seconds, and shoot fifteen times.

462
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,440
It's not a difficult practice.

463
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,239
But you must be serious doing all these moves.

464
00:32:27,239 --> 00:32:30,839
Because your muscles, like your brains, have memories.

465
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:33,399
Only by doing these moves correctly

466
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:36,898
can you improve your muscles' memories and maintain your stamina.

467
00:32:36,898 --> 00:32:38,919
- Understand?
- Got it!

468
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:40,519
Let's start it!

469
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,680
Fang-fang.

470
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,699
Again!

471
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,578
Yu Tong, you sweat a lot, you should drink more.

472
00:33:35,578 --> 00:33:38,438
- Thanks!
- I'll help myself to it.

473
00:33:38,438 --> 00:33:41,559
- That's not yours!
- Why haven't you got over it?

474
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:44,399
That's mango juice! Aren't you allergic to mango?

475
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,220
Drink blueberry juice instead.

476
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,178
Good girl! You remember that.

477
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:51,880
Thank you.

478
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,940
Yu Tong, do you think she likes me?

479
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,430
It doesn't seem so.

480
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,700
You know nothing.

481
00:34:02,619 --> 00:34:04,799
I'm sure she likes me.

482
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,399
Fang-fang, have some juice.

483
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,760
Let me!

484
00:34:23,499 --> 00:34:26,739
It doesn't taste good? Drink more!

485
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,699
- Here you go!
- Thank you.

486
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,259
Time to have your juice.

487
00:34:45,259 --> 00:34:47,679
Coach, have some juice.

488
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,460
Thank you.

489
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:55,779
What are you shooting at?

490
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,219
Coach, can you see the target with your sunglasses on?

491
00:35:01,219 --> 00:35:05,539
I don't need to see it, I knew that's a miss simply from hearing the sound.

492
00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:08,419
Just from hearing the sound?

493
00:35:08,419 --> 00:35:12,298
An arrow hitting ten points and a miss, their strings give out different sounds.

494
00:35:12,298 --> 00:35:13,879
Get it?

495
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,800
Xu Fang!

496
00:35:25,399 --> 00:35:27,339
Didn't I say so?

497
00:35:27,339 --> 00:35:32,318
When you shoot an arrow, you must relax your fingers and the back of your hand.

498
00:35:32,318 --> 00:35:34,898
What about you? What is this?

499
00:35:34,898 --> 00:35:37,359
What is it? Chicken feet?

500
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,320
I'll show you how to do it.

501
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:57,359
Once the arrow is shot, your fingers should move to the back smoothly.

502
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,839
That's how it should be done.

503
00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:01,879
But your hand has always been unstable.

504
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:04,659
I've pointed it out many times, can't you do something about it?

505
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:07,539
But Coach, I've tried! I can't hit the target by doing that.

506
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:10,719
Although my move is flawed, it gives me better control.

507
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:13,160
Cut the crap, take it!

508
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,380
I'm telling you, none of the national champions did that move!

509
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,199
Moreover, you're the captain!

510
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:22,980
Keep practicing!

511
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:30,058
- Coach, here's your drink! Don't get angry.
- Thank you.

512
00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:36,759
Don't feel panic, do it slowly!

513
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:38,800
Have some juice!

514
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,660
Didn't I say so? When you shoot an arrow,

515
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:07,130
you must relax your fingers and the back of your hand.

516
00:37:07,138 --> 00:37:09,439
What is it? Chicken feet?

517
00:37:09,439 --> 00:37:11,939
But Coach, I won't be able to hit the target.

518
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,120
How can he be our captain with such lousy basics?

519
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,639
He should just quit!

520
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:22,380
You should stop it.

521
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:26,959
- What?
- Brother, he's that bad.

522
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,359
I want you to hang in there.

523
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,139
Keep playing archery and being a captain!

524
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:40,460
Be a role model for your team members!

525
00:37:57,579 --> 00:37:59,179
Coach.

526
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:02,879
He's been practicing for so long but still no improvement.

527
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:05,199
Isn't Xu Fang your old friend?

528
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,919
Why isn't he being dedicated?

529
00:38:08,779 --> 00:38:11,078
Actually, he always works hard.

530
00:38:11,078 --> 00:38:13,419
He's the last person to leave the field today.

531
00:38:13,419 --> 00:38:18,360
They practice but they don't know why they do so.

532
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:23,419
I was trained to be an athlete, so I know what's in their mind.

533
00:38:23,419 --> 00:38:25,859
Their parents signed them up for classes and they got a skill now.

534
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:27,878
And it's called archery, right?

535
00:38:27,878 --> 00:38:31,460
They went to school, so it's time to eat and practice.

536
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,099
They follow my instructions.

537
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,400
But if I don't give them any, they'll do as they please.

538
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,320
They're wasting their time.

539
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:44,259
You can ask them! They think they're playing archery for me, get it?

540
00:38:45,579 --> 00:38:49,660
I think you're right.

541
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,020
Such a pity! They're wasting their time.

542
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:58,879
If they miss this opportunity now, they'll cry feeling regretful in the future.

543
00:39:00,910 --> 00:39:03,700
They act like this probably because it's a practice.

544
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,000
If there were a competition, I think they'd be very excited.

545
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:12,680
Good idea!

546
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:16,100
Just having a competition as a practice!

547
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:20,020
That'll stimulate their motivation and pressure.

548
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,859
And they'll find out their weaknesses through the competition.

549
00:39:26,179 --> 00:39:27,940
You're really something!

550
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,600
Luckily, I recruited you.

551
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,818
Fine! I'll contact the authority.

552
00:39:32,819 --> 00:39:34,960
That's awesome!

553
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,219
Nobody wants to play with me!

554
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,460
So serious!

555
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,920
She's truly a top student.

556
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,890
