1
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,880
Ru Jing Hanghong.

2
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,320
Chao Meiqi Yan.

3
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,560
Yi Shuo.

4
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,840
Yi.

5
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,560
Yu Yi Ke Miao Yang Qian Qianran.

6
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,920
Meiyuan.

7
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,759
This Fang Xian.

8
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,400
Isn't he pickling meat?

9
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,880
Damn it.

10
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,720
The cuisine of Wu Dynasty is unparalleled across the four seas.

11
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,760
I'm quite impressed as well.

12
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,520
So I've done some research.

13
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,640
If I'm not mistaken,

14
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,520
wasn't the Kan family's son-in-law just

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,640
pickling the guests like livestock?

16
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,880
Wait.

17
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,320
Take a good look.

18
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,420
It's absolutely amazing.

19
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,480
Fang Xian's skill not only has a massage effect,

20
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,440
but surprisingly also has a cleansing function.

21
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
It's wonderful.

22
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,610
So comfortable.

23
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,120
It feels like I've lost more than ten pounds.

24
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,640
Great!

25
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,600
Good, good, good.

26
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,360
What a son-in-law of the Kan family.

27
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,220
What an orphan of the Fang family.

28
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,880
To think he could so cleverly turn danger into safety.

29
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,560
Now that's a worthy opponent.

30
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,020
I want to get a membership.

31
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,640
You won.

32
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,079
My dear,

33
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,040
I did it.

34
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,079
I can't believe sister and Fang Xian actually turned the situation around.

35
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,200
Miss Meiming, why get so worked up?

36
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,320
It's not like there won't be opportunities in the future.

37
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,360
Future, future,

38
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,090
but when exactly in the future?

39
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,520
Watching Tianxiang Pool getting more prosperous day by day,

40
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,980
my chances are only getting fewer and fewer.

41
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,160
That's why you shouldn't degrade yourself even more.

42
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,160
Isn't that right?

43
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,360
You just want to marry into our family, don't you?

44
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,480
If you have a way to deal with my sister and Fang Xian,

45
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,880
I'll agree to let you marry into our family.

46
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,839
Miss Meiming,

47
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,240
you're drunk.

48
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,850
I won't take advantage of someone in a vulnerable state.

49
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,640
Then consider that I'm taking advantage of the situation,

50
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,840
forcing you to agree

51
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,240
to help me deal with my sister and Fang Xian.

52
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,200
Miss Meiming,

53
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,500
to become your ideal husband,

54
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,980
I'll have to use every trick up my sleeve.

55
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,600
My dear,

56
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,820
Don't move around.

57
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,090
What are you looking at?

58
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,860
When I left the Kan family,

59
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,920
I met a few orphaned children.

60
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,120
the orphanage where they live,

61
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,240
for some unknown reason,

62
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,800
the well they use for water today

63
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
has been sealed off by the soldiers.

64
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,960
Where will they get water from then?

65
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,420
The location of Yi Suo is already remote.

66
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,520
there are only a few commonly used wells.

67
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,320
I'm afraid

68
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,159
we'll have to go to Rong Mountain to fetch water.

69
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,480
Those are all children.

70
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,560
Going to Rong Mountain is too dangerous.

71
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,420
I don't know why the officials sealed off the wells.

72
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,159
Don't worry too much.

73
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,159
I'll have Ting Yu gather some information.

74
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,200
You helped me once before.

75
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,170
This time, I'll help you in return.

76
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,960
Then we'll be even.

77
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,480
Fang Xian,

78
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,720
thank you.

79
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:22,760
My lady,

80
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,560
I think

81
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,360
Miss,

82
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,610
something terrible has happened!

83
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,440
My dear,

84
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,440
I...

85
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,600
Go, go, go!

86
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,240
Welcome!

87
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,840
Welcome! Please come in.

88
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,120
Tingyu,

89
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,880
Is everything you said true?

90
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,300
Yes, it's true.

91
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,560
It's not just Yisuo.

92
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,880
All the water collection points in the city, big and small,

93
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,200
have been sealed off since the day before yesterday.

94
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,080
Many citizens have been forced

95
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,320
to go outside the city to fetch water.

96
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,520
This is outrageous!

97
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,400
They won't even spare the children from the orphanage.

98
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,200
Tingyu,

99
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,320
do you know anything else?

100
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,480
Yes.

101
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,120
The new Grand Master of Ceremonies

102
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,760
sealed off the water to make us prepare for the imperial audience,

103
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,960
by bathing.

104
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,800
Who is this new Grand Master of Ceremonies?

105
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,720
Tell me.

106
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,720
It's

107
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,640
Lord Song Kang.

108
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,900
This Song Kang has a history with the Kan family.

109
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,920
Can we go and mediate this matter in person?

110
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
That makes sense.

111
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,760
We can find an opportunity

112
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,620
to visit Song Kang and have a chat.

113
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,080
Oh, here you are.

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,280
The Song family has sent an invitation.

115
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,010
It's to congratulate Song Kang on his promotion.

116
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,039
Welcome, Boss Kan Xiang and Miss Kan Meiyuan.

117
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,880
The master specifically asked me to welcome you personally.

118
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,799
This is my husband, Fang Xian.

119
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,520
I am aware.

120
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,140
Fang Xian is indeed the famous live-in son-in-law of Taizhou.

121
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,080
However, for today's banquet,

122
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,480
the master has left a specific rule.

123
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,780
This means even dogs are allowed inside.

124
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,600
I can't believe you can still laugh.

125
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,360
My dear,

126
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,160
how about

127
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,080
I go back first?

128
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,240
All visitors are guests.

129
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,600
How can I let Master Fang leave like this?

130
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,610
The three of you,

131
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,800
please come in.

132
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,600
Wait a moment.

133
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,920
Don't you have rules?

134
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,640
Enough.

135
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,920
What's the occasion today?

136
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,450
What nonsense are you up to?

137
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,360
I apologize.

138
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,040
We're really busy today.

139
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,610
I didn't expect such a mess.

140
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,920
It's my fault.

141
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,000
Meiyuan,

142
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,520
how have you been lately?

143
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,600
Is Master Fang alright?

144
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,360
I'm fine.

145
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,290
My wife is taking care of me.

146
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,560
Song Kang,

147
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,320
I won't waste words with you.

148
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,360
The Kan family won't miss this one meal from you.

149
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,200
Let me ask you,

150
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,560
did you order the sealing of the city's wells?

151
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,520
Why ask when you already know the answer?

152
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,720
I'm doing this for the good of your Tianxiang Pool.

153
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,600
After all, your Kan family

154
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,120
is about to bathe and have an audience with the emperor.

155
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,160
I'm just making preparations in advance.

156
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,560
For many years in the Wu Dynasty,

157
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,840
it's not just Marquis Yanqing who has bathed before meeting the emperor.

158
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,920
There has never been a precedent

159
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,250
to seal off wells where people draw water.

160
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,040
So what if there's no precedent?

161
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,920
For many years,

162
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,920
who has matched Marquis Yanqing's civil and military achievements?

163
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,720
Could it be

164
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,610
that your Tianxiang Pool has objections?

165
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,200
Master Song, you speak too harshly.

166
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,040
Regarding the matter of bathing before meeting the emperor,

167
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,370
our Tianxiang Pool and the Ministry of Rites are of one mind.

168
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,600
That's good.

169
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,440
After all, your daughter and I

170
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,500
were once close to becoming a couple.

171
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,720
I still have goodwill towards all of you.

172
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,040
Let me escort you to the banquet.

173
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,440
That won't be necessary.

174
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,480
We don't share the same principles, so we can't work together.

175
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,960
I can't stomach this meal.

176
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,880
Let's go.

177
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,400
If you imitate me again,

178
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,160
I'll...

179
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,760
You'll what?

180
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,810
I'm sorry, darling.

181
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,560
I was confused.

182
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,000
I didn't sense it was you.

183
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,680
You really think you're the Shadow Master, don't you?

184
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,840
As if you could sense me.

185
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,840
But I actually...

186
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,120
Fang Xian,

187
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,280
You're not...

188
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,000
jealous, are you?

189
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,840
Why do you say that, darling?

190
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,840
You're usually so diplomatic with people,

191
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,440
but today, with the Grand Ceremonial Officer,

192
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,120
you weren't so polite.

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,040
I was just addressing the issue at hand.

194
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,120
Song Kang's matter

195
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,440
is truly unbearable.

196
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,920
Anyone with a shred of decency

197
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,580
wouldn't have stayed silent.

198
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,720
Is that so?

199
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,800
But,

200
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
although you're always clingy with me in private,

201
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,640
you've always been restrained in front of others.

202
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,770
Today, however, in front of Song Kang,

203
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,080
you held me like this.

204
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,240
Is this also out of decency?

205
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,920
It's only natural.

206
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,020
Who would like their wife to be constantly on someone else's mind?

207
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,760
You big man,

208
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,800
being so petty in public,

209
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,600
and even jealous.

210
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,440
You really are...

211
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,480
I didn't expect that.

212
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,640
I'm sorry, darling.

213
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,280
I quite like it when you're jealous.

214
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,680
What?

215
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,720
Look at your moon.
