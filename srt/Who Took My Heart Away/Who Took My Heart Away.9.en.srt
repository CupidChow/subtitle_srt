1
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,480
Yi Shuo.

2
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,360
Bian Zifan.

3
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:42,280
My dear,

4
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,320
So is it my fault this time too?

5
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,479
What else could it be?

6
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,140
Who gave you permission to pull me into the bath?

7
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,320
You were the one who peeped at me bathing first.

8
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,880
That's enough from you.

9
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,479
Are you trying to make a big deal out of this?

10
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,170
Did you like it, my dear?

11
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,640
What does it matter if I liked it?

12
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,370
What does it matter if I didn't?

13
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,360
So, my dear, do you like me,

14
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,740
or do you just like watching me bathe?

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,960
I have to say,

16
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,440
except for the low value for money of the massage service,

17
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,360
this Tianxiang Pool is quite nice.

18
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,200
You Da Wu people are really clueless,

19
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,960
treating the bathing pool culture so casually.

20
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,620
Indeed, a country bumpkin can't appreciate fine bran.

21
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,760
You're far inferior to us Xin Tuo people.

22
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,280
Your bathing pools are all imitations of those established in our dynasty.

23
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,680
Calling us casual?

24
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,540
You're really arrogant, aren't you?

25
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,840
Me, arrogant?

26
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,000
It seems I need to show you

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,400
what I'm capable of.

28
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,340
What are you doing?

29
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,800
You... don't come any closer!

30
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,260
You... what are you doing?

31
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,640
This... causing trouble so early in the morning.

32
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,280
Perfect timing. My hands were itching for some action.

33
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,960
My dear wife,

34
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,690
this is the men's bathing area.

35
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,079
My dear wife,

36
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,400
this is the men's bathing area.

37
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
My dear wife, your technique is quite impressive.

38
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,460
Who's 'dear wife'?

39
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,400
Who is it?

40
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,240
This is our Sindhu massage technique.

41
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,520
it has a thousand-year history.

42
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,160
and it's also our royal family's

43
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,690
highest etiquette for entertaining guests.

44
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,760
It's not some casual bathhouse

45
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,360
that can master such massage skills.

46
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,340
My, what a grand claim you're making.

47
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,720
Are you suggesting

48
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,080
that you popularized bathing culture?

49
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,640
Apart from opening the first bathhouse,

50
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,560
your Wu Dynasty's bathing culture

51
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,480
isn't anything special.

52
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,360
You... We Sindhu have long surpassed you.

53
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,240
You...

54
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,120
Can't you speak properly?

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,480
Just because you're decent at massage,

56
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,920
you claim to surpass us.

57
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,520
That's truly a frog in a well.

58
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,920
Seven days from now,

59
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll set up a challenge at Tianxiang Pool.

60
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,880
If you're not convinced,

61
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,680
feel free to come and challenge.

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,600
If you lose, you must admit

63
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,560
that we, Xinduo, are the true kings of bathing.

64
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,920
It's a deal.

65
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,000
My dear,

66
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,320
I don't care if they look down on me.

67
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,720
But I won't tolerate them disrespecting our great Wu Dynasty.

68
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,040
Or the Kan family's Tianxiang Pool.

69
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,440
I, Kan Meiyuan, will be the first to object.

70
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,760
It makes me so angry!

71
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,760
My dear,

72
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,720
don't you think you're being a bit impulsive this time?

73
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,120
We represent more than just the Kan family.

74
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,480
We represent the entire Wu Dynasty.

75
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,120
Are you suggesting

76
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,440
we should just watch them strut around on our turf

77
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,600
and show off?

78
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,320
Whose side are you on anyway?

79
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,280
Why aren't you backing me up?

80
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,160
Of course I'm on your side.

81
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,080
If you know you're on my side, why aren't you acting like it?

82
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,320
Will you accept punishment?

83
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,720
What kind of punishment?

84
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,460
I haven't decided yet.

85
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,000
Miss,

86
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,000
Tingyu.

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,640
You really know how to pick your moment.

88
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,770
Go ahead, what is it?

89
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,800
If we fail this time,

90
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,240
our Kan family's reputation will be ruined.

91
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,280
The common people will only remember

92
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,000
that it was our Kan family

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,200
who disgraced the people of the Great Wu Dynasty.

94
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,320
It might even affect

95
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,520
the important matter of Marquis Yanqing's audience with the emperor.

96
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,280
Meiming,

97
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,560
what do you want to do then?

98
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,040
Naturally, we should apologize

99
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,840
and invite him to join the Kan family.

100
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,120
I don't care if you want to show weakness to others,

101
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,880
but I, Kan Meiyuan,

102
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,320
have never been one to admit defeat before the battle even begins.

103
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,840
How did I not realize before

104
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,840
that you were such a spineless person?

105
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,160
So selfish and narrow-minded,

106
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
how could you possibly take over the seal of office?

107
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,320
So weak and incompetent.

108
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,600
Then you can take over the seal.

109
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,800
Stop arguing.

110
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,760
Fine.

111
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,280
Look at all of you.

112
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,490
you don't even look like a family anymore.

113
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,120
I'm not dead yet.

114
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,840
for the sake of a seal,

115
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,420
you're arguing like this.

116
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,640
Kneel down.

117
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,960
What are you looking at?

118
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,360
I'm telling you two to kneel down right now.

119
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,210
Kneel until I'm satisfied.

120
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,760
Sir,

121
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,600
why don't I call

122
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,800
a top-notch technician from my family?

123
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,240
Although their skills

124
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,600
may not be as good as that Sindhu person's,

125
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,370
they're at least experienced.

126
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,880
That's thoughtful of you, Second Lady.

127
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,050
Then, Fang Xian,

128
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,320
this matter of learning and improving skills

129
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,720
will be entrusted to you.

130
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,300
Thank you very much, Second Lady.

131
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,840
We're all family.

132
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,000
How about I go talk to Grandfather?

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,060
and ask for a favor.

134
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,520
No need.

135
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,020
Grandfather must be really angry this time.

136
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,240
Come here.

137
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,520
My dear,

138
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,860
what are you doing?

139
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,800
You need to accept your punishment properly.

140
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,200
If Grandfather gets angry again,

141
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,130
he might increase the punishment.

142
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,800
This... this lady...

143
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,130
Aren't you angry at all?

144
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,680
Did you understand what I said?

145
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,520
I heard and understood,

146
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,240
but...

147
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,080
I'm a cook.

148
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,200
He's not a massage therapist.

149
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,000
Nonsense.

150
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,680
If you were a massage therapist, I wouldn't be asking you.

151
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,880
That live-in son-in-law will come to you for advice later.

152
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,610
Just say something, anything.

153
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,880
I want to make them look foolish on the stage.

154
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,400
Second Aunt,

155
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,159
I'm here.

156
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,240
Master Kong,

157
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,600
please guide me.

158
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,580
You're too kind, too kind.

159
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,120
Master Kong,

160
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
you can start now.

161
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,320
I'm listening.

162
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,400
Alright.

163
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,920
This matter,

164
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,440
it's been passed down from a long, long time ago,

165
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,440
it's been handed down as a

166
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,880
very good technique.

167
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,760
Originally,

168
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,400
our ancestors,

169
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,040
they

170
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,800
didn't allow us to tell outsiders about it.

171
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,080
But since you, Young Master Fang, have come today,

172
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,920
I'll

173
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
tell you.

174
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,440
It goes like this.

175
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,040
You take this dragon fruit,

176
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,320
and this milk,

177
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,200
mix them together,

178
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,360
then use an ancient technique,

179
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,120
and rub and knead vigorously.

180
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,360
So,

181
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,800
after all this kneading,

182
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,160
even the toughest muscles

183
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,240
will become

184
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,880
silky smooth.

185
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,800
That's basically how it goes.

186
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,960
Okay.

187
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,940
You're still at the bathing pool so late?

188
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,320
Grandfather added more punishment again?

189
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,450
It's actually fine.

190
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,120
after all, cleaning the bathing pool

191
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,850
can reduce the kneeling punishment by two hours.

192
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,220
I always see you looking at the stars.

193
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,480
You like stargazing.

194
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,920
My dear,

195
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,120
do you know?

196
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,760
when I was little,

197
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,280
my family experienced a sudden change.

198
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,520
for a while, I didn't know what I should do

199
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
or what I could do.

200
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,520
Later,

201
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,840
grandfather took me in.

202
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,560
I started taking care of him.

203
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,400
At first, I didn't overthink things.

204
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,280
But since grandfather passed away,

205
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,200
that feeling suddenly came back.

206
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,320
But this time, I wasn't lost.

207
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,080
Because

208
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,040
I had something to hold onto in my heart.

209
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,480
Do you know

210
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,160
what stars mean to me?

211
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,960
If it's a long, sleepless night,

212
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,240
the starry sky

213
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,610
is the gentleness that the night bestows upon me.

214
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,170
But you can't see stars during the day.

215
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,920
Then you are my starry sky.

216
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,680
Alright,

217
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,260
let's switch back.

218
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,320
But I've been kneeling as punishment all day,

219
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,760
and I've done so much work.

220
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,680
If we switch back now, you'll be very tired.

221
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,600
You've already endured the punishment of kneeling for me.

222
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,130
You've taken that on for me.

223
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,920
I can handle the other fatigue.

224
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,520
But...

225
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,200
If you don't want to switch back, forget it.

226
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,360
My dear, don't...

227
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,560
My legs are weak.

228
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,320
Your legs are weak every time.

229
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,920
I don't know if it's true or not.

230
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,120
Of course it's true!

231
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,200
If you don't believe me,

232
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,400
I'll get up right now.

233
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,500
Let's just stay like this.

234
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,120
Fang, Fang Xian...

235
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,880
Your hand...

236
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,080
My dear,

237
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,420
let me hold you for a while.

238
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,920
Alright then.

239
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:02,880
Welcome.

240
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,680
Welcome, please come in.

241
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,640
After Fang Xian arrived,

242
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,280
Kan Meiyuan indeed became difficult to deal with.

243
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,040
Miss,

244
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,100
please have a seat.

245
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,570
What a coincidence to see you here, Miss Meiming.

246
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,320
Young Master Liu,

247
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,320
you're really supporting our business, aren't you?

248
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,600
You haven't given up

249
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,720
on the proposal, have you?

250
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,580
Miss Meiming, you're certainly straightforward.

251
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,890
As for the proposal,

252
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,720
it's best to let nature take its course.

253
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,780
Why should I stoop to being a villain?

254
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,760
That's easy for you to say.

255
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,440
In Runzhou,

256
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,440
you're overshadowed by your mediocre elder brother.

257
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,920
Without any support,

258
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,760
I'm afraid that in the future,

259
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,960
the inheritance will never fall to you.

260
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,010
Are you really not worried?

261
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,200
Miss Meiming,

262
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,360
it seems you've specifically investigated my affairs.

263
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,600
I'm truly honored.

264
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,400
Of course.

265
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,260
When someone suddenly comes to propose,

266
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,570
I naturally need to be well-informed.

267
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,680
Although I'm overshadowed by my elder brother in the Liu family,

268
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,040
I've been in business for many years

269
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,760
and have built up some resources.

270
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,600
Nothing is set in stone yet.

271
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,120
Fortunes can change in an instant.

272
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,560
Nothing is certain yet.

273
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,400
Miss Meiming,

274
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,090
you think so too, don't you?

275
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,480
I heard your sister

276
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,810
has been causing a lot of trouble for your Kan family lately.

277
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,120
True friends are hard to find.

278
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,640
If you need any help,

279
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,400
I'll be sure to lend a hand.
