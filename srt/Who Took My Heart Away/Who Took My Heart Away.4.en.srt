1
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,480
Yi Shuo.

2
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,560
Fang Xian.

3
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,240
That thing I gave you yesterday,

4
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,520
can you give it back to me?

5
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,320
What thing?

6
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,280
That letter.

7
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,490
Letter? Letter?

8
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,360
This one?

9
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,120
Yes.

10
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,280
What's inside?

11
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,440
Don't. Give it to me.

12
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,680
Why?

13
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,640
Are you going to give it to me or not?

14
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,400
I won't.

15
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,050
Give it to me or not? I won't.

16
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,160
Give it to me.

17
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,520
Hurry.

18
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,560
I said I won't give it to you.

19
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,240
Give it. I won't.

20
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,960
You give it.

21
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,600
Give it to me. I won't.

22
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,050
Divorce papers.

23
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,530
Why did you give me divorce papers?

24
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,880
If I give you the divorce papers,

25
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,410
are you going to divorce me?

26
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,240
Are you?

27
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,320
I won't give them to you.

28
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,450
You've gone too far.

29
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,360
Fang Xian.

30
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,280
Grandfather.

31
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,160
Grandfather knows you two are a loving couple,

32
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,720
but to start like this early in the morning,

33
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,960
look at this mess.

34
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,640
Here, take it.

35
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,660
These are divorce papers.

36
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,360
What does this mean?

37
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,800
This is outrageous!

38
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,360
Do you know

39
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,720
that your marriage

40
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,040
was a long-standing agreement between me and his grandfather, Fang Banxia?

41
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,480
How can you, Kan Meiyuan, think

42
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,160
you can end it with just a word?

43
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,340
Grandfather, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

44
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,120
Fang Xian,

45
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,840
here's what we'll do.

46
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,560
I promise

47
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,760
I will definitely give you an explanation for this matter.

48
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,520
Meiyuan,

49
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,240
I want you to swear in front of your grandfather

50
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,200
that in this life and the next,

51
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,240
you will never divorce your husband.

52
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:38,640
What?

53
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,560
I, Kan Meiyuan, hereby swear today

54
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,920
that in this life and the next, I will never divorce my husband.

55
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,560
If I break this vow,

56
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,240
may heaven strike me down with lightning

57
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,800
and may I never know peace.

58
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,860
What nonsense are you talking about?

59
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,160
Now you can rest assured.

60
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,600
Meiyuan has sworn in front of me.

61
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,200
As for you,

62
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,079
you can show your skills at the Tianxiang Pool.

63
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,240
If that's the case,

64
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:59,170
don't blame me for being impolite.

65
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,360
This young couple.

66
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,220
Their relationship seems pretty good, doesn't it?

67
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:20,880
Young Master,

68
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,730
I've been waiting for you here for a long time.

69
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,120
Feng Qingyang.

70
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,159
Young Master,

71
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
I'm doing this all for your own good.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,400
Antidote, antidote! Give me the antidote!

73
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,200
Young Master,

74
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,820
I'm just a pharmacist.

75
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,640
if you keep shaking me like this,

76
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,640
you'll break my neck.

77
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,840
You have the nerve to call yourself a pharmacist.

78
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,520
You concocted a drug that even stripped me of my martial arts skills.

79
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,280
Like this,

80
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,280
how can I still be the Shadow Master?

81
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,680
Don't worry, Young Master.

82
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,680
The time hasn't come yet.

83
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,480
When the time comes,

84
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,960
I will definitely provide you with the antidote.

85
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,440
You're being mysterious again.

86
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,240
Young Master,

87
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,960
tell me,

88
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,240
besides losing all your martial arts skills, are there any other side effects?

89
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,440
I'll make a note of it.

90
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,560
There actually is.

91
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,320
Go on.

92
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,760
I'll try it out on you.

93
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,680
Can we switch bodies?

94
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,120
Switch bodies?

95
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,360
Tell me more about it.

96
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,560
Young Master,

97
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,960
no, no, no.

98
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,240
Qingyang, don't go!

99
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,680
My dear,

100
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,600
Why have we acquired so many storefronts?

101
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,730
What's the purpose?

102
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,720
You don't understand, do you?

103
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,360
Business at Tianxiang Pool has been booming lately.

104
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,400
Expansion is inevitable.

105
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,600
we're expanding?

106
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,320
expanding to the opposite side of Tianxiang Pool?

107
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,480
How else are we supposed to lose money?

108
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,360
You don't get it.

109
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,200
I'm planning to build a training hall.

110
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,880
I want to awaken the martial spirit in our citizens,

111
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,010
just like that esteemed official did.

112
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,680
That esteemed official?

113
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,600
Ting Yu.

114
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,400
Wait a moment.

115
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,520
Does my wife

116
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,850
already have someone in her heart?

117
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,800
How did you know, son-in-law?

118
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,200
Have you met that person?

119
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:24,200
Actually, I've only heard the young lady mention him.

120
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,280
It's said that he

121
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
is chivalrous, benevolent, and commands respect from heroes.

122
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,200
He's truly a dragon among men.

123
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,820
I'll take my leave now.

124
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,560
Then it's not me.

125
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,520
After all,

126
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,800
the Shadow Master's appearance is rumored to be terrifying.

127
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,520
I'd better perform well then.

128
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,360
Ting Yu.

129
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,159
tell me.

130
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,800
How did the dilapidated shop I bought at a high price

131
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,320
end up like this?

132
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,240
Miss,

133
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,480
I actually think a shop like this

134
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,320
is worth buying at a high price.

135
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,040
No,

136
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,659
but I'm supposed to be losing money here.

137
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,160
Well...

138
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,560
My dear,

139
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,560
you're here.

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,800
Fang Xian.

141
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,760
What have you done this time?

142
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,560
I.

143
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,680
I just made a small contribution.

144
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,880
however, time was limited.

145
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,920
this is the best I could do under the circumstances.

146
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,720
My dear,

147
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,560
but now, opening on schedule

148
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,640
is definitely not a problem.

149
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,440
Don't worry.

150
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,200
Alright, alright, alright.

151
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,480
So, we're opening, right?

152
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,280
Tingyu.

153
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,240
make an announcement.

154
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,039
The Kan family's training hall opens today.

155
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,840
Admission fee.

156
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,169
Fifty taels per person.

157
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,840
What?

158
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,520
You've done so much for me.

159
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,250
Don't you deserve fifty taels?

160
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,720
My dear,

161
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,640
I know you care about me,

162
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,570
but this isn't worth it.

163
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,760
You deserve it.

164
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,720
you really deserve it.

165
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,120
My dear wife,

166
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,360
You don't really have to do this for me,

167
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,680
setting such a high price for our training room.

168
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,400
I only made a small contribution.

169
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
It's not worth it.

170
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,760
Don't think that just because you've sworn on my body,

171
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,290
I won't dare to divorce you.

172
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,240
The Kan family's business,

173
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,480
since when do you have a say in it?

174
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,440
Can this way of doing business really work?

175
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,800
You're so smart.

176
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,740
You're so smart that you only brought one umbrella to pick someone up.

177
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,000
Or do you think

178
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,720
that such a small gesture as picking me up

179
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,920
would move me?

180
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,200
Childish.

181
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,640
If you catch a cold from this,

182
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,290
you'd deserve to drop dead.

183
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,160
My dear,

184
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,920
are you worried about me?

185
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,800
Oh, so you brought two umbrellas after all.

186
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,640
You deliberately took out only one.

187
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,440
Fang Xian,

188
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,760
you're quite calculating, aren't you?

189
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,800
My dear,

190
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,840
I didn't mean to gain sympathy.

191
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,120
I just... Miss.

192
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,960
I want to take this chance to get closer to you, miss.

193
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,600
Miss,

194
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,320
Wait a moment.

195
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,050
Has something happened again?

196
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
Is it about the training room again?

197
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,420
Have you made a lot of money again?

198
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,960
Is it something Fang Xian has stirred up again?

199
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,040
My dear,

200
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,210
What have I done?

201
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,080
Did you go to the training room today?

202
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,840
No, I didn't.

203
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,320
Okay.

204
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,240
I want to see today

205
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,040
who exactly is ruining my plans.

206
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,600
Miss,

207
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,760
wait for me.

208
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,920
It's alright.

209
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,660
It's fine, don't block my way.

210
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,880
Don't mind me.

211
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,240
Don't worry about me.

212
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,900
You all continue practicing.

213
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,880
I just came to ask

214
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,680
how everyone today

215
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,480
feels about the service in our practice room

216
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,200
Are you satisfied?

217
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,160
Miss,

218
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,420
your preferences are quite simple and easy to understand.

219
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,320
That's right,

220
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,720
I'm the owner of this establishment,

221
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,920
and I wanted to ask you all

222
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,920
if there's anything you're not satisfied with.

223
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,160
Go ahead, speak up.

224
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,520
Don't hide anything from me.

225
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,720
If you have any requests, I'll do my best to accommodate them.

226
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,480
Alright?

227
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,320
Understood, understood, understood.

228
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,780
Understood, understood.

229
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,080
My dear, look.

230
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,140
it's so dirty here.

231
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,520
This cleaning is far from thorough.

232
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,410
Today is our first day of business.

233
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,120
because I'm happy,

234
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,720
I'd like to treat everyone to a drink.

235
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,580
How about that?

236
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:55,560
Good.

237
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,760
Good, good, good.

238
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,320
So, my dear has this kind of preference.

239
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,560
It's settled then, alright?

240
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,040
Tonight, we won't leave until we're drunk.

241
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,840
Should I start practicing then?

242
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,040
Son-in-law,

243
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,760
it's alright.

244
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,220
The young lady has always been this shallow.

245
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,880
I'll drink it all.

246
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,520
Feel free to do as you please.

247
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,480
Be careful, be careful, be careful.

248
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,290
Enjoy your meal and drinks.

249
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,480
My legs hurt so much.

250
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,600
My dear wife,

251
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,460
how about I give you a massage?

252
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,340
You know how to give massages?

253
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,840
Would you like to try?

254
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,000
You're a grown man, after all.

255
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,400
I didn't expect you'd enjoy giving massages to women so much.

256
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
So, my dear wife,

257
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,810
do you care more about that person?

258
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,560
What?

259
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,460
Why do you care so much about that person?

260
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,080
I just want to know who is so lucky

261
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,800
to have gained your favor.

262
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,280
Perhaps I am indeed not as good as that person,

263
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,120
but you surely dislike even more

264
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,770
a husband who gives up when faced with difficulties.

265
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,400
Since I have already become your husband,

266
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,000
I have an advantage over him.

267
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,540
I won't lack the courage to fight for you.

268
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,680
You like that person's chivalrous deeds

269
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,010
and charitable nature.

270
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,480
Then I will do a thousand times better than him,

271
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,010
ten thousand times better.

272
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,520
You, you...

273
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,010
Why are you doing this to yourself?

274
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,000
Moreover, my dear, you are not a commodity

275
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,760
to be passed around.

276
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,280
If you were to leave me,

277
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,160
it would only be because I didn't try hard enough.

278
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,000
Why wouldn't you deserve

279
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,400
a better husband?

280
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,680
If I have you, I'm fortunate;

281
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,970
if not, it's my fate.

282
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,000
Your feelings for me,

283
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,480
where do they come from?

284
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,490
From the moment I first saw you.

285
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,860
Shadow Master.

286
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,800
My lady.

287
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,740
Hurry, my lady.

288
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,160
Get out.

289
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:45,960
My lady.

290
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,480
My lady.

291
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,280
I don't know why this happened either.

292
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,640
But I will take responsibility.

293
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,480
My lady, it's over.

294
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,400
it's over, it's over.

295
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,440
How could I mistake Fang Xian for the Shadow Lord?

296
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,040
How can I be worthy of the Shadow Lord like this?
