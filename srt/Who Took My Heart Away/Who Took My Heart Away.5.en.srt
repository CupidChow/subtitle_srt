1
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,600
Yi Shuo.

2
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,200
My lady.

3
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Hurry, my lady.

4
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,400
Get out.

5
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,360
My lady.

6
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,720
My lady.

7
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,479
I don't know why this happened either.

8
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,000
But I will take responsibility.

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,880
How could I have mistaken Fang Xian for Ying Zhu?

10
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,960
How can I be worthy of Ying Zhu now, my lady?

11
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,600
My lady.

12
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,400
Please don't do anything foolish.

13
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,920
I don't know why this happened either.

14
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,960
But you must believe me.

15
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,760
I will definitely be a responsible person.

16
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,560
Fang Xian.

17
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,039
I don't need you to take responsibility for me.

18
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,680
Today,

19
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,560
I don't know why

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,920
this happened.

21
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,840
But we're not from the same world.

22
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,160
You might long for a harmonious and happy family,

23
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,960
but that's not what I aspire to.

24
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,440
Let's just

25
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,840
pretend today never happened.

26
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,300
I don't really long for these things either.

27
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,280
Look,

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,800
now you want to change for me again.

29
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,130
The things you long for.

30
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,480
Why do you have to be like this,

31
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,760
loving others so humbly?

32
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,620
That's why I think you're not as good as that person.

33
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,480
Now that we've made things clear,

34
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,810
even though I made a vow,

35
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,840
I will still divorce you.

36
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,600
If you feel there's any resentment,

37
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,680
I don't mind.

38
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,460
You can go find that person in your heart.

39
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,240
But the person I like in my heart

40
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,280
is you.

41
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,240
My dear daughter,

42
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,040
I didn't know business could be done this way.

43
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,840
When you first opened that training room,

44
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,160
I thought you were just playing around.

45
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,920
I didn't expect

46
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,600
that this training room would not only make money,

47
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,240
but also

48
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,320
boost the business of our Tianxiang Pool.

49
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:20,840
You see,

50
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,280
after those customers finish their training, they're all sweaty,

51
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,880
and then they come to our Tianxiang Pool to bathe and change clothes.

52
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,940
Isn't this called bundled business?

53
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:32,320
I knew it,

54
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,980
you're Kan Xiang's daughter.

55
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,840
Impressive.

56
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,890
This kind of method,

57
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,900
only you could come up with it.

58
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,000
If I could come up with it, I wouldn't do it anymore.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,800
What?

60
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,740
It's nothing, it's nothing, Father.

61
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,600
Are you feeling particularly reassured about me now?

62
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,680
Of course!

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,600
Your words are enough for me.

64
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,720
I've come up with a brilliant plan.

65
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,360
What brilliant plan?

66
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,400
Miss,

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,010
Is this the new massage area you've built?

68
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,680
How is it?

69
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,480
Miss,

70
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,880
you've finally decided to run the business properly.

71
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,410
How could that be possible?

72
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,200
This is my spur-of-the-moment strategy to squander money.

73
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,540
Think about it.

74
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,280
Our Kan family has been in business for three generations.

75
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,280
As long as nothing unexpected happens,

76
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,880
even if the business is poorly managed for a while,

77
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,120
there won't be any major problems, right?

78
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,040
And now we're launching new services.

79
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,880
We have massage and acupuncture.

80
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,480
We'll decorate it in the most luxurious way.

81
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,400
We'll set the prices as high as possible.

82
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,480
These are different from things like gourmet training rooms.

83
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,520
It's not the same.

84
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,400
As long as our service is poor,

85
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,560
the negative reviews will flood in.

86
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,600
We'll definitely lose money day by day.

87
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,530
Don't you think?

88
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,840
Miss,

89
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,880
your determination to squander the family fortune is really...

90
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,360
Won't this affect

91
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,880
the important matter of Marquis Yanqing's audience with the emperor after his bath?

92
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,120
Of course it will.

93
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,080
That's why

94
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,400
you need to work hard

95
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,520
to help me quickly get rid of my status as the heir.

96
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,480
This way, Meiming can

97
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,520
properly prepare for Marquis Yanqing's matter, right?

98
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,280
Stupid.

99
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,400
Young master,

100
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,800
Madam actually opened

101
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,560
a new massage area for you.

102
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,520
It must be because she knows

103
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,720
your massage skills are exceptional.

104
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,840
You're overthinking it.

105
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,840
Welcome.

106
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,100
Come this way, please.

107
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:52,960
Alright.

108
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,200
Now, your first assessment begins.

109
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,340
Get ready to start.

110
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,920
Alright.

111
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,400
Those who persevere to the end

112
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,240
will be eliminated.

113
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,440
The rest will advance to the next round.

114
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,640
No,

115
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,200
Miss, this is

116
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:48,920
This...

117
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,720
What's wrong?

118
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,040
We're looking for masseuses,

119
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,159
not strongmen.

120
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,000
If they use too much force

121
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,600
and hurt a customer,

122
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,000
who will be responsible?

123
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,880
It seems

124
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,800
to make some sense.

125
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,240
Alright, now let's begin the second round.

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,730
Use your fingers to poke the paper in front of you.

127
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,040
Those who failed are eliminated.

128
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,640
The remaining ones can go sign contracts with our people.

129
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,770
Meeting adjourned.

130
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,360
Miss,

131
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,880
I can understand the massage just now,

132
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,440
but for foot massage,

133
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,760
doesn't it still require some strength?

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,080
What do you know?

135
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,720
Although those acupoints have a long history,

136
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,800
foot massage is something new.

137
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,720
If the pressure is too strong and something happens to the customer,

138
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,360
we'll be blamed for it.

139
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,320
Yes.

140
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,800
Is that so?

141
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,240
My dear,

142
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,160
don't worry.

143
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,040
I won't interfere this time.

144
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,240
At least you have some

145
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
self-awareness.

146
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,360
You're mine from now on.

147
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,320
I wonder what she's doing now.

148
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,200
Does she miss me?

149
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,760
But

150
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,440
I miss her so much.

151
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,360
I wish she could appear in front of me.

152
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,040
Qingyang,

153
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,680
if you ever imitate my voice again

154
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,840
or read my inner monologue,

155
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,640
I promise you'll be missing limbs next time.

156
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,440
Young Master,

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,840
you used to

158
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,400
be someone who could take a joke.

159
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,930
That was in the past.

160
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,000
Young Master,

161
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,080
you've been dreaming about her all this time.

162
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,120
Now that you're married to the lady,

163
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,320
shouldn't you be happy?

164
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,410
Unfortunately, the goddess is indifferent.

165
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,560
Yes.

166
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,080
Then.

167
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,420
Young master, young master, wait for me!

168
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,840
Tingyu.

169
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,800
Tomorrow, you must promote our foot massage.

170
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,520
publicize it extensively,

171
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,800
promote it as exaggeratedly as possible.

172
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,660
Did you hear me?

173
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,400
Okay, I understand.

174
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,080
Let me tell you,

175
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,520
I've already thought it through.

176
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,920
Everything is part of my plan.

177
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,850
So you've really been calculating all along.

178
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,800
I knew it.

179
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,600
You've never given up all this time.

180
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,560
Of course I won't give up.

181
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,360
It's what I've always been pursuing.

182
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,840
Don't worry, Meiming.

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,520
Just get your seat ready,

184
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,280
wait for the surprise I have for you.

185
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,000
Alright.

186
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,440
Then I'll wait and see.

187
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,560
She's angry.

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,080
I don't know.

189
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,640
Young master,

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,040
What exactly happened between you and the madam?

191
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,040
Are you really

192
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,340
breaking off the engagement?

193
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,490
It's not like I have any say in this matter.

194
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,640
Oh, by the way, young master,

195
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,900
the Jinyi Merchants' Association has contacted us again.

196
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,200
They were the ones who wanted to cut ties with us before.

197
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,720
I was just going along with their wishes.

198
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,920
After all,

199
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,080
we and Yingshao are of the same lineage.

200
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,120
The Jinyi Merchants' Association

201
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,240
still needs some of Yingshao's

202
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,650
under-the-table tactics,

203
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,650
don't you think?

204
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,000
Regardless,

205
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,280
the Yingshao of today

206
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,920
is no longer the Yingshao of the past.

207
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,080
Besides, those elders in the Jinyi Merchants' Association

208
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,600
are all getting on in years.

209
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,130
They still need others to clean up after them.

210
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,800
Young master.

211
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,890
That man just now was Fang Xian.

212
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,000
It really is him.

213
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,640
Then you'd better get ready.

214
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,440
Yes.

215
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
You seem to be in a good mood, my lady.

216
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,720
Of course.

217
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,680
A big task is about to be completed.

218
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,240
I'm naturally in high spirits.

219
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,960
Don't worry.

220
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
After it's done,

221
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,840
I'll make it up to you.

222
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,440
Being able to spend these days with you, my lady,

223
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,200
has been the happiest time for me.

224
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,930
I don't need any compensation.

225
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,360
I won't feel at ease if I don't give you some compensation.

226
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,280
My lady,

227
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,360
you haven't really started to like me, have you?

228
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,560
How is this possible?

229
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,570
Why did we switch again?

230
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,160
God, what kind of joke are you playing on me?

231
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,640
My dear,

232
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,600
Maybe this means we're destined to be together.

233
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,560
Don't give me that.

234
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,400
Hurry up and switch us back.

235
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,330
I really have important matters to attend to lately.

236
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,960
Sister,

237
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,480
your surprise really shocked me.

238
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,940
So what if you're shocked?

239
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,480
Can't you see we're busy?

240
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,920
Shameless behavior in broad daylight.

241
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,360
Looks like you've thought of your next move, huh?

242
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,680
Bring it on then.

243
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,960
My dear,

244
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
let's continue.

245
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,820
If you're feeling shy,

246
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,800
why don't you close your eyes?

247
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,860
I'll take the lead.

248
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,330
Meiyuan, Fang Xian.

249
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,880
Hold on a moment.

250
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,960
Come with me.

251
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,850
The old master wants to see you.

252
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,730
Now give me a perfect explanation.

253
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,720
Why

254
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,480
in just three short days,

255
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,160
Tianxiang Pool has lost 60% of its customers?

256
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,800
Grandfather,

257
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,520
don't go soft now.

258
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,080
Speak up, will you?

259
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,240
Fine.

260
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,050
Starting tomorrow,

261
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,440
all affairs of Tianxiang Pool

262
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,760
will be managed by Meiming.

263
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,120
Furthermore,

264
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,520
the Kan family seal

265
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,900
will also be temporarily entrusted to Meiming.

266
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:46,840
Kan Meiyuan,

267
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,560
do you

268
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,160
accept this?

269
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,880
I accept.

270
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,880
Also,

271
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,520
I know

272
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,040
that you two

273
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,720
still haven't consummated your marriage.

274
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,040
This marriage

275
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,000
was probably

276
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,600
my wishful thinking all along.

277
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:36,760
My wife,

278
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,160
Why did my heart suddenly ache?

279
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,800
But I haven't fallen for him.

280
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,080
At most, I just feel sorry for him.

281
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,240
After all,

282
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,080
he's been innocent throughout this whole affair.

283
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,960
Fang Xian,

284
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,960
this marriage

285
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,520
ends here.

286
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,760
Treat everything that happened before

287
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,400
as if it never happened.

288
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,600
Well,

289
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,280
let it be so then.

290
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,240
A live-in son-in-law being divorced,

291
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,760
life won't be easy for him from now on.

292
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,560
Grandfather,

293
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,480
why don't we give Fang Xian some silver

294
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,210
and let him return to Rongshan?

295
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,530
It could be considered compensation.

296
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,340
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

297
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,720
Kan Meiyuan,

298
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,520
have you misunderstood?

299
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,600
I never said

300
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,640
that Fang Xian should leave this family.
