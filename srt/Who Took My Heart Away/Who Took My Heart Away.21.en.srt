1
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,600
Yi Shuo.

2
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,000
Ji Ying.

3
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,770
I originally thought you were just a bit jealous.

4
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,760
for so many years, I've been turning a blind eye.

5
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,960
you've never settled down.

6
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,480
And now you've done something like this again.

7
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,200
How can you face me?

8
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,120
How can you face the Kan family?

9
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,240
Master, I know I was wrong.

10
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:20,960
Master,

11
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,280
I know I was wrong.

12
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,920
Please forgive me.

13
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,120
For the sake of my years of diligent service,

14
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,920
I was just confused for a moment.

15
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,760
Master,

16
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,520
Master,

17
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,160
Meiyuan,

18
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,480
Meiyuan,

19
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,440
For the sake of me being the second wife.

20
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,280
Please plead for Second Mother.

21
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,680
Meiyuan.

22
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,040
Wrong is wrong.

23
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,079
Master Kan.

24
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,520
what the Second Madam did this time

25
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
is unforgivable.

26
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,079
Father,

27
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,560
mother was indeed wrong this time.

28
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
I won't make excuses for her either.

29
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,960
But blood is thicker than water after all.

30
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,840
Please allow me to continue supporting her

31
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,900
and spare her life.

32
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,440
Look at this,

33
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,920
this is your own daughter.

34
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,080
How righteous she is.

35
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,840
And you?

36
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,960
You wretch!

37
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,840
You wretch! You wretch!

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,800
Master,

39
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,200
Master, please give me another chance. Silence!

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,000
Master.

41
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,720
Let's go.

42
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,120
Meiyuan.

43
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,840
Husband,

44
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,200
the show is over.

45
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,040
Let's go home.

46
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,800
The doctor clearly said

47
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,840
Grandfather would wake up in a few days.

48
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,400
How many days has it been now?

49
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,600
Don't worry, my dear.

50
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,880
Grandfather's complexion has improved a lot.

51
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,880
He will surely be blessed by heaven.

52
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,680
My dear,

53
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,320
Do you really not plan to reconcile with your father-in-law?

54
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,040
After all,

55
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,520
My dear,

56
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,560
what's wrong?

57
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,320
I just want to look at you more.

58
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,440
My dear,

59
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,660
you're up so early.

60
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,480
Fang Xian,

61
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,880
even if you're dissatisfied with my second mother,

62
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,440
you shouldn't do such things.

63
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,440
Making our family a laughingstock for the whole city.

64
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,880
As a son-in-law of the Kan family,

65
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,120
you knew about the Kan family scandal,

66
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,000
yet you still used me to spread it widely.

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,520
It's clear you just want to seize the family fortune.

68
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,580
Profiting from it.

69
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,200
Do you know your mistake?

70
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,320
My dear wife,

71
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,840
what's wrong with you?

72
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,680
Wife?

73
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,760
Who's your wife?

74
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,840
You've done such a thing,

75
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,480
you've already violated the Seven Outs.

76
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,280
Fang Xian,

77
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,040
I'm divorcing you today.

78
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,440
Miss,

79
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,600
it's not that serious.

80
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,800
Really, it's not that bad.

81
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,160
The young master's hot spring business has just started.

82
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,680
If you divorce him now,

83
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,760
how will we revive the Kan family?

84
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,640
What do you mean 'the young master's'?

85
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,120
From the day he entered this house,

86
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,080
everything he owns belongs to the Kan family.

87
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,680
Even if he's divorced and sent away today,

88
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,810
the Rongshan Hot Springs still belong to our Kan family.

89
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,760
My dear,

90
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,440
Since you've already made up your mind,

91
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,320
I can leave.

92
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,480
You're right,

93
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,580
everything I have belongs to you.

94
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,760
if you want it,

95
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,440
it's yours. However,

96
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,500
is this really how you want to do this?

97
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,440
Are you finished?

98
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,360
Get out!

99
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,960
My wife's sudden change in temperament

100
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,560
must have a reason behind it.

101
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,160
Tingyu,

102
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,360
take good care of your mistress.

103
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,040
It seems I have no choice but to go along with this for now.

104
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,840
Young master,

105
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,640
Miss.

106
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,650
It's way too quiet here.

107
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,840
Indeed.

108
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,920
My blade is almost rusting.

109
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,480
Have you seen

110
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,780
Feng Qingyang?

111
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,440
Who's Feng Qingyang?

112
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,400
Who are you?

113
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,960
He's your manager.

114
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,880
Isn't this the Yingshao branch?

115
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,960
How do you know this is Yingshao?

116
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,640
Who are you with?

117
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,480
Everyone, calm down.

118
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,010
Feng Qingyang is my butler.

119
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,160
You say the manager is your butler.

120
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,090
Then aren't you our Shadow Master?

121
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,400
Indeed, I am.

122
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,360
Stop talking nonsense here.

123
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,740
You dare to provoke our Yingshao.

124
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,240
You must have a death wish.

125
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,320
Oh, right.

126
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,960
Where's the shopkeeper?

127
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,640
The shopkeeper knows me too.

128
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,760
Our shopkeeper

129
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,840
is always away on business these few days every month.

130
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,200
You don't even know this.

131
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,400
Yet you pretend to be our Shadow Master.

132
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,320
Get lost now.

133
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,000
Where has that Qingyang boy run off to again?

134
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,120
My dear,

135
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,570
how are you feeling?

136
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,200
Sister,

137
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,560
brother-in-law has already left.

138
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,440
Why did you do this?

139
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,080
It's nothing.

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,920
Keeping it bottled up like this

141
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,720
isn't good for you at all.

142
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,800
Are you worried that the Marquis still holds a grudge?

143
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,640
And then using this opportunity of bathing before an audience with the Emperor

144
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,800
to take revenge?

145
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,400
I'm just worried.

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,200
After all, bathing before an audience with the Emperor is no small matter.

147
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,440
If the Marquis of Yanqing really has other plans,

148
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,280
I'm afraid we won't be able to escape this time.

149
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,240
So,

150
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,960
you divorced your brother-in-law because...

151
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,840
No matter what,

152
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,980
this is our Kan family's debt.

153
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,880
I just hope

154
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,320
if we can't escape,

155
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,210
Fang Xian won't be implicated.

156
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,080
He has already suffered a lot for me.

157
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,280
These matters

158
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,730
shouldn't be his burden to bear for me.

159
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,600
Greetings, Your Excellency.

160
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,400
You may rise.

161
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,810
Where is your live-in son-in-law?

162
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,680
Fang Xian has committed one of the seven grounds for divorce.

163
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,810
I have divorced him.

164
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,360
Is that really so?

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,160
Impressive move.

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,920
Please, Your Excellency, change your clothes first.

167
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,580
I'll have someone escort you to the hot springs.

168
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,930
This way, Your Excellency.

169
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,000
Miss, Miss.

170
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,440
Here we go again.

171
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,400
Nothing good ever comes when you call like that.

172
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,560
Go ahead, what is it?

173
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,200
Brother,

174
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,560
you promised to play with us today.

175
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,680
You can't break your promise.

176
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,560
Alright, alright.

177
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,360
At least let me freshen up first.

178
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,640
Where's the auntie from last time?

179
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,300
Why didn't she come this time?

180
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,120
She...

181
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,160
She's been a bit busy lately.

182
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,840
But she'll definitely come to visit in a while.

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,130
However, you need to learn to call her 'sister' instead.

184
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,520
Qingyang.

185
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,240
Qingyang.

186
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,800
Qingyang.

187
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,040
Young Master.

188
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,760
Qingyang.

189
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,000
Qingyang.

190
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,440
What's wrong with you?

191
