1
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,080
Yi Shuo.

2
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,600
Yi Shuo.

3
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:44,200
Miss,

4
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,440
don't be angry anymore.

5
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,400
This is outrageous! This is outrageous!

6
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,860
I must divorce my husband.

7
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,840
Just say that Fang Xian is affecting Tianxiang Pool's business.

8
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,120
Miss,

9
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,360
are you sure?

10
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,490
What has Fang Xian done?

11
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,960
Everyone, there's no need to rush.

12
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,600
Kan family's Tianxiang Pool has prepared

13
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,440
enough delicious food for everyone.

14
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,320
There's no need to fight over it.

15
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,720
I guarantee no one will be shortchanged.

16
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,000
If everyone is satisfied,

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,520
please be sure to visit our Kan family's Tianxiang Pool often.

18
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
Good, good, good.

19
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,800
There are still such suckers in this world.

20
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,200
Ten taels and you can eat as much as you want.

21
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,000
Ten taels.

22
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,200
Ten taels is still a bit expensive, isn't it?

23
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,160
What are you thinking?

24
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,840
These are all abalone, sea cucumber, shark fin, and fish maw.

25
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,170
And it's unlimited too.

26
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,360
If your stomach is big enough,

27
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,400
you can eat until the Kan family goes bankrupt.

28
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,480
Let's go eat.

29
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,200
Let's go, let's go.

30
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,240
My dear,

31
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,680
Keep it up.

32
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,440
Why aren't you keeping an eye on the dining area?

33
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,040
What are you looking at here?

34
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,360
I'm admiring the night view.

35
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,600
What's so special about this view?

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,320
I've been looking at it for over a decade.

37
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,520
Well, I've only been here for a few days.

38
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,720
Is the night view of Rongshan beautiful?

39
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,380
I'd like to go there and see it.

40
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,700
Of course, it's not as beautiful as here.

41
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:45,480
Besides, the night view isn't the only beautiful thing here.

42
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,840
There's also the person I've been thinking about.

43
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,960
You really live up to being a live-in son-in-law.

44
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,040
Such a smooth talker.

45
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,100
I'm not being smooth-tongued at all.

46
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,680
Every scene,

47
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,000
becomes unique because of the people in it.

48
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,600
and stands out from the rest.

49
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,120
Your night view, my dear,

50
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,200
will also change because of certain people.

51
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,200
Let's have a taste of the rich young lady.

52
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,040
Miss,

53
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,040
don't be afraid.

54
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,000
It's safe now.

55
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,680
I am the Master of Shadow Sentinels.

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,760
Miss,

57
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,480
how are you?

58
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,720
How much money did you lose today?

59
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,360
I made a net profit of 300 taels today.

60
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,840
I knew it.

61
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,560
just

62
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,760
made a profit.

63
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,960
made a profit.

64
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,920
My dear, you're here.

65
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,560
I made your favorite fermented rice balls.

66
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,320
Try some.

67
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,400
I won't eat them.

68
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,640
Don't try to butter me up.

69
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,400
I want to ask you something.

70
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,760
How did you make so much money?

71
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,440
I...

72
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:33,880
I...

73
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,240
I've told you before,

74
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,520
you must use genuine ingredients.

75
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,200
You can't use inferior goods as substitutes.

76
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,159
The Marquis of Yanqing is about to have his audience with the Emperor soon.

77
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,480
You can't use our Kan family name

78
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,240
to do such things.

79
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,520
My dear, you...

80
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,280
You've misunderstood.

81
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,920
How dare I disobey your instructions?

82
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,240
You know I have a passion for cooking, right?

83
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,880
So there are some shopkeepers I'm familiar with.

84
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,640
When they saw me making such large purchases,

85
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:55,720
they gave me more favorable prices.

86
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,520
I have receipts for everything.

87
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,400
Meiyuan.

88
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,520
You two have really given me a huge surprise.

89
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,650
Surprise my ass.

90
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,080
surprise, surprise, surprise.

91
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,880
Fang Xian.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,240
I know you have high standards,

93
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,760
but if you set your expectations too high,

94
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,520
it will only add unnecessary pressure.

95
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,160
You've already broken our Tianxiang Pool's

96
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,240
revenue record for the past thirty years.

97
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,520
Even your grandfather praised you,

98
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,200
saying you're impressive.

99
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,400
Keep up the good work.

100
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,880
Meiyuan,

101
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,200
grandfather said he wants to reward you.

102
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,640
Let's go,

103
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,480
let's go home for dinner.

104
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,120
Okay.

105
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,120
Wait a moment.

106
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,620
Fisherman's house

107
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,330
You should understand what I mean, right?

108
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,960
Rest assured, Miss Meiming.

109
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,400
The fish I sent to Fang Xian

110
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,200
will definitely be hard for the guests to swallow.

111
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,159
Fang Xian, oh Fang Xian,

112
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,920
I'm just waiting to see

113
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,080
how you'll handle this move of mine.

114
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,840
Son-in-law,

115
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,480
stop joking with me.

116
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,760
I'm very busy.

117
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,280
Ting Yu

118
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,320
I've already told you I'm your young mistress.

119
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,920
Stop calling me son-in-law.

120
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,680
Son-in-law,

121
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,840
I'm really busy.

122
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,120
And the things you're saying

123
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,040
are very strange

124
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,360
are very strange and unbelievable.

125
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,960
Fine if you don't believe me.

126
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,440
In any case,

127
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,240
we can't let Fang Xian have any goods to buy tomorrow.

128
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,300
If this continues,

129
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,480
I'll really become the heir.

130
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,640
No matter what happens with the heir,

131
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,200
it won't fall to you.

132
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,480
You can rest assured.

133
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,250
Don't cause trouble here. Get out.

134
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
You seem to be in a good mood, sister.

135
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,880
Meiming.

136
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,760
Good evening.

137
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,440
We both know the nature of this marriage.

138
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,800
Using Fang Xian's background.

139
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,200
Aren't you afraid of hurting his feelings?

140
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,520
Husbands and wives help each other.

141
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,160
How can you call it using someone?

142
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,220
Besides, Fang Xian knows about this.

143
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,880
although his abilities are limited,

144
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,409
he's willing to contribute what he can for me.

145
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,360
What a clever tactic.

146
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,100
You've never even met him,

147
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,040
yet Fang Xian is so willing to give everything.

148
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,560
Does he know

149
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,000
that you have someone else in your heart?

150
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,500
My wife has someone else in her heart?

151
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,560
So you didn't tell him.

152
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,840
You swore to me before

153
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,040
that you wouldn't marry anyone but that person.

154
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,970
Now you're having Fang Xian marry into the family for the inheritance.

155
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,480
It seems that in the future,

156
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,440
there will be quite a show to watch.

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,480
My wife's beloved

158
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,440
could it be me?

159
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,920
Can Fang Xian make this fish taste good?

160
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,400
Fang Xian.

161
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,800
It seems that besides me,

162
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,530
someone else is targeting you.

163
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,130
You can't blame me for this now.

164
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,680
What is this thing?

165
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,000
It tastes terrible.

166
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,680
Refund! We must get a refund!

167
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,240
My dear,

168
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,320
you don't need to worry about this matter.

169
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,840
I'll think of a solution.

170
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,240
Think of a solution?

171
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,320
What solution could there be?

172
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,840
If we don't give the customers an explanation,

173
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,970
our reputation will surely be ruined.

174
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,080
Indeed, my arrangements might not be effective.

175
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,400
I didn't think it through.

176
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,040
What's going on with your Muchi?

177
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,680
Yes, exactly!

178
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,520
We need an explanation.

179
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,240
Refund!

180
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,000
Spending ten taels of silver to eat this?

181
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,260
Let's just report it to the authorities.

182
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,640
Little fishes,

183
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,800
would you like a bigger fish tank?

184
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,280
Darling.

185
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,120
Darling.

186
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,250
Why are you pointing a mirror at me?

187
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,440
Darling.

188
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,760
It's me.

189
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,220
Why didn't you come home to sleep last night?

190
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,880
It's none of your business.

191
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,410
I'll sleep wherever I want.

192
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,440
I'm just worried you won't rest well here.

193
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,090
I don't mean to control you.

194
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,660
What are you doing?

195
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,520
It's nothing.

196
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,520
I'm just afraid that

197
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,520
we haven't switched for too long,

198
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,240
so I wanted to take this chance to switch back.

199
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,680
If you want to switch back,

200
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,610
you can't just kiss me when I'm not paying attention.

201
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
As you wish, my lady.

202
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,920
But could you please let go first?

203
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,720
You're pinching your own face.

204
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,960
Miss, young master,

205
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:14,720
something's wrong!

206
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,380
There's a commotion outside.

207
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,200
It's only noon,

208
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,330
and they're already fighting?

209
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,720
My lady.

210
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,320
Your family wasn't like this before.

211
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,720
What's going on now?

212
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,160
My dear,

213
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,160
You don't need to worry about this matter.

214
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,600
I'll think of a solution.

215
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,440
Solution?

216
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,880
Letting fish into the bathing pool,

217
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,040
offending customers,

218
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,840
our Kan family's reputation is about to be ruined.

219
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,240
Indeed,

220
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,400
my arrangement might not have been effective.

221
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,860
I didn't think it through.

222
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,400
See how I'll divorce you this time.

223
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,130
Since things have come to this,

224
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,040
please take this.

225
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,300
Why are you giving it back now?

226
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,680
My dear,

227
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,290
since this matter was caused by me,

228
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,280
I should naturally bear the responsibility alone.

229
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,080
Everyone,

230
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,520
if you have any questions,

231
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,580
feel free to ask me.

232
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,480
At first, I was quite uncomfortable,

233
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,520
but unexpectedly,

234
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,960
the little fish nibbling on my legs

235
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,490
doesn't hurt or itch at all.

236
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,500
Even the dead skin is gone,

237
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,520
it's like a peeled egg.

238
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,240
What's going on with your bathing pool?

239
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,360
Why is it only the men's pool

240
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,680
that has the fish massage pool?

241
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,800
Arrange one for us quickly,

242
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,260
or we'll file a complaint.

243
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,720
These fish were all arranged by our young lady

244
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,320
who came back this morning to set it up.

245
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,720
We really don't know the specific details.

246
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,480
Quickly arrange one for us too!

247
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,720
Give me a few big ones!

248
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,240
We want a massage too!

249
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,800
How this situation has developed

250
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,640
is not at all what I expected.
