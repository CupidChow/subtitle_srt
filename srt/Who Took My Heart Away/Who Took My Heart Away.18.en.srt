1
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,440
Yi Shuo.

2
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,600
Yi Shuo.

3
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,640
Adapted from Tomato Novel.

4
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,700
Where on earth are you?

5
00:01:47,039 --> 00:01:47,840
Fang Xian.

6
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,280
My dear wife,

7
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,800
I thought I'd never see you again in this lifetime.

8
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,600
Who do you think you're looking down on?

9
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,000
I promised you I'd come back,

10
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,400
and I definitely would.

11
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,040
What delicious food have you made today?

12
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,040
It's your healing medicine.

13
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,040
No.

14
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,840
I...

15
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,760
I've been drinking it for almost half a month.

16
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,400
Why do I still have to drink it?

17
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,200
My dear,

18
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,560
you lost a lot of blood when you were injured last time.

19
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,360
If you don't take proper care of yourself,

20
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,680
there will be endless troubles in the future.

21
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,940
Can I stop drinking it?

22
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,280
It's too bitter.

23
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,200
This medicine...

24
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,800
It can treat external injuries.

25
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,130
and ensure your wounds won't leave scars.

26
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,920
What's wrong with having scars?

27
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,579
Are you complaining about it?

28
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,079
Here.

29
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Take another sip.

30
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,330
One more sip.

31
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,160
Okay, that's enough.

32
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,000
That's good.

33
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,399
My dear,

34
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,800
what's wrong?

35
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,690
Are you still thinking about those stolen goods?

36
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,640
It's all because of those bandits who have no honor.

37
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,880
They relied on their numbers,

38
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,480
and even resorted to ambush and encirclement.

39
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,840
Are you alright?

40
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,159
Look at you.

41
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,480
You're injured yourself.

42
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,440
Yet you're still only focused on taking care of me.

43
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,240
Actually,

44
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,000
these injuries are

45
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,409
not a big deal for me.

46
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,600
Don't try to comfort me.

47
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,600
If you hadn't married into the Kan family,

48
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,659
you wouldn't have to endure all this.

49
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,560
I'm the one who's harmed you.

50
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,720
Suffering such a small hardship

51
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,480
to gain such a wonderful wife,

52
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,659
I wouldn't mind

53
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,700
making this kind of deal a few more times.

54
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,440
Wait a moment.

55
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,920
What do you mean by 'come a few more times'?

56
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,880
Is one wife not enough?

57
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,040
You want more?

58
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,280
Darling,

59
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,980
I didn't mean it like that.

60
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,040
Oh, right.

61
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,280
How's Tianxiang Pool doing lately?

62
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,800
Miss?

63
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,200
Miss?

64
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,520
I thought something bad had happened to you.

65
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,960
You scared me to death.

66
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,040
If you really threw yourself at your miss,

67
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,240
that's when you'd really be in trouble.

68
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,760
I'm fine.

69
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,840
Alright, she's fine.

70
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,200
really, I'm fine.

71
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,280
Don't worry.

72
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,640
So,

73
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,740
my father has entrusted Tianxiang Pool to Meiming.

74
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,400
I've already put the official seal

75
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,080
in a safe place.

76
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,760
They probably haven't found it yet.

77
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,960
However, given the current situation,

78
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,880
even if we have the seal in our possession,

79
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,440
we still won't be able to get Tianxiang Pool back.

80
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,520
It's all my fault for not catching those bandits.

81
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,600
Otherwise, we would have been able to find

82
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,880
the key to the problem.

83
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,800
Don't worry about this, my dear.

84
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,840
I've already asked Yingshao for help.

85
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,500
You even know about Yingshao?

86
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,200
Young Master.

87
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,720
Of course I know.

88
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,240
Don't step on my chair.

89
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,300
Get down right now.

90
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,080
It's the young master.

91
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,840
I am Feng Qingyang.

92
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,920
Greetings, madam.

93
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,360
Who are you?

94
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,640
It's the grand finale.

95
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,440
Madam doesn't recognize me yet.

96
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,720
I am Feng Qingyang.

97
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,080
I'm the young master's butler.

98
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,880
I also serve as

99
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,840
one, two,

100
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,040
I hold multiple positions.

101
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,700
I'm the young master's most capable assistant.

102
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,480
Where have you been, you rascal?

103
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,720
The antidote, give me the antidote.

104
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,600
Don't tell me again that the time isn't right.

105
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,200
Young master,

106
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,240
the time has come.

107
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,520
I've brought you the antidote.

108
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,240
Don't rush.

109
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,520
Where's the antidote?

110
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,680
Young master, I was just joking with you.

111
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,210
The antidote is right here.

112
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,480
Are you kidding me again?

113
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,920
Young Master,

114
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,160
This antidote method is absolutely true.

115
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,240
Whether it's the loss of your martial arts skills

116
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,720
or the side effects of body swapping with your wife,

117
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,720
it will cure the ailment instantly.

118
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,050
Never mind that,

119
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,120
what season is it now?

120
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,000
Where am I supposed to find peach blossoms?

121
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,560
Young Master, have you forgotten?

122
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,159
This is Rong Mountain after all.

123
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,570
Twelve three-year-old yellow chickens.

124
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,560
take the chicken wings,

125
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,040
roast them with honey,

126
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,170
and smell the aroma.

127
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,720
A jar of osmanthus wine,

128
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,840
a jar of plum wine,

129
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,220
and a jar of grape wine.

130
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,240
Boil with Lulin bamboo charcoal,

131
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,610
and smell the aroma.

132
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,920
Young master,

133
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,520
you have never disappointed me.

134
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,560
Your culinary skills are excellent.

135
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,240
I'll help myself.

136
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,920
You're not really teasing me, are you?

137
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,800
Roasted chicken wings,

138
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
boiled fine wine,

139
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,040
can detoxify,

140
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,560
and I can't even eat them.

141
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,200
I can only smell the aroma.

142
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,460
It's absolutely true.

143
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,480
Just complete this final step.

144
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,000
Drink the dew from peach branches at 5:30 AM,

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,860
and your powers will be restored.

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,560
This place is shrouded in mist,

147
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,960
with spring-like weather all year round.

148
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,919
No wonder peach blossoms bloom here.

149
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,740
So you're sneaking food here.

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,799
My dear,

151
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:38,679
you're back.

152
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,440
My lady,

153
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,480
you've come at the right time.

154
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,240
Next,

155
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,320
let's witness

156
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,960
Ying.

157
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,460
You don't need to tell my wife about this.

158
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,280
You don't need to tell me anything anymore.

159
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,080
Fang Xian.

160
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,360
You're hiding something from me.

161
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,280
My dear, you're overthinking.

162
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,320
I wouldn't dare.

163
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,200
Qingyang, you tell me.

164
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,940
There's really nothing going on.

165
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,120
My dear,

166
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,020
You are the Shadow Master.

167
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,920
I'm not.

168
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm not.

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,800
Congratulations, young master.

170
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,600
Regain my powers.

171
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,680
Return to my peak as the Shadow Master.

172
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,160
I

173
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,680
The bath salts my wife lost.

174
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,810
The Shadow Whistle has sent back news.

175
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:33,720
No.

176
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,560
Then why didn't you say so from the beginning?

177
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,800
The identity of the Shadow Master is sensitive.

178
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,640
The more you know, the more dangerous it becomes.

179
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,560
Besides, I didn't know

180
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,400
that the person you admired at first was the Shadow Master.

181
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,000
And with my martial arts skills completely lost,

182
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,060
it was even more impossible to prove.

183
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,120
Then why did you deny it just now?

184
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,520
Well, before,

185
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,060
I was pretending to be myself in front of you.

186
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,120
It would have been too embarrassing to admit it.

187
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,720
I don't know what to say about you.

188
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,120
With a personality like yours,

189
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,050
I really don't know how you became the Shadow Master.

190
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,280
It's all because of that guy's trouble.

191
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,080
Young Master,

192
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,560
don't be so modest.

193
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,080
I still remember

194
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,250
that moonlit night.

195
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,360
Young Master,

196
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,000
it's getting late.

197
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,700
You should rest early.

198
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,680
Qingyang,

199
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,820
I went down the mountain today

200
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,640
and heard that Brother Hu's field

201
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,570
was inexplicably requisitioned.

202
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,560
Young Master.

203
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,720
Grandma Chen's grandson

204
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,280
died on the battlefield,

205
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,360
not only is the compensation nowhere in sight,

206
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,240
but he's also been labeled as a deserter.

207
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,160
This world,

208
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,680
is it really alright?

209
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,720
Young Master,

210
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,200
do you really

211
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,800
want to change this world?

212
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,440
If it's possible,

213
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,180
that would be nice.

214
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,680
At first, the Shadow Whistle

215
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,200
was just a department I had Qingyang establish for the Brocade Robe Merchant Association

216
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,800
to gather intelligence.

217
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,080
By the time its reputation soared,

218
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,080
the Shadow Whistle had already become

219
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,400
the top assassin organization in the Wu Dynasty.

220
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,120
And I

221
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,480
somehow became the Shadow Master.

222
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,120
When you killed Song Kang before,

223
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,000
I heard what you said to him

224
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,200
and felt that

225
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,680
you and the person I admired

226
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,840
were so similar.

227
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,320
It seems fate is truly mysterious.

228
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,640
I hated the idea of marrying you so much back then

229
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,280
instead of marrying the Shadow Master,

230
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,210
only to find out after all this time

231
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,360
that you are actually the Shadow Master.

232
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,160
Perhaps

233
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,960
it's not just fate.

234
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,450
What do you mean?

235
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,640
It seems you really don't remember.

236
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:32,480
Ten years ago,

237
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,360
we had already met.

238
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,520
Stinky Fang Xian.

239
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,720
Jinx.

240
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,160
Cursed his parents to death and now his wife.

241
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,240
stinky Fang Xian.

242
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,400
jinx.

243
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,320
cursed his parents to death and now his wife.

244
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,280
What are you doing?

245
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,880
Don't you dare bully anyone from our Kan family.

246
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,400
What do you mean 'your Kan family'?

247
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
He's just staying at your place temporarily, isn't he?

248
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,160
Even if he's staying temporarily, he's still part of our family.

249
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,240
I can't stand you bullying the weak.

250
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,040
If anyone dares to bully him again,

251
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,640
they'll have to deal with me.

252
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,960
I'll protect you from now on.

253
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,890
Don't be afraid.

254
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,900
Tell me if anyone bullies you.

255
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,480
My mother said,

256
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,280
Fang Xian is a jinx.

257
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,080
he caused the death of his own parents.

258
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,960
Sooner or later, his wife will also die because of him.

259
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,080
Nonsense.

260
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,880
When I grow up, I'll marry him.

261
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,980
Let's see if he can cause my death too.

262
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,920
Miss,

263
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,360
it should be 'marry' instead of 'be married to.'

264
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
Stop talking nonsense.

265
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,840
I said marry, so marry it is.

266
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,200
Just you wait and see.

267
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,320
I remember now.

268
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,240
Later, an old grandfather came and took you away.

269
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,900
And then I never saw you again.

270
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,760
That was my grandfather,

271
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,720
Fang Banxia.

272
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,050
It was because of you

273
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:40,320
that I learned the strong should protect the weak.

274
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,240
That's why I established the matchmaking agency.

275
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,040
And you,

276
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,840
it was because of your admiration that you wanted to marry me.

277
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,600
No matter how twisted the path was,

278
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,800
it was ultimately you

279
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,330
who brought me to your side.

280
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,240
Is that so?

281
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,280
But,

282
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,560
on our wedding day,

283
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,760
you weren't planning to agree at first.

284
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,920
I know very well

285
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,960
that Kan Meiming wasn't married at that time either.

286
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,600
If my father-in-law had made a wrong match,

287
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,680
causing me to miss you,

288
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,340
I would have regretted it for the rest of my life.
