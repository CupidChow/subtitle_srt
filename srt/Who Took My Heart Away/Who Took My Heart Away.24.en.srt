1
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,560
Yi Shuo.

2
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,880
Big brother.

3
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,440
Yes.

4
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,640
Which brother?

5
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,759
Sister, what's wrong with you?

6
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,800
my reaction...

7
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,580
Could it be that you're pregnant?

8
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,080
Ting Yu.

9
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,200
Ting Yu.

10
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,240
Tell me.

11
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,930
What's really going on?

12
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,640
Previously, I was asked to travel around.

13
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,440
Now, I'm being urged to return to Taizhou.

14
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,240
This Feng Qingyang really knows how to run this young master ragged.

15
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,320
Stop!

16
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,250
Who on earth are you people?

17
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,400
I'll have you know I'm a Shadow Sentinel assassin.

18
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,280
We are all Shadow Sentinel assassins.

19
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,440
But I am the leader of the Shadow Sentinels.

20
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,120
It's you, the leader of the Shadow Sentinels, that we're after.

21
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,400
What's gotten into all of you?

22
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,060
Has the Taizhou branch collectively rebelled?

23
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,160
You all.

24
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,100
Do you remember me?

25
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,640
Uncle.

26
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,560
Kan Xiang, Uncle Kan.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,600
But I've forgotten how I met you.

28
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,640
I only remember that you're Uncle Kan.

29
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,280
Well...

30
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,850
Let's go through the formalities.

31
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,360
Let me tell you.

32
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,079
Our Kan family and your grandfather, Fang Banxia,

33
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:45,600
arranged a marriage for you two since childhood.

34
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,800
I can't believe this.

35
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,960
What era are we living in?

36
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,320
Just based on a marriage contract,

37
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,880
to force your daughter to marry me,

38
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,720
it's not appropriate, not appropriate at all.

39
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,850
Strictly speaking,

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,400
you're the one marrying my daughter.

41
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,260
So I'm marrying into your family?

42
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:58,800
Well then,

43
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,000
take a look at my daughter

44
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,060
and see if you can remember anything.

45
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,480
Which one?

46
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,800
It can't be the pregnant one, can it?

47
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,399
she looks

48
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,959
like she wouldn't have trouble getting married.

49
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,290
Why is she in such a hurry to find a husband?

50
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,680
It's not me.

51
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,880
Our young lady is the one marrying you.

52
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,680
What?

53
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,600
She's already pregnant and you want me to marry your daughter?

54
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,800
You're the one marrying our young lady.

55
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,640
What nonsense is this?

56
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,800
I know everything that happened.

57
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,280
everything else can be discussed,

58
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,600
but this child is yours.

59
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,480
You have to take responsibility.

60
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,760
The child is mine?

61
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
I've never even met you.

62
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,159
You're spewing lies.

63
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:50,360
I have someone I love.

64
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,890
What do you mean?

65
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,360
We're in this situation now.

66
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,320
Are you trying to back out of the engagement?

67
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,880
No.

68
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,880
Of course not.

69
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,840
Think carefully.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,930
Have we ever properly performed a wedding ceremony?

71
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,160
And then?

72
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,600
So...

73
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,850
Would you like to have a proper wedding ceremony?

74
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,040
Has your housekeeper led you astray?

75
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,200
You've actually started caring about these ceremonial things.

76
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,000
No.

77
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,600
I just want our marriage to be...

78
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,120
legitimate and proper.

79
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,200
beyond reproach.

80
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,040
You...

81
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,610
will forever be my wife, Fang Xian's wife.

82
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
But wait.

83
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,840
Given our current situation...

84
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,520
isn't it a bit difficult?

85
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,080
The moon shall be our witness.

86
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,920
I am Fang Xian.

87
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,320
Kan Meiyuan.

88
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,540
Today we are joined in matrimony.

89
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,960
May our lives be filled with many twists and turns,

90
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,640
yet I will always gaze upon you.

91
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,960
The husband shall be as firm as a rock,

92
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,440
the wife as pliant as a reed.

93
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,440
In life, we may dwell in separate rooms,

94
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,680
in death, we shall share the same grave.

95
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,880
If you doubt my words,

96
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,880
let the bright sun be my witness.

97
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,400
May heaven and earth bear witness to our deep love.

98
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,640
This life,

99
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,800
unchanging.

100
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,640
Who is your beloved?

101
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,240
Yes.

102
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,920
yes.

103
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:30,560
yes.

104
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:32,960
yes.

105
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,880
You're the one who knowingly faced danger.

106
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,560
You still rushed to save her without regard for your own safety.

107
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,280
You're the one who would rather be hurt and sad yourself,

108
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,940
the one who couldn't bear to see her suffer even the slightest bit.

109
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,400
I don't know when it started.

110
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,480
It was just an ordinary, unremarkable day.

111
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,760
But suddenly, because of a bowl of chicken soup,

112
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,080
I was in tears.

113
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,250
I clearly remember someone telling me

114
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,740
that I deserve all the best in this world.

115
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,240
But I can't remember his face at all.

116
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,040
Fang Xian,

117
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,840
I know you must feel the same way as I do.

118
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,960
even if everyone tries to hide the truth from us,

119
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,960
even if drugs have made us forget,

120
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,520
from the moment I saw you,

121
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,280
I knew.

122
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,840
It was you.

123
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,720
You've done so much for me,

124
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,000
but you can only forget and be forced to forget.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,080
It's so unfair to you.

126
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,480
Fang Xian.

127
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,360
Take a good look at me again.

128
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,640
Do you really not remember who I am?

129
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,640
You are...

130
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,080
Lin Wan.

131
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:48,960
Who?

132
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,159
I am your wife.

133
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,159
Kan Meiyuan.

134
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,320
That's why,

135
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,160
a person's memories,

136
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,360
because they are infused with strong emotions,

137
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,760
don't become a patchwork of fragmented scenes.

138
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,520
These memories may fade,

139
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,360
but the feelings

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,320
won't.

141
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,159
Fang Banxia,

142
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,960
I believe you can see from the afterlife,

143
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,000
and you must have seen

144
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
that even without my appearance,

145
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,920
these two

146
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,680
were destined to be together.

147
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,320
Besides Old Master Fang Banxia,

148
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,840
you are the second

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,120
senior I sincerely admire.

150
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,240
You have good taste.

151
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,560
Of course.

152
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,680
Who told you to sit down?

153
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,480
Stand up.

154
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,320
My daughter and son-in-law are sitting,

155
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,180
while I, the father, am standing.

156
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,570
It's too embarrassing.

157
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,480
Now you realize you've lost face.

158
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,400
Think about all the things you've done in the past.

159
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,040
I'm being generous by not making you kneel.

160
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,970
Stand properly.

161
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,080
Think about the recent times,

162
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,520
all that our family has been through.

163
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,840
Your father and I have discussed,

164
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,760
Indeed,

165
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,520
it's time to pass on the Kan family business

166
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,480
to you younger generation.

167
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,080
How about this,

168
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,160
let's hand over Tianxiang Pool to...

169
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,120
Grandfather,

170
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,770
let's give Tianxiang Pool to my sister and brother-in-law.

171
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,040
It's just Tianxiang Pool.

172
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,960
I'm confident I can start from scratch.

173
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Besides,

174
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,140
hasn't my brother-in-law not received a dowry yet?

175
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,440
Although that's true,

176
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,240
Grandfather,

177
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,760
my wife and I have already discussed it.

178
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,620
The hot springs we run in Rongshan

179
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,960
are doing quite well.

180
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,680
Let's have Meiming manage Tianxiang Pool.

181
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,920
Sister,

182
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,440
Meiming,

183
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,680
please spare me.

184
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,120
You know I don't like doing business.

185
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,800
A family business like Tianxiang Pool

186
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,680
would be wasted in my hands.

187
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,720
Something on the scale of the hot springs,

188
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,580
even if I squander it, it's still the Fang family's.

189
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,400
What exactly do you mean?

190
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,600
Why are you suddenly being so modest with each other?

191
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,400
What,

192
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,520
you think Tianxiang Pool is a hot potato?

193
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,880
Let me tell you,

194
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,400
today you all have to listen to me.

195
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,120
I declare

196
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,650
that Tianxiang Pool

197
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,240
will be managed by

198
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,560
Meiming from now on.

199
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,240
As for Meiyuan and Fang Xian,

200
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,680
you young couple,

201
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,840
just focus on managing the Rongshan hot springs well.

202
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,760
How's that?

203
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,460
Let's settle it this way then.

204
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,820
Don't celebrate too soon.

205
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,160
Let me ask you something.

206
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,800
Aren't you curious to know

207
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,120
why our Kan family has become

208
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,520
so financially strained in recent years?

209
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,000
So Old Master Fang

210
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,800
had already informed Old Master Kan

211
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,320
about the hot springs on Rong Mountain.

212
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,250
He bought the entire Rong Mountain

213
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,160
as a dowry.

214
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,000
Now our Taizhou branch is the only part of Yingshao

215
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,240
that's not focusing on its main business.

216
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,120
The current emperor is wise and diligent in governing.

217
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,680
In the future, the opportunities for Yingshao to be needed

218
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,360
will only become fewer and fewer.

219
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,620
As long as the common people can be happy,

220
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,560
what does it matter if I'm the head of Yingshao or not?

221
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,320
Master,

222
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,400
master,

223
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,280
master!

224
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,520
My wife says that whenever you're this flustered,

225
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,360
it's never for anything good.

226
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,080
Go on,

227
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,960
what is it this time?

228
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,800
This time it's good news.

229
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,130
The young mistress is about to give birth!

230
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,320
Young-

231
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,240
What are you looking at?

232
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,080
The young master has already left.

233
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:30,880
Then I should hurry back too.

234
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,560
No, don't.

235
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,060
It's not like you can give birth for the madam if you go back.

236
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,400
Stay here

237
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,360
and help me

238
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,000
attend to the guests.

239
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,680
Go on, go on,

240
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
go on, go on, go on!

241
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,200
Let's go.

242
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,000
My dear,

243
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,720
How are you doing?

244
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,090
keep going, my dear!

245
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,240
you can do it!

246
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,080
push harder!

247
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,960
Easy for you to say.

248
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,760
You're not the one giving birth.

249
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,250
If I had known...

250
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,920
if I had known giving birth would be this painful,

251
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,720
I would never have fallen in love with you.

252
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,280
I hate you so much right now.

253
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,560
I wish I could give birth for you,

254
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,640
but I'm a man.

255
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,040
It's okay, it's okay.

256
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:21,880
It's alright.

257
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,160
Come here, you!

258
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,160
This young couple doesn't know when to behave.

259
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,200
Listen.

260
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,080
Why has Meiyuan's crying stopped?

261
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,480
I hope nothing unexpected has happened.

262
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,010
T-t-this can't be, Father.

263
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,450
What's Fang Xian doing?

264
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,840
There's not a sound coming from inside.

265
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,520
Father, Grandfather,

266
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,120
don't worry unnecessarily.

267
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,320
My sister has been under my brother-in-law's care for months.

268
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,640
I'm sure both mother and child are safe.

269
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,160
Exactly.

270
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,280
How would you know? You've never given birth.

271
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,000
Look at you.

272
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,680
Have you given birth then?

273
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,200
Alright, alright.

274
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,120
stop arguing.

275
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,640
Let's do this.

276
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,200
We can't just keep waiting like this.

277
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:05,960
Meiming,

278
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,080
go inside quickly and check on your sister.

279
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,600
That's right.

280
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,400
Hurry, hurry!

281
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,560
Fang Xian,

282
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,560
why did you come out?

283
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,560
Why aren't you inside with Meiyuan?

284
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,320
That's right.

285
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,200
It's okay, it's okay.

286
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,260
It'll be over soon.

287
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,720
My dear,

288
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,760
Even if you want me to give birth for you,

289
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,840
you could at least keep me company.

290
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,440
No.

291
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,080
This...

292
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,840
You're Meiyuan.

293
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,360
The one giving birth in there is

294
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,720
your live-in son-in-law,

295
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,760
Fang Xian.

296
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,060
I guess that works too.

297
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,560
You're really something, aren't you?

298
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,680
Hang in there, brother-in-law!

299
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,520
It's all up to you now!

300
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,120
Now I'm not worried anymore.
