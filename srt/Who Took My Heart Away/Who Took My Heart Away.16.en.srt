1
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,600
Yi Shuo.

2
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,890
Father-in-law.

3
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,280
Everything is negotiable.

4
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,320
Some things can't be taken back.

5
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,200
That's right, Father.

6
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,720
All these years of father-daughter bond.

7
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,920
Do you really intend to turn a blind eye?

8
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,600
Who's really turning a blind eye?

9
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:56,960
Hurry.

10
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,759
As soon as you see the Marquis of Yanqing, kneel down first.

11
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,640
you rushed to acknowledge your kin.

12
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,800
What do you think?

13
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,400
Kan Meiyuan.

14
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,560
I...

15
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,400
No...

16
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,240
Father...

17
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,759
What do you mean?

18
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,920
You're asking me what I mean?

19
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,800
What do you mean?

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,800
Couldn't you wait even for a moment?

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,000
It was me.

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,500
I've raised you for so many years.

23
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:24,720
Running off to the Marquis of Yanqing's mansion to acknowledge your kin.

24
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,360
I...

25
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,280
Back then, when your mother married into the Kan family,

26
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,079
she was pregnant not long after.

27
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,680
I thought I was lucky.

28
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,560
So that wretched woman knew.

29
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,840
Back then, the Marquis of Yanqing hadn't made his fortune.

30
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,720
She came to me to raise her daughter.

31
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,680
Father-in-law, please stop.

32
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,340
Don't call me father-in-law.

33
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,680
What?

34
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,560
You still want to stand up for them?

35
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,820
Can't you see this is a good opportunity?

36
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,640
After you two got married,

37
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,040
the business of Tianxiang Pool

38
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,680
has always been barely surviving.

39
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,740
Our Kan family's working capital is already in crisis.

40
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,560
Tell me, you two,

41
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,720
how can you still be so extravagant?

42
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,020
I was counting on you, my son-in-law,

43
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,250
to revive the family business.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,720
You...

45
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,120
You are the Marquis of Yanqing's

46
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,720
people sent to cause trouble in our Kan family.

47
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,400
The Kan family's working capital is insufficient.

48
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,480
How come I didn't know?

49
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,840
How could you not know?

50
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,960
Otherwise, how come every time

51
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,090
the Kan family almost takes a big fall?

52
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,380
I've been causing trouble for the family all along.

53
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,920
Do I really still qualify to be the Kan family heir?

54
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,840
Nonsense!

55
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,840
Grandfather.

56
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,300
Please don't get excited.

57
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,640
Kan Xiang.

58
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,000
Stop pretending

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,720
to be so smart.

60
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,240
A bit of unfounded rumor,

61
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,840
and you believe it to be true.

62
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,600
Is Meiyuan really

63
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,760
of our Kan family bloodline?

64
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,480
How could I not see it?

65
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,440
Even I, as her father, am not sure.

66
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,900
How can you, as her grandfather, be certain?

67
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,720
What did you say?

68
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,440
You unfilial son, say that again!

69
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,560
Fine, Grandfather.

70
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,120
Today, I must... Grandfather...

71
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,519
Grandfather!

72
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,959
Father, do you really want to anger Grandfather to death?

73
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,880
Kan Xiang,

74
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,840
remember this.

75
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,880
The Kan family seal, no matter what,

76
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,240
belongs to my good granddaughter.

77
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,080
No one can take it away.

78
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,640
Unless...

79
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,880
Unless I'm dead.

80
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,560
Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa!

81
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,120
Grandpa!

82
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,560
Someone come quickly! Go find a doctor!

83
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,520
Help! Grandpa!

84
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,240
Grandpa! Grandpa, what's wrong?

85
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,800
Grandpa!

86
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,280
You stayed with me all night.

87
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,520
Thank you.

88
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,800
You're awake.

89
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,320
How did you sleep?

90
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,760
You're asking me?

91
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,040
Why aren't you sleeping in your room?

92
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,640
Can you sleep well here?

93
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,680
So much happened yesterday.

94
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,620
I want to keep you company.

95
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,600
You don't have to hold it in.

96
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,680
It's just me here.

97
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,600
I really...

98
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,200
...don't deserve to be a daughter of the Kan family.

99
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,120
But nothing really happened between you and the Marquis.

100
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,000
I know.

101
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,970
This has nothing to do with blood ties.

102
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,200
These days, I...

103
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,160
What on earth have I been doing?

104
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,380
In fact, the Kan family has long been in decline.

105
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,920
My father and grandfather are single-minded,

106
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,720
pinning their hopes on me.

107
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,360
They hope I can revitalize the family business.

108
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
But what have I done?

109
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,640
I only know how to play the hero,

110
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,240
roaming the martial arts world.

111
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,040
I...

112
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,720
I even went so far as to deceive them.

113
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,420
I've squandered the family fortune.

114
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,000
I wanted to escape the responsibilities of being an heir.

115
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,320
It was me.

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,120
It was I who pushed my grandfather's life's work

117
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,720
bit by bit towards the edge of the cliff.

118
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,159
My dear,

119
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,610
nobody's perfect, everyone makes mistakes.

120
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,880
In life, we make countless mistakes.

121
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,960
What's rare is

122
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,880
that you feel remorse for your mistakes,

123
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,850
and feel guilty.

124
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,960
This already puts you ahead of many others.

125
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,890
Don't you think?

126
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,080
But what good does guilt do?

127
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,200
Grandfather is seriously ill now.

128
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,130
Father firmly believes I'm the Marquis's daughter.

129
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,640
It's all too late.

130
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,880
How can it be too late?

131
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,970
Have you forgotten what Grandfather said before he collapsed?

132
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,520
As long as you don't give up now,

133
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,020
and try to make amends,

134
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,280
you won't let him down.

135
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,480
Alright,

136
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,480
I'll always be by your side.

137
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,160
It's okay.

138
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,400
It's fine.

139
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,720
Let's tidy up.

140
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,740
I'll wait for you outside.

141
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,560
Um...

142
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,980
Next time, let's sleep on the bed.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Say that again.

144
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,360
Miss,

145
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,100
The master is calling for you.

146
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,680
I'll cut to the chase.

147
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,680
Kan Meiyuan,

148
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,560
There are some things I can pretend not to know,

149
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
but the seal

150
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,400
I hope you'll hand it over.

151
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,920
I know everything now.

152
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,280
The master is being very lenient now.

153
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,520
But we can't just

154
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,040
stand by and watch the seal

155
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,760
fall into the hands of someone with an unknown background.

156
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,690
Father-in-law,

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,920
Meiyuan has been with the Kan family for so many years.

158
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,960
isn't she the granddaughter of the Kan family?

159
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,960
Do we need anything else to prove it?

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,060
Young Master Fang,

161
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,080
we are all married-in sons-in-law.

162
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,240
There are some things

163
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,880
you have no right to speak about.

164
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,140
I don't want to talk about anything else,

165
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,240
but Tianxiang Pool is already in a precarious situation.

166
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,240
It might not even last until the day Marquis Yanqing has an audience with the emperor.

167
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,039
Do you have the ability to protect Tianxiang Pool?

168
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,880
Indeed.

169
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,680
Over the years,

170
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,280
Meiyuan has done nothing but ruin Tianxiang Pool.

171
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,480
What other contributions has she made?

172
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,760
She kept saying she didn't want to inherit, didn't want to inherit,

173
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,400
but now that the old man has fainted,

174
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,600
she immediately shows her true colors.

175
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,960
No matter what,

176
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,040
only Grandfather has the right to take away my seal of authority.

177
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,360
Even if you don't believe me,

178
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,560
you'll have to wait until Grandfather wakes up.

179
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,800
As for Tianxiang Pool,

180
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,640
we've already ordered bath salts for scrubbing.

181
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,440
Once the bath salts arrive,

182
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,360
we can launch Fang Xian's scrubbing service.

183
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,640
That will surely save Tianxiang Pool.

184
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,480
The bath salt production site is in a remote mountainous area,

185
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,120
and cannot be transported by water.

186
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,480
Heaven knows what accidents might happen.

187
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,440
This time, I will personally handle the transportation.

188
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't you all doubt me?

189
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,080
Then I'll prove it to you.

190
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,440
Alright.

191
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,480
I agree.

192
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,000
If that's the case,

193
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,200
then it's settled.

194
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,120
You may go now.

195
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,000
What have you done this time?

196
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,240
Tomorrow is the day Kan Meiyuan

197
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,840
will receive the bath salts.

198
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,540
I've arranged some men

199
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,640
to kill and rob.

200
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,440
How come I never realized before

201
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,640
that your methods could be so ruthless?

202
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,160
Ruthless?

203
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,680
Fighting for family inheritance is always a matter of life and death.

204
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,080
Haven't you ever thought about it this way?

205
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,780
Otherwise, why would you let your sister transport the goods?

206
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,860
You can think that if you want.

207
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,840
The Kan family will soon fall apart.

208
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,120
The weather is getting colder.

209
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,780
Be careful not to catch a cold.

210
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,520
Although the journey isn't too far,

211
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,800
you must find a place to stay when night falls.

212
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,160
There's no need to rush.

213
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,480
And also,

214
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,720
there are many people on the road,

215
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,200
you'd better wear a veil.

216
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,920
To prevent anyone from having ill intentions.

217
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,080
No,

218
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,120
I'm still worried.

219
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,640
Why don't I go with you?

220
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,120
Alright,

221
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,760
I'm not a three-year-old child.

222
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,820
Even Tingyu isn't as dramatic as you.

223
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,920
I'm really worried about grandfather's illness.

224
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,280
I need you to take care of him for me.

225
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,480
Don't be silly.

226
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,360
I can't switch places with you now.

227
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,640
I won't kiss you.

228
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,640
Really...

229
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,000

230
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,280
