1
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:53,440
Yi Shuo.

2
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,560
Yi Shuo.

3
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,360
Bian Zifan.

4
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,840
I really can't understand

5
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,840
what charm you have

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,130
that makes Meiyuan choose you over me.

7
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,840
Because you two are not the same kind of person.

8
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,320
My wife abhors evil,

9
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,880
is generous and kind-hearted,

10
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,200
and always puts the people first.

11
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,960
While you,

12
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,520
to achieve your goals,

13
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,800
deceive both superiors and subordinates,

14
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,080
and don't hesitate to exploit the people and waste resources.

15
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,160
How despicable.

16
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,360
To hear such words from a merchant's son-in-law,

17
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,800
how ironic.

18
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,800
Defining the truth of the world is the power of the strong

19
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,660
and the privilege of the victors.

20
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,240
The weak

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,660
have no right to express their opinions.

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,320
Those who follow different paths cannot work together.

23
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,579
We have nothing more to say to each other.

24
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,640
Kill him.

25
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,240
Look carefully.

26
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
I am your master.

27
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,880
I meant the one who just left.

28
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,640
First,

29
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,880
you are not my master.

30
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,840
Second,

31
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,440
why would I kill my own husband?

32
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,850
You are Kan Meiyuan.

33
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,920
Meiyuan.

34
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,840
Calm down.

35
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,600
I am the Grand Ceremonial Officer.

36
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,640
If you kill me,

37
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,960
aren't you afraid of being caught?

38
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,360
If it were that easy to be caught,

39
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,720
Yingshao would have been shut down long ago.

40
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,650
You're an assassin from Yingshao.

41
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,480
Song Kang,

42
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,680
you heard what Fang Xian just said.

43
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,680
You beat the common people,

44
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,760
waste people's labor and money,

45
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,880
abuse your official power disregarding others' lives.

46
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,280
Your crimes are heinous.

47
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,480
The Grand Ceremonial Officer has perished.

48
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,800
The Shadow Whistle, Eradicator of Evil.

49
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,360
The Grand Ceremonial Officer has perished.

50
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,620
The Shadow Whistle, Eradicator of Evil.

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,000
Sit, sit, sit.

52
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
This glass of wine

53
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,000
is to celebrate our family's

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,640
turn of fortune from bad to good.

55
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,840
It's not that simple.

56
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,240
This time, to avoid losses,

57
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,079
we've invested all our previous profits.

58
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,160
It's already quite good.

59
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,840
Think about it,

60
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,400
we were planning to close down for good before.

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,120
But you know,

62
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,680
the Shadow Whistle, that notoriously evil organization,

63
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,610
actually ended up being a big help.

64
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,240
That's right.

65
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,520
Actually, the Shadow Whistle

66
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,720
might not be as evil as people think.

67
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,120
And the Shadow Master,

68
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,400
maybe he's not so terrifying either.

69
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,080
Who is this Shadow Master?

70
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,600
I have nothing to do with him.

71
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,360
It's not like I'm becoming his in-law.

72
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,360
People like that,

73
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,120
it's best to avoid getting involved with them.

74
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,960
But I-

75
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,960
No buts.

76
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,480
On the day of our reopening,

77
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,920
let's not talk about such unlucky topics.

78
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,850
Come on, come on,

79
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,339
let's drink, let's drink.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,800
My dear,

81
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,760
You've been working hard these days.

82
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,400
Here,

83
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,610
have some more meat.

84
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,280
Madam,

85
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,720
What should we add today?

86
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,159
Add some poison.

87
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,600
Put it all on Kan Meiyuan and her husband.

88
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,840
I don't know what bad luck we're having,

89
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,570
they keep turning danger into safety every time.

90
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,880
Without a kindred spirit to drink with,

91
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,159
how can one truly appreciate the fine taste of wine?

92
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:01,160
Would the lady be willing to honor me with her company?

93
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,720
My dear,

94
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,890
why are you looking at me like that?

95
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,760
Didn't you dislike the Shadow Master?

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,720
You even pretended to criticize him before.

97
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,120
Love me, love my dog, right?

98
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,159
If you like him,

99
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,970
I also hope everyone can change their opinion of the Shadow Master.

100
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,680
I thought

101
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,560
you really understood

102
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,640
the Shadow Master's exceptional qualities

103
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,770
and were planning to back down in the face of difficulty.

104
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,760
When will you give me up too?

105
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,400
No.

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,320
I can compromise on anything,

107
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,560
except for you, my dear wife.

108
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,620
It's not possible.

109
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,760
No one is allowed.

110
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,290
Not even the Shadow Master.

111
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,680
Then why do you know about the Shadow Master?

112
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,160
Have you met him?

113
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,700
Isn't this just following what you said before?

114
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,680
I'm just learning from you.

115
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,160
Fang Xian is getting quite enthusiastic,

116
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,890
he's even starting to act like the Shadow Master.

117
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,200
Wait for me.

118
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,080
Could Fang Xian be the Shadow Master?

119
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,420
But he doesn't know martial arts either.

120
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,340
That's just his disguise.

121
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,200
How stupid.

122
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,200
Didn't we swap bodies before?

123
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,880
We've been to the Taizhou branch, right?

124
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,810
I'll just go and check it out again.

125
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,640
Welcome, please come in.

126
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,360
Welcome.

127
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,160
What excuse should we use for the exchange?

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,800
My dear,

129
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,450
what are you talking about?

130
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,400
You just keep doing your calculations.

131
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,060
Why are you still distracted?

132
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,320
I've almost finished calculating.

133
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,200
If it weren't for the water sealing incident,

134
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,520
you probably would have really achieved

135
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,800
grandfather's goal of ten thousand taels.

136
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,320
I don't want to leave now.

137
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,320
You were so determined before,

138
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,610
why did you suddenly change your mind?

139
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,440
Why did I say what's on my mind?

140
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,920
Look.

141
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,880
It's not like you can only be a hero when you're away from home.

142
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,040
You can do good deeds right here at home too.

143
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,920
This time, I did a good deed

144
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,080
for the people right here at home, didn't I?

145
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,920
Moreover,

146
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,560
I've always wanted Meiming to be the heir.

147
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
But this time, I've realized

148
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,960
things aren't as simple as they seem.

149
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,200
My father is also unreliable.

150
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,370
Is there really no part of it because of me?

151
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,300
What nonsense are you talking about?

152
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,280
If my wife wants to leave home to be a hero,

153
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,680
I will surely follow her wherever she goes.

154
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,840
But I want to know,

155
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,580
is your decision to stay really not because of me at all?

156
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,080
Darling,

157
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,760
you're drinking from my cup.

158
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,760
It's fine.

159
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,960
I'll get another one.

160
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,200
Darling,

161
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,039
I...

162
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,800
Don't flatter yourself.

163
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,000
I promised Grandpa I'd watch the shop for a day.

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,130
Now, as punishment,

165
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,890
you'll do it in my place.

166
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,480
That'll teach you to be so disrespectful,

167
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,080
asking all these questions.

168
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,960
My long journey was not in vain.

169
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,280
I've finally arrived in the city where the Shadow Master resides.

170
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,920
I must serve my idol well.

171
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,360
But how can I find the Shadow Master now?

172
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,480
Given the Shadow Master's power,

173
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,680
I'm afraid it won't be easy to find them.

174
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,320
Should I try my luck at the branch office?

175
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,200
I've finally found you.

176
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,480
Do you know

177
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,480
how much I've suffered

178
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,920
to find you?

179
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,640
Miss,

180
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,680
I think you've mistaken me for someone else.

181
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,400
I don't

182
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,040
know you.

183
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,000
Of course,

184
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,440
how could I not recognize my idol?

185
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,120
I clearly remember

186
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,840
every moment we spent together.

187
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,120
Then tell me in detail.

188
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,200
I'd like to hear

189
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,680
our story.

190
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,770
Have you completely forgotten it?

191
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,040
I want to hear

192
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,360
how you view our relationship.

193
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,120
Idol,

194
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,000
you're finally starting to consider it, aren't you?

195
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,080
Whatever works.

196
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,040
Go ahead,

197
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,130
tell me what kind of person I am.

198
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,920
Am I a shadow?

199
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,720
That's right,

200
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,440
we used to be inseparable.

201
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,010
Chatting and laughing.

202
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,600
and then?

203
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,840
We are the most famous partners in the area.

204
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,800
You are the idol I admire the most.

205
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,720
Great, great.

206
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,440
So you have such romantic debts behind my back.

207
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,160
How can you say that?

208
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,320
If there's a debt to pay, I'll pay it.

209
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,920
I traveled a long way,

210
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,360
just to be united with you.

211
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,600
Master,

212
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,320
look,

213
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,160
since Fang Xian joined our household,

214
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,560
what has happened?

215
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,520
How can he be someone with great abilities?

216
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,450
I'm telling you,

217
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,360
your daughter

218
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,490
has married poorly.

219
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,520
What nonsense are you talking about?

220
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,920
That's my own daughter.

221
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,640
Besides,

222
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,800
this matter of marriage,

223
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,880
how can there be any talk of loss or gain?

224
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,360
Haven't they turned misfortune into good fortune every time?

225
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,200
Can we rely on turning misfortune into good fortune to get by?

226
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,320
If this continues,

227
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,440
not only will our daughter be at a loss,

228
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,360
even Tianxiang Pool will be lost.

229
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,880
Master,

230
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,920
regarding Meiming's marriage,

231
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,680
can we make a decision now?

232
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,680
Not to mention anything else,

233
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,000

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,680
