1
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,600
Yi Shuo.

2
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,560
I just feel something's a bit off.

3
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,300
Are you sure that top-rated masseuse

4
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,200
said all that?

5
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,440
Then they rub and knead vigorously,

6
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,240
and after all that kneading,

7
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,000
That's exactly what he said.

8
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,560
And he seemed very serious about it.

9
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,520
It didn't look like he was making it up.

10
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,690
I can do everything written there.

11
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,480
It's just...

12
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,200
As long as you can do it, that's fine.

13
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,920
This time,

14
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,800
we absolutely cannot lose face

15
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,280
for the Kan family and the Wu Dynasty.

16
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,120
We must win.

17
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,920
To be on the safe side,

18
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,640
has Tingyu found any suitable candidates in their recruitment?

19
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,840
I guess not yet.

20
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:26,240
If she had, that girl would have come to claim credit already.

21
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,920
Fang Xian.

22
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,760
Your hand.

23
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,600
My dear wife,

24
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,220
let me hold you for a while.

25
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,720
Alright.

26
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,560
Young master.

27
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,960
Your eyeshadow...

28
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,840
I...

29
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,290
It's not eyeshadow.

30
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,780
I have something even more exciting.

31
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,020
Let's go, let's go.

32
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,079
What's with your appearance?

33
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,440
How did you end up like this?

34
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,560
I stayed up all night drawing it on.

35
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,280
Those dark circles under your eyes too, huh?

36
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,120
Well, I pulled an all-nighter.

37
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,780
It's normal to have some dark circles, isn't it?

38
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,040
This time it's a matter of great importance.

39
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,800
It concerns my lifelong happiness.

40
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,240
My wife has set up a challenge.

41
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
You must help me.

42
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,760
Don't worry, young master.

43
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,279
No need to be so formal with me.

44
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:20,399
It's my honor to contribute to your lifelong happiness.

45
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,839
It's truly my pleasure.

46
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,800
What are you waiting for?

47
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,680
Come down!

48
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,320
We've grown up together since childhood.

49
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,560
Why are you being shy?

50
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,360
Young master,

51
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,240
this tattoo will come off as soon as it touches water.

52
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,040
I want

53
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,320
to keep it for a while longer.

54
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,640
After all, it looks pretty good,

55
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,570
don't you think?

56
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
You're hopeless.

57
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,400
Today,

58
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,400
Xinda's top technician, Cai Song,

59
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,680
has set up the arena

60
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,560
for the Bathing King competition challenged by the Kan family's main branch.

61
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,690
It's about to begin.

62
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,000
Will the Wu Dynasty's bathing culture prove unrivaled,

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,200
or will Xinda's techniques surpass their predecessors?

64
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,040
Let's wait and see.

65
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,880
Now, the contestants are entering.

66
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:21,320
Good, good, good.

67
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,320
Now I declare,

68
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,920
the competition begins.

69
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,040
Daughter, son-in-law,

70
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,040
are you confident?

71
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,600
The seven-day period is so tight.

72
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,900
Have you found a way to deal with Cai Song?

73
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,720
We managed to recruit a master just in time last night.

74
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,840
whether we can handle Cai Song

75
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,080
is still unknown.

76
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,440
Today's judges

77
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,170
It's this gentleman next to me.

78
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,320
He will decide whose service is superior.

79
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,800
Now, let's welcome Cai Song.

80
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,600
Alright, alright.

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,560
Why is he kneeling down?

82
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,280
I've never seen this kind of massage before.

83
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,000
What about you?

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,400
I haven't seen it either.

85
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,260
He's riding on top.

86
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,320
Relax.

87
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,410
It can't be over, right?

88
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,080
Okay.

89
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,520
Cai Song's service has ended.

90
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:05,040
Now it's time for the Kan family representative to make an appearance.

91
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,360
Good, good, good.

92
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,080
Alright, alright, alright.

93
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,340
You're looking for me?

94
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,360
Yes.

95
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,840
It's your turn to take the stage.

96
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,800
Leave it to me.

97
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,200
Alright, alright, alright.

98
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:22,930
Don't worry.

99
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,760
Are you guys crazy?

100
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,880
Is this really the massage therapist you hired?

101
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,730
Look at those skinny arms and legs.

102
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,000
If you didn't tell me, I'd think he was just a bystander.

103
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,460
He doesn't have the presence of a massage therapist at all.

104
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,280
Please.

105
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,640
Lie down.

106
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,880
This isn't right.

107
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,760
This is only 20% of his strength?

108
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,440
Is it over?

109
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,080
Phew.

110
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,640
Comfortable.

111
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,360
So comfortable.

112
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,240
Good.

113
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,400
Good, good, good.

114
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,010
This guy's got quite a few tricks up his sleeve for a massage.

115
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,360
Now even martial arts masters have fallen so low

116
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,360
that they're seeking re-employment at my bathhouse.

117
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,200
Interesting.

118
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,320
Really interesting.

119
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,600
I wonder how you would evaluate

120
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,000
the service on both sides, which is better?

121
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,320
These two,

122
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,360
they both felt very good to me.

123
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,520
If you ask me,

124
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,280
I'd rate them as

125
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,280
a tie.

126
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,360
Okay, okay, okay.

127
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,440
Wait a minute.

128
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,960
This isn't massage at all.

129
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,280
You brought in a martial arts expert.

130
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,840
It's just a trick.

131
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,920
not every massage therapist

132
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,520
is a martial arts master.

133
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,880
This shows

134
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,560
that as long as we can provide the best service,

135
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,560
our Kan family is willing to pay more.

136
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,090
Even if it means hiring a martial arts master.

137
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,890
That's just sophistry.

138
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,720
Justice is in people's hearts.

139
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,260
Ladies and gentlemen,

140
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,040
What you've seen so far was just the appetizer.

141
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,040
Now, it's time for the main course from our Kan family.

142
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:13,800
Rest assured.

143
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,760
Master Kong,

144
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,000
you

145
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,450
What are you doing here?

146
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,680
I am a chef.

147
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,600
Of course, I'm here to prepare desserts for everyone.

148
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,640
A chef?

149
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,560
This.

150
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,040
Meiming.

151
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,080
Meiyuan is definitely out of options this time.

152
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,940
What's the situation on your end?

153
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,160
Don't worry, Mother.

154
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,930
I've already invited a master.

155
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,000
Once Fang Xian is defeated,

156
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,900
we'll have a way to deal with Cai Song.

157
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,570
Theoretically, it's about right.

158
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,840
It might be a viable approach.

159
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,000
with some appropriate adjustments,

160
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,080
it's worth a try.

161
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,090
What are you talking about?

162
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,360
It's nothing.

163
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,200
Don't worry.

164
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,200
I'll be careful.

165
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,560
This is.

166
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,520
Vinegar.

167
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,320
Noble guest,

168
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,240
only the simplest massage method is needed.

169
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,040
massage with aromatic vinegar,

170
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,000
relaxing the muscle fibers.

171
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,960
Sprinkle fine salt,

172
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,760
rub back and forth,

173
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,520
removing impurities.

174
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,200
Accompanied by dragon fruit,

175
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,360
milk and other food ingredients,

176
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,330
harmonizing the meat texture.

177
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:03,040
A perfect guest has been prepared.

178
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,120
Excellent.

179
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,400
There's going to be quite a show.

180
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,120
Meiyuan.

181
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,800
This Fang Xian.

182
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,400
Isn't he curing meat?

183
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:32,660
Cast

184
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,000
Kan Meiming, Gao Xiaoyu

185
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,260
Ye Yi

186
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,680
Feng Qingyang

187
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,520
Zhou Liaoke

188
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,000
Wang Miaomiao

189
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:33,800
Ting Yu

190
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,320
