1
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,560
Yi Shuo.

2
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,000
Are you saying your injuries haven't healed yet,

3
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,800
or

4
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,080
you just want to enjoy yourself?

5
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,520
My dear,

6
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,600
I have many injuries on my body.

7
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,600
You've seen them with your own eyes.

8
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,600
I'm only doing this to spare you some suffering.

9
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
That's why I don't want you to switch back.

10
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,160
How could you think of me like that?

11
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,760
It's not that I'm unwilling.

12
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,120
I just feel that

13
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,720
this exchange of ours

14
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,840
is the longest we've had

15
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,560
since we've known each other.

16
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm always bathing with your body and such,

17
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,360
it's quite inconvenient.

18
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,160
Is that so?

19
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,520
But why do I hear from Ting Yu

20
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,880
that you've been taking longer and longer baths lately?

21
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,040
And that you've been frequently

22
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,880
touching and feeling my body?

23
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,940
What nonsense are you talking about?

24
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,040
My dear,

25
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,040
my dear,

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,000
I was wrong.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,600
I...

28
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
I truly enjoyed

29
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,280
the time you took care of me.

30
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,320
Silly,

31
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,610
we are husband and wife.

32
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,800
I wouldn't be nice to you just because

33
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,960
we switched bodies.

34
00:02:59,079 --> 00:02:59,880
My dear,

35
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
I understand.

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,090
We've been through so much.

37
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,440
I won't let you leave my side again.

38
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,800
So don't worry,

39
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,960
you don't need to threaten me with body swapping.

40
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,440
I won't divorce you again.

41
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,770
You'll be my live-in son-in-law for life.

42
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,760
Well,

43
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,920
shall we switch back?

44
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,079
Alright.

45
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,120
We still have a long way to go.

46
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,040
Oh, right.

47
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,680
I forgot to ask you something.

48
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,200
Since you took the antidote,

49
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,840
haven't you been unable to switch bodies?

50
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,970
How did you suddenly switch last time?

51
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:03,440
Perhaps

52
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,560
heaven heard my wish to protect you.

53
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,200
My dear,

54
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,340
I'd like to have some of your chicken soup again.

55
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,720
Oh, you!

56
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,839
Now you're already bossing me around.

57
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,959
Alright, you wait here.

58
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,220
I'll go make it for you.

59
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,160
Young Master,

60
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,200
we should leave now.

61
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,500
The side effects of the medicine are about to start.

62
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,000
Meiming, let me go.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,730
This is Big Sister's decision.

64
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,159
Qingyang.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,600
Don't be fooled by how obedient your son-in-law usually is.

66
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,640
He's actually quite picky about food.

67
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,680
Luckily, I secretly learned a thing or two.

68
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,480
Miss,

69
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,920
why did you secretly learn from the son-in-law?

70
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,240
Please don't tell him.

71
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,280
We don't want him to get even more proud.

72
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,360
I'm not like him.

73
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,920
As soon as he arrived at the mansion, he started showing off his cooking skills.

74
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,440
And he made so many dishes.

75
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,600
My dear,

76
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,640
You...

77
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,880
I'm sorry.

78
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,140
Don't come any closer.

79
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,460
What are you doing?

80
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,120
My dear,

81
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,520
I'm just afraid that we...

82
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,380
it's been so long since we switched, so I thought...

83
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
I'd take this chance to switch back.

84
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,440
If you want to switch back,

85
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,000
you can't just try to kiss me when I'm not paying attention.

86
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,840
The Kan family training room opens today.

87
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,640
Admission fee:

88
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,970
fifty taels per person.

89
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,800
What?

90
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,440
You've done so much for me.

91
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,440
And it's not even worth fifty taels?

92
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,720
I'm leaving.

93
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,440
Actually, swapping bodies is quite troublesome.

94
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,690
Fang Xian always ruins things for me at crucial moments.

95
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
but I used to...

96
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
didn't I always want to marry the Shadow Master?

97
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,600
I never thought he would be the Shadow Master.

98
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,080
Can you tell at all?

99
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,640
You say he's usually like that.

100
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,880
He doesn't look anything like a Shadow Master.

101
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,680
He...

102
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,920
what was he like again?

103
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,680
These days...

104
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,140
I've really been a bother.

105
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,320
Alright.

106
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:00,960
Don't see me off.

107
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,720
You should hurry back to take care of Grandfather.

108
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,920
Grandfather just woke up and needs you.

109
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,520
What should we do?

110
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,080
Brother-in-law,

111
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,840
Miss Meiming,

112
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,160
Why are you calling me brother-in-law?

113
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,440
Think about it.

114
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,600
Meiming.

115
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,090
How did I know your name is Meiming?

116
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,400
Why am I on a horse?

117
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,520
I don't know how to ride a horse.

118
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,760
Don't worry, young master.

119
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,600
you now

120
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,200
already know how.

121
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I really can do it.

122
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,840
Faster, faster.

123
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,080
Why am I making soup?

124
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,360
When did I learn to make soup?

125
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,280
Who am I making soup for?

126
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,160
Tingyu.

127
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,480
I...

128
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,240
Why am I like this?

129
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,120
Miss,

130
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,080
it's alright.

131
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,800
Old Master Kan must be sick.

132
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,300
You're worrying too much.

133
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,000
So that's how it is.

134
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,480
But...

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,120
But why do I feel...

136
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,520
like I've forgotten something important?

137
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,560
Who?

138
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,100
Didn't I say not to disturb me?

139
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,080
Young Master,

140
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,000
it's me.

141
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,360
Qingyang?

142
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,620
It seems I've truly grown old.

143
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,320
I can't even see you clearly anymore.

144
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,120
Young Master,

145
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,400
how could you be old?

146
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,360
You can't see clearly only because...

147
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,290
Because of what?

148
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,600
Because...

149
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,320
Why am I crying?

150
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,480
Is it because...

151
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,290
I feel like I've forgotten the most important thing?

152
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,840
Fang Xian.

153
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,480
Body swap.

154
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,720
Meiyuan.

155
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,760
Are you like me,

156
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,880
watched too many plays

157
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,760
and gone crazy?

158
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,520
Master,

159
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,450
What the young master said is true.

160
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,320
The young miss had told me before

161
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,680
about her ability to swap bodies with the young master.

162
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,960
This explains everything.

163
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,400
I was wondering why the young miss

164
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,000
seemed a bit off earlier.

165
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,360
What are the side effects?

166
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,410
That love potion

167
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,320
was something I casually concocted.

168
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,280
The side effects

169
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,160
are sometimes unknown even to me.

170
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,800
Body swapping is just one

171
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,320
of the possible effects.

172
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,920
That day, in order to take my wife's place,

173
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,560
I was captured by the Marquis of Yanqing.

174
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,160
I took the love potion again,

175
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,330
which reawakened the ability to swap bodies.

176
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,760
But I've noticed

177
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,360
I'm gradually forgetting

178
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,560
the experiences I shared with Meiyuan.

179
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,490
I guess it's causing new side effects.

180
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,040
Son-in-law,

181
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,200
Hasn't the young lady always liked Yingzhu?

182
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,400
Even if she forgets you,

183
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,920
she certainly won't forget

184
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,640
that she has always liked Yingzhu.

185
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,760
Isn't that the same?

186
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,960
But once we forget each other,

187
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,540
even if Meiyuan finds me because she likes Yingzhu,

188
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,120
a version of me that doesn't love her,

189
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,520
what's the point of that?

190
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,520
It would only bring more pain.

191
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,520
Whether I can be by her side or not,

192
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,320
I hope that every day of her future

193
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,960
will be happy and joyful.

194
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,010
From now on, please don't mention me anymore,

195
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,130
let my wife forget about me.

196
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,480
Live well.

197
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,840
Why can't I remember?

198
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,480
Hello, miss.

199
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,610
Hello, Miss Kan.

200
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,360
What's going on here?

201
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,170
Was Tianxiang Pool's business always this good?

202
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,600
Well, business is business.

203
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,200
it gets better day by day.

204
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,940
What's so strange about that?

205
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,440
They even have a buffet with the bath service.

206
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,840
No wonder business is so good.

207
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,840
Which genius came up with this idea?

208
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,540
Don't tell me it was my father.

209
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,080
If it were my father with his brain,

210
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,560
he wouldn't have made grandpa faint from anger.

211
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,320
It was me.

212
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,120
Oh, it's Meiming.

213
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,280
I knew it.

214
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,440
I was right about you.

215
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,760
You're more suitable to be the heir than I am.

216
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,560
It's nothing.

217
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,760
I just followed someone else's advice.

218
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,120
You don't need to worry about Tianxiang Pool anymore.

219
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,960
You can do whatever you want now.

220
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,120
Of course.

221
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,000
You've managed Tianxiang Pool so well.

222
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,330
I'm definitely going to

223
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,520
enjoy my freedom

224
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,920
and live carefree.

225
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
That's right.

226
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,880
The bathing pool at Tianxiang is indeed quite nice.

227
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,280
but the hot springs are a bit more exciting.

228
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,920
It's all Kan family's pools anyway.

229
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,320
The package tickets can still be used.

230
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
Let's eat quickly.

231
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,560
We'll go right after we finish eating.

232
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,240
Okay.

233
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,530
Hot springs?

234
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,280
Does our family have this business?

235
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,440
Actually, it's only been in trial operation for a short while.

236
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:33,240
It's not surprising that you didn't know about it.

237
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,720
I was on Rong Mountain before.

238
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,960
I indeed discovered hot springs there.

239
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,840
Strange.

240
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,520
Why did I go to Rong Mountain?

241
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,760
Did I go alone?

242
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,520
Miss,

243
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,760
don't think too much about it.

244
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,600
Didn't we agree to let the second young miss handle it?

245
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,730
Wait, that's right.

246
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,570
The body scrubbing too.

247
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,120
And the buffet as well.

248
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,740
I feel like something's not quite right.

249
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,120
Tingyu,

250
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,840
I need to go to Rong Mountain.

251
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:04,930
This.

252
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,360
Hurry, hurry!

253
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,080
Miss,

254
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,680
Miss,

255
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,400
It's almost dark.

256
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,160
There's no need to rush to Rong Mountain at this hour, is there?

257
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
Isn't that our Kan family's hot spring?

258
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,290
can't we just stay there for the night?

259
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,480
But, Miss...

260
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,200
Sister.

261
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,000
Little girl,

262
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,080
do we know each other?

263
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,840
Sister,

264
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,840
don't you remember?

265
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,440
When I was sick before,

266
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,120
my brothers tried to fetch water for me but were bullied.

267
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,780
You were the one who helped us.

268
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,360
Only the young master and miss know about this.

269
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,420
We haven't approached them about it.

270
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,560
I do seem to have some recollection of that.

271
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,120
Are you feeling better now?

272
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,130
Yes, I'm better.

273
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,040
It's just that you and the big brother,

274
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,920
why don't you come play with us anymore?

275
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,920
Big brother?

276
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,320
Yes,

277
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,520
which brother?

278
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,960
What's wrong, sister?

279
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,020
These symptoms...

280
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,440
Could I be pregnant?
