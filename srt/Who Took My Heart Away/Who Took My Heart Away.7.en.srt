1
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,600
Yi Shuo.

2
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,759
My dear,

3
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,680
hold on to me tight.

4
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:47,240
I won't let anything happen to you.

5
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,920
Fang Xian, let go quickly.

6
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,240
I won't let go.

7
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,880
It's better for one person to die than two.

8
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,640
My dear,

9
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,360
I won't let go.

10
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,120
My dear,

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,200
Why are you being so foolish?

12
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,200
For you, I'm willing to do anything.

13
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,280
Are you still cold?

14
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,000
Don't look at me.

15
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,920
Okay.

16
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,040
The fish is ready.

17
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,920
Try some.

18
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,240
although it doesn't have much flavor,

19
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,240
it will help replenish your energy.

20
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,360
Thanks.

21
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,020
Since your father-in-law...

22
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,840
Uncle Kan...

23
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,960
has said he's willing to pay a high price for the medicine,

24
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,680
why do you need to risk your life?

25
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,440
Do you care so little about your own life?

26
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,300
What about you?

27
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,760
At least I'm doing this for my grandfather.

28
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,520
You can't even feed yourself,

29
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,120
yet you're still sharing food with those children.

30
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,360
What are you thinking?

31
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,200
There are countless suffering people in this world.

32
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,600
If going hungry

33
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,840
is all it takes to help them,

34
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,900
then it's nothing.

35
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,329
Though what I can do is limited,

36
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,410
I won't give up on this compassion.

37
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,480
My dear,

38
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,730
How did you know I was sharing food with the children?

39
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,560
Could it be

40
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,140
you specifically went to look for me?

41
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,920
This fish is still raw.

42
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,820
You should grill it a bit more.

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,800
Alright,

44
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,970
I'll grill it some more for you.

45
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,540
You're so useless.

46
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,440
If there wasn't a river here,

47
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,650
we both would have lost our lives here.

48
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,920
And you,

49
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,800
you had already let go,

50
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,200
why did you still jump in?

51
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,600
We're not husband and wife anymore.

52
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,250
After all, we've known each other for a while.

53
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,180
I couldn't just stand by and watch you in danger.

54
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,480
Is that all we are? Just acquaintances?

55
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,360
What else could it be?

56
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,200
Don't look at me.

57
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,280
My dear,

58
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,730
I'm so glad you're alright.

59
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,000
My dear,

60
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,200
my dear,

61
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,320
what's wrong?

62
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,680
Cold.

63
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:04,840
My dear,

64
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,840
it's alright.

65
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,000
It's alright.

66
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,480
Just hold on a little longer.

67
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,340
It'll be better when dawn breaks.

68
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,400
What did you say?

69
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,920
You're really something.

70
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,080
How could you let the young miss act so recklessly?

71
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,680
The young miss insisted on going.

72
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,320
I couldn't stop her.

73
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,800
What should we do now?

74
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,280
Go.

75
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,720
Go find the housekeeper.

76
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,280
Get a few strong guards.

77
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,160
Hurry up the mountain.

78
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,960
Yes, sir.

79
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,240
Fang Xian.

80
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,200
You're getting bolder and bolder these days.

81
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,000
How dare you lay your hands on me?

82
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,280
Let go of my arm.

83
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,640
Fang Xian.

84
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,080
Fang Xian, what's wrong with you?

85
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,200
Wake up, please!

86
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,480
Why can't we switch back?

87
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,640
Didn't a kiss work before?

88
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,320
Is it because he's unconscious?

89
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,780
Can we not switch anymore?

90
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,280
Fang Xian.

91
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,880
Fang Xian, wake up! Fang Xian!

92
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,680
You are my live-in son-in-law.

93
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,480
without my consent,

94
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,480
you can't just abandon me like this.

95
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,520
Fang Xian.

96
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,440
Fang Xian.

97
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,720
Didn't you say you wanted to prove to me

98
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,179
that you're someone I can entrust my life to?

99
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,280
You haven't proven it to me yet.

100
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,000
If you're upset because I wasn't good enough to you before,

101
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,960
I accept that.

102
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,360
But you need to wake up.

103
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,560
Give me a chance to apologize to you.

104
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,040
I'm begging you.

105
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,480
You can't do this.

106
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,600
You can't just suddenly appear in my life,

107
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,760
make me get used to you being so good to me,

108
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,800
and then leave me, Fang Xian.

109
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,240
Can someone please save him?

110
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,360
Can someone please save him?

111
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,810
My lady, please don't cry anymore.

112
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,680
Fang Xian.

113
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,640
Fang Xian, you're awake.

114
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,770
This time, it's my turn to protect you.

115
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,400
I'll take you home.

116
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,640
Fang Xian.

117
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,960
Hang in there.

118
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,040
we're almost there.

119
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,880
Fang Xian.

120
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,610
Fang Xian, are you alright?

121
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:32,880
Fang Xian.

122
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,640
Fang Xian.

123
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,800
Fang Xian, please wake up.

124
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,440
Wake up, please.

125
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,360
Fang Xian.

126
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,280
I'm begging you.

127
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,320
please wake up.

128
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,200
if you don't wake up soon,

129
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,200
I really don't know what to do.

130
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,400
Please, I beg you.

131
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,800
Water.

132
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,160
water.

133
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,480
What did you say?

134
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,120
Water.

135
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:05,320
Water.

136
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,160
Just wait.

137
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:47,800
My dear,

138
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,960
are you alright?

139
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,640
You're worried about me?

140
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,360
I'm sorry.

141
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,890
I've caused you trouble this time.

142
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,400
Don't say anything more.

143
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,680
Just rest well.

144
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,000
My dear,

145
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,560
is there any water left from before?

146
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,960
Don't worry, sir.

147
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,640
I've already notified the son-in-law.

148
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,280
You haven't slept all night.

149
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,040
How can I sleep?

150
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,000
I can't sleep until I see them return.

151
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,280
That may be true,

152
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,640
but if you collapse,

153
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,500
the young miss will be devastated when she returns.

154
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,690
You're starting to sound more and more like your young miss.

155
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,520
Father!

156
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,560
It's good that you're safe, it's good that you're safe.

157
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,360
Fang Xian.

158
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,880
You must have been the one who saved Meiyuan, right?

159
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,640
Father-in-law,

160
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,160
actually, about this incident...

161
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,960
My good son-in-law,

162
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,560
there's no need to be modest.

163
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,400
Are you tired?

164
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,760
Let your father-in-law treat you to some good food.

165
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,400
Father-in-law, wait a moment.

166
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,460
Let's go, let's go.

167
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,320
I was also in danger.

168
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,280
Why don't you comfort me?

169
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,080
Miss, are you alright?

170
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,410
Are you really leaving?

171
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:44,920
Indeed.

172
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,280
After all,

173
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,100
it's not convenient for me to stay at the Kan family now.

174
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,640
With weather like this today,

175
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,600
actually,

176
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,320
there's no rush.

177
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,320
Do you want me to stay, my lady?

178
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,720
I don't have any particular thoughts about it.

179
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,840
It's just that,

180
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,240
it's raining now.

181
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,800
If you don't want to leave,

182
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,520
I can't say much about it.

183
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:40,880
