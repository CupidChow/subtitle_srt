1
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,600
Yee-seok.

2
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,600
[Adapted from tomato novel]

3
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,880
That’s it.

4
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,600
My matrilocal husband is divorced.

5
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,000
Life will be hard in the future.

6
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,920
Grandpa.

7
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,800
give Fang some money

8
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,530
and send him back to Mount Rong?

9
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,120
as compensation.

10
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,200
Wait, wait, wait.

11
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,120
Mi-won.

12
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,880
Did you misunderstand?

13
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,000
I never said

14
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,960
to let Fang idle leave this house.

15
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,280
His grandfather Fang Banxia and I are best friends.

16
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,360
No matter what,

17
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,640
I will take good care of him.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,079
As for you,

19
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,400
never

20
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,680
I can't accept this marriage.

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,800
So,

22
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,840
the inheritance of the Nie family

23
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,200
Of course it has nothing to do with you now.

24
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,079
The Nie family has rules.

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,010
we don't raise useless people.

26
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,360
So you should be

27
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,960
should be you.

28
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,240
Grandpa.

29
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,600
Are you serious?

30
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,200
Grandpa.

31
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,040
This punishment is too heavy.

32
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,520
You just hate it.

33
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,160
Please withdraw your order.

34
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,080
I...

35
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,920
I'm done.

36
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,280
Can we go now?

37
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,400
No, no.

38
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,760
I can't laugh yet.

39
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,020
I have to hold it in.

40
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,160
My dream

41
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,120
to travel the world with a sword.

42
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,920
Okay.

43
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,079
Let's go.

44
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,960
Leave now!

45
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,520
Wait.

46
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,640
Honey.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,920
You know what?

48
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,640
Every time you show up,

49
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,400
my life will change.

50
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,300
I always wanted to try to get close to you.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,060
But I didn't expect

52
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,560
to marry you without any effort.

53
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,760
But I know clearly

54
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,360
I won’t let my love suffer

55
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,560
because of my own wishful thinking.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,040
So this time,

57
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,960
let me do something for you.

58
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,960
Grandpa.

59
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,840
It's because I didn't point out

60
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,090
that Mi-won made a mistake.

61
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,280
If you really need someone to leave,

62
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,640
to make up for the mistake,

63
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,040
this person should be me.

64
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,839
Fang Fang.

65
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,600
Thank you for taking care of me these days.

66
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,680
You...

67
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,880
No, you...

68
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,320
You can't...

69
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,040
Suzhen.

70
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,280
Take care.

71
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,400
Fang...

72
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,400
Why are you so touched by yourself?

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,800
Mother.

74
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,760
Why are you here?

75
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,480
Mei Ming.

76
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,400
I heard you returned

77
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
the seal of Tianxiang Pool.

78
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
This is a great opportunity.

79
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,720
You just let go?

80
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,600
how could you and Fang Fang Fang be so easy to deal with?

81
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,880
They must have had a plan.

82
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
They dug a trap

83
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,640
They're waiting for us

84
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,520
I think your expression now

85
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,000
must be depressed.

86
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,680
This trap...

87
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,200
I won't jump.

88
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,040
My lady.

89
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,880
Master said

90
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,240
you must go back to Tianxiang Pool today.

91
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,880
Got it.

92
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,520
Fang Fang.

93
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,000
Miss.

94
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,600
You're divorced.

95
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,880
Do you still want to hit me when I'm down?

96
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,800
Young Master is in such a state.

97
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,840
I must protect her.

98
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,080
If you had stayed in the Nie family,

99
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,480
he wouldn't have suffered this.

100
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,680
He asked for it.

101
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,810
Thank you, brother.

102
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,400
You can't even protect yourself. Thank you, brother.

103
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,560
But Miss,

104
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,400
Don't you like this?

105
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,920
If it weren't for him,

106
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,040
I would have fulfilled my dream

107
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,159
and left.

108
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,120
Listen to the rain.

109
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,720
Do you think I should look for Fang Fang?

110
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,940
What's with that look?

111
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,240
Miss.

112
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,480
You really care about Young Master.

113
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,320
I...

114
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,760
I just feel that he was kicked out.

115
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,320
because of me.

116
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,120
I can't just watch him

117
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,440
be a beggar.

118
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,159
But Young Master also ruined your plan.

119
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,690
It’s fine that you don’t take it out on him.

120
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,650
but you still care about Young Master.

121
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,159
I’m worried about him.

122
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,160
Young Master.

123
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,840
Go back to the shadow whistle with me.

124
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,640
Qing Yang.

125
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm not going back.

126
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,480
I can see my wife here.

127
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,280
No, Young Master.

128
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,530
Your addiction is more serious than mine.

129
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,680
If you're kicked out,

130
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,000
you can come to me.

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,600
right?

132
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,120
Why are you begging here?

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,840
I didn't

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,530
I couldn't think straight.

135
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,370
I feel like I have nowhere to go if I get kicked out.

136
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,640
Young Master.

137
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,400
What should we do next?

138
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:49,960
I don't know.

139
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,600
Go back to the shadow whistle and get me some medicine.

140
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,120
Those kids were sick.

141
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,520
I can't leave them alone.

142
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,400
Also,

143
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,320
Find out

144
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,720
where they live.

145
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,460
It's all a hard family.

146
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,880
We can't ignore it.

147
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,320
Young Master, I mean

148
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,080
you and your wife...

149
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,320
What's your plan

150
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,130
between you two?

151
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,080
I see.

152
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,400
A man

153
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,440
There's no need to worry about a wife.

154
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,240
Young Master.

155
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,680
Don't be sad.

156
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,200
My wife is my best dream.

157
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,600
It's unique.

158
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,440
Young Master.

159
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,700
You'll wake up from your dream. You'll wake up soon.

160
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,480
Young Master!

161
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,400
I swear today

162
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,800
I will never divorce you.

163
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,480
If I break my promise,

164
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,160
I'll be struck by lightning.

165
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,320
will never be peaceful.

166
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,480
It's not just the night view.

167
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,520
but also someone I miss.

168
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,120
I just want to know who is so lucky

169
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,800
to be favored by you.

170
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,280
Maybe I'm not as good as that person.

171
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,320
But my wife definitely doesn't like

172
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,240
a husband who retreates.

173
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,840
Now that he's your husband,

174
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,260
you have more advantage than him.

175
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,480
I have the courage to fight for it.

176
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,650
You like that man who is righteous,

177
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,800
and kind,

178
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,320
I'll do a thousand times better than him.

179
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,480
10,000 times.

180
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,640
Am I two-timing?

181
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,180
But I'm not the wife of the movie host.

182
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:31,960
Forget it.

183
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,760
Forget it.

184
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,680
What are you looking at?

185
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,000
Mr. Bai is in trouble.

186
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,840
What?

187
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,800
What should we do?

188
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,440
Don't worry, Father.

189
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,960
Everything will be fine.

190
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,120
Doctor.

191
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,400
How is grandpa?

192
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,160
He's in a rush.

193
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,120
causing blood and blood to reverse.

194
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,560
and made him unconscious.

195
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,160
I'm afraid his life will be in danger.

196
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,720
Take the medicine now.

197
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,000
We will pay you a lot.

198
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,280
Of course.

199
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,520
However,

200
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,760
there is still one ingredient missing.

201
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,360
called Muxiang Doumo.

202
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,240
It can cure the current condition.

203
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,040
But

204
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,000
this medicine is very cold.

205
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,320
It's not easy to buy.

206
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,400
I

207
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,160
I only saw you in Mount Rong.

208
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,040
in Mount Rong.

209
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,240
In that case,

210
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,440
I'll go to Mount Rong now.

211
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,200
Don't.

212
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,640
Don't be reckless.

213
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,880
Mount Rong is dangerous.

214
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,360
Why don't we pay a lot for the medicine first?

215
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,280
Everyone,

216
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,000
hurry up.

217
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,160
Mr. Niu can't wait long.

218
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Father.

219
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,120
Please take care of grandpa.

220
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,850
We'll go find the medicine now.

221
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,080
Okay.

222
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,680
Dr. Zhao.

223
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,200
How is it?

224
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,920
Did it go well?

225
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,320
They all believed it.

226
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,080
As you ordered,

227
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,280
I've told everyone

228
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,440
the herbs can only be collected in Mount Rong.

229
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,720
I hope Mei Yuan

230
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,120
can bring back her free time.

231
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,640
Do you think I'm old?

232
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,400
Why didn't I remember it until now?

233
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,720
He lived in Mount Rong for a long time.

234
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Only there can find him.

235
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,000
By the way,

236
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,360
what should I do

237
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,960
how should I pretend to be sick

238
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,640
to prevent them from suspecting me?

239
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,160
Okay.

240
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,000
Like this.

241
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,200
Wonderful

243
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,400
You...

244
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,000
I heard nothing.

245
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,320
She's smart.

246
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,160
Miss.

247
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,200
What are you doing?

248
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,320
Are you going to Mount Rong alone?

249
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,360
Aren't you going to bring Young Master along?

250
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,120
After all, he has been living in Mount Rong.

251
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,080
and knows a little about medicine.

252
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,800
No.

253
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,360
He's not a member of the Nie family.

254
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,760
I can't get him involved.

255
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,640
Let's go.

256
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,920
Miss, you go alone.

257
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,560
if you go alone?

258
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,800
I don’t take him because it’s dangerous.

259
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,930
He used to be a member of the Nie family.

260
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,220
Of course I have the responsibility to protect him.

261
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,480
No.

262
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,240
Miss.

263
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,850
Do you want to hear what you're talking about?

264
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,200
All right.

265
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,440
Don't worry.

266
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,200
You know my kung fu.

267
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,160
You just need to hide it from my family.

268
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,920
Got it?

269
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,840
I've heard that

270
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,760
Only after dawn

271
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,520

272
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,250

No.

274
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,170
My Lady, you're doing it again.

275
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,160

276
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,920

No.

281
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,200
It's better to die alone than two people.

282
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,960
Honey.

283
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,640
I won't let go.
