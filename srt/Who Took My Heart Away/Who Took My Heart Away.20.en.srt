1
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:55,600
Yi Shuo.

2
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,289
Mother-in-law.

3
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,060
Do you need something from me?

4
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:54,280
There's no one else here.

5
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,740
Why are you still calling me mother-in-law?

6
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,479
Madam,

7
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,720
just say what you want to say.

8
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,200
Ji Nu,

9
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,240
take me with you.

10
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,200
That damned Fang Xian,

11
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,360
ever since he opened the Rongshan Hot Springs,

12
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,960
the business at Tianxiang Pool has plummeted.

13
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,520
I'm counting on the payment you promised.

14
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,560
Liu Ji Nu,

15
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,600
are you there?

16
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,890
Why is Meiming here?

17
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,720
So what? I'll hide first.

18
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,560
Like mother, like daughter.

19
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,840
they sure know how to pick their moment.

20
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,640
I'm here.

21
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,560
Come in.

22
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,240
Business at Tianxiang Pool has been declining a lot lately.

23
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,370
Father sighs and complains every day.

24
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,700
even his mental state has deteriorated.

25
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,780
I'm listening.

26
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,920
go on.

27
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,840
Can you help us?

28
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,640
From now on, I will sincerely

29
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,760
be your wife.

30
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,560
As long as you can help us get through this crisis.

31
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,360
Interesting.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,360
Very interesting indeed.

33
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,480
However, everything

34
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,960
must be done in order.

35
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,080
Isn't that right?

36
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,160
Aren't you curious?

37
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,600
Why would your parents agree to this marriage?

38
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,560
I paid a hefty price for this.

39
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,000
Mother,

40
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,930
what are you doing here?

41
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,280
The deal your mother proposed is different from yours.

42
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,560
She only wants to cut ties with your Kan family.

43
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,220
Then she'll ask me for payment and flee far away.

44
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,040
I'm interested in all the deals you've proposed.

45
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,840
So,

46
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,780
I need to think it over carefully.

47
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,920
Shameless.

48
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,000
Mom.

49
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,680
Kan Meiming.

50
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,040
I admit,

51
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,000
as a partner, I've screwed you over.

52
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,160
So I deserve this slap.

53
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,960
But I, Liu Jinu,

54
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,000
never take a loss for something that's not worth it.

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
so this slap,

56
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,570
your mother will repay.

57
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,880
Meiming,

58
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,120
my entire future depends on him.

59
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,120
The Kan family is finished.

60
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
Please, just help me this once.

61
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,080
Mom.

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,730
Do you realize what you're saying?

63
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,900
You're selling out your family and daughter for money.

64
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,980
Miss Kan seems to be in a good mood.

65
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,380
May the Marquis be in good health.

66
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,320
Could I really be his daughter?

67
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,240
What are you thinking about?

68
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,280
Marquis,

69
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,200
between you and my parents,

70
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,960
did something happen in the past?

71
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,560
Those are all old stories from long ago.

72
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,360
Back then,

73
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,770
your mother and I

74
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,800
were childhood sweethearts.

75
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,200
But I came from a poor family,

76
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,480
with no power or influence.

77
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,440
I felt I wasn't worthy of your mother.

78
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,240
So,

79
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,400
I went to the battlefield

80
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,800
to earn military merits.

81
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,460
By the time I returned in glory

82
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,980
with the title of Marquis,

83
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,520
I learned that

84
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,640
your father and mother were already married.

85
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,840
What a pity.

86
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,730
Your mother and I

87
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,740
were destined to meet but not to be together.

88
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,600
I almost forgot the main purpose of my visit.

89
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,440
I came here

90
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,480
to change the location for the imperial bathing ceremony

91
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,800
from Tianxiang Pool to here.

92
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,620
What have Fang Xian and I done to deserve this honor?

93
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,000
It's not entirely for your sake.

94
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,900
Tianxiang Pool has been poorly managed lately.

95
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,000
The imperial bathing ceremony

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,360
cannot have any mishaps.

97
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,159
Otherwise,

98
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,080
I will kill someone.

99
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,680
Just kidding.

100
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,920
Prepare well.

101
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,480
Just kidding.

102
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,500
How could a joke have any killing intent?

103
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,920
Meiming.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,800
Meiming.

105
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,060
What's wrong with you?

106
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,200
Are you okay?

107
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,000
It's nothing.

108
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
Brother-in-law,

109
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,290
can you take me to see my sister?

110
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,820
I never thought Second Mother would do such a thing.

111
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,600
Sister,

112
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,640
I used to believe

113
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,720
that as long as I held power,

114
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,650
I could succeed in everything.

115
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,320
But seeing our parents like this now,

116
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,000
I feel terrified.

117
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,450
So what do you want to do now?

118
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,840
Liu Jinu is not as simple as we thought.

119
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,240
If mother continues like this,

120
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,840
there won't even be bone fragments left of her.

121
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,680
Sister,

122
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,440
I need your help.

123
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,960
Alright.

124
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,409
But you have to listen to me.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,800
Madam,

126
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,250
Where's the money you promised me?

127
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,690
Madam, is there a need to be so anxious?

128
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,840
I'm worried every day now

129
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,040
that Meiming will reveal our affair.

130
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,840
If we don't leave soon, I'll be in big trouble.

131
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
So, Madam,

132
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,810
you want me to serve you well today?

133
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,840
Is that so?

134
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,280
What are you saying?

135
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,280
I can serve you too,

136
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,900
as long as you promise to take me away.

137
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,640
Come on, come on!

138
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,840
We've already partnered with Tianxiang Pool.

139
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,799
The pipeline has been dug.

140
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,640
We've channeled the hot spring water from Rong Mountain.

141
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,700
If we go a day later,

142
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,240
we might not even get enough hot spring water to fill a bathtub.

143
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,200
we might not even get enough hot spring water to fill a bathtub.

144
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,919
That's the hot spring water from Rong Mountain!

145
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,880
I've heard about it.

146
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,200
Rong Mountain has become really popular lately,

147
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,930
all because of this hot spring.

148
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,800
No worries.

149
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,560
Well,

150
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,400
thanks to everyone's support before.

151
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,920
If you all trust me,

152
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,680
I'll help you cut in line.

153
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,320
After all, you've been so kind to me before.

154
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,200
So now, I certainly can't

155
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,400
not do you all a favor.

156
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,360
Son-in-law.

157
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,160
Young Master Fang is an honest man. Let's go with him then.

158
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,440
Let's go, let's go!

159
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,080
Judging by the sky,

160
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,420
the young master and his party should be arriving soon.

161
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,800
I, the esteemed Chief of Shadow Sentinels,

162
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,930
am actually doing such trivial tasks.

163
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,480
I must get the young master to increase my monthly salary.

164
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,560
So even the mighty Chief of Shadow Sentinels

165
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,480
gets headaches over monthly wages.

166
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,200
I was just thinking about dealing with

167
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,640
the hidden guards around Liu Jinu.

168
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,840
I didn't expect you to deliver yourselves to my doorstep.

169
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,000
Chief Feng,

170
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,040
today

171
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
you'll have to leave your life here.

172
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,920
Sir,

173
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,600
Feng Qingyang has fled with severe injuries.

174
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,000
We've injured several of our comrades

175
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,840
and couldn't catch up with him.

176
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,600
Useless.

177
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,080
Continue the search.

178
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,930
Feng Qingyang is Fang Xian's right-hand man.

179
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,290
I want to cut off this arm of his.

180
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,760
We haven't informed Mr. Liu

181
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,220
about this operation yet.

182
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,360
Inform him?

183
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,140
Is that really necessary?

184
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,040
Er Niang,

185
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,200
we're here.

186
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,880
Get out!

187
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,620
All of you, get out!

188
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,920
Or don't blame me for being rude.

189
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,440
Er Niang,
