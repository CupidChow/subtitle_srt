1
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,560
Yi Shuo.

2
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,600
Marquis.

3
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,000
We humbly await your esteemed presence, Marquis.

4
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,440
Please, there's no need for such formalities.

5
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,960
I've been quite busy with work today.

6
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,440
I apologize for being late.

7
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,900
You're too kind, Marquis.

8
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,640
Your gracious visit, Marquis,

9
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,440
brings great honor to our Kan family.

10
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,200
We are truly fortunate.

11
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,780
Regarding Song Kang's recent incident,

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,720
which also affected the Kan family,

13
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,800
I feel,

14
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,000
truly apologetic.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,960
Not at all, not at all.

16
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,919
In a while,

17
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,440
I plan to bathe in your Kan family's Tianxiang Pool

18
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,500
before an audience with the Emperor.

19
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,840
I wonder,

20
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,680
might I trouble you for a drink tonight?

21
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,079
You're too kind, Marquis.

22
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:22,760
Please, come in.

23
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,090
Yes, please, do come in.

24
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,560
Kan Xiang,

25
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,360
What's past is past.

26
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,840
Don't dwell on it.

27
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,420
The reason for my visit

28
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,600
is mainly to see Susu's child.

29
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,120
The Marquis is gracious,

30
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,240
which is my good fortune.

31
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,160
Marquis,

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
this way, please.

33
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,579
Please, after you.

34
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,760
Just you wait.

35
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,400
I'll replace you soon enough.

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,530
Good luck with that.

37
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,320
Please, Your Lordship, drink this cup to the full.

38
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,280
Come, come.

39
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:20,880
Meiyuan.

40
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:23,520
Did you grow up together with Meiming?

41
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,370
Who's older and who's younger?

42
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,560
I am the eldest daughter of the Kan family.

43
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,220
Ten years older than Meiming.

44
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,240
So how is the relationship between you two sisters?

45
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,560
Meiming is in the mansion.

46
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,890
I can see that Your Lordship cares a lot about the Kan family.

47
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,170
The couple's affection runs deep.

48
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,440
Your father and I are also considered family friends.

49
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,800
By that calculation, you should be my...

50
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,360
...nieces.

51
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,920
If I had a child...

52
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,690
...they would probably be about your age.

53
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,810
I wonder if Miss Meiyuan...

54
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,000
...could tell me a bit more?

55
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,010
I... I'm just afraid...

56
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,960
...that you'll find our...

57
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,740
...trivial matters too boring, Your Lordship.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
How could that be?

59
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,240
Your Lordship,

60
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,960
why don't we have another drink?

61
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,480
Good, good, good.

62
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,480
Come, come, come.

63
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,440
From now on, without my permission,

64
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,640
you're not allowed to kiss me in public.

65
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,720
Meiyuan,

66
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,440
don't you think what the Marquis said earlier

67
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,640
was a bit strange?

68
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,520
Did you grow up together with Meiming?

69
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,920
It was a bit strange.

70
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:50,680
He kept asking me

71
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,960
about Meiming and me when we were children.

72
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,840
For such a distinguished Marquis

73
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,800
to be so concerned about such trivial matters,

74
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,130
taking it so seriously.

75
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,720
It's strange.

76
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,920
What's really going on?

77
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,410
I just secretly inquired about it.

78
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,880
When your father and the Marquis were young,

79
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,280
they had some conflicts.

80
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,800
That's ancient history.

81
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,080
He's now a respected Marquis.

82
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,600
Would he still care about such things?

83
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,460
It's not like he killed his father or stole his wife.

84
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,160
Actually, it might be.

85
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,240
Killing the father or stealing the wife?

86
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,720
But the Marquis lost both parents at a young age

87
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,280
and temporarily lived with our Kan family.

88
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,010
So it must be stealing the wife.

89
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,800
No wonder he just now

90
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,520
kept asking me about Meiming.

91
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,640
It must be that when the Marquis was young,

92
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,640
he had an affair with Second Mother.

93
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,080
So he suspects that my sister might be his child.

94
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,130
It must be like this.

95
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,520
I didn't even inquire about these things,

96
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,850
and you've already started speculating.

97
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,520
Now that I've kept my promise

98
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,700
and let you marry into our Kan family,

99
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,080
shouldn't you tell me

100
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,640
how exactly you're going to help me deal with them?

101
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,720
Don't worry.

102
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,720
I won't let you down.

103
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,040
Just wait and see.

104
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,080
What?

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,460
You're not thinking of turning this act into reality, are you?

106
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:39,960
Oh, right.

107
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,320
There's one more thing.

108
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,800
Although I agreed,

109
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,880
how did you convince my parents

110
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,680
to let you marry into our family?

111
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,480
Trade secret.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,159
Not to be disclosed.

113
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,360
What?

114
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,930
Miss Meiming is the daughter of the Marquis and his second wife.

115
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,680
Miss,

116
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,610
you're not joking with me, are you?

117
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,560
I'm just suspicious too.

118
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,520
I always feel

119
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,920
there might be something between Father and the Marquis.

120
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,400
A grudge over stealing a wife.

121
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,120
And Father hasn't been in a good mood lately, has he?

122
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,180
He might have discovered something.

123
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,560
That doesn't necessarily mean

124
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:35,440
Miss Meiming is the Marquis's daughter, does it?

125
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,400
You don't know,

126
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,120
on the day of Meiming's wedding,

127
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,280
the Marquis kept asking me about Meiming.

128
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,840
If there wasn't some entanglement,

129
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,440
why would he be so concerned?

130
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,000
What are you doing?

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,159
You scared me to death with your sudden outburst.

132
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,120
No, miss.

133
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,680
I've recently heard

134
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,360
that the second madam often takes her maid

135
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,960
out for long periods of time,

136
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,720
and sometimes

137
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,020
returns to the mansion late at night.

138
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,640
Second Sister often goes out shopping,

139
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,760
and she also comes back very late.

140
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,720
But

141
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,360
recently, in the second madam's quarters,

142
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,440
it seems nothing new has been added.

143
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,200
It's possible that the household has been tight on money lately,

144
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,330
so she's just looking without buying.

145
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,120
Although I've had disagreements with Meiming recently,

146
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,920
but

147
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,120
years of sisterly affection

148
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,560
won't be erased by these baseless rumors.

149
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,820
It can't be wiped away.

150
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,640
But isn't this unfair

151
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,320
to the master?

152
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,760
The master has the right to know the truth.

153
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,559
We can't keep watching the second madam

154
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,159
make a cuckold of the master.

155
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,160
Tingyu,

156
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,420
help me keep an eye on Second Sister's whereabouts lately.

157
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,700
Are you sure it's here?

158
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,040
I'm certain.

159
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,160
I've been following for some time now.

160
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,960
The second madam comes here every four days.

161
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,680
Miss.

162
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
Stop right there.

163
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,000
I am Kan Meiyuan, the eldest daughter of the Kan family.

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,280
I request an audience with the Marquis of Yanqing.

165
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,240
My apologies, Miss Kan.

166
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,000
The Marquis is not in the mansion.

167
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,720
He goes out every four days.

168
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,520
Well,

169
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,480
do you know when the Marquis will return?

170
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,640
I have urgent matters to discuss with him.

171
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,600
We guards

172
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,440
are not privy to the Marquis's whereabouts.

173
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,200
Miss.

174
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,240
How coincidental.

175
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,840
The Marquis happens to be out today of all days.

176
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,120
Why are you here?

177
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,120
Meiyuan.

178
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,520
How come you're here?

179
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,880
Answer my question.

180
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,000
Things are not as you think.

181
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,960
Just as I expected.

182
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,010
Father, you already know everything.

183
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,520
Meiming.

184
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,160
Later, you must, must have a good attitude.

185
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,400
No matter what happens,

186
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,120
even if we're not related by blood,

187
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,120
the sisterly bond between us will never break.

188
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,850

What are you talking about?

190
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,040
If father wants to blame me, I'll bear it.

191
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,840
My dear,

192
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:54,960
don't be nervous.

193
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,890
What if it's not as bad as you think?

194
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,020
What a touching display of sisterly affection.

195
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,020
What a misfortune for our family.

196
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,800
A family disgrace.

197
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,320
I never thought our prestigious Kan family

198
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,520
would have such a scandal.

199
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,560
Father.

200
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,720
Can you just speak plainly?

201
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,250
I'll take responsibility for my own actions.

202
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,370
Do you really intend to disown your daughter?

203
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,770
Father-in-law,

204
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,320
everything can be discussed.

205
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,920
Some things can't be undone.

206
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,320
That's right, Father.

207
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,800
After so many years of father-daughter affection,

208
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,860
do you really plan to turn a blind eye?

209

00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,880
As soon as you see the Marquis of Yanqing, you kneel down first.

212
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,600
You rushed to acknowledge your kin.

213
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,680
