1
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,520
Yi Shuo.

2
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,960
We've reclaimed Tianxiang Pool.

3
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,560
but it's barely surviving like this every day.

4
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,050
What kind of situation is this?

5
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,280
The bath attendants trained by my brother-in-law are still here.

6
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,400
Although we don't have bath salts anymore,

7
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,160
we can still

8
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,360
continue to offer scrubbing services.

9
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,320
Once we've earned enough silver,

10
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,920
we can consider the matter of bath salts again.

11
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,199
Tianxiang Pool is now in your hands.

12
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,000
You decide.

13
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,640
Massage here too.

14
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:16,720
Here.

15
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,720
What are you all doing?

16
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,360
Don't you have work to do?

17
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,680
What are you all doing here?

18
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,880
You're no longer part of the Kan family.

19
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,760
Grandfather said,

20
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,040
as long as Tianxiang Pool is open,

21
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,900
we won't turn away a single guest.

22
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,120
Whether it's a street vendor

23
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,520
or royal relatives,

24
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,000
today I am a guest.

25
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,320
Why can't I come?

26
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,160
Guest?

27
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,770
You're clearly here to cause trouble.

28
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,800
Tianxiang Pool doesn't welcome guests like you.

29
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,840
We're not just guests today.

30
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,040
We have other purposes for coming here.

31
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,160
This is the batch of bath salt you stole.

32
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,280
At least you have a conscience.

33
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,160
Guards!

34
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,920
Take the bath salts away.

35
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,560
Wait.

36
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,120
I wonder if the second madam

37
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,480
is prepared to pay for these bath salts.

38
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,760
Kan Meiyuan.

39
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,079
What do you mean?

40
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,560
These bath salts

41
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,240
were purchased with the Kan family's treasury funds.

42
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,970
Are you trying to extort us with these bath salts?

43
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,760
The previous batch of bath salts was stolen.

44
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,880
These were recovered by Fang Xian.

45
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,780
So they belong to him personally.

46
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,640
I'm sorry,

47
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,840
but as the saying goes, 'a married daughter belongs to her husband's family.'

48
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,120
Fang Xian's personal belongings

49
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,680
are not mine to dispose of.

50
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,160
This is absolutely absurd!

51
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,240
Meiyuan,

52
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,160
As long as you hand over this batch of bath salts,

53
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,920
even if you can't regain control of Tianxiang Pool,

54
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,120
you're still my Kan family's daughter.

55
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,560
Master Kan,

56
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,960
search your conscience.

57
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,040
Have you ever truly considered me as part of the Kan family?

58
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,000
Cut the nonsense.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,800
Guards!

60
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,050
Go and get those things back for me.

61
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,560
Mere son-in-law,

62
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,680
to think he possesses such martial skills.

63
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,140
Sister, brother-in-law,

64
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,640
I guess you didn't come back this time

65
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,800
just to show off, did you?

66
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,360
I've already said,

67
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,959
I'm here to make a deal today.

68
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,320
As long as you're willing to pay,

69
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,480
I can sell you this batch of bath salts.

70
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,240
But you should know

71
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,000
the Kan family doesn't have much silver left in their treasury.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,960
There are still valuable things.

73
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,760
For example,

74
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,320
Tianxiang Pool.

75
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,050
Some things are better not misplaced.

76
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,520
Even if you put the seal under Grandfather's pillow,

77
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,960
it's not foolproof.

78
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,720
Meiyuan is pulling the rug out from under us this time.

79
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,650
If we take this batch of bath salts,

80
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,840
we can't keep the management rights of Tianxiang Pool.

81
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,080
If we don't take this batch of bath salts,

82
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,740
we can't keep Tianxiang Pool.

83
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,720
Ji Nu,

84
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,680
I don't know about your side.

85
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,920
I can certainly raise the funds,

86
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,880
but that couple has wild ambitions.

87
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,810
I'm afraid they won't give me time to raise the funds.

88
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:36,920
Well,

89
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,640
Master,

90
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,560
I...

91
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,100
I've found a solution to the problem.

92
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,400
I've found a buyer.

93
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,240
If we mortgage the Kan family's courtyard,

94
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,370
we'll have money to buy the bath salts.

95
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,640
As long as Tianxiang Pool is still here,

96
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,080
a property like this

97
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,800
can always make money back.

98
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,760
Who is this buyer?

99
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,890
Can they be trusted?

100
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,600
Don't worry, Master.

101
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,280
I asked Yingshao to find the buyer.

102
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,960
Alright, alright.

103
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,840
Now is not the time to be picky.

104
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,240
Fine.

105
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:23,960
Not enough.

106
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,280
You're far from causing real chaos.

107
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,720
I've already signed the document.

108
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,760
When will your family's silver be ready?

109
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,640
Don't worry.

110
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,640
Since Yingshao is the guarantor,

111
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,640
I won't go back on my word either.

112
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,159
In half an hour,

113
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll have the silver delivered to Tianxiang Pool.

114
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,260
If that's the case,

115
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,720
we'll move out of this residence tomorrow.

116
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,000
My father is bedridden,

117
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,130
so it might take a bit more time.

118
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,020
Since grandfather is unwell,

119
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,840
Then there's no need for a tiring journey.

120
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,640
from now on,

121
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,120
I'll take care of him.

122
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,960
What?

123
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,960
You're also short on cash,

124
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,460
eager to sell off the bath salts you have.

125
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,760
Don't worry,

126
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,200
Tianxiang Pool will soon have enough silver.

127
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,120
Your scheme to swindle Tianxiang Pool

128
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,410
won't work anymore.

129
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,320
As I expected.

130
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,600
Who are you?

131
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,840
Of course,

132
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,159
it's me.

133
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,320
No one in the Kan family knows you.

134
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,680
Why bother with the disguise?

135
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,480
It's him.

136
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,080
It's about ceremony.

137
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,200
This is about ceremony.

138
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,260
What are you touching?

139
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,120
Sister,

140
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,280
Was your target from the beginning

141
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,760
this mansion?

142
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,640
Since I've been outmaneuvered by you,

143
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,560
I admit defeat.

144
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,840
I have money now.

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,530
Can I buy that batch of bath salts from you now?

146
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,160
I'm sorry,

147
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,320
but I don't want to sell anymore.

148
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Are you crazy?

149
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,040
You don't even have the Tianxiang Pool.

150
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,080
What's the use of keeping these bath salts?

151
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,120
Or are you saying

152
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,250
you want to fight to the death with our Kan family?

153
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,090
The goods are in my possession.

154
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,800
Even if I ate these bath salts,

155
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,330
it's none of your business.

156
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,640
Now,

157
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,480
please leave my mansion.

158
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,400
Kan Meiyuan,

159
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,960
do you really want to sever all ties with me?

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,799
Fine.

161
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,840
Then hand over the Kan family seal to me.

162
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,919
From now on, we'll have nothing to do with each other.

163
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,919
Mr. Kan,

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,280
you've got it backwards, haven't you?

165
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,480
Am I, Kan Meiyuan, the one who wants to sever ties with you?

166
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,720
Is this how merchants twist the truth?

167
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,520
Tingyu,

168
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,090
this family seal

169
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,080
has always been kept in grandfather's jade pillow.

170
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,160
If any one of you

171
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,440
had taken proper care of him,

172
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,120
you wouldn't have failed to discover it until now.

173
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,180
But what happened?

174
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,880
Except for Meiming,

175
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,880
have any of you cared about grandfather's condition?

176
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,120
Now,

177
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,760
I owe you nothing.

178
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,600
Please leave

179
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,290
my mansion first thing tomorrow morning.

180
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,880
Don't worry.

181
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,240
That pair of scumbags won't last long.

182
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,080
At least we've got the money in hand now.

183
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,760
Worst case, we'll just ship another batch of bath salts.

184
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,240
You should keep your mouth shut.

185
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,960
I'm just speaking for our family.

186
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,160
Look at you before,

187
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,920

189
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,840
you've raised an ungrateful wretch, haven't you?

190
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,440
You always accuse me of being jealous.

191
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,040
Mother,

192
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,040

193

You only know how to take your anger out on me.

198
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,280
Okay.

199
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,200
I don't care anymore.

200
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,280
Mother.

201

Miss,

202
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,320

203
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,880

204
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,410

206
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,880

Tell me,

208
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,920
was what I did right?

209
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,960
I don't know.

210
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,800
all I know is

211
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,720
whether it's right or wrong,

212
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,920

Mother-in-law,

220
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,700

221
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,640
What do you think?

222
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,540
