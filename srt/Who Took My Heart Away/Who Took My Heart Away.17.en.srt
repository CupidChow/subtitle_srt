1
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,440
Yi Shuo.

2
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,560
Yi Shuo.

3
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,440
Fang Xian.

4
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,600
Greetings upon reading this letter.

5
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,160
I, who once firmly believed in love at first sight,

6
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,160
actually strongly disagreed with the notion of love growing over time.

7
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,000
I thought it was nothing more than a kind of

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,120
forced acceptance of reality in relationships,

9
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,920
not worthy of being called love.

10
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,020
But after spending time with you,

11
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,360
I realized that simply spending the rest of my life with you

12
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,800
seems just as wonderful.

13
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,640
I'm very frustrated,

14
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,130
feeling torn between two desires.

15
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,120
I want both the ideals of the Shadow Master

16
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,920
and the warmth you give me.

17
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,079
I always hold onto

18
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,000
the irresponsible thought of how great it would be if you were the Shadow Master.

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,880
This irresponsible idea

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,120
Until I discovered

21
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,240
that you possess the same ideals and passion

22
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:43,160
as the person in my heart.

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,200
I finally understand

24
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,370
that he is merely an object of admiration in my heart.

25
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,640
He can do it.

26
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,280
You can do it too.

27
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,120
but what you can do,

28
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,180
the Shadow Master cannot.

29
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,040
Because he won't be the one

30
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,880
who is willing to give unconditionally for me,

31
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,360
a trustworthy husband.

32
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,240
So among all those who have come to me in this world,

33
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,040
you are the only one.

34
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,760
Therefore, the one worth spending my life with

35
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,640
It's you too.

36
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,160
It's not him.

37
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,850
You always worry that I'll abandon you and leave.

38
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,800
in fact,

39
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,680
I've already told you how I feel.

40
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,800
It's in every look I give you.

41
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,600
Take good care of grandfather.

42
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,800
Wait for me to return.

43
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,329
My dear husband,

44
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,600
Auntie, uncle.

45
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,760
Son-in-law,

46
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,700
Why are there no fish in the fish therapy pool today?

47
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:18,959
Xiao Nianshi.

48
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,360
Son-in-law,

49
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,320
pull yourself together.

50
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,040
The young lady asked you to guard the Tianxiang Pool,

51
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,880
and take care of the old master.

52
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,760
You can't go on like this.

53
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,920
My dear,

54
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,080
call me husband.

55
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,159
My little fish.

56
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,250
The weather is getting colder.

57
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,400
My dear, you shouldn't keep fanning yourself.

58
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,060
Be careful not to catch a cold.

59
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,250
You're getting bolder and bolder.

60
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,080
You dare to lecture me now?

61
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,720
This mountain was opened by me.

62
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,960
This tree is... alright, alright.

63
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,220
Let's not use those old sayings anymore.

64
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,760
I am Kan Meiyuan of the Kan family from Taizhou.

65
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,960
Although what we're transporting is rare,

66
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,560
it's not particularly valuable.

67
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,820
I hope you gentlemen can show some mercy.

68
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,560
Since ancient times,

69
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,320
thieves never leave empty-handed.

70
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Besides,

71
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,000
we can judge for ourselves whether it's valuable or not.

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,460
And we still have you, little miss, don't we?

73
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,760
So, I take it there's no room for negotiation?

74
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,800
Of course not.

75
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,600
You're so stubborn and foolish.

76
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,720
You people think you can rob me?

77
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,700
You'd need to be twice as many to even stand a chance.

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,860
Why did I have to open my big mouth?

79
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,159
Fang Xian.

80
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,140
Son-in-law Fang Xian,

81
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,680
something's happened to Meiyuan.

82
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,560
She encountered bandits while transporting the goods.

83
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,220
Both the people and the goods have disappeared.

84
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,520
Son-in-law,

85
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,040
we've already delivered the bath salts.

86
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,600
Since you chose to transport them yourselves,

87
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,400
and they were lost,

88
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,240
you can't use that as an excuse not to pay the balance, can you?

89
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:11,800
That's right.

90
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,760
You can't not pay the balance.

91
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,640
We're a small business.

92
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,880
If possible,

93
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,760
I hope your main branch

94
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,720
can settle this season's coal and fire fees first.

95
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,680
When have we ever owed money for goods?

96
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,960
What do you mean by asking us to pay in advance?

97
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,120
Everyone knows now

98
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,800
that your Tianxiang Pool's business is getting worse and worse.

99
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,960
The current Tianxiang Pool

100
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,440
is like a starved pig,

101
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,080
ready to be picked clean.

102
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,800
Enough.

103
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,000
Fang Xian,

104
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,960
you've seen it all.

105
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,880
Now you and Meiyuan

106
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,080
have run the Kan family into the ground.

107
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,200
You should hand over the seal of authority.

108
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Miss Meiming,

109
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,680
are you satisfied now?

110
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,760
Now your sister and brother-in-law

111
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,000
will surely be doomed.

112
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,040
My wife's fate is unknown now,

113
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,060
yet all you care about is the seal.

114
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,000
Her life is at stake,

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,680
and you still won't hand over the seal?

116
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,340
How long are you going to wait?

117
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,920
I'm going to find my wife now.

118
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,480
She promised me she would return.

119
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,840
If she doesn't come back,

120
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,080
I'll bring her back myself.

121
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,760
Wait.

122
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,120
Leave the seal here.

123
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,960
No one cares who you're going to find.

124
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,400
Guards!

125
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,580
Let's go, let's go.

126
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,850
Father-in-law,

127
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,040
do you really have to do this?

128
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,560
If you don't hand over the seal today,

129
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,520
don't even think about leaving the Kan family's house.

130
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,159
I've been part of this family for less than a year,

131
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,240
but my wife has called you

132
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,960
father and second mother for twenty years.

133
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,920
Enough talk.

134
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,680
Beat him up!

135
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,520
Son-in-law.

136
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,520
Enough.

137
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,740
Money moves people's hearts.

138
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,920
I finally see things clearly today.

139
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,000
Fang Xian.

140
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,760
You can go now.

141
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,400
From now on, the affairs of the Kan family...

142
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,060
...are none of your business.

143
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,730
Take good care of Grandfather.

144
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,130
Son-in-law.

145
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,760
Young Master Fang Xian,

146
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,039
please come with me.

147
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,200
Liu Jinu.

148
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,720
Master Fang,

149
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,240
how did you end up in such a state?

150
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,840
As your brother-in-law,

151
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,280
I truly sympathize with you.

152
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,240
Get to the point.

153
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
I don't have time for your nonsense.

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,800
Is that so?

155
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,660
How long would it take to chat with me?

156
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,680
I thought you cared about

157
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,320
Miss Meiyuan's life.

158
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,480
Do you know where my wife is?

159
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,920
I am a businessman.

160
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,680
You are, after all, the heir to the Jinyi Merchant Association.

161
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,560
Fair trade,

162
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:22,560
you know?

163
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,620
You also want the Kan family seal?

164
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,920
What's so special about the Kan family's seal holder?

165
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
I've said before,

166
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,200
I'm going to become

167
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,730
the man who leads all merchants under heaven.

168
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,970
Hand over the heir's token of the Jinyi Merchants Association.

169
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,050
You're reluctant, aren't you?

170
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,320
I knew

171
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,330
you wouldn't give in so easily.

172
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,680
What kind of trick are you pulling?

173
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,560
What trick?

174
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,200
Didn't you say you wanted it?

175
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,000
Here you go.

176
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,610
Now tell me where my wife is.

177
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,920
Alright.

178
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,120
Bring it here.

179
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,240
Wait.

180
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,300
You're standing too high.

181
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,380
I don't like looking up at people.

182
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,920
Fang Xian,

183
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,400
this is far from enough.

184
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,120
Liu Jinu,

185
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,840
where is my wife?

186
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,240
When did I ever say that?

187
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,920
