1
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,560
Yi Shuo.

2
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,320
Be good.

3
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,960
Alright.

4
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,920
Come, come, come.

5
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,840
Get up quickly.

6
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,840
Fang Xian,

7
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,480
you must have learned quite a bit of your grandfather Fang Banxia's skills.

8
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,480
I'm sure you've picked up many of the essentials.

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,260
Be sure to behave yourself in the future.

10
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,079
Help your beloved wife Meiyuan take care of the business more often.

11
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,079
A loss of 300 taels in one month.

12
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:30,540
How much skill would it take to be of any help?

13
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,079
Isn't that Fang Xian who has arrived?

14
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,320
It will get better in the future.

15
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,180
Right, Father?

16
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,000
Exactly.

17
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,160
Fang Xian has joined the Kan family.

18
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,760
he'd better behave himself.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,329
It's best not to do anything unnecessary.

20
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,800
What do you mean by unnecessary things?

21
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,680
This Fang Xian has joined our Kan family.

22
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,000
He is now a member of the Kan family.

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,560
Of course he should manage Tianxiang Pool.

24
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,490
Father-in-law,

25
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,000
you're mistaken about this.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,120
I think Second Mother and Meiming

27
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,560
have a point.

28
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,800
The Kan family business is of great importance.

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,480
The matter of inheritance is

30
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,160
Meiyuan's own affair.

31
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,160
How can we rely on others' strength?

32
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,360
As the saying goes,

33
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,520
natural talents will always find their use.

34
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,040
How can we lose faith in Meiyuan

35
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,570
because of a small setback?

36
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,079
Does the Kan family really need

37
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,120
an heir who only relies on others?

38
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,440
If that's truly the case,

39
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,370
then my Fang family is indeed unworthy of this match.

40
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,040
Well said!

41
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,120
Truly worthy of being Fang Banxia's grandson.

42
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,480
My son-in-law is indeed a dragon among men.

43
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,079
I wasn't wrong about him.

44
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,520
That's not right, Father.

45
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,840
I've already said all this.

46
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,480
you shouldn't angrily say,

47
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,079
'Get out!'

48
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:48,610
'Do I not have a son-in-law as arrogant and domineering as you?'

49
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:49,880
Meiyuan,

50
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,920
hurry and bring your worthy son-in-law

51
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,800
to take a look at Tianxiang Pool.

52
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,120
Meiyuan, Meiyuan!

53
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,160
Yes,

54
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,680
mother.

55
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,840
My lord.

56
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,290
Cooperate, cooperate.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,130
I'll take him there.

58
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,560
Look at this young couple.

59
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,440
How lovely.

60
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,760
Alright.

61
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,240
Well, let me see what this son-in-law of yours can do.

62
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,720
What skills do you have?

63
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,000
Look.

64
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,460
This is our Kan family's Tianxiang Pool.

65
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,220
Please, come in. Please, come in.

66
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,840
Please.

67
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,320
Please, please, please.

68
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,280
Our Kan family's Tianxiang Pool

69
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,560
is the largest bathing pool in the Southern Kingdom.

70
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,840
Our clientele ranges from royal relatives

71
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,040
to common people.

72
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,159
And next month,

73
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,480
we will be responsible for

74
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,360
the bathing of Marquis Yanqing before he enters the palace to see the emperor.

75
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,159
Let's go.

76
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,930
Let's move on to the next place.

77
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,860
Miss Kan really knows how to do business.

78
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,760
Impressive, impressive.

79
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,520
My dear,

80
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,240
it seems you're getting along well with the customers.

81
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,120
Of course.

82
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,040
You must remember,

83
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,040
they've paid money,

84
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,560
which shows their trust in our Kan family.

85
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,800
We must provide the best service in return.

86
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,960
I understand, my dear.

87
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,400
I will definitely

88
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,460
revitalize the bathing pool for you.

89
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,760
If you're capable, help me lose a lot of money,

90
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,720
completely ruin my qualification as an heir,

91
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,360
so I can rightfully divorce you.

92
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,640
It's killing two birds with one stone, and grandfather won't blame me.

93
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,040
I'm such a genius.

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,800
Darling,

95
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,250
where are you going?

96
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,480
What are you doing?

97
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,520
I'm going to inspect the bathing pools.

98
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,159
No,

99
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:43,880
darling,

100
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,400
that's the women's bathing pool.

101
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,800
We've switched bodies now.

102
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,730
It might not be appropriate for you to go in like this.

103
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,159
Going to the men's pool doesn't seem right either.

104
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,680
Greetings, son-in-law.

105
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,280
Don't look, don't look, don't look.

106
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,880
Welcome.

107
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,860
What are you doing?

108
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,200
Are you looking for trouble?

109
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,600
Don't go, you guys.

110
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,880
Come back!

111
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,880
Your father is just playing favorites.

112
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,480
Kan Meiyuan has lost so much.

113
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,440
You still hope that finding a live-in son-in-law can turn things around?

114
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,640
What are you doing?

115
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,159
Do you know you're getting in the way of me greeting the hunks?

116
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,440
do you understand?

117
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,640
Useless.

118
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,400
The tattoo was treated with a foul-smelling potion.

119
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,440
It was discovered before I even got in the water.

120
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,900
Is this the discerning eye of the Jinyi Merchant Guild's heir?

121
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,720
I must help my lady well.

122
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,799
But I can't use my identity as the Shadow Master.

123
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,730
Otherwise, it will implicate him.

124
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,840
What should I do?

125
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,580
What are you doing?

126
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,490
There are no customers, right?

127
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,040
We can't let the chefs stay idle anymore.

128
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,080
It seems that the dining area of Tianxiang Pool

129
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,080
needs to change its business model.

130
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,010
Father-in-law,

131
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,040
Father, husband.

132
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,140
I've given you a little demonstration of my skills.

133
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,120
Your cooking skills are really good, my dear.

134
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,200
If you like it,

135
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,000
I can cook for you for a lifetime.

136
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,160
Is this the charm of being a live-in son-in-law?

137
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,600
The young lady has changed completely.

138
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,120
The power of love, indeed.

139
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,840
Come here.

140
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,050
What are you all looking at?

141
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,640
I've got an idea.

142
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,240
I'll teach you to mind your own business.

143
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,960
Is that all you wanted to say?

144
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:13,680
Yes.

145
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,400
I plan to start from tomorrow.

146
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,000
Let Fang Xian take over the catering area.

147
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,840
It will surely go bankrupt in no time.

148
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,640
When that happens,

149
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,680
you'll take over the family business.

150
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,080
I'll wander the world from then on.

151
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,920
Perfect.

152
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,400
Take it.

153
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,000
What?

154
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,440
Miss,

155
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,400
Miss Meiyuan is intentionally trying to incur losses,

156
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,440
so that you can inherit the family business.

157
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,600
Intentionally incurring losses?

158
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,330
Where in the world would such a good thing happen?

159
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,960
Are you sure?

160
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,140
She and Fang Xian are still sleeping in separate rooms.

161
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,240
Fang Xian.

162
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,320
My dear wife,

163
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,680
you're back.

164
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,920
What are you doing here?

165
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:10,640
Go sleep in the side room.

166
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,440
My dear, there's no need to make a fuss.

167
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,720
it's just that the weather is getting colder,

168
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,440
I'm here to warm the bed for you.

169
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,720
A grown man

170
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,720
indulging in such trivial matters,

171
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,170
what a waste of manhood.

172
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,720
I indeed don't want to be some great man.

173
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,780
I just want to be a good husband to you.

174
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,800
I'm warning you, Fang Xian.

175
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,160
Don't use my body

176
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,360
to do those strange things anymore.

177
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,020
Otherwise, I'll divorce you.

178
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,960
So,

179
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,530
my dear, will you still kiss me?

180
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,080
Alright,

181
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,460
I'll go rest in the side room then.

182
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,080
That's right.

183
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,000
We only exchange kisses.

184
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,120
How could I possibly kiss him again?

185
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,400
Why haven't you left yet?

186
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,200
My dear,

187
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,040
You-

188
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,040
I beg your pardon.

189
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,980
Don't come any closer!

190
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,080
What are you doing?

191
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,080
Meiming,

192
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,490
This matter is inappropriate.

193
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,800
If word gets out,

194
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,530
People will surely say Grandpa is a dirty old man.

195
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,440
Never mind, never mind.

196
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,560
I'm going back.

197
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,800
Grandpa,

198
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,280
Since you're already here.

199
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,610
Since I'm already here,

200
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,920
You're right.

201
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,760
My dear,

202
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,280
I can do it myself.

203
00:13:59,040 --> 00:13:59,840
Fang Xian,

204
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,600
You, you stop right now!

205
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,560
I can't, my dear.

206
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,240
I can't stop.

207
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,160
Will you stop or not?

208
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,760
I can't, I really can't stop.

209
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,160
Listen,

210
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,760
How much noise your sister and them are making.

211
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,160
Will you stop or not?

212
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:16,880
I can't.

213
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,800
You-

214
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,440
Grandpa!

215
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,240
My dear,

216
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,050
I really can't hold on anymore.

217
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,610
I'll be the death of you!

218
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,520
Miss,

219
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,860
are you and the young master for real?

220
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,880
Why would you ask that?

221
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,480
Didn't you two yesterday...

222
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,960
...make such a ruckus that the bed collapsed?

00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,760
Ting Yu.

224
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
Let me tell you,

225
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,800
this matter absolutely cannot be spread around.

226
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,930
Otherwise, I'll...

227
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,480
Miss.

228
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,800
Isn't it a bit late to say that?

229
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,760

230

232

233
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,880
