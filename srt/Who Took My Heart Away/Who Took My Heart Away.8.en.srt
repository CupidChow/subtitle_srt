1
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:55,560
Yi Shuo.

2
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,360
Zi Fan.

3
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,440
I have fortunately not failed in my mission.

4
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,000
Doctor,

5
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,729
when will Grandfather wake up?

6
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,320
He needs to

7
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,530
rest for a few more days.

8
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
I'm exhausted.

9
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,400
Grandfather!

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,260
Father, Grandfather!

11
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,120
Fang Xian, you're back.

12
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,120
Since the old master has recovered,

13
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,120
I shall take my leave.

14
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,280
Go see him off.

15
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
Alright, Father.

16
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,200
No need to see me off, really.

17
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,320
Grandfather,

18
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,320
are you really alright now?

19
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,400
I'm fine.

20
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
I know my own body best.

21
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,520
Fang Xian, you...

22
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,720
Look at you,

23
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,040
you've lost weight.

24
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,560
This time,

25
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,079
you've saved your grandfather's life.

26
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,040
I know.

27
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:37,040
Our Kan family owes you for this.

28
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,500
From now on, don't go out in the wind and sun anymore.

29
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,420
Come back home.

30
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,120
As for the matter of the divorce papers,

31
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,240
you can rest assured.

32
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,800
As long as I don't give my approval,

33
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,760
whatever anyone else says doesn't count.

34
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,960
But, Grandfather...

35
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,300
Don't try that with me.

36
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,560
Let me tell you,

37
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,720
didn't you say you don't want to stay at home?

38
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,200
If you can't earn a thousand taels of gold,

39
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,120
don't even think about running off somewhere far away.

40
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,920
Fine.

41
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,130
How dare you talk like that!

42
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,160
You think I don't know?

43
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,480
You're always thinking about going somewhere with that Shadow Master,

44
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,720
going here and there, and whatnot.

45
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,650
I'm telling you, it's impossible.

46
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,640
So I really am my wife's beloved.

47
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,480
Come, come.

48
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,900
Let's go out for a meal.

49
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,440
So my wife and I

50
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,570
are in love with each other.

51
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,160
Don't leave from now on.

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,320
If anyone bullies you,

53
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,980
grandpa will stand up for you.

54
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,520
I didn't expect

55
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,320
that the young miss really brought back the medicine this time.

56
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:43,360
Now the old master will surely favor the young miss even more.

57
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Grandfather was saved this time because Kan Meiyuan took a risk.

58
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,290
He was only saved

59
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,680
That's a separate matter.

60
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,880
Don't talk nonsense.

61
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,920
This young lady has a good eye.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,640
This piece of Xiuyu jade is a rare and exquisite item.

63
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,240
Wearing it for a long time can nourish the body and cure ailments.

64
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,970
So you're saying

65
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,140
it would be beneficial for grandfather's illness too?

66
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,040
But the color...

67
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,400
If you don't know how to appreciate it,

68
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,600
don't get in the way here.

69
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,880
What kind of attitude is this?

70
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,680
Do you know who our young lady is?

71
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,200
Well, do you know who our boss is?

72
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,560
Our shops are spread all over the world.

73
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,200
We've seen plenty of people like you,

74
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,760
pretending to know things and trying to haggle.

75
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,560
You...

76
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,800
How dare a small shop like this

77
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,600
treat customers so arrogantly?

78
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,400
It seems our Liu family in Runzhou

79
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,800
has some serious oversight issues.

80
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,600
Second Young Master,

81
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,840
what brings you here?

82
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,080
This is the second young lady of the Kan family from Taizhou.

83
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,200
It's one thing that you failed to recognize such an important person,

84
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,720
but you even used our Liu family's name?

85
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,440
Second Young Master,

86
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,360
I was wrong.

87
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,760
This is a misunderstanding.

88
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,400
Miss Meiming, please forgive us.

89
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,480
To express our apologies,

90
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,560
whatever you like today

91
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,159
will be on me, how about that?

92
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,130
Unfortunately,

93
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,760
there's nothing in your store

94
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,159
that I find appealing.

95
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,850
You certainly have character,

96
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,520
Miss Meiming.

97
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,170
We'll meet again later.

98
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,960
Fortunately, the old master is alright this time.

99
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,160
Otherwise, our Kan family would have been in big trouble.

100
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,800
Master,

101
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,000
someone has sent a visiting card.

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,530
They're here to pay a visit.

103
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,400
Please show them in. Yes.

104
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,600
Master Kan,

105
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,440
Madam Kan,

106
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,240
Miss Kan,

107
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,400
Liu Jinu pays his respects.

108
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,440
Liu Jinu,

109
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,400
from the Liu family of Runzhou.

110
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,440
I've come here today to propose a marriage.

111
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,360
I hope to have the opportunity to marry into the Kan family

112
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,090
and become Miss Kan's husband.

113
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,640
Esteemed son-in-law,

114
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,600
you're too kind.

115
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,120
The Liu family from Runzhou wants to marry into our family.

116
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
Young Master Liu,

117
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,000
our Kan family really can't aspire to such a match.

118
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,440
Please go back.

119
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,640
My dear wife,

120
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,640
I can't take it anymore.

121
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,800
it's my first time as your husband.

122
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,159
My back is about to break.

123
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,690
It's really going to break.

124
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,520
My dear wife,

125
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,880
About this training,

126
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,960
haste makes waste.

127
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,680
I think it's better to progress gradually.

128
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,920
Alright then.

129
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,400
Actually, I'm doing this for your own good.

130
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,760
Learning some martial arts

131
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,080
can not only strengthen your body,

132
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,960
but also protect yourself.

133
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,960
Isn't that great?

134
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,500
You're right, my dear.

135
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,640
In the future,

136
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,000
I'll pay attention to it.

137
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,640
You're getting bolder and bolder now.

138
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,480
Casually making physical contact with me.

139
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,340
You're not bad yourself, my dear.

140
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,120
I.

141
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,280
That's not what I meant.

142
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,440
I... I did it to prevent you from touching me.

143
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,840
I only did that to keep you from getting close to me.

144
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,000
My wife's intelligence and wit

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
are always applied in strange ways.

146
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,120
Shut up.

147
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,240
But grandfather was right about one thing.

148
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,080
This time, it was indeed thanks to you.

149
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,080
Both emotionally and rationally, I should thank you.

150
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,380
I should give you some reward.

151
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,159
My dear,

152
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,280
don't.

153
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,400
I.

154
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm not ready yet.

155
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:03,920
My dear,

156
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,720
is that all?

157
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,210
My dear still harbors resentment towards me.

158
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,800
Could it be

159
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,370
that you prefer my identity as the Shadow Master?

160
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,480
When will I ever have good days then?

161
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,220
Shadow Master.

162
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,880
Since that night we parted,

163
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,800
we haven't had a proper conversation.

164
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,200
I've truly neglected such a beautiful lady.

165
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,960
No, no, no.

166
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,680
This humble servant still needs the Shadow Master's help.

167
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,560
I'm the one who has been neglectful of the Shadow Master.

168
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,890
What do you mean by that?

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,400
I should be thanking you, miss,

170
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,920
for giving me such a good opportunity

171
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,120
to be a hero saving a damsel in distress.

172
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,080
The weather is lovely today.

173
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,720
Would you like to join me,

174
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,520
the Shadow Master, for a heart-to-heart talk?

175
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,060
Shadow Master,

176
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,400
are you joking with me?

177
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,450
I never joke with beautiful women.

178
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,640
No way.

179
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,880
Fang Xian,

180
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,480
explain to me

181
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,410
what's going on.

182
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:43,720
I...

183
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,640
I...

184
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,800
I was just joking with you,

185
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,880
you stinky boy!

186
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,640
Don't run away!

187
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,040
I'm going to give you extra training today!

188
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,840
Stop right there! Don't run!

189
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,640
Miss.

190
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:14,880
Miss.

191
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,860
What are you doing?

192
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,640
Are you thinking about the young master again?

193
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,880
Your relationship has been getting better lately.

194
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,360
When are you planning to tie the knot?

195
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,320
Do you even know how to use idioms properly?

196
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,920
What do you mean by 'tie the knot'?

197
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,880
Stop talking nonsense.

198
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,920
Quickly, go find someone

199
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,320
to call the young master back for his shift.

200
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
At this time,

201
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,780
the young master should be taking a bath.

202
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,760
I'm just here to inspect the bathing pool.

203
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,800
come a little closer.

204
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,560
What's so strange about that?

205
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,010
The extra practice has shown results so quickly.

206
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,920
My dear wife,

207
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,680
peeking from outside,

208
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,960
it would be quite improper if someone were to discover us.

209
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,680
I

210
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,540
We are husband and wife after all.

211
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,400
Why don't you come in and have a proper look?

212
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,060
Rest assured, sir.

213
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,440
We've booked the entire place for today.

214
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,360
No one will overhear our conversation.

215
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,160
Good.

216
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,320
I've entered Taizhou under the identity of a Sindhu person.

217
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,580
No one will notice anything suspicious.

218
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,120
Something unusual happened with the Kan family recently.

219
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,680
They mobilized a large group of people to go to Rong Mountain.

220
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:37,410
However, things have returned to normal lately.

221
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,360
Since things are back to normal,

222
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,020
there's no need to dwell on it.

223
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,240
I must say,

224
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,760
the business at Tianxiang Pool

225
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,520
is indeed well-run by the Kan family.

226
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,280
Tianxiang Pool is naturally excellent in all aspects.

227
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,280
However, when it comes to massages,

228
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,500
it's really hard to compliment them.

229
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,440
Since we're all prepared,

230
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,320
let's get ready to take action.

231
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,120
Yes.

232
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,880
Anyway,

233
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,770
I just want to throw the Kan family into chaos,

234
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,800
and make Fang Xian hand over

235
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,200
the token of the Jinyi Chamber of Commerce.
