1
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,600
Yi Shuo.

2
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,640
Adapted from the Fanqie novel '

3
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,320
You guys really have a deep brotherly bond, huh?

4
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,920
I can't believe you chased me all the way here.

5
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,760
Our boss was assassinated by you.

6
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,480
Most of our brothers died by your hand.

7
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
If we don't kill you,

8
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,280
how can we face the world?

9
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,480
Killing your boss

10
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,480
would allow me to join the ranks of the top ten assassins.

11
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,400
Then I could meet the Shadow Master.

12
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,440
But if you continue to be so stubborn,

13
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't mind sending you to the underworld

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,930
to continue being brothers there.

15
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,329
So you're saying

16
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,640
you're not willing to admit it?

17
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,680
The same words

18
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,360
I won't say twice.

19
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,760
This is absolutely ridiculous.

20
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,720
Old Eight,

21
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,120
how can you be an assassin like this?

22
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,600
Our Shadow Sentinel

23
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,120
has always been clear about right and wrong.

24
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,650
You always go for overkill.

25
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,560
Look at the mess you've made now.

26
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,520
How can I tolerate you?

27
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,360
It's not like I haven't warned you.

28
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,560
You insist on killing innocents.

29
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,760
Don't you feel

30
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,000
your hands are covered in blood?

31
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,040
Aren't you afraid of karma?

32
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,100
Why do you care so much about what I do?

33
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,280
We are assassins.

34
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,960
You're the only one always thinking about being a hero.

35
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,290
Who do you think you are?

36
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,840
It's nonsense.

37
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,540
I am the Shadow Master.

38
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,840
Those rumors about killing innocents are all false.

39
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
You believe them?

40
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,720
What?

41
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,000
Don't you dare.

42
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,960
I'll give you the time it takes to eat a bowl of noodles.

43
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,240
kill or flee,

44
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,600
it's up to you.

45
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,760
Lao Ba.

46
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,400
Boss, run quickly!

47
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,560
I'm not.

48
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,160
Before they realize my qi is exhausted,

49
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,890
quickly replenish your blood.

50
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,860
What are you doing?

51
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,960
Damn it.

52
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,480
I haven't even met my Shadow Master yet.

53
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,120
and I'm about to die here.

54
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,399
Stop staring and run!

55
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,560
Miss, you're finally back.

56
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,840
I was worried sick.

57
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,360
Don't you trust your miss's skills?

58
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,960
What is there to worry about?

59
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,640
Oh, right.

60
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,400
You know what?

61
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,040
This time,

62
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,900
I encountered the Shadow Master.

63
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,200
It's the legendary

64
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,040
nine-foot-tall

65
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,800
winged

66
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,400
green-faced, fanged Master of Yingshao.

67
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,200
Rumors.

68
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,420
Shadow Master.

69
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,050
Are you alright?

70
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,820
Are you the Shadow Master?

71
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,320
Shadow Master,

72
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,480
may I have the honor of seeing your true face?

73
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,280
Wait.

74
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,280
Young master,

75
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,460
I'm only doing this for your own good.

76
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,930
Give me back the Shadow Master.

77
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,200
Those are all rumors.

78
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,720
The Shadow Master

79
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,000
is chivalrous, generous, and commands respect from all.

80
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,640
He's truly a dragon among men.

81
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,720
Those people are just slandering the Shadow Master.

82
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,780
What are you doing?

83
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,400
If it weren't for those

84
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,080
rumors about Yingshao killing innocent people,

85
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,680
they wouldn't be slandered like this.

86
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,200
It's all a misunderstanding.

87
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,960
In all my years with Yingshao,

88
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,320
we've only robbed the rich to help the poor.

89
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,580
We've only killed those who deserved it.

90
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,200
Meiyuan,

91
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,840
grandfather is here.

92
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,120
Grandfather is here to pressure me about marriage again.

93
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,040
Wait a moment.

94
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,170
Miss, your clothes.

95
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,240
Where's Meiyuan?

96
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,920
Grandfather is here.

97
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,040
Grandfather,

98
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,100
you're here again.

99
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,400
Meiyuan, let me tell you,

100
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,360
if you don't get married soon,

101
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,400
what will people say about me?

102
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,560
They'll say grandfather is

103
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,200
an ungrateful, disloyal wretch.

104
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,920
When our Kan family goes out,

105
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,560
we won't be able to hold our heads up or show our faces.

106
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,760
I'd rather die.

107
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,040
Where are you going?

108
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,160
I'm not finished talking yet.

109
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,640
I've told you so many times already.

110
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,760
I already have someone I like.

111
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,640
I won't marry anyone but him.

112
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,160
Why do you have to force me?

113
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,680
Fine.

114
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,480
Since you say so,

115
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,400
then tell me,

116
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,760
what's his name?

117
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,600
Who is he?

118
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,840
You're not saying anything again.

119
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,559
Every time I ask you, it's the same.

120
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,880
I think you're doing this on purpose.

121
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,559
You're just letting people stab me in the back.

122
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,840
You want your grandfather to be seen as an ungrateful wretch,

123
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,960
breaking promises and betraying trust, don't you?

124
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,160
What era are we living in?

125
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,320
You're still arranging marriages before birth?

126
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,000
Can't you be a little more mature?

127
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,840
mature.

128
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,320
What's wrong with arranging marriages before birth?

129
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,480
I'm not mature?

130
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,160
Fine.

131
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,060
I'll die right now to show you.

132
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,080
My dear,

133
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,040
This kind of weather always reminds me of you.

134
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
You know, living alone...

135
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,440
Grandpa.

136
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,400
Grandpa.

137
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,360
Come up quickly.

138
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:13,960
I promise you.

139
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,240
Isn't it enough that I promise you?

140
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:15,920
Okay.

141
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,680
You must keep your word.

142
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,960
There's no time like the present.

143
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,880
Let me do a quick calculation.

144
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,120
Today is an auspicious day.

145
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,200
Very lucky and prosperous.

146
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,320
You're calculating now?

147
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,080
Yes.

148
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,840
Grandpa.

149
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,600
Could you please stop joking?

150
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,400
Joking?

151
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,280
Do I look like I'm joking?

152
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,800
Guards!

153
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,040
Change my clothes.

154
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,080
Stop.

155
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,210
I'll change myself.

156
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:58,960
That guy Qingyang

157
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,640
smeared something all over my face.

158
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,770
Why have I lost my martial arts skills?

159
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
Nice to meet you.

160
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,640
You must be Fang Xian.

161
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,570
What do you want?

162
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,440
I am

163
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Don't be nervous, don't be nervous.

164
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,700
I'm not some kind of...

165
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,840
...good person.

166
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,080
I'm not a bad person either.

167
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,360
I...

168
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,840
...just want to arrange a marriage for you.

169
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,680
With you?

170
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,840
Brother,

171
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,200
With me.

172
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,800
Come on, come on.

173
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,200
Let's change clothes for your son-in-law.

174
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,600
Master also knows that Yingshao has a notorious reputation.

175
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,200
How dare you still ask them to take action?

176
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,720
Isn't it because the old master wants to be absolutely sure?

177
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,920
You know me.

178
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,480
Even if I had two lives,

179
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,520
I wouldn't dare to get involved with Yingshao.

180
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,240
Right?

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,760
My worthy son-in-law,

182
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,600
Don't worry.

183
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,440
You're marrying my daughter,

184
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,560
not me.

185
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,640
Brother,

186
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,600
is this really necessary?

187
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,680
Is your daughter a tigress?

188
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,080
Insisting on tying me up to get married.

189
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,340
Don't call me brother.

190
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,730
Call me father-in-law.

191
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,000
You're so busy with the Jinyi Chamber of Commerce,

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,080
always coming and going like a dragon, seen only briefly.

193
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,160
Resorting to such a low tactic.

194
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,560
I had no choice.

195
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,720
Otherwise, when would you and my daughter ever get married?

196
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,480
Right?

197
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,280
I won't marry.

198
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,640
I won't marry! I won't marry!

199
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,250
I said I won't marry!

200
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,880
I won't marry! I won't marry!

201
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,250
I said I won't marry!

202
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,720
Aren't you tired of this?

203
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,050
Put me down! Put me down!

204
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,760
Is this supposed to be the heir of the Jinyi Chamber of Commerce?

205
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,840
He doesn't look like one.

206
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,400
That's good that he doesn't.

207
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,880
it's better if he's just an ordinary person.

208
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,880
The less trouble for me, the better.

209
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,450
Don't get any ideas.

210
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,480
You want me to marry into your family.

211
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,200
It's all for the Jinyi Chamber of Commerce, isn't it?

212
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,560
I've long since cut ties with the Jinyi Chamber of Commerce.

213
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,760
The Jinyi Chamber of Commerce is wealthy and powerful.

214
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,480
I can't believe you'd voluntarily cut ties with them.

215
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,560
It's nothing but a competition of vanity,

216
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,000
a business of speculation and profiteering.

217
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,400
Secretly colluding and compromising,

218
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,640
even hiring thugs to commit violence.

219
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,040
It's far from being a glorious homecoming.

220
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,800
You've got guts.

221
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,000
As expected of the grandson-in-law I personally chose.

222
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,160
I

223
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,960
Please welcome the bride.

224
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,160
You think I'm good, don't you?

225
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,240
then I'll just ruin my image, that should be fine, right?

226
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,040
Wait a moment.

227
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,840
You're in such a hurry to have me marry into your family.

228
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,680
This bride must be an ugly duckling.

229
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,280
Let me make this clear to you.

230
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,240
I, Fang Xian,

231
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,400
have seen countless beauties.

232
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,130
If your young lady doesn't meet my standards,

233
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,090
I'd rather marry this maid.

234
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,640
You all

235
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,840
This is absolutely ridiculous.

236
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,920
It was all the young lady's idea.

237
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
How come it's you?

238
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,160
Boss, run quickly!

239
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,320
I'm not.

240
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,880
Aren't you that stall owner?

241
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,480
I am your humble son-in-law.

242
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,400
Greetings, grandfather.

243
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,960
Father-in-law, mother-in-law,

244
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,690
please accept Fang Xian's bow.

245
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,440
A shallow lecher like you,

246
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
I will absolutely never be with you.

247
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,860
What are you doing?

248
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:04,960
Pervert!

249
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,400
This is just an accident.

250
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,000
You're the one who tackled me.

251
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:09,640
What do you mean by accident?

252
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,560
You did it on purpose.

253
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:10,920
No,

254
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,580
I was just trying to catch you.

255
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,560
What's going on here?

256
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,640
Now that the ceremony is complete,

257
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,280
there's no backing out, okay?

258
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,960
I've just heard

259
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,040
that Fang Xian has agreed.

260
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,380
So let me ask once more,

261
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,480
Meiyuan,

262
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,600
are you willing?

263
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,840
I don't... I do, I do!

264
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,880
I don't!

265
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,760
No, that's not...

266
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,160
Hey, you better switch back right now!

267
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,200
Well, maybe a kiss is the only way to switch back.

268
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,560
You're trying to take advantage of me, aren't you?

269
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,360
I'm not!

270
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,240
What are you doing? Where are you touching?

271
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,120
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Congratulations, congratulations!

272
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,920
Thank you.

273
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,800
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

274
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,120
Here, a red envelope.

275
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,840
Thank you, thank you everyone.

276
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,640
Enjoy the food and drinks!

277
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,360
Congratulations, congratulations!

278
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,280
I'm so embarrassed.

279
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,680
This is so embarrassing.

280
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,740
Please enjoy the food and drinks!

281
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,440
Miss, wait for me!

282
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,720
My son-in-law is a bit impatient.

283
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,680
Everyone, let's start the feast.

284
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,840
Enjoy the food and drinks.

285
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,900
come on, it's good.

286
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,040
come, come, come.

287
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,640
Say.

288
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,760
What exactly do we need to do to switch back?

289
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,640
I'm completely clueless too.

290
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,480
My dear,

291
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,520
I'm afraid we need to kiss again.

292
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,720
We have to kiss again?

293
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,120
Come on, my dear.

294
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,320
Close your eyes.

295
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,280
Don't move.

296
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,120
don't move.

297
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,480
I'll kiss myself.

298
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
i'll kiss myself.

299
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,960
I can do it.

300
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,960
Don't, don't, don't come near me.

301
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,160
Quick, quick, get up.

302
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,640
I don't want a live-in son-in-law.

303
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,800
I want to break off the engagement.
