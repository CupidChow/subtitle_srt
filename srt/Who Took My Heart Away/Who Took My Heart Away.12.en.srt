1
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,600
Yi Shuo.

2
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,560
A bunch of little bastards.

3
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,690
You still dare to come and steal water.

4
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,080
I'm going to break your legs today.

5
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,140
What are you doing?

6
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,880
The well has already been sealed.

7
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,400
Do you still want to go to such extremes now?

8
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,560
Brother Fang Xian,

9
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,120
Little Lian fell ill last night.

10
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,450
we just wanted to get water to brew medicine for Little Lian.

11
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,040
Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda.

12
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,160
Even if you're acting under orders,

13
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,840
you can't just stand by and watch someone die, can you?

14
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,240
Give them water.

15
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,639
If the higher-ups blame us,

16
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,120
who will save our lives?

17
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,170
A bunch of lowly people.

18
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,960
Who knows when they'll die in some corner of the city.

19
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,160
What's there to pity?

20
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,320
There may be differences in social status,

21
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,440
but since when did human lives have a distinction between noble and lowly?

22
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,360
As officials,

23
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,480
don't you even understand this basic principle?

24
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,120
You-

25
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
What's it to you?

26
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,480
Brothers,

27
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,200
get him!

28
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,960
Are you hurt?

29
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,600
You shouldn't play the hero without any skills.

30
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,730
Aren't you afraid of losing your life?

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,280
My dear,

32
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,360
I can actually fight too.

33
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,520
Miss, Young Master,

34
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,850
something's happened.

35
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,000
Song Kang.

36
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,760
Song Kang.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,960
Miss Meiyuan,

38
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,290
We are not yet husband and wife.

39
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,040
You barged in while I was bathing.

40
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,770
That's not appropriate, is it?

41
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,600
Song Kang,

42
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,200
you previously had the soldiers seal off

43
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,480
the wells in the outer city, and that wasn't enough.

44
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,880
Now you've gone even further

45
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:14,760
and sealed the wells in the inner city's civilian areas too.

46
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,560
You've taken on

47
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,079
the task of preparing Marquis Yanqing for his audience with the emperor.

48
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:20,160
An imperial audience is a matter of great importance.

49
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,360
The water used for bathing

50
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,880
cannot come from the same source as that used by common people.

51
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,640
Ridiculous.

52
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,600
No matter how respected the marquis is,

53
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,480
he shouldn't be so extravagant at the expense of the people.

54
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,210
Before? Don't mention before.

55
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,360
It was because they weren't respectful enough to His Majesty before.

56
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,280
As the newly appointed Grand Master of Ceremonies,

57
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,210
I must fulfill my duties properly.

58
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,560
Besides, I haven't burdened the people much.

59
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,720
I've only blocked the water access points within the city,

60
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,040
not those outside the city.

61
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,480
As the Grand Master of Ceremonies,

62
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,640
aren't you afraid the court will find out

63
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,920
about your actions?

64
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,720
Aren't you afraid of losing your official hat?

65
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,040
You actually believe

66
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,520
that those bigwigs in the court care about the common people?

67
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,280
I thought you merchants

68
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,320
had already seen through worldly interests.

69
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,280
Unexpectedly,

70
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,880
you're still so naive.

71
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,960
There's no use talking further.

72
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,680
Let's go.

73
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,440
Do whatever you want.

74
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,880
Everyone,

75
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
we absolutely will not

76
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,800
sacrifice the lives of the common people

77
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,130
to gain imperial favor.

78
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,360
Starting from today,

79
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,159
we will cease

80
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,040
all operations of the Tianxiang Pool bathhouse.

81
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,920
We will open all water sources of Tianxiang Pool

82
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,200
for the villagers to fetch water.

83
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,280
My husband's will is my will.

84
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,080
Extinguish the furnaces and release the water.

85
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,880
Yes.

86
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,770
Finally, we don't have to go outside the city to fetch water.

87
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,040
The Kan family truly cares for the people's needs.

88
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,640
That's bold.

89
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
But don't say I didn't warn you.

90
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,080
Business is business.

91
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,200
Your bathhouse is no ordinary shop.

92
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,800
One day of closure

93
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,560
I hope you're aware of how much you'll lose.

94
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,240
Let's see how long you can hold out.

95
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,720
It's only been a few days,

96
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,330
and the deficit is already worse than before.

97
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,240
Meiyuan,

98
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,400
if this continues,

99
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,960
we really won't be able to keep Tianxiang Pool.

100
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,960
What a noble act of self-sacrifice!

101
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,840
You're now using the entire Kan family

102
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,400
to pay for your heroic deed.

103
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,160
It's the first time I've seen

104
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,440
someone being so generous with other people's money

105
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,040
and still managing to be so righteous about it.

106
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,680
When Tianxiang Pool was profitable before,

107
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,200
I acquired several properties.

108
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,440
I will find opportunities to sell them off.

109
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,280
And then what?

110
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,760
Continue to lose money, is that it?

111
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,560
Kan Meiyuan,

112
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,880
if you want to be a hero, then go all the way.

113
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,680
A businessman

114
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,250
doesn't operate like this.

115
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,200
Stop arguing, stop arguing.

116
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,920
Meiyuan.

117
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,450
Meiming is right this time.

118
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,240
Tingyu, Tingyu.

119
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,560
Go, go, go. Hurry up and start the furnace.

120
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,880
I...

121
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,960
Go on.

122
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,840
I'm in charge of Tianxiang Pool now.

123
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,960
The seal is in my hands.

124
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,040
Your words don't count.

125
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,560
I'm still your father.

126
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,280
I'm ordering you right now.

127
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,960
Who's whose father?

128
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,160
I'm your father.

129
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,480
You're my father, you're my father.

130
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,000
Listen up, all of you.

131
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,680
Whoever possesses the Kan family seal

132
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,920
will have control over all affairs of Tianxiang Pool.

133
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,980
This is the rule set by our ancestors.

134
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,120
You all...

135
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,760
That's enough.

136
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,560
It seems

137
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,650
I need to ask everyone for help.

138
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,159
The second young lady seems to be in a good mood.

139
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,140
Young Master Liu has graced us with his presence again.

140
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,120
Didn't I tell you?

141
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,810
If you can find a way to deal with my sister,

142
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,560
I'll agree to this marriage.

143
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,680
Then, is the weight of this incident

144
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,480
enough?

145
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,690
I can't believe you have the ability to command the Grand Ceremonial Officer.

146
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,600
Command?

147
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,120
It's not quite like that.

148
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,880
It's just a mutually beneficial arrangement.

149
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,960
Now even your father in the Kan family

150
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,220
has objections to Meiyuan's decisions.

151
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,970
When the deficit of Tianxiang Pool explodes,

152
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,530
no one can protect the seal of authority in her hands.

153
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,920
So,

154
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,130
when will you seriously consider the matter of marriage alliance?

155
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,970
This is just the beginning.

156
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,340
I'll make sure you never have a peaceful day.

157
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,800
Grand Ceremonial Officer Song Kang,

158
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,200
acting against the will of the people,

159
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,480
to curry favor with the emperor,

160
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,600
has blocked the water source of Taizhou,

161
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,520
showing no concern for the common people.

162
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,720
I hope someone will handle this matter.

163
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,920
As this is a matter of great importance,

164
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,720
I order that employees outside the top twenty of Yingshao

165
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,520
are not allowed to take on tasks.

166
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,960
Miss,

167
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,520
look, sky lanterns.

168
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,160
It's actually a task issued by the Shadow Master himself.

169
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,810
Here we go again.

170
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,560
You think this is some kind of drama?

171
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,320
You think a simple fall can lead to a kiss?

172
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,240
Let go of me!

173
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,680
My lady,

174
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,560
This isn't my fault, you know.

175
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,440
I'm going out for a while.

176
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,900
Wait for me at the mansion.

177
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,380
What are you doing?

178
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,920
I know, I know.

179
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,920
Could it be

180
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,410
that the Shadow Master wants to do it himself?

181
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,560
As soon as this task is issued,

182
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,620
it actually gives me an opportunity.

183
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,880
Then I'll use my most skilled method

184
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,120
to settle this matter.

185
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,920
Yes,

186
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,400
there's no time to waste.

187
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,800
My lady,

188
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:45,800
miss.

189
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,280
My lady,

190
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,800
I know I've been performing well lately,

191
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,160
but if you want to reward me,

192
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,720
could you give me a heads up?

193
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,240
So I can be mentally prepared.

194
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,320
Actually, I can kiss even better.

195
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,040
W-what are you talking about?

196
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,600
That's not what I meant at all!

197
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,880
I'm just in a hurry to go out with Tingyu to take care of something.

198
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,200
You, you, you, you...

199
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,240
Get some rest early.

200
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,300
Don't mess around.

201
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,530
You don't believe I didn't send it out?

202
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,680
Aren't you...

203
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,320
Damn it.

204
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,200
Attention, everyone.

205
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,530
The officials are here.

206
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,600
Are you Fang Xian?

207
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,680
You mean the son-in-law of the Kan family?

208
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,400
Fang Xian.

209
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,040
Who else could be Fang Xian?

210
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,520
Hurry up.

211
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,400
Come with us.

212
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,400
I see.

213
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,640
When do we make our move?

214
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,520
The son-in-law of the Kan family you mentioned,

215
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,960
could it be the husband of that ravishing beauty,

216
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,040
that enchanting,

217
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,880
Miss Kan Meiyuan's husband,

218
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,600
Fang Xian?

219
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,680
Are you messing with me?

220
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,400
You allowed your wife to assault officials.

221
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,480
If you want to live, be smart about it.

222
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,560
I am, I am.

223
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,490
Take me away, take me away quickly.

224
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,930
I really can't understand.

225
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,000
What charm do you have

226
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,130
that makes Meiyuan choose you over me?

227
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,760
Because you two are not the same kind of person.

228
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,240
My wife abhors evil,

229
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,560
is generous and kind,

230
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,280
and always puts the people first.

231
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,000
As for you,

232
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,360
to achieve your goals,

233
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,520
you deceive both superiors and subordinates,

234
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,760
and don't hesitate to exploit the people and waste resources.

235
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,840
How despicable.

236
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,320
