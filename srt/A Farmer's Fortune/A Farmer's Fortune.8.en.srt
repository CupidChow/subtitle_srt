00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
Xifeng,

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,480
you've got new jewelry again.

24
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,680
Must have spent quite a bit.

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
It's really beautiful.

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,960
Just a few taels of silver.

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,920
No worth mentioning.

28
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,120
It's different

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,200
from ours.

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,960
Tian Xifeng,

31
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,280
you troublesome woman!

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,180
You brought Xiaosheng to me.

33
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,800
Said he wanted to sign the death contract.

34
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:37,880
And now he's run off.

35
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,720
Again and again, you two...

36
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,720
Are you both playing me

37
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,200
for a fool?

38
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,680
How could Tian Xifeng

39
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,800
sell Xiaosheng?

40
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,240
That's truly a ruthless heart.

41
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,360
Boss Wang.

42
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,920
There's a misunderstanding here.

43
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,920
Let's go somewhere else.

44
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,920
I'll explain it to you.

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,880
I've met plenty like you before.

46
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,720
Look proper on the surface.

47
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,680
Yet secretly sold out your own kin.

48
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,360
But those grudges aren't my concern.

49
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,400
I paid, yet never got the person.

50
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,360
You owe me twice the amount.

51
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,760
I don't have that much right now.

52
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,880
These shiny trinkets of yours.

53
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,960
They're newly bought, right?

54
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
Take them off.

55
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,880
My stomach hurts.

56
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,720
I need to see the physician first.

57
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,200
Stop trying to pull tricks on me.

58
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,160
It's not me who caused your condition.

59
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,400
Well then?

60
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,920
Want me to take them off?

61
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,120
Ring.

62
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,680
You and your husband,

63
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,160
better watch yourselves in the future.

64
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,600
She even sold his nephew?

65
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,880
It's unacceptable.

66
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,480
Some "scholarly family" this is!

67
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,960
Her character is truly lacking.

68
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,680
How could she sell a child?

69
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,840
It's you.

70
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,080
You had Wang Cheng act out this scene.

71
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,800
You just wanted to humiliate me,
didn't you?

72
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,650
I...

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,680
Tian Xifeng,

74
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,160
I'm telling you,

75
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,760
next time you dare

76
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,240
to make a move on my child.

77
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,560
It won't just be a slap.

78
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,200
- Well done!
- Exactly,

79
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,290
selling a child deserves it.

80
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,170
She deserves it.

81
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,360
How could she do such a thing?

82
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,600
Selling children?

83
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,520
- Shocking.
- It is.

84
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,480
That was so satisfying.

85
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,640
How could she do such a thing?

86
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,920
Say something, will you?

87
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:24,480
Mother.

88
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,840
You actually did it.

89
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,280
Of course I did.

90
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,480
I promised you to

91
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,480
get your revenge.

92
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,280
With my wok-tossing technique strength,

93
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
in three days,

94
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,400
that handprint on her face

95
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,560
won't fade at all.

96
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,400
Impressive.

97
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,000
Though,

98
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,840
using force is not right.

99
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,280
Still, we must know
how to protect ourselves.

100
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
What do you say?

101
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,640
Want to learn the wok-tossing Technique?

102
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,960
Yes.

103
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,040
You little Tangbao.

104
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,040
What about you?

105
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,560
Though he was misled by bad people,

106
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,680
I still think

107
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,000
Xiaosheng should also learn

108
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,320
to discern right from wrong.

109
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
Well,

110
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,140
I'll take him to school tomorrow.

111
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,520
True.

112
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,280
Gaining wisdom is important.

113
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,910
But after school,

114
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,040
he can still learn cooking.

115
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,240
Am I right? Come on.

116
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,680
Eat some more.

117
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,760
Tangbao, you too.

118
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,470
Father.

119
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,560
Do you think being a great chef

120
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,920
or a great hero is better?

121
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,560
Is it that you don't want to

122
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,120
learn cooking from your mother?

123
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,280
No.

124
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,040
I just think
being a great hero is cooler.

125
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,280
Look at you.

126
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,480
Mr. Fu.

127
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,880
Thank you.

128
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,520
Let's go.

129
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,320
Sanniang.

130
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,400
She's shy.

131
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,040
We've lost some time again.

132
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,560
Let's hurry.

133
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,040
We need to catch up with the deadline.

134
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,320
Mother.

135
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,040
How did our Tangbao know

136
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,760
Mother needed these ingredients?

137
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,600
I remember it as soon as I smell it.

138
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
Really?

139
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,880
You not only have a little dog nose,

140
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,760
but is also so good
at remembering recipes.

141
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,400
Alright, Tangbao, work with me.

142
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,280
Okay.

143
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,760
Mother's getting tired.

144
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,880
Tangbao will help you make
cold bean jelly.

145
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,880
Tangbao is still too young.

146
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,200
You can't make it just yet.

147
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,720
However,

148
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,280
what you said is right.

149
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,480
There's no way
I can finish this on my own.

150
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,820
If only I could find someone
to lend a hand.

151
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,040
Xiaosheng.

152
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,840
Brother.

153
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,760
Perfect timing.

154
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,160
Xiaosheng, could you help me out?

155
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,260
Let's make cold bean jelly.

156
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:21,000
The teacher assigned a lot of homework.

157
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,040
I...

158
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,000
That's true.

159
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,760
He started school far too late.

160
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,040
He's fallen behind on lessons.

161
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,320
No time to learn cooking skills.

162
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,170
- True.
- Go on then.

163
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,960
Let me help you.

164
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,600
Have you ever cooked before?

165
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,040
Never.

166
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,050
Father.

167
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,840
You can't do anything in the kitchen.

168
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,400
Just go wash the chili peppers.

169
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,840
Tangbao.

170
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,000
Is that so?

171
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,160
I'm doing it right.

172
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,820
Out of chili peppers.

173
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,200
I'll go pick some more then.

174
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,400
Alright.

175
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,560
Mr. Fu.

176
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,760
Why are you doing such laborious work?

177
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,320
Are you here for Qingqing?

178
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,160
She's been gone.

179
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,760
I… I made some extra pastries.

180
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,000
Couldn't finish them alone at home.

181
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,040
The children could have a taste.

182
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,320
Many thanks.

183
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,160
No need to thank me.

184
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,200
If the children enjoy it,

185
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,320
I can make something new every

186
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,880
for them and for you.

187
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,320
This time, let's just say I bought it.

188
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,120
No need to trouble yourself.

189
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,920
Mr. Fu,

190
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,880
I heard you want a divorce.

191
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,440
Is that true?

192
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,160
I'm only concerned for you, Mr. Fu.

193
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,720
After all, the He Family

194
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,000
is a powerful household.

195
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,000
Village Head will naturally lean toward them.

196
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,840
But if you truly wish for a divorce,

197
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,320
there are ways to make it happen.

198
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,440
This is a private matter.

199
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,760
No need for you to trouble yourself.

200
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,040
Mr. Fu, you must keep your eyes open.

201
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,440
He Qingqing now keeps a calmer face.

202
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,980
Because she's afraid you'll divorce her.

203
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,000
Yet deep inside…

204
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,320
She doesn't truly care
for you and the child.

205
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,880
Just look at the flour jar...

206
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,320
And the oil pot...

207
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,840
Even the soil...

208
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,160
See? This sleeve is torn.

209
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,280
She wouldn't even mend it.

210
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,920
She's not truly devoted to you.

211
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,600
Mr. Fu, are you worried your home

212
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,680
will fall apart without her?

213
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,320
When busy, I forget things.

214
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,840
Even forgot to bring the money pouch.

215
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,240
What's going on here?

216
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,000
That part isn't even in the family letters.

217
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,360
Do I intervene or not?

218
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,000
If I don't meddle in Fu Qinghuai's affairs

219
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,200
and a new ancestor are born...

220
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,680
It will turn into chaos.

221
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,320
I won't let the child suffer.

222
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,960
And towards you,

223
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,200
I'll be accommodating.

224
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,640
Given the situation,

225
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,360
I might as well speak plainly.

226
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,560
What kind of person He Qingqing is?

227
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,240
I only trust what I have seen.

228
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:22,520
All that she's done to you in the past.

229
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,440
Can you really forgive it entirely?

230
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,680
Mr. Fu, no need to push yourself.

231
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,860
- Whether I forgive,
- I...

232
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,120
is not anyone else's concern.

233
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,960
Even if she's the same as she once was,

234
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,760
I would never walk away

235
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,600
by betraying her.

236
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,680
Well said.

237
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,120
Worthy of being my husband.

238
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,760
Stealing my man in the dead of night.

239
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,200
Don't you feel shame?

240
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,520
Such a pity.

241
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,660
My husband is devoted to me,
heart and soul.

242
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,200
He keeps himself as pure as jade.

243
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,680
Still, I appreciate your reminder.

244
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,560
From now on, towards my husband,

245
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,200
I will cherish him a hundred times more.

246
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,640
You won't get another chance.

247
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,120
The door is that way.

248
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,080
Seems I forgot my purse.

249
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,360
Oh right.

250
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,680
May I borrow your study for a moment?

251
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,500
The ink you asked for.

252
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,880
Thank... thank you.

253
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,360
- Just now...
- Just now...

254
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,520
Let me speak first.

255
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,520
The reason I said that just now

256
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:02,520
was to make Xu Sanniang believe

257
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,640
that our bond is strong.

258
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,880
That way, she'd know to back off

259
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,960
and stop entangling you.

260
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,680
I understand your intentions.

261
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,360
So just now,

262
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,320
what you said

263
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,200
was for that reason, wasn't it?

264
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,760
I know,

265
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,320
we've never truly lived
as husband and wife.

266
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,640
But if you wish to part ways and remarry,

267
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,240
could you wait

268
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,880
until I've redeemed Fengyang House?

269
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,000
And also,

270
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,760
could you please...

271
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,000
not ask for custody?

272
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,560
It's for Tangbao and Xiaosheng.

273
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,760
I have no such intention.

274
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,640
What...

275
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,880
are you doing?

276
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,400
Keeping accounts.

277
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,360
I'm tracking today's income to see

278
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,080
how much longer it take

279
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,560
to have enough to redeem the house.

280
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,500
(Lotus root cake)

281
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,080
I've barely even used it.

282
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,120
My business

283
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,000

a partner skilled in cooking.

284
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,840
Would you be willing?

285
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,120
Even if I were drowned in the river,

286
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,240
I'd never bow my head.

287
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,240
Stop dragging your feet.

288
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,000
If you don't pay up, then sell yourself.

289
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,840
Go.

290
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,100
How much does she owe you?

291
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,820
Are you paying for it for her?
