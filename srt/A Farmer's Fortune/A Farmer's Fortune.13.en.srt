22
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,340
(Two days ago)

23
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,590
Here, my dear.

24
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,680
Have some hot water.

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,880
Why would I drink that, He Datian?

26
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,680
If you had any standing with Wang Cheng,

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,640
would he back He Qingqing
to humiliate me?

28
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,040
I married down into your family

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,880
and haven't seen a single good day since.

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,360
My dear, calm down.

31
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,800
Drink the water first.

32
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,680
I'm not drinking it.

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,240
I'm still very much alive.

34
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,760
Yet here you are, shouting away.

35
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,240
Do you think that's proper?

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,400
Mother, please sit down first.

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,880
Mother.

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,680
Xifeng was simply driven

39
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,760
into a corner by He Qingqing.

40
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,080
You may not know

41
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,880
while you've been lying in bed,

42
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,080
He Qingqing has turned our lives
upside down.

43
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,080
I thought…

44
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,720
After I was gone,

45
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,840
she would take good care of you all.

46
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,480
Who would have thought

47
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,440
she's shut the door on her own family.

48
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,880
My daughter...

49
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,040
I raised her for nothing.

50
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,600
Mother,

51
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,280
we've nearly spent the household dry.

52
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,800
There's still a lot of debt.

53
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,520
How can we go on living like this?

54
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,400
I'm speaking with my son.

55
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,920
Why are you cutting in?

56
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,160
If you hadn't been whispering
behind our backs,

57
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,560
- I...
- You don't think of your son's future.

58
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,720
Then I must think of my own son.

59
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,040
Or maybe…

60
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,720
you should send me away.

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,400
I'll settle this for the child

62
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,400
and go back to my mother's house early.

63
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,720
Oh dear, don't, please.

64
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,160
Datian.

65
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,200
I honestly thought

66
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,840
your mother cared deeply for you.

67
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,480
Turns out she hides from troubles.

68
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,360
She thinks this home won't last.

69
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Probably wants to
throw in her lot over there.

70
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,920
You two…

71
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,240
Fine.

72
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,600
I'll fight for your sake, then.

73
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,280
Mother, you've got a plan?

74
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,680
Mother.

75
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,200
What did you say?

76
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,040
Qingqing.

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,840
Mrs. He.

78
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,920
What's the truth of it?

79
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,400
Speak your mind freely.

80
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,480
The two of them

81
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,560
kept quarreling without pause.

82
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,680
As their mother,

83
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,320
my heart was aching.

84
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,200
I tried to mediate between them.

85
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,480
But to my surprise,

86
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,380
Qingqing harbored deep resentment

87
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,480
toward me.

88
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
She even...

89
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,920
put poison in my medicine.

90
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,840
She meant to take my life.

91
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,840
If you hadn't arrived earlier,

92
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,480
I fear I would have...

93
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
Mother.

94
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,960
Village Chief.

95
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,760
You must seek justice for my mother.

96
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,320
The crime of filial impiety.

97
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,040
It's the crime of filial impiety.

98
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,200
In lighter cases,
your property is seized.

99
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,320
In severe cases, the punishment is death.

100
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,400
He Qingqing.

101
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,760
Do you admit your guilt?

102
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,960
I understand now.

103
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,200
So from start to finish,

104
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,320
you never even considered

105
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,920
mending things with me.

106
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,760
No matter how I treat you,

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,840
I'm always just

108
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,560
the one sacrificed for your son.

109
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
It was my mistake.

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,120
I should never have

111
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,200
held any hope for you.

112
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,280
Stop with that useless talk.

113
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,320
Just punish her.

114
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,760
Confiscate her property.

115
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,400
Qingqing is my daughter.

116
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,840
She's my own flesh and blood.

117
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,200
How could I let her
face heavy punishment?

118
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,160
Village Chief,

119
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,480
I will take her back home

120
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,200
and educate her properly.

121
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,280
Please stand up for us.

122
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,040
Let the Fu Family

123
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,560
divorce his wife.

124
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,400
Divorce?

125
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,920
No wonder you've been

126
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,040
bringing up divorce with me.

127
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,760
Part of your scheme, right?

128
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,720
What now?

129
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,880
Plan to sell me off again?

130
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,000
Stop spouting nonsense.

131
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,120
If you won't comply,

132
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,120
I'll have to handle it fairly by law.

133
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,960
Wait.

134
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,160
Qinghuai,

135
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
you're here just in time.

136
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,880
He Qingqing poisoned the medicine

137
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,160
with intent to harm her mother.

138
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,880
She even taught the two children

139
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,200
to lose all sense of justice.

140
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,280
You should cut ties with her early.

141
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,320
Do you

142
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,720
have any proof?

143
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,400
Any actual evidence?

144
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,600
He Qingqing would surely

145
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,000
destroy any trace of her wrongdoing.

146
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,560
Is my mother's testimony not enough?

147
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,000
You have none.

148
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,280
But I do.

149
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,320
This is the prescription.

150
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
You may examine it.

151
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,000
See if it's poison.

152
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,160
You wish to clear Qingqing's name

153
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,440
and that is understandable,

154
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,720
but that doesn't mean

155
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,280
you can call anything evidence.

156
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,560
That is not correct.

157
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I got the prescription

158
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,480
from a physician just this morning.

159
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,400
How could I possibly know in advance

160
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
that this would happen today?

161
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,720
I also invited

162
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,440
the physician here as well.

163
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,600
We must know if Mrs. He was poisoned

164
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,400
or if there's another cause.

165
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
Examination will tell.

166
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,320
Qingqing.

167
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,880
If they truly find something,

168
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,840
there will be no turning back.

169
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,240
Mother,

170
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,440
let them investigate thoroughly.

171
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,840
If there's something wrong,

172
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,120
I'll accept whatever comes.

173
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,200
This pulse is indeed poor.

174
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,000
He Qingqing, what have you to say?

175
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,550
However, it is not

176
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,040
caused by this medicine.

177
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,280
It's from the cold-natured medicine

178
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,720
you've consumed for years.

179
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,880
You've long been drained of strength.

180
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,000
That's why the illness lingers.

181
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,680
What nonsense are you spouting?

182
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,160
My mother was fine at home.

183
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,160
Her condition worsened
after she came here.

184
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,400
That's because she recently took

185
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,600
a few nourishing medicines.

186
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
Too weak to handle them.

187
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
But in the long run,

188
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,760
this is actually saving her life.

189
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,360
Physician,

190
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,320
thank you.

191
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,600
It seems

192
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,000
someone else is plotting

193
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,120
to harm his mother.

194
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,000
You wretched soul.

195
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,440
I planned everything with you in mind.

196
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,920
And you...

197
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,880
Mother.

198
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
- You...
- It wasn't me.

199
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I really don't know.

200
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,400
Xifeng told me to put it there.

201
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,040
I didn't know what the medicine was for.

202
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,680
Mother, I was wrong.

203
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,120
I really didn't know.

204
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,600
- Mother.
- He Datian!

205
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,480
Do you admit your guilt?

206
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,160
How dare you harm your own mother!

207
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,760
You…

208
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,160
I was misled by others

209
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,200
and nearly wronged Qingqing.

210
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,920
Thankfully now,

211
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,280
the truth has come to light.

212
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,880
He Datian

213
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
will meet his own fate.

214
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,840
But look at the state

215
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,680
your mother's in now.

216
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,840
It's truly pitiful.

217
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,160
She is still your mother after all.

218
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,920
You can't just turn your back on her.

219
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,040
When you framed me just now,

220
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,720
you didn't think I was your child.

221
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,000
She's the one who gave birth to you.

222
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,880
In this world,
all parents are to be respected.

223
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
No matter what,

224
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,600
being unfilial is the gravest mistake.

225
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,240
If the Fu Family

226
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,320
uses this as a reason
to bring up divorce again,

227
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,320
we can't keep siding with you.

228
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,320
No need to take my side.

229
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,520
I won't divorce her.

230
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,720
A virtuous mother

231
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,000
raises a filial son.

232
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,880
If the mother isn't virtuous,

233
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,360
the son need not obey blindly.

234
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,880
Need not be trapped by others' constraints.

235
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,640
Just follow what your heart truly wants.

236
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,360
Such words defy the proper order!

237
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,560
You'll set a bad example
for the children.

238
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,040
Qingqing,

239
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,200
my judgment was clouded by foolishness.

240
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This time, I truly know I was wrong.

241
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,440
Please, give me one more chance.

242
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,440
Village Chief, please be my witness.

243
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,440
I'll cover all the treatment cost

244
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,160
this time.

245
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,760
But from this day forward,

246
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,320
I, He Qingqing, and she

247
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,440
are forever parted.

248
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,640
We owe each other nothing.

249
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,440
Cutting ties with one's own mother

250
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,880
is unheard of.

251
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,000
It's unheard of.

252
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,520
Have you decided?

253
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,400
Yes.

254
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,320
Blood ties

255
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,320
are gifts bestowed by Heaven.

256
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,200
Yet they use the name of kinship

257
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,560
to bring harm.

258
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,480
From now on,

259
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,440
I will no longer swallow my pride.

260
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,080
Today,

261
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,880
your words

262
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,560
gave me more confidence.

263
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,640
Thank you.

264
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,160
No need to thank me.

265
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,200
Alright.

266
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,480
Tonight,

267
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,560
we're having a feast at home.

268
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,740
- Mother.
- Are you okay?

269
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,120
Did it burn you badly?

270
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
I'll go get the medicine.

271
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,840
- Hurry.
- I'm fine, truly.

272
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,920
Don't tough it out.

273
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
Leave it to us to handle.

274
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,400
Go, hurry.

Brother cooked.

283
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,000
We made it together.

284
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,440
Then I must have a taste.

285
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,160
Delicious.

286
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,640
Seems that even if I leave one day,

287
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,360
you can still look after yourselves.

288

Mother.

289
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,120
Are you leaving?

290
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,200
I was just speaking casually.

291
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
How could I ever leave?

292
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,440
Come on, let's eat.

293
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,680
Mother.

294
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,560
You really scared Tangbao.

295
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,440
Alright, alright.

296
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,000
It was my mistake.

297
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,560
I'll punish myself

298
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,240
with a pot of spirit.

299
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,040
Drink slowly.

300
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,520
It's fine.

301
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
This spirit's strength

302
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,000
is nothing compared
to what I used to drink.

303
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,760
Not just this pot,

304
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,680
I could finish a whole vat.

305
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,160
Father.

306
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,680
I'll take Tangbao back to sleep first.

307
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,040
Go ahead.

308
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,410
Tangbao, let's go.

309
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,480

310

You're drunk.

I'll take you back to the room.
