My intentions?

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,520
I just want to stay here peacefully

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,600
redeem Fengyang House,

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
raise the two children until they grow up.

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,240
Do you think

28
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,440
I would believe that?

29
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,920
Mother.

30
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,440
I want a hug.

31
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,760
Mother.

32
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,400
Everything I said comes from the heart.

33
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,560
Believe it or not.

34
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,080
You're not sleeping in this room?

35
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,600
(I must never let Fu Qinghuai)

36
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,840
(take the children away.)

37
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,480
Let's go.

38
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,560
Stop right there.

39
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,120
Where are you taking her?

40
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,890
I have important business.

41
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,400
Sir.

42
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,800
You must be Mr. Fu.

43
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,840
Quite the handsome gentleman.

44
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,960
You want to part ways with He Qingqing.

45
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Is that true?

46
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,920
If it is, that's fine.

47
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,480
There are plenty of fine young ladies.

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,320
Take a look at me.

49
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,800
Wait, don't go, stay.

50
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,520
Why laugh? You could look at me too.

51
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,960
Is there someone you fancy?

52
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,800
I said, don't leave.

53
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,600
Mother, does it hurt?

54
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,200
This pain is nothing.

55
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,920
What hurts most

56
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,920
is your father wanting to take you away.

57
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,480
From now on,

58
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,920
I can't make you tasty treats anymore.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,560
Nor can I lie beside you at night.

60
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,280
Tangbao won't leave.

61
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,730
Tangbao wants to stay with Mother.

62
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,560
Such a good daughter to Mother.

63
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,840
Tell your father the same later, okay?

64
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,480
Let's work extra hard next few days.

65
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,000
We can finish Wang Cheng's order in time.

66
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,200
Mother, I need to use the outhouse.

67
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,560
You need to use the outhouse?

68
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,320
Come on, I will take you to the outhouse.

69
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,400
Did you secretly drink something tasty?

70
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,040
Go play at my house.

71
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,120
Hey, that's my family's stuff.

72
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,000
Do not touch it.

73
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,480
Isn't that the Fu kid

74
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,760
without a mother?

75
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,080
You are the one without a mother.

76
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,120
He has a stepmother.

77
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,370
But she's a wicked one.

78
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,320
Shame, shame, shame!

79
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,680
A dog for a wicked woman!

80
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,000
Woof woof woof!

81
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,040
Enough, stop talking.

82
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,680
Fu Xiaosheng has no mother.

83
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,400
Her stepmother is a cruel woman.

84
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,120
Fu Xiaosheng has no mother.

85
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,200
Her stepmother is a cruel woman.

86
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,680
Fu Xiaosheng has no mother.

87
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,200
Her stepmother is a cruel woman.

88
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,040
Quiet.

89
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,880
Attack now.

90
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,000
Tangbao, you good?

91
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,600
Xiaosheng.

92
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,680
What happened here?

93
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,280
She was never truly our mother.

94
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,320
And she will never be our mother.

95
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,400
Is it because you sided with your father

96
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,880
that you deliberately ruined it?

97
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,280
What?

98
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,920
You plan to deliver a few days late?

99
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,600
We did run into some unexpected trouble.

100
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,840
In ten days,

101
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,440
I promise the goods will be restocked.

102
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,280
Quality goods are worth the wait.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,160
You've got quite the nerve.

104
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,320
Trying to swindle me of all people?

105
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,600
Return the money quickly.

106
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,920
Or I'll report you.

107
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,000
If I truly intended to cheat you,

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,720
would I have come here?

109
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,560
Besides, in our line of business,

110
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,720
getting the authority involved
is not auspicious.

111
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,400
How about you hear my compensation plan?

112
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,320
As for this advance payment,

113
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,160
I'll double it for you.

114
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,600
I won't take any profit.

115
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,240
Not enough.

116
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,720
I've promised this batch
to someone else.

117
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,400
If it's not delivered on time,

118
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,040
I'll compensate at full selling price.

119
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,160
That's three times your advance.

120
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,720
Three times?

121
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,000
Your markup is outrageous.

122
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
How much I sell it for is my business.

123
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,760
If you can't afford to pay,

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,400
forget about doing business.

125
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,040
And these two little ones here

126
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,880
have to be sold.

127
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
One sold to the south...

128
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
The other to the north.

129
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,760
You'll never see them again.

130
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
You're such a...

131
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,560
I want to stay.

132
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,600
- Because of sweet peppers,
- Tangbao.

133
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,280
her hands got so many cuts.

134
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,880
She's worked so hard.

135
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,680
I want to stay.

136
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,320
And you're still crying?

137
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,320
Tangbao.

138
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,480
It's all Mother's fault for being useless.

139
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,120
If only Mother could give you a good life,

140
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,760
I wouldn't care about hurting my hands.

141
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,480
Even if it means getting hurt,
I'm willing.

142
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,720
I'm just afraid
I won't have the chance later.

143
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,550
Mother.

144
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,680
Tangbao.

145
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,160
Please don't sell my child.

146
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,420
- Move along!
- Don't sell her.

147
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,280
Move along, everyone.

148
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,760
Move, move.

149
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,440
Alright, alright, alright.

150
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,760
Five days.

151
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,760
Just five days.

152
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm so unlucky.

153
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,880
It's settled then.

154
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,560
Tangbao, thank him.

155
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,280
Oh, the wrong way.

156
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,560
Thank you, sir.

157
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,040
Tangbao, you're amazing.

158
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,520
Xiaosheng.

159
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,160
Father.

160
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,880
That woman falsely accused me.

161
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,760
I never want to see her again.

162
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,600
When will you finally take me away?

163
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,560
I will take you away, I promise.

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,680
But Tangbao only listens to her now.

165
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,600
Don't worry.

166
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,920
Father will find a way soon.

167
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,760
Then we'll leave.

168
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,560
It's alright.

169
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,280
It's alright.

170
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,880
No more tears, no more crying.

171
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,480
He Qingqing has changed a lot lately.

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,320
Last time I praised her cold bean jelly.

173
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,600
And she gave me some

174
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,280
for free several times after that.

175
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,400
Such generosity.

176
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,380
You always know how to grab a little favor.

177
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,160
Xiaofeng.

178
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,720
She's your sister-in-law.

179
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,600
Tell me.

180
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,600
Why has she changed so much lately?

181
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,160
She's family, you see.

182
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,440
Some things are hard to say outright.

183
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,160
Aunties.

184
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,880
With such paltry gains,

185
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,280
she's already fooled you all.

186
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,320
Don't forget the nasty tricks
she pulled before.

187
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,400
Maybe…

188
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,000
she's planning something big.

189
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,720
That's why Sanniang is so clever.

190
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,960
Oh, that sister-in-law of mine…

191
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,160
Take a look, everyone.

192
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,400
Let's all get rich together.

193
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,280
What kind of trick are you pulling now?

194
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,020
What trick?

195
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,290
I'm here to give everyone money.

196
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,960
Giving money?

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,120
My sister-in-law is here too.

198
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,320
Well, this money-giving business

199
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,880
is not available for my relatives.

200
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,920
Perhaps you should excuse yourself?

201
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:48,700
I'm not short of this little bit.

202
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,760
I've still got meat
simmering in the pot.

203
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,120
I'll be on my way then.

204
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,880
Qingqing,

205
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,360
you can speak up now, can't you?

206
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,320
Do you have a chili pepper?

207
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,680
I'll pay generously for it.

208
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
We all do.

209
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
I have two pots at home.

210
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,560
Aren't those just for show?

211
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:11,980
They're worth money?

212
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,900
Of course.

213
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,200
How much will you pay?

214
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,760
Twenty wens for each liang.

215
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,440
Twenty wens?

216
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,960
But I don't have the cash right now.

217
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,360
I can only pay in five days.

218
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,960
See?

219
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,680
Her true colors are showing now.

220
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,560
No money and still wanting to buy?

221
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,200
Are you thinking of taking it for free?

222
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,120
No money.

223
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,160
Taking for free.

224
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,240
You can sell me the chili peppers now.

225
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,440
I'll always remember your kindness.

226
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,680
In the future,
I'll prioritize your supplies.

227
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,320
Think it over yourselves.

228
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,980
Leaving those chili peppers there

229
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,200
is just a waste.

230
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,760
Sell them to me

231
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,760
and you'll earn more

232
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,120
than planting potatoes yourself.

233
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,720
Alright,

234
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,080
anyone

235
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,360
who wants to sell to me,

236
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,080
bring the chili peppers to my home tonight.

237
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,360
I'm off.

238
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,960
She's leaving?

239
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,560
Without payment,

240
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,520
the goods won't change hands.

241
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,520
She's in such a rush right now.

242
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Later on, we'll be the ones
setting the terms.

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Right, whoever sells will be called dog.

244
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,520
Whoever sells will be called dog.

245
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,360
That's right.

246
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,200
I forgot to mention something.

247
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,440
The 20 wens
is the starting purchase price.

248
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,200
After that, for each extra liang I buy,

249
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,880
I'll lower the price by two wen.

250
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,560
Until I've gathered all I need.

251
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,560
Take a look, come and see.

252
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,120
- Sellers will be called dog.
- Come

253
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,120
- Sellers will be called dog.
- and see.

254
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,080
- There's profit for all.
- Don't heed her words.

255
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,860
(Twenty Wens)

256
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,000
Zhou,

257
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,000
what are you doing out so late at night?

258
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,680
Selling chili peppers behind
everyone's back?

259
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,120
Don't get me wrong.

260
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,640
Ate too much, out walking it off.

261
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
Wait, Granny Sun.

262
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,760
Why does your belly look so round?

263
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,680
I... I just found out I'm expecting.

264
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,880
Who would believe that?

265
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:31,740
(Eighteen Wens)

266
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,000
Heavens above.

267
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,520
Who would be so shameless?

268
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,080
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

269
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:37,960
I was here first.

270
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,960
Stop pulling me.

271
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,680
I was here first.

272
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,200
Potato.

273
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,200
Honey.

274
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:20,800
Honey.

275
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,840
Have a seat.

276
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What's wrong, my dear?

277
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,760
Who dared to upset my wife?

278
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,560
Your sister, of course.

279
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,560
She's making big money

280
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,440
by selling bean jelly.

281
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,880
Yet never once sent a bit back.

282
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,880
Exactly.

283
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,000
And I heard something else.

284
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Boss Wang

285
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,120
placed another huge order with her.

286
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
Now the old grievances

287
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,760
have been pinned on me.

288
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,440
She won't even share the business.

289
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,360
Your mother

290
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,880
went to town for treatment

291
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,120
and the expenses got higher.

292
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,440
We'll burn through our savings.

293
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,680
What else can we do?

294
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:02,120
If she won't bring the money over,

295
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,000
we'll just take over her way

296
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,240
of making it.

297
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,080
Take over her way?

298
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,520
Yes, yes, snatch it over here.

299
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,360
Snatch it over here.

300
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,360
- Yeah.
- We're rich.

301
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,220
- We're rich!
- Yeah.

302
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,320
My dear, you're so clever.

303
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,160
We're going to be rich!

304
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,640
(Next Episode)
Recipe? Fine.

305
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,520
But dare to touch the child?

306
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
I'll make you regret it.

307
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,080
Five.

308
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,560
Four.

309
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,960
Three.

310
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,000
Two.

311
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,400
One.

312
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,280
Mother, look, a firefly.

313
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,760
Because it's so common,

314
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,640
we often

315
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,520
overlook it in daily life.

316
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,480
Fu Qinghuai,

317
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,560
let's call a truce.

318
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,320
Let's just

319
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:53,680
