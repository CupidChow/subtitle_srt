22
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,880
She hit you?

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,400
I'll hit you too.

24
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,960
Mother.

25
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,160
How could you hit me?

26
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,000
You wicked rebel.

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,000
Kneel down.

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,040
I won't kneel.

29
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,080
Then I'll make you.

30
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,920
Now I see who you really are.

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,840
While I was bedridden,

32
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,680
you did those things

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,800
to your own older sister,

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,400
ignoring all morality and filial duty.

35
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:48,640
Now you have the nerve to cause trouble.

36
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,690
(She...)

37
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,200
- (is standing up for me.)
- Mother.

38
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,120
Have you lost your mind?

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,720
I am your son.

40
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,320
I will take care of you in old age.

41
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,760
And yet you still

42
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,320
show such favoritism toward her

43
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,440
who married out for good.

44
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,720
You... you dare talk back to me, you...

45
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,560
I didn't.

46
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,880
Fine.

47
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,160
Fine.

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,800
If you are this partial to her,

49
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
I shall see for myself

50
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,360
how many days you can last without me.

51
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:29,620
You ungrateful child.

52
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,140
The water is here for you.

53
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,340
Qingqing,

54
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,780
I know

55
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,820
you hold resentment toward me.

56
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,980
I failed to care for you.

57
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,460
It was Datian

58
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,340
who pushed you into such a state.

59
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,500
I'm at fault.

60
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,820
I've failed you, my child.

61
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,660
I can hardly face you.

62
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,980
It was He Datian who did all these.

63
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,780
I never blamed you.

64
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,180
No.

65
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,340
Qingqing,

66
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,540
it's my fault.

67
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:25,100
It's my fault.

68
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,900
Back then…

69
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,700
I heard that young man was a scholar.

70
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,940
His family was also fairly well-off.

71
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,620
So I agreed to marry you into his family.

72
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,380
But I never expected…

73
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,220
Datian to try to take over
his family's property.

74
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,900
He even dragged his own sister into it.

75
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,580
You too became part of his plot.

76
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,260
It's because I failed to
teach him right.

77
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,740
(She truly believes this.)

78
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,300
My dear daughter,

79
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,300
if you don't wish to stay
with the Fu Family,

80
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,260
I'll speak to

81
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,540
the village head about your divorce.

82
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,660
Come home with Mother.

83
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,540
Let Mother make it up
to you and Tangbao.

84
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,340
Alright?

85
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,660
Tangbao.

86
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,620
This big piece is saved for Qingqing.

87
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,340
She works every day
to support the family.

88
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,620
She needs nourishment.

89
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,300
You're back.

90
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,620
Qingqing.

91
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,940
I still remember

92
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,020
you loved chicken drumsticks the most.

93
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,140
I made this especially for you.

94
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,660
You're not in good health.

95
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,540
Stop doing these heavy tasks.

96
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,860
As a mother,

97
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,940
I don't feel tired from

98
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,220
making food for my own child.

99
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:34,900
In the past,

100
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,540
our family's situation isn't great.

101
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,380
You always save the chicken drumstick,

102
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,580
so Datian can have some.

103
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,460
You've always been thoughtful.

104
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,620
But, my child, I...

105
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,740
Let's not talk about all this now.

106
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,260
Here.

107
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,660
Try a bite.

108
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,940
Is it still the taste you loved
as a child?

109
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,420
As long as you like it.

110
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,260
Once we're back home,

111
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,660
I'll cook this for you every day.

112
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,740
Mother,

113
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,700
please don't leave.

114
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,100
Tangbao doesn't want you to go.

115
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,140
Tangbao,

116
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,820
be good, Tangbao.

117
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,260
When did I say I was leaving?

118
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,540
You must have misheard.

119
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,580
I'm not leaving.

120
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,020
I still want to make

121
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,620
many delicious dishes for you.

122
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,620
Come on.

123
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,620
Tangbao

124
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,260
truly can't live without you.

125
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,180
Seeing you well now,

126
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,940
I can finally rest easy.

127
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,860
It's getting late.

128
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:07,900
I should be heading back soon.

129
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,200
There's some congee in this pot.

130
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,020
Don't forget to eat it.

131
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,780
Wait.

132
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,740
Your health isn't good.

133
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,020
You should stay here and rest.

134
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,380
Mother.

135
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,740
Tangbao,

136
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,340
from now on,

137
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,460
we'll sleep together with Grandma.

138
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,940
As long as Mother is here,

139
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,780
it doesn't matter where we sleep.

140
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,380
You're such a good child.

141
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,460
Come, lie down.

142
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,260
Mother.

143
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,220
From now on, you'll be like Tangbao.

144
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,660
You'll have a mother caring for you.

145
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,700
Go to sleep, my dear.

146
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,380
I'll keep watch.

147
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:12,540
It's alright.

148
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,340
You still have classes tomorrow.

149
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,580
Better rest early.

150
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,880
Something's on your mind.

151
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,180
I just feel like…

152
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,260
it's so unreal.

153
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,220
Like I'm dreaming.

154
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,180
It's as though…

155
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,940
The thing I'd longed for
and could never have

156
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,380
suddenly fell right into my lap.

157
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,740
You mean…

158
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,540
your mother.

159
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,900
She's always favored my brother.

160
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,680
Ever since I was little, I've wondered

161
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,340
if I worked a bit harder

162
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,660
and became even better,

163
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,050
would she finally see me

164
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,580
and care for me?

165
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,020
You're the model son

166
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,420
every family wishes for.

167
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,020
You must have been treasured
by your parents.

168
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,900
You probably wouldn't understand me.

169
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,180
Fu Qinghuai.

170
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,020
Will you promise me one thing?

171
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:00,140
No matter if I'm here or not
in the future,

172
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,700
treat Tangbao well, just as

173
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,540
you treat Xiaosheng.

174
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,420
Of course, I treat everyone equally.

175
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,420
Not only loving them the same,

176
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,820
but valuing her just as much.

177
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,140
Don't overlook her
just because she is a girl.

178
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,900
She deserves the same respect.

179
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,140
She can't handle the family business.

180
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,100
Mm.

181
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,260
I promise you.

182
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,100
You just said,

183
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,700
whether you are here or not,

184
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,380
what did you mean...?

185
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,580
Wasn't I in the kitchen making medicine?

186
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,500
How did I end up in Fu Qinghuai's room?

187
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,820
Mother.

188
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,580
Grandma is coughing up blood.

189
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,580
Mother.

190
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,420
The doctor will be here soon.

191
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,660
Please hold on a bit longer.

192
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,220
He Qingqing.

193
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,580
He Qingqing, come out now!

194
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,580
Mother.

195
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:10,940
He Qingqing!

196
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,220
He Qingqing, come out now!

197
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:14,900
He...

198
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,060
He Datian.

199
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,340
Whatever you plan to do,

200
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,100
Mother is feeling unwell today.

201
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,460
Maybe another day.

202
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,740
Malicious woman.

203
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,060
Stop putting on an act.

204
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,910
I'm here

205
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:28,940
for the sake of my mother.

206
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,860
Qingqing.

207
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,180
Datian said,

208
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,900
you bear resentment toward your mother

209
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,300
and plotted harm against her.

210
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,100
Is that true?

211
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,940
He Datian.

212
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,260
You really went to great lengths

213
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,700
to concoct such an accusation.

214
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,300
Village Head,

215
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,260
do you believe him?

216
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,780
This concerns filial conduct.

217
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,980
It's of utmost importance.

218
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,340
But rest assured.

219
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,460
Once I ask Mrs. He for the truth.

220
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,460
I will see that justice is served.

221
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,940
But she is gravely ill today.

222
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,100
Can't take any shocks.

223
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,300
Wait for another day.

224
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,780
Until her condition steadies.

225
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,380
She's obstructing.

226
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,540
Because she's feeling guilty.

227
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:05,180
Village Head, we can't delay.

228
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,740
My mother will be gone because of her.

229
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,940
These words ring true.

230
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,420
Qingqing, stop getting in the way.

231
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,590
- Mother.
- Hold on.

232
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,420
This is my home.

233
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,940
I'll see who dares to barge in.

234
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:24,300
I heard every word you just said.

235
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,620
Mother.

236
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,820
Step aside.

237
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,060
Mother.

238
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,700
It's only been a few days.

239
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,940
And your health is...

240
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,940
Mrs. He,

241
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,860
just tell me the truth.

242
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,100
Qingqing,

243
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,660
Mother has wronged you,

244
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:53,580
but I truly cannot

245
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,220
shield you anymore.

246
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,260
The crime of filial impiety.

247
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,460
(Next Episode)
He Qingqing, do you admit it?

248
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,860
It was my fault.

249
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,940
I shouldn't have expected

250
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,020
anything from you.

251
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,300
Whether Mrs. He was poisoned

252
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,100
or there was another cause,

253
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,400
an examination will reveal.

254
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,060
But from now on,

255
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,620
I, He Qingqing, am severing all ties

256
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,740
with her.

257
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,900
Fu Qinghuai,

258
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,980
I wish you weren't my ancestor.
