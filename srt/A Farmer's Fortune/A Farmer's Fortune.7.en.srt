Father and Tangbao

(Madam Chen)
have both been won over by that woman.

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,760
I don't want to stay in this family.

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,560
Mother.

32
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,160
I miss you so much.

33
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,440
My poor sister-in-law.

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,480
You left us so young.

35
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,840
Leaving Xiaosheng alone in this world.

36
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,480
When there's a stepmother,

37
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,160
there's a stepfather too.

38
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,200
That He Qingqing

39
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,880
used her fox charmer arts

40
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,400
and bewitched

41
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,480
Fu Qinghuai and Tangbao.

42
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,560
Xiaosheng has no place

43
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,360
in this household.

44
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,320
Chen,

45
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,080
if your spirit watches from the heavens,

46
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,720
please offer my nephew some guidance.

47
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,040
What?

48
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,800
You want Xiaosheng

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,800
to venture out and build a life for himself

50
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,480
away from this family?

51
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,880
You can speak with my mother?

52
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,160
How could that be possible?

53
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,200
They say this copper coin

54
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,500
can connect heaven and earth.

55
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Let's see

56
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,960
what your mother thinks.

57
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,120
Chen, if your spirit hears me from above,

58
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,920
I'll toss this copper coin in a moment.

59
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,920
If you want Xiaosheng

60
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,480
to settle down elsewhere,

61
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,480
show the side with the inscription.

62
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480
If you want Xiaosheng

63
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,120
to keep swallowing his pride,

64
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,400
then give me the other side.

65
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,660
This means

66
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,680
your mother is saying

67
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,200
you should leave tonight without delay.

68
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,920
Mother.

69
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,320
Dinner's ready.

70
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,000
Xiaosheng, come out for lunch.

71
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,040
Xiaosheng.

72
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,560
I'll go call my brother.

73
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,560
Alright, Tangbao.

74
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,040
I…

75
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,040
Lunch's served.

76
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,280
Sit down, let's eat together.

77
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,120
Mother.

78
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,040
Brother is missing.

79
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,640
This is all that's left.

80
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,460
(I'm leaving and won't be back.)

81
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,000
How is it?

82
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,480
A caravan just passed the village.

83
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,120
Aunt Zhou saw Xiaosheng among them.

84
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,200
Just follow this road.

85
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,770
If we start chasing,

86
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,760
we may catch up.

87
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,720
That rascal,

88
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,760
already knows to run away from home.

89
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,400
Once we find him, he'll get a lesson.

90
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,900
- Let's go.
- Sure.

91
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,000
Get ready to set out.

92
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,600
You can't leave yet.

93
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:55,760
- Xiaosheng!
- Xiaosheng!

94
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,440
- Xiaosheng!
- Don't go, Xiaosheng!

95
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,840
Xiaosheng, are you in there?

96
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,040
- Come home.
- Xiaosheng!

97
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,400
- Xiaosheng!
- Xiaosheng!

98
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,680
Hurry, come home with Mother.

99
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,240
- Father.
- Xiaosheng!

100
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,520
Who are you?

101
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,480
Why make a scene?

102
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:07,370
Step aside, quickly.

103
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,240
Sir,

104
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,240
inside this carriage,

105
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,200
is there perhaps

106
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,520
a boy around ten years old?

107
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes, about this tall.

108
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
Wearing grey cloth shoes.

109
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,640
No, move aside.

110
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,280
Don't delay our departure.

111
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,240
Hold on.

112
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,640
I just want to confirm

113
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,320
whether my child is inside.

114
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,560
If we miss the time,

115
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:24,760
can you take the blame?

116
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,280
Xiaosheng, Xiaosheng!

117
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Xiaosheng, come out now!

118
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,880
Come home with me.

119
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,280
Move away, you'll spook the horses.

120
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,320
You'll answer if the child's gone.

121
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,880
Get out of the way.

122
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,760
Xiaosheng! Xiaosheng, come out quickly.

123
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,880
Come home, Xiaosheng.

124
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,760
From this day on,

125
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,160
that will no longer be my home.

126
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,000
Fu Qinghuai, I'll hold them off.

127
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,000
Go find Xiaosheng.

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,880
He'll listen to you.

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,850
You troublesome woman.

130
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,720
Go away!

131
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,000
Watch out!

132
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,440
Fu Qinghuai.

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,840
I'm fine.

134
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,160
Father.

135
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,320
Xiaosheng.

136
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,000
Why did you run away from home?

137
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,000
A real man longs for distant horizons.

138
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,280
I want to venture out.

139
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,720
None of you should stop me.

140
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,240
Halt.

141
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,520
Xiaosheng.

142
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,040
Look at me.

143
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,320
You need to think this through.

144
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,000
Once you take this step,

145
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,600
there's no turning back.

146
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,040
Xiaosheng.

147
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,200
What exactly happened?

148
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,320
Tell me.

149
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,200
We'll face it together, alright?

150
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,120
You don't even want me.

151
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,600
Why make me go back?

152
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,000
How could you think that way?

153
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,040
It was clearly others who bullied me

154
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,200
and ruined the chili peppers.

155
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,480
Yet you say it was me.

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,840
And you.

157
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,840
You promised to take us away.

158
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,840
Yet you choose to walk by her side.

159
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,320
Looks like I'm the outsider here.

160
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,720
Rather than be cast out by you,

161
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,920
maybe I should go on my own.

162
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,120
Xiaosheng.

163
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,680
Xiaosheng.

164
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
It was my fault.

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,320
I shouldn't have blamed you.

166
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,400
I owe you an apology.

167
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,440
I'm also to blame.

168
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,880
Failed to take care of you.

169
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,920
And I failed to keep

170
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,320
the promises I made to you.

171
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,520
Xiaosheng.

172
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,720
I know.

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,720
You've been working hard all these years,

174
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,760
protecting your sister

175
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,760
and this family.

176
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,440
Enduring so much unfairness.

177
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,400
The past

178
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,720
can't be changed.

179
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,040
But from now on,

180
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,720
we will use time

181
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,760
to make things right.

182
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,440
Can you...

183
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,280
give us a chance?

184
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,560
Yes.

185
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,840
I feel the same.

186
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,320
Alright,

187
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,440
I'll give you a chance.

188
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,000
Come on, kid.

189
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,720
Are you hungry?

190
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,600
The food at home is cold.

191
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,320
Your sister cried waiting for you.

192
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,840
We're here.

193
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,040
You're back.

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Boss Wang?

195
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,800
What are you doing at my house?

196
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,000
As for Xiaosheng,

197
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,200
I spent silver to sign

198
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,520
the death contract with him.

199
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,760
So today,

200
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
he must come with me.

201
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,200
Wasn't it working with the caravan?

202
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,640
How could it be a death contract?

203
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,160
Xiaosheng,

204
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,800
who exactly took you there?

205
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,320
It was...

206
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,120
Aunt Tian.

207
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,620
Boss Wang,

208
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,800
it's a misunderstanding.

209
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,680
We would never sign a death contract.

210
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,000
This looks like Tian Xifeng's scheme.

211
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,200
That's not my concern.

212
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,360
I do business solely for profit,

213
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,120
not for people.

214
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,760
Since it's a death contract,

215
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,880
he belongs to me now.

216
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,040
Today,

217
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,560
he must come with me.

218
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,200
The He Family tried to

219
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,440
sell my Fu Family's kid?

220
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,440
No way.

221
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,990
Even if this reaches the authority,

222
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,320
I hold an official rank.

223
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,200
The Hes are merely common farmers.

224
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,360
So who do you think has the upper hand?

225
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,640
You know the answer in your heart.

226
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,520
Yeah, I know.

227
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,400
Boy.

228
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,560
Boss Wang, don't be upset.

229
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,320
Paying money and swallowing insults

230
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,340
make anyone fume inside.

231
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,800
But think it over carefully.

232
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,000
This matter

233
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,120
was entirely Tian Xifeng and her husband

234
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,560
using you to put pressure on me.

235
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,080
That's why, time after time,

236
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,320
they made a fool of you.

237
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,360
Wouldn't you agree?

238
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,160
Fine.

239
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,640
This score,

240
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,640
I know exactly who to settle it with.

241
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,520
Come on, let's go.

242
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,800
You can't apply the med by yourself.

243
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Let me help you.

244
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,520
It's fine.

245
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,570
I can manage it.

246
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,760
You got hurt because of me.

247
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,560
Do you want me to drown in guilt?

248
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,520
Why do you have so many injuries?

249
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Who did this to you?

250
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,360
Bandits.

251
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
That must've been hard.

252
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,800
Let me handle it myself.

253
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,210
I… I…

254
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,880
Mother.

255
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,680
Sleepy…

256
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,960
Tonight.

257
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,720
Father, Mother.

258
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,440
Brother, Tangbao.

259
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,800
Can we sleep together?

260
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,680
It was my trouble to begin with.

261
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:58,720
Xiaosheng.

262
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,680
Don't overthink it.

263
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,440
This matter

264
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,680
is not your responsibility.

265
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,880
Leave it to us grown-ups to handle.

266
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,360
But...

267
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,200
Xiaosheng.

268
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Home

269
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,240
is a place built on love.

270
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,520
No matter what mistake you make,

271
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,320
we'll always stand by you

272
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,640
and never give up on you.

273
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,320
That's what home truly means.

274
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,160
Close your eyes.

275
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,520
Sleep till morning.

276
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,240
Everything will be resolved.

277
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,000
Thank you.

278
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,560
Mother.

279
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,360
It's you.

280
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,910
(Next Episode)

281
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,600
You set this up with Wang Cheng.

282
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,320
All just to watch me humiliated, right?

283
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,390
I...

284
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,600

285
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,040
