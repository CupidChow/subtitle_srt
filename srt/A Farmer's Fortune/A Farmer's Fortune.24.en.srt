22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,880
General Su, please give me a little more...

23
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,800
General, some villagers are outside.

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,000
They're demanding to see He Qingqing.

25
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,720
What villagers?

26
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,880
Drive them away.

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,840
Yes.

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,640
Qingqing, we're here!

29
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,720
Qingqing,

30
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,960
if Boss Wang hadn't told us you pawned off
your belongings,

31
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,720
we wouldn't even have known you were
in such trouble.

32
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,120
Here, take this money.

33
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,600
Sanniang,

34
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,200
I can't accept this.

35
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,920
The food shop can't reopen now.

36
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,760
I already owe you too much.

37
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,200
Stop.

38
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,760
Don't talk like we're strangers.

39
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,400
If it weren't for you back then,

40
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,560
I'd have been sold off to God knows where.

41
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,240
And you told me yourself,

42
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,760
once I could stand on my own two feet,

43
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,280
it'd be time to repay you.

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,040
That time is now.

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,800
At last, I can

46
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,280
rightfully become

47
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,760
your business partner.

48
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,360
Miss He,

49
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,480
this is three years' advance stipend

50
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,040
the academy owes to Mr. Su.

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,480
He's a man of great talent.

52
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
We can't afford to let him go.

53
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,040
Thank you, Mr. Fan.

54
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,760
Qingqing, please don't refuse this.

55
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,760
It's what

56
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,520
the villagers collected together.

57
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,760
Altogether, twenty taels.

58
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,840
They asked me to bring it to you.

59
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,320
Aunt Zhou,

60
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,440
you really didn't have to...

61
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,280
I pinch every coin till it cries,

62
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,040
but I know

63
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,840
the good days we've had

64
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,720
are thanks to you, Qingqing.

65
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,800
If we don't help you now,

66
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,760
what kind of people would we be?

67
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,600
Don't worry, Qingqing.

68
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,560
Tell us how much more you need,

69
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:21,840
I'll cover the rest.

70
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,320
Consider it

71
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,320
a down payment for our future partnership.

72
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,520
Alright.

73
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,920
Thank you, everyone.

74
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,480
General Su,

75
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,040
I've gathered the remaining hundred taels.

76
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,880
Now we can finally

77
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,640
be reunited as a family, can't we?

78
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,400
In the end,

79
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,840
I've lost.

80
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,480
You've won.

81
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,240
I expected

82
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,400
this outcome.

83
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,680
So

84
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,280
you really refuse to be Su Yanjin?

85
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,600
You truly refuse

86
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,680
to be my son?

87
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,280
I never once thought of not being your son.

88
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,400
But my heart belongs to the way of the scholar.

89
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,640
I won't waver.

90
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
These past days,

91
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,680
I've come to understand

92
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,120
a father's care and foresight.

93
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,120
A father's love

94
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,320
plans far ahead for his child.

95
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,880
I want to be like you,

96
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,880
to protect my wife and child just as

97
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,600
you protected me when I was little.

98
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,000
Please, Father,

99
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,920
grant me your blessing.

100
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,800
Mom,

101
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,480
when will Dad come out?

102
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,720
Don't worry,

103
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,720
he'll be out soon.

104
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,440
Okay.

105
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,000
Qingqing.

106
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,320
This is from Father.

107
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,000
Grandpa,

108
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,720
I'll come back someday to learn martial arts

109
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,200
from you.

110
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,120
Sanniang.

111
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,720
You're finally back!

112
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,320
Thank you so much for today.

113
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
Don't be so formal.

114
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,320
Look at that moon tonight,

115
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,120
so red and bright,

116
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,320
unlike any other night.

117
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,440
That means peaceful days are ahead.

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,440
I remember reading about

119
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,280
such omens.

120
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,200
A crimson moon, falling stars,

121
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,720
the heavens shift,

122
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,720
and nature's law

123
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,480
may change.

124
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,400
Change?

125
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,320
(Could it be)

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,400
(I'm going back?)

127
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,400
(So soon?)

128
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,920
You all enjoy your family time.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,320
We'll take our leave.

130
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,560
Let's go.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,840
Here.

132
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,280
Sanniang,

133
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,440
in this moment,

134
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,000
I've written you another poem.

135
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,520
For you.

136
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,160
Oh, your sappy words.

137
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,080
You'll make people laugh!

138
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:45,990
Save it for when we get home.

139
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,880
Alright.

140
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,160
What's wrong?

141
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,320
Nothing.

142
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,680
On such a special night,

143
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,440
shouldn't we celebrate a little?

144
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,470
Sure.

145
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,720
Careful.

146
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,560
- I made it myself.
- Here.

147
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,360
Try some.

148
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,320
So sour!

149
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,160
Carrots!

150
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,600
- So sour!
- So sour!

151
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,890
Here, Tangbao.

152
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Let's have a toast.

153
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,770
Okay!

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,920
Cheers!

From now on,

164

I'm willing!

167
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,200
I want to be

170

than Mom.

171
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,800
With talent like hers,

172
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,560
she'll surely help

173
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,760
our family's house flourish again.

174
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,760
But isn't inheriting the family business

175
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,240
something for boys to do?

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Mom, that's not right.

177
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,760
There's no difference between boys and girls.

178
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,560
Tangbao loves this and she's good at it,

179
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,240
so she should be the one to take it on.

180
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,680
Xiaosheng is right.

181
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,880
I was mistaken.

182
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,640
Then,

183
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,240
Xiaosheng, what do you want to do?

184
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,440
Say what you want to say.

185
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,360
I...

186
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,560
I want to learn martial arts.

187
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,480
Good.

188
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,760
Since you've made your choice,

189
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:10,520
pursue it bravely.

190
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:12,680
I hope

191
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,560
both of you

192
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,000
will always follow your hearts

193
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,880
and do what you truly love.

194
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,400
So that's why

195
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,880
you were so determined to buy back
Fengyang House,

196
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,440
because it was something you truly wanted.

197
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:33,840
And now,

198
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,800
have you achieved your wish?

199
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,680
It doesn't matter anymore.

200
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:49,760
Because

201
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,080
I've found something

202
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,880
more precious

203
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,560
than a dream.

204
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,240
Mom, the stars fell!

205
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,200
They're shooting stars.

206
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,400
Come on.

207
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,140
Let's make a wish.

208
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,140
Wishes are most powerful right now.

209
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,940
I want to become a great general

210
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,300
to protect Dad, Mom and Tangbao.

211
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,300
I want to be like Mother,

212
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,260
and always stay together.

213
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:48,860
Mom,

214
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,140
your turn!

215
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,820
May those I love

216
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,460
never drift apart.

217
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,940
I hope Mom's wish comes true.

218
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,700
Me too.
