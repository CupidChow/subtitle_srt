Mr. Zhang, buy a bowl for your kid.

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,200
He Qingqing.

26
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,400
The Village Chief sent me to inform you.

27
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,360
You need to pay the Stall Tax.

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,680
It's five taels in total.

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,600
Stall Tax? What's that?

30
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Never heard of it.

31
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,440
There are so many vendors here.

32
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,040
No one ever mentioned this tax.

33
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,860
According to the village rules,

34
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,600
if locals trade small goods,

35
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:41,900
they don't have to pay any tax.

36
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,760
But the Fu Family are not locals.

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,920
So the tax must be collected as per rule.

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,960
You've been trading for long.

39
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,360
The Village Chief says
you owe five taels.

40
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,720
That's already lenient.

41
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,520
Could it be

42
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,680
you want to add the fine as well?

43
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,600
That's clearly unequal treatment.

44
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,600
Sir,

45
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,520
please allow us a few more days
to prepare.

46
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:16,060
(Cold Bean Jelly)

47
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,040
I offended the Village Chief before.

48
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,840
Now he's making things difficult for me.

49
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,720
Sanniang,

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,260
I've dragged you into this.

51
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,840
What are you saying?

52
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,100
If it weren't for you,

53
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,960
I would've been sold off long ago.

54
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,160
But with such high taxes,

55
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,400
I fear keeping the stall running

56
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,840
won't earn us anything back.

57
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,800
Nine taels of tax for every ten earned.

58
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,680
We can't make a profit.

59
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,400
We can only grow our business
big and strong

60
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
to survive.

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,680
To survive...

62
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,000
Sanniang.

63
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,040
We're heading to town

64
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,560
to open a shop.

65
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,880
You want to open a shop?

66
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,120
People here live off the river.

67
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,600
There are many taboos in this trade.

68
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,720
Never heard of a woman running a shop.

69
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,280
No one would ever

70
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,480
rent a shop to a woman.

71
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,600
You know,

72
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,120
you shouldn't waste your effort in vain.

73
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,000
If this were easy to arrange,

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,920
I wouldn't be coming to you, Wang.

75
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,240
Don't worry.

76
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,400
I won't short you

77
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,040
a single coin of brokerage fee.

78
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
Just tell me,

79
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,120
can it be done?

80
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,040
It is

81
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,920
doable,

82
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,400
however…

83
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,600
you must

84
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:39,940
agree to one condition.

85
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,040
Bro, I'd like to join later too.

86
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:52,380
Alright.

87
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,880
Bro, me too.

88
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
No problem.

89
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,040
We, as brothers, should...

90
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,500
share blessings together.

91
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,400
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

92
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,200
Fu Qinghuai?

93
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
What are you doing?

94
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,700
Teaching you a lesson.

95
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,200
Where is He Qingqing?

96
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,040
Brother Fu, Mr. Fu.

97
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,040
Let's talk this out.

98
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,680
He Qingqing!

99
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,040
Help me, He Qingqing!

100
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,400
You…

101
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,760
What are you doing?

102
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,000
Help me.

103
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,120
It's He Qingqing who's opening a shop.

104
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,280
We just happen to have an empty place.

105
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,040
Let's try out a dish today.

106
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,320
Was it necessary to be so harsh?

107
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,680
My apologies.

108
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,040
If you really feel embarrassed,

109
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,560
have your wife

110
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,760
cook for me a few more days.

111
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,760
Nah, I was joking.

112
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,200
As of now,

113
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,320
towards Boss He,

114
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,320
I have only respect and admiration.

115
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,000
It's done.

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,040
Here, you should taste this one too.

117
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,000
In future, for such risky matters,

118
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,180
let me come along with you.

119
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,480
I'm just out looking at a shop.

120
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,640
What could possibly happen?

121
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,320
Exactly.

122
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,880
The danger lies with me.

123
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,440
And with my companions.

124
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,840
I… I'll cover the consultation fee.

125
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,040
I've never seen you
this flustered before.

126
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,400
What's going on?

127
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,440
Because it concerns you.

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
Can you two calm down a bit?

129
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,560
There's a living soul right here.

130
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,880
Alright.

131
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,440
Tomorrow.

132
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,160
Come find me to sign the contract.

133
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,000
I'd better eat somewhere else.

134
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,440
It's spacious here.

135
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,320
When the time comes,

136
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,500
we can put up a folding screen

137
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,600
to make it a private room.

138
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,320
Then decorate with some plants.

139
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,000
Here.

140
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
This table is big enough,

141
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,480
perfect for the cashier's counter

142
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,820
with space to lay out the ledger.

143
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,160
Most importantly,

144
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,440
right in front of us,

145
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,000
it's Fengyang House.

146
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,400
But this time,

147
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,480
taking over this shop

148
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,880
cost our family quite a bit of savings.

149
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
Still, don't worry.

150
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,720
I already have a plan for running it.

151
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,680
I trust you.

152
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,000
Thank you.

153
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,440
Fu Qinghuai.

154
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,120
Last night,

155
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,400
was I...?

156
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,160
Wish you weren't my ancestor.

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,600
Tangbao saw it all.

158
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,780
You had too much to drink.

159
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,880
Father was steadying you.

160
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,840
Then you two shared a kiss.

161
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,880
Tangbao, you've had too much to drink.

162
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,600
Let's take the hearth for a meal.

163
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,320

will welcome it.

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,480
It's a rare delicacy.

00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,000
The flavor truly lingers on the tongue.

191
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,480
So, Mr. Fan,

192
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,320
would you care to visit more often?

193
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,560
Silly one.

194
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,160
The tasting is free for you.

195
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,720
Besides, with all this silver,

196
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,400
you could buy this whole shop.

197
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,000
It's not for the meal.

198
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,600
It's the betrothal gift.

199
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,320
I…

200
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,160
Mr. Fan.

201
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,840
Are you toying with me?

202
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,840
You're not usually that kind of flirt.

203
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:34,720
Not at all.

204
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
That day, you saved me

205
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,600
and spoke those words of enlightenment.

206
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,530
When I returned home,

207
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,600
I thought long and hard.

208
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,320
The debt I owe you is beyond words.

209
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,680
I can only offer myself in return.

210
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,000
I welcomed you with kindness.

211
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,880
Yet you harbored such intentions.

212
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,400
Don't come again.

213
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,360
Sanniang.

214
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,320
This was planted by my father himself.

215
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,520
He treasured it.

216
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,620
Naturally,

217
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
it's nowhere near as precious

218
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,000
as you, Sanniang.

219
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,840
Tomato?

220
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,400
Sanniang.

221
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,960
My heart is just this token,

222
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,240
pure and true.

223
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,240
Would you be willing?

224
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,080
Would you...

225
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,480
Would you be...

226
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,840
Sanniang.

227
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,320
Stop following me!

228
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,640
Came effortlessly.

229
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,120
Now.

230
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,480
Guests who can't take spice
are taken care of.

231
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,300
(Next Episode)
No.

232
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,640
Would you really

233
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,520
just watch me leave this world

234
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,840
with regrets?

235
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,520
And now you wish to put the blame on me?

236
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,360
Not a chance.

237
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,600
Qingqing Self-Service Hotpot

238
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,480
opens officially.

239
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,960
Good.

240
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:03,800
He Qingqing!

241
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,280
You owe me our mother's life.

242
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,560
You do.

243
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,220
If you can't repay it,

244
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,440
I'll take this restaurant as payment.

245
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,960
That's her, this ill-fated star.

246
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,680
Brought doom to her mother.

247
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,440
Heaven dealt its punishment

248
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,680
