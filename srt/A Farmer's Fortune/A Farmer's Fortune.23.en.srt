22
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,720
You've got quite the nerve,

23
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,760
daring to mock me.

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,640
Mom!

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,520
Tangbao?

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,920
What are you two doing here?

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,760
Bad man! Don't you yell at my mom!

28
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,760
Xiaosheng!

29
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,960
The children of country women

30
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,960
have no manners whatsoever.

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,800
And you? Always scolding people!

32
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,120
Is that what you call manners?

33
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,040
Mom, I'm scared.

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,560
Let's go home.

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,080
It's alright, sweetheart.

36
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,280
Don't be scared.

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,920
Go home with your brother first.

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,880
Daddy and I

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,760
will come back soon, okay?

40
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,280
Then we're not going either.

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,240
We want to stay with you and Daddy!

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,880
Fine then.

43
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,920
We'll all stay here,

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,400
with Grandpa,

45
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,400
until your father comes back.

46
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,520
You think this is a game?

47
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,160
These two kids are so young.

48
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,360
Without adults,

49
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,160
you want them to freeze or starve?

50
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,320
Besides,

51
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,600
don't you love locking people up?

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,840
Two more in,

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,400
and you're getting a bargain!

54
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,120
Enjoy your meal.

55
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,200
Let's go.

56
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,960
That insolent woman!

57
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,280
Unbelievable!

58
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,820
(Quiet Elegance)

59
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,280
Brother Ruofeng,

60
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,760
please, let me in!

61
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,660
- No, Tangbao.
- I'm begging you!

62
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,520
You can't go in there.

63
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,480
Brother Ruofeng.

64
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,840
What are you doing here?

65
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,200
Grandpa!

66
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Mom asked me to bring Dad some food.

67
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,760
You have no father.

68
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,920
Grandpa,

69
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,760
please!

70
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,440
Let Daddy eat,

71
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,040
he's so pitiful

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,880
being locked up.

73
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,880
Please, Grandpa!

74
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,560
I'm begging you!

75
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,920
Please, Grandpa!

76
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,400
Stop crying, Tangbao.

77
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,680
Give it to me.

78
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,040
Thank you, Brother Ruofeng.

79
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:34,960
You're welcome.

80
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,480
Useless.

81
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,680
No technique at all.

82
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,760
If you keep swinging that sword carelessly,

83
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,840
you'll hurt yourself.

84
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,560
So you know martial arts?

85
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,400
Watch closely.

86
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,040
Grandpa's amazing!

87
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,760
Even better than Dad!

88
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,840
Of course.

89
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,880
I taught your father

90
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,680
everything he knows.

91
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,040
That sword move just now looked so cool!

92
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,000
Can you do it again?

93
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,120
I want to learn!

94
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,400
Really?

95
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,760
Then watch closely.

96
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,400
- Grandpa!
- To learn swordsmanship,

97
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,760
you have to start with the horse stance.

98
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,320
Come in.

99
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,180
So,

100
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,000
what are you hinting at this time?

101
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,840
This is winter melon and fox nut soup.

102
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,760
It's good for your leg pain.

103
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,600
I heard from Xiaosheng

104
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,880
that your legs have been bothering you,

105
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,440
so I asked Ruofeng about it.

106
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,440
He said you were injured

107
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,880
years ago on the battlefield,

108
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,280
and you like

109
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,600
to eat too much meat.

110
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,040
I guessed

111
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
it might be gout.

112
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
This soup

113
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,440
won't cure it,

114
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,280
but drinking it regularly

115
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,720
can ease the pain.

116
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,920
Petty tricks.

117
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,760
Small favors.

118
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,400
Don't think a little gesture like this

119
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,600
will make me go soft.

120
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,760
I do hope for my family to be reunited,

121
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,040
but I'm not naïve enough to believe

122
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,000
you'd let that happen just because of this.

123
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,880
Still, Yanjin has been away

124
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,920
for so many years,

125
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,720
just treat this

126
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,040
as a bit of filial piety offered on his behalf.

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,840
Wait.

128
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
The border is in crisis now.

129
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,840
If you can gather one thousand taels

130
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,000
within a single day

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,880
to support the army,

132
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,240
I might

133
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,160
consider reuniting your family.

134
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,000
But

135
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,720
if you can't,

136
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,200
don't blame me for being heartless.

137
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,480
I'll take Yanjin and leave immediately.

138
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,000
Here's

139
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,160
all the money our family has, and

140
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,880
the title deed and secret recipes
of the Fengyang House.

141
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,600
Although I want our family to be together

142
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,840
and happy again,

143
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,040
this is

144
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,840
everything we own.

145
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
Once we hand it over,

146
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,720
we'll go back

147
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,040
to living dirt poor,

148
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,880
barely scraping by.

149
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,000
And Fengyang House

150
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,440
will belong to someone else.

151
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,760
This decision affects the future

152
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,120
of both the Fu family and Fengyang House.

153
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,040
So I can't decide alone.

154
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,440
Today,

155
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,000
we'll all speak our minds.

156
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,440
Should we give up everything we have

157
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,840
to save Father

158
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,840
and reunite our family?

159
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,560
General Su.

160
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,440
(Quiet Elegance)

161
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,000
This is everything we own.

162
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,000
Please take a look.

163
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,120
You're really

164
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,880
willing to give it all up?

165
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,920
It's a decision my children

166
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,000
and I made together.

167
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,280
If it means bringing our family back together,

168
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,120
we'll give everything we have.

169
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,440
General, there's only nine hundred taels.

170
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,680
Time was short.

171
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll find the remaining hundred

172
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,440
as soon as possible.

173
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,760
Please...

174
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,000
There's no room for negotiation.

175
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,000
I'm leaving for the capital today.

176
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,160
You'd better stop dreaming.

177
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,320
- General Su!
- From this day on,

178
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,000
you and Yanjin are no longer

179
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,280
connected in any way.

180
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,560
General Su, please give me a little more...

181
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,600
General, some villagers are outside.

182
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,800
They're demanding to see He Qingqing.

183
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:33,800
(Next Episode)
So you really refuse to be Su Yanjin?

184
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,880
You really refuse

185
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,960
to be my son?

186
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,000
I want to be like you,

187
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,440
to protect my wife and child just as

188
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,680
you protected me when I was little.

189
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,800
I've found something

190
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,160
more precious

191
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,800
than a dream.

192
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,200
I want to become a great general

193
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,560
to protect Dad, Mom and Tangbao.

194
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,480
I want to be like Mother,

195
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,120
and always stay together.

196
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,320
May those I love

197
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,360
never drift apart.

198
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,940
♪Content in my humble, rustic ways♪

199
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:18,380
♪My home spans ten acres wide,
eight or nine thatched rooms in gentle shade♪

200
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:24,060
♪Elms and willows shade the eaves,
peach and plum trees bloom before the hall♪

201
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:31,340
♪A distant village veiled in haze.
Smoke curls lightly through the fields♪

202
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:37,820
♪Dogs bark in the deep alley,
and roosters crow atop the mulberry tree♪

203
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:44,260
♪No dust disturbs the quiet court.
An empty room holds endless peace♪

204
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:50,860
♪Long was I caged within the world,
now I return to nature's grace♪

205
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,420
♪In youth, I had no taste for fame.
My heart was drawn to hills and streams♪

206
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:18,100
♪By chance I strayed into the world snare,
thirty years gone in a flash♪

207
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,780
♪A captive bird yearns for its forest,
like fish in a pond longing for the ocean♪

208
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:31,310
♪I till the southern fields once more,
content in my humble, rustic ways♪
