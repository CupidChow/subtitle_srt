Xiaosheng.

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,720
Tangbao.

25
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,380
(Fengyang House)

26
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,880
Where is everyone?

27
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,760
Open the door!

28
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,920
Brother, why did you lock Mother inside?

29
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,040
She took advantage while Father's away.

30
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,440
She sold off all our family property.

31
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,800
- Xiaosheng.
- She even planned to sell us to Wang Cheng.

32
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,240
Treat it as if we have no mother.

33
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,800
But Mother…

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,280
She did save us and bring us back.

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
That was just another of her tricks.

36
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,400
Open the door.

37
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,680
We can't stay in the village any longer.

38
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,040
I'll take you to find Father.

39
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,160
Let's go, Goaty.

40
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,760
I can still bring Fengyang House back.

41
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,560
If our ancestors turn away,

42
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,800
who will carry it forward?

43
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,240
Who will alter the precepts?

44
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,760
I refuse.

45
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:32,960
Hurry up.

46
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,400
It's gone wrong.

47
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,320
Stop right there!

48
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,200
It's you.

49
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,520
If there's an issue, face me.

50
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:56,180
Snatching a child in broad daylight.

51
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,260
What kind of skill is that?

52
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,200
You and your brother

53
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,400
played tricks on me.

54
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,580
I haven't settled that score.

55
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,840
And now you act up again.

56
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,600
That child was sold to me by you.

57
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,410
Taking him away is rightful.

58
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,750
What are you doing?

59
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,090
I'm warning you, don't use force.

60
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,840
I deal in lawful trade of people.

61
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,360
I have their deeds of Sale.

62
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,840
I have reason on my side.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Wang Cheng, isn't it?

64
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,000
No matter what I signed before,

65
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,050
you cannot

66
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,400
take away the people.

67
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,560
I've already paid for them.

68
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,400
Two children.

69
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,640
Two taels for the deeds.

70
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,740
Fengyang House as collateral,

71
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,480
worth thirty taels.

72
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,280
This Fengyang House was sold to you?

73
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,190
That's right.

74
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,840
I handed your brother money.

75
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,100
Are you trying

76
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,240
to back out now?

77
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,400
Business is about profit for you.

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,280
You wouldn't wish ruin on the family, right?

79
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,120
How much debt do they owe?

80
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,220
I'll repay you.

81
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,540
If I can't repay,

82
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,580
at your mercy.

83
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,740
Not right now.

84
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,260
One month later.

85
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,690
Do you take me for a fool?

86
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,390
I'll add fifty percent interest.

87
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,980
A month is too long.

88
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,220
Ten days only.

89
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,940
Repay four taels.

90
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,580
Four taels of silver?

91
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,340
Can you even do the math?

92
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,740
And what about the time you struck me?

93
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,620
Treating my wounds cost a coin.

94
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,180
Deal.

95
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,380
Withdraw.

96
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,900
Hurry up.

97
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,980
Do you hear

98
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,340
what they just said?

99
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,360
Spare me your false kindness.

100
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,540
We're going to find Father.

101
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,980
Let him set you free.

102
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,660
Alright.

103
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,060
Lead this goat along.

104
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,460
Just walk straight out.

105
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,340
Your deeds of sale
are still in his hands.

106
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,180
I'd like to see for myself

107
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,620
if you can even reach
the edge of the village.

108
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,620
Brother, I'm scared.

109
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,260
I don't want to go anymore.

110
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,380
Don't be afraid.

111
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,260
For now, Fengyang House can wait.

112
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,740
The pressing matter now…

113
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,900
is the deeds of sale
for these two ancestors

114
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,060
and fixing the door.

115
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,780
Will this business with Wang Cheng

116
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,340
end up angering your sister?

117
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,930
I doubt it.

118
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,940
She's not exactly a virtuous woman.

119
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,160
I'll charm her into agreeing again.

120
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,660
She'll follow our lead.

121
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,900
(Well, speak of the devil.)

122
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,340
(Enemies do cross paths.)

123
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,900
Sister, come on, sit down.

124
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,740
Why didn't you send word before coming?

125
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,900
I even told Dacheng,

126
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,060
we should go and offer you an apology.

127
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,780
Sit down, quick.

128
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,620
Sit, sit, sit.

129
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,180
The food looks decent.

130
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,460
Is it bought with

131
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,180
Wang Cheng's thirty-two taels of silver?

132
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,340
That's right.

133
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,420
Thanks to you, sister.

134
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,460
We finally drained the Fu Family's coffers

135
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,620
down to the last coin.

136
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,140
Just as we agreed before,

137
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,620
these thirty-two taels

138
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,020
will all mine.

139
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,640
The owner of this body

140
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,580
never even split the spoils evenly
when scheming.

141
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,660
She was so eager to spoil her brother.

142
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,580
I need it urgently now.

143
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,500
Hand me the money first.

144
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,340
Qingqing,

145
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,380
you suddenly come over

146
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,540
just to ask for money.

147
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,660
Isn't that like taking our lives away?

148
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,020
Unless...

149
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,580
I give you the child in my belly

150
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,260
as compensation.

151
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,620
Stop right there.

152
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,940
Where's the money?

153
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,220
Just...

154
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,220
Just these few coins left.

155
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,940
Anyway, all the signed papers

156
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,980
carry your name on them.

157
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,220
If...

158
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,940
the Village Head learns of this,

159
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,340
none of us will come out well.

160
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,370
You...

161
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,380
I'm new here.

162
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,820
Still figuring things out.

163
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,480
Better not cause too much trouble.

164
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,500
Alright.

165
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,500
No money?

166
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,500
Then trade something instead.

167
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,540
Brother, I'm so hungry.

168
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:02,940
Hold on a bit more.

169
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,340
Tonight, I'll make you roasted potatoes.

170
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,460
Time to eat.

171
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,060
Smells amazing.

172
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,100
Tastes so good.

173
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,660
Brother.

174
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,340
She has meat.

175
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,620
Feeling sleepy.

176
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,540
I'll take a nap.

177
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,620
Then eat afterwards.

178
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,180
Were you sneaking bites?

179
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,860
Mother.

180
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,940
If someone must be punished,
let it be me.

181
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,820
Don't hit my brother.

182
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,740
Tangbao just wants a taste.

183
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,060
Looks like he's been beaten often.

184
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,180
No wonder he's so guarded.

185
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,020
Stand properly.

186
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,740
I won't lay a hand on you.

187
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,380
Nor will I yell at you.

188
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,020
This food here,

189
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,860
you're all welcome to eat it.

190
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,060
You're being so generous?

191
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,180
Of course, there's a condition.

192
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,500
You need to go into business with me.

193
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,060
Go into business?

194
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,240
Let me lay it out for you.

195
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,820
It costs money
to redeem a deed of sale.

196
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,820
Redeeming Fengyang House
costs money too.

197
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,970
So, we

198
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,380
must start making trades now.

199
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,860
Are you tricking us?

200
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,740
And right now?

201
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,380
I hold the knife and the power.

202
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,740
You're just prey.

203
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,420
So you have no choice but to trust me.

204
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,940
Smells incredible.

205
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,260
Alright.

206
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,740
Okay.

207
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,180
Sit down, let's eat.

208
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,450
There's still work to do.

209
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,180
Luckily, there are still potatoes
in the field.

210
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,420
We've got the ingredients.

211
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,260
Now for the most important seasoning,

212
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,140
where can we find it?

213
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:44,900
Let's go.

214
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,100
Chili pepper...

215
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,060
So in this era,

216
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,620
chili peppers are just for show.

217
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,340
Perfect.

218
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:07,660
I'll make good use of it.

219
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,570
Tangbao, hold this.

220
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,300
Miss,

221
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,460
my home is right across from yours.

222
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,140
I'd like to trade a flower pot.

223
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,950
Want the chili pepper?

224
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,580
Exactly. What's your offer?

225
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,620
Go ahead, name it.

226
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,980
Wait right here.

227
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,060
Thanks.

228
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,620
A close neighbor is better than
a distant relative.

229
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,450
The people here

230
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:47,820
are truly pure and...

231
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,480
He Qingqing.

232
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,840
Don't think a change in your tone

233
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,180
will stop me from recognizing you.

234
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,500
Go on, bite her.

235
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,420
Hey kids, why'd you wander off so far?

236
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,740
(Next Episode)
Come take a look.

237
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,380
Delicious potato bean jelly.

238
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,620
Only three wens a bowl.

239
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,760
You won't regret buying

240
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,460
nor be fooled.

241
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,260
Calm down, all of you.

242
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,780
The owner of this body is so despised.

243
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,540
Mother.

244
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:43,420
Tangbao wants to sleep with you tonight.

245
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,420
You're not afraid of me?

246
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,620
Xiaosheng, run!

247
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,300
Sir, let's talk this out.

248
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,500
Father.

249
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,180
(Divorce Letter)

250
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,460
I want a mutual divorce.
