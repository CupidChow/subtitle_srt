22
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,040
Take your time.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,120
I've never had such delicious food.

24
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,200
Now I see why you refuse to go back.

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,760
Alright.

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,360
Eat well.

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,880
Finish it, then go back.

28
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,600
Tell that person I'm already gone.

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,440
I wouldn't dare say that.

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,960
I'd rather stay locked up here

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,460
than going back and getting hit.

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,880
It's right here.

33
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,800
I smell someone sneaking bites inside.

34
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,640
Stop eating.

35
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,220
Come on, let's go.

36
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,040
Could there really be a bandit hiding in?

37
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,560
Let's open it and see.

38
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,720
(If we really find the bandit,)

39
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,080
(Fu Qinghuai's identity)

40
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,280
(will likely be exposed.)

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,920
(How will I face them)

42
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,520
(and explain this to the children?)

43
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,680
Tangbao, be good.

44
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,520
Go wait for Mother outside, alright?

45
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,400
Alright.

46
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,920
Sanniang.

47
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,600
With people coming and going here,

48
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,240
how could someone hide in here?

49
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,280
That's where you're mistaken.

50
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,920
It's called the blind spot.

51
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,360
Those bandits are desperate men.

52
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,600
They're capable of anything.

53
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,160
We have to stay wary of them.

54
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,320
Mountain bandits

55
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,840
are not necessarily all bad.

56
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,120
Perhaps...

57
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,800
Maybe they had hardships in the past

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,560
and have now turned over a new leaf.

59
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,480
Qingqing, why are you speaking
in their defense?

60
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,520
I...

61
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,200
Hey,

62
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,640
did... did you hear that?

63
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,040
Someone is inside.

64
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,120
Let's report it.

65
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,920
We can't.

66
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,000
If this blows up,

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,440
it'll be bad for business.

68
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,960
Let me handle it.

69
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,400
Alright.

70
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,440
Listen up, little bandit.

71
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,440
We know you are inside.

72
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
Don't you try to run.

73
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,160
We're coming in now.

74
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,960
See?

75
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,720
I told you there was no one.

76
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,480
Guess I was just imagining things.

77
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,840
Sanniang, let's restock the vegetables.

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,040
Don't keep the guests waiting.

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,410
- Quick.
- Alright.

80
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,000
Even if I keep quiet,

81
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,000
others sent will still find this place.

82
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,760
Unless you and Young Madam

83
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,680
can keep hiding.

84
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,760
If they find you,

85
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,760
then it'll be...

86
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,560
(I can't hide it anymore.)

87
00:03:59,120 --> 00:03:59,960
Qingqing.

88
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,420
I need a word with you.

89
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,860
I need to handle the chicken.

90
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:06,880
Maybe later.

91
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,680
Take care.

92
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,040
Make way, make way!

93
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,400
Hot. It's scalding!

94
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,480
Sanniang, are you calling me?

95
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,400
Qingqing.

96
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,680
I need a word with you.

97
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,000
I still have a few accounts to settle.

98
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,280
Let's talk later.

99
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,060
We can check the accounts later.

100
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,400
"The waterfowl would coo;

101
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,320
Upon an islet in the brooks."

102
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,000
Fan Ruolin.

103
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,600
Everyone's here.

104
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,120
What brings you here?

105
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,480
At such an ill-timed moment.

106
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,160
Sanniang.

107
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,680
Look.

108
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,680
The weaving maiden by the river.

109
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,480
The cowherd by the riverside.

110
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,990
You are the weaving maiden,

111
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,680
and I the cowherd who stands behind you.

112
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
My heart is not a stone.

113
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,120
It cannot be changed.

114
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,760
Heart? Stone? What nonsense is that?

115
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,840
Such pretentious words.

116
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,920
Spout them somewhere else.

117
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,240
Go, go, go.

118
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,280
I'll recite you another verse.

119
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,480
Carry on, you two.

120
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,640
I don't want to hear it.

121
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,760
Stop talking, let's go.

122
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,400
Qingqing.

123
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,280
What I have to say is important.

124
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,160
You saw, just now, that person...

125
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,840
That… Fan Ruolin...

126
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,600
Truly, that was ill-timed.

127
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,600
Qinghuai, you must never follow...

128
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,120
his ways.

129
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,840
When is the right time, hmm?

130
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,080
I'm about to earn enough to buy back

131
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,000
Fengyang House.

132
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,120
Such a joyous, worthy celebration.

133
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,560
I want to welcome it

134
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,720
with my children.

135
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,990
As for everything else,

136
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,320
let's set it aside for now.

137
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,760
Alright?

138
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,160
Fine.

139
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll listen to you.

140
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,320
Mother.

141
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,160
What's got you grinning like that?

142
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,720
There's good news to announce tonight.

143
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,690
Come on.

144
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,560
Xiaosheng.

145
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,560
Tangbao.

146
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,000
What is it?

147
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,380
Don't you recognize me?

148
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,200
I'm your father.

149
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,160
What a bold trafficker you are!

150
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,330
Shout like that again

151
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,400
and I'll report you.

152
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,160
Hold it.

153
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,520
You are...

154
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,960
He Qingqing, right?

155
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,720
Who are you?

156
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
I'm Fu Qinghuai.

157
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,160
Fu Qinghuai.

158
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,000
Mother.

159
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,440
Has this man lost his mind?

160
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,320
How dare he pose as my father?

161
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,600
Back then,

162
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,570
I was taken by bandits

163
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,780
on my way to the imperial exam.

164
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,480
So I simply disappeared.

165
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,720
On my way to the exam back then,

166
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,600
I was seized by mountain bandits.

167
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,200
They made me serve as a scribe

168
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,840
until I finally managed to escape.

169
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,760
I know it's hard to believe.

170
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,880
But...

171
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,440
the truth

172
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,720
is the truth

173
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,040
and cannot be false.

174
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,680
Xiaosheng,

175
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,880
didn't Mr. Fan say

176
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,280
you mustn't be late for the exam?

177
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,760
Head to the academy first,

178
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,600
then tell your father,

179
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,160
a man claimed to be him

180
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,120
and came looking for us.

181
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,600
- Xiaosheng.
- He still has classes to attend.

182
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,000
If there's something,

183
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,000
let's discuss it when we get home.

184
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,440
Alright.

185
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,700
Tangbao.

186
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,160
Go play in your room, alright?

187
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,170
Okay.

188
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,040
Go on now.

189
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,840
Tangbao, she…

190
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,040
It's alright.

191
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
The child's just tired.

192
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,880
I told her to rest inside.

193
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,920
You say you're Fu Qinghuai.

194
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,440
Do you have any proof?

195
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,600
Normally,

196
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,280
I keep the Fu Family Seal

197
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,400
with me at all times.

198
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,280
But sadly,

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
it was taken by bandits.

200
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,280
So you have no proof then.

201
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,120
Then how am I supposed to trust you?

202
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,400
Luckily,

203
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,320
the imperial officials suppressing bandits

204
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,720
verified my identity

205
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,440
and had already

206
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,000
sent the document proving who I am

207
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,440
to the Village Chief.

208
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,120
If you truly are my father,

209
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,400
do you still remember what I asked you

210
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,200
to bring back when you left?

211
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,320
Of course I do.

212
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,120
So that's how it was.

213
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,960
By the way,

214
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,870
Xiaosheng asked you

215
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,200
to bring something back.

216
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,320
Did you bring it?

217
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,920
He's been talking about it lately.

218
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,480
It's been so many years.

219
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,000
How could I remember that?

220
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,680
It's been sitting overnight.

221
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,000
Let me fetch you a fresh pot.

222
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,400
Here.

223
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,160
Much obliged.

224
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,200
Upon my return,

225
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,320
I intend to sell off

226
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,720
the Fu Family estate

227
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,860
and take the children back to my hometown.

228
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,320
That cannot be allowed.

229
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,960
I won't agree to it.

230
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,920
You won't agree?

231
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,080
I am the master of the Fu Family.

232
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,520
My word is final.

233
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,520
You are merely a second wife.

234
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,000
If you refuse,

235
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,960
I can divorce...

236
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
you any time.

237
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,960
You don't even know
what Xiaosheng wants.

238
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,200
Yet you try to fool me.

239
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,400
Mother.

240
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,960
Xiaosheng.

241
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,600
Where's your father?

242
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,440
They took him away.

243
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,680
They said he was an imposter.

244
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,080
Mother.

245
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,800
They're lying, aren't they?

246
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,160
Xiaosheng.

247
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,520
I can't give you an answer right now.

248
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,320
But I will uncover the truth.

249
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,320
My father

250
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,720
is not real?

251
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,800
(Next Episode)
The fake Fu Qinghuai is in my custody.

252
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,160
Someone has accused you both

253
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,320
of plotting together

254
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,320
to seize the Fu Family's assets.

255
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,240
Take them away.

256
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,840
Which means...

257
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,400
you really were a bandit.

258
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,160
No matter what happens,

259
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,840
I'll face it with you.

260
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,400
Tangbao, from this moment on,

261
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,800
trust no one else

262
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,320
but me.

263
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:51,840
Xiaosheng!

264
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,880
Don't be afraid.

265
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,040
Come home with me.

266
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,880
They've been deceiving me all along.

267
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,480
They're not my real parents at all.
