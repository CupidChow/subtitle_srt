All done.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
How forgetful I am.

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,200
So focused on my work,

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,040
and I ended up neglecting our Tangbao.

26
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,960
Isn't that right?

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,230
I'll make delicious food for you.

28
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,880
Tangbao already has lunch.

29
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,040
For you to enjoy.

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,040
Where did these pastries come from?

31
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,600
From the food box over there.

32
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,240
Come on.

33
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,280
Thank...

34
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,240
We need to talk.

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,680
I have nothing to say to you.

36
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,200
You sent the food box, didn't you?

37
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,960
Yes, I did.

38
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,040
Was yesterday's humiliation

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,080
not enough for me?

40
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,480
You have to finish me off today?

41
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,960
You...

42
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,120
I did not say anything.

43
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,680
Yet you questioned me.

44
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,600
He Qingqing.

45
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,600
Go ahead, kill me.

46
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,080
I'd rather drown

47
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,200
than yield.

48
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,760
So strange...

49
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,480
Many dislike me.

50
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,520
But you are the first one

51
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,600
who hate me so much.

52
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,840
How did I offend you?

53
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,720
You don't remember?

54
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,680
Years ago,

55
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,160
I felt sorry for Tangbao

56
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,520
and gave her some food,

57
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,560
but you saw it

58
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,400
and told everyone
I went crazy from causing

59
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,440
my husband's death

60
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,360
and even wanted to steal others' kids.

61
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,920
I have the chance...

62
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,400
to remarry.

63
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,800
You ruined it.

64
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,160
I almost didn't survive...

65
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,040
I was truly vile.

66
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,280
So...

67
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,320
you don't love Fu Qinghuai,

68
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,640
but you resent me.

69
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,760
You did evil,

70
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
yet he accepts and loves you

71
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,640
because of

72
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,480
your slight change.

73
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,760
Why?

74
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,160
Of course,

75
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,760
my life was hard.

76
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,120
I just needed a lifeline.

77
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,760
What if I give you one?

78
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,760
My business

79
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,640
needs a cooking partner.

80
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,480
Will you?

81
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,120
He Qingqing.

82
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,400
Are you fooling me?

83
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,200
After what I did,

84
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,200
you'd spare me?

85
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,760
I won't let you take revenge on me.

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,230
Thank you both.

87
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,680
Let's cooperate more.

88
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,560
Thank you so much.

89
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,400
Like I told you, Qingqing is capable.

90
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,320
Luckily,

91
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,000
we ignored Xu Sanniang's advice.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,640
Yes, she is just a widow.

93
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,200
After seeing your happy life,

94
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,000
she must have other thoughts.

95
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,320
Stop spreading this around.

96
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,400
Otherwise next time,

97
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,680
I won't dare take your goods.

98
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,800
Okay, okay.

99
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,120
We won't say a word again.

100
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Speaking of which,

101
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,760
what's going on in

102
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,280
Xu Sanniang's household?

103
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,320
Her?

104
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,200
Like cutting bitter melon in coptis water,

105
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,000
she's had a life full of hardships.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,840
Indeed.

107
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,280
Don't dawdle.

108
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,720
If you can't repay,
you'll have to work it off. Move.

109
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,680
I've already repaid a lot these years.

110
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,840
I have nothing left.

111
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,920
Isn't that enough?

112
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,840
All you've paid is interest.

113
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,320
I want the principal now.

114
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,370
Do you understand? Move.

115
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,760
Who is it?

116
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,760
Boss Wang?

117
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,560
I thought it was some street thug.

118
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,560
You really need to change your way.

119
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,400
If I'm not a bit tough,

120
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,880
how can I keep those debt dodgers in line?

121
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,600
Do you owe him money?

122
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,920
It's her ill-fated husband.

123
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,560
He owed me a huge gambling debt.

124
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,880
She couldn't repay it,

125
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,680
so I had to take her in repayment.

126
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,320
She's a living person,

127
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,680
not some burial item.

128
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,160
It's not right to take her as payment.

129
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,520
A wife follows her husband

130
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,040
and stands by him through all trials.

131
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,680
Besides,

132
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,000
her husband sold her to me
before he died.

133
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,280
I've only been collecting interest
these years.

134
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,680
I've shown plenty of mercy.

135
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,920
You'd better

136
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,200
stay out of this matter.

137
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,280
This is simply my fate.

138
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,840
Satisfied now?

139
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,320
How much does she owe you?

140
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,440
Three taels of silver.

141
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,960
Three taels...

142
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,680
Don't tell me you plan to pay for her.

143
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,160
Think carefully about this.

144
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,440
Three taels of silver.

145
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,990
How much bean jelly do you need?

146
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,520
The debt note.

147
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,880
Don't say I didn't warn you.

148
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,040
If you fail to deliver goods,

149
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,440
the one to be sold will be you.

150
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
You've had your way.

151
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,600
Do as you like with me.

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,440
You truly underestimate me

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,320
and yourself as well.

154
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,560
If you think this worthless paper

155
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,280
will decide your fate,

156
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,680
then you'll be nothing

157
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,160
more than someone's puppet.

158
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,720
You'll be sold off again

159
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,160
and again after that.

160
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,440
How could I not know that?

161
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,440
But I'm just a widow.

162
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,720
I make a living washing clothes.

163
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,000
What else can I possibly do?

164
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,680
That's why I envy you.

165
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,400
You have Mr. Fu, such a good husband.

166
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,600
If I could find someone to rely on,

167
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,160
maybe things wouldn't be this way.

168
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,840
But why depend on someone else?

169
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,160
Can't you rely on yourself?

170
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,400
I'm not like you,

171
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,160
smart and capable.

172
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,160
How can I create a life that's truly mine?

173
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,880
I hadn't expected,

174
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,040
in your eyes,

175
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,400
I seem so impressive.

176
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,840
So if I told you,

177
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,560
before I ever came here,

178
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,080
none of my efforts

179
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,600
were ever valued by my family

180
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,680
and could be taken away anytime.

181
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,600
Do you still think I'm that impressive?

182
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,000
Instead of pinning my hopes on others,

183
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,880
I should fight for it myself.

184
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,120
If I win,

185
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,440
the rest of my life is in my hands.

186
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
If I lose,

187
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,880
it won't be any worse than now.

188
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,560
Consider this money a loan.

189
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,840
It's okay if you don't want to help.

190
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,000
But I still hope you can

191
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,160
become self-reliant soon.

192
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,400
Sanniang?

193
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,120
I thought about it.

194
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,520
You're right.

195
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,520
If even I won't fight fate

196
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,360
and give it my all,

197
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,000
who can save me?

198
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,460
I've been up all night

199
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
thinking about it.

200
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Can I still do business with you?

201
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,800
Snail Maiden,

202
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,880
I've been waiting for you.

203
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,720
Come with me.

204
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,200
You can stop struggling.

205
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,320
Take it easy now.

206
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,960
You're not doing business with us?

207
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,000
Why change your mind so suddenly?

208
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,760
Isn't our bean jelly good enough?

209
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,800
Or does it not sell well?

210
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,360
It sells quite well.

211
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,120
But now's the dry season.

212
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,000
And there's drought in many areas.

213
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,200
We can't get the goods out.

214
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,320
The final payment.

215
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,440
If you get more business,

216
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,560
remember to come find me.

217
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,320
Let's head out.

218
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,320
I'm a jinx. Because of me,

219
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,680
your deals fell through.

220
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,760
Nonsense.

221
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,120
You're my hard-won golden lady.

222
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,920
Don't worry.

223
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,680
With our skills,

224
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,960
we'll surely find new markets.

225
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,720
Come on.

(Jinshui Academy)

227
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,080
Goodbye, sir.

228
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,080
Xiaosheng.

229
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,080
- Sir.
- Mother.

230
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,430
Long day, huh?

231
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,280
Sir.

232
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,040
Let's go home.

233
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,430
Sir.

234
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,560
You ate it all.

235
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
So impressive.

236
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,840
Mother.

237
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,320
From now on, could you

238
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
bring me an extra portion of food?

239
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,680
Just add more of those French fries.

240
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,640
Studying really drains your energy.

241
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,760
It's because your cooking is so good.

242
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,120
Everyone's competing to
get a share from me.

244
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,920
Exactly.

245
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,760
I could set up a stall right
by this gate.

249
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,490
How could we allow you

250

to peddle your goods here?

Don't slander my mother.

What are you all doing?

256
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,800
A woman's virtue lies in modesty.

257
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,950
For her to show herself so openly,

258
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,150
how could that be proper?

259
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,820
If a woman has talent and ambition,

260
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:37,510
why can't she spread her wings and soar?
