(Qingqing Self-Service Hotpot)

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,280
Fengyang House has reopened for business.

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,560
The preparations are underway.

25
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,200
Money is flowing out like water.

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,520
Qingqing.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,680
Something big has happened.

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,880
The Village Chief just sent word.

29
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,800
A distinguished guest

30
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,200
asked to meet you, the shop owner.

31
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,440
They say he comes from the Capital.

32
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,440
He's at the Village Chief's residence.

33
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,600
Better hurry over.

34
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,960
It'll be a lucrative deal.

35
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,120
This way.

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,400
Please.

37
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
Such a grand air...

38
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,240
- My lord.
- about him.

39
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,080
She's here.

40
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,240
Greetings, my lord.

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,360
You...

42
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,800
must be He Qingqing.

43
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,440
That's right.

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,960
I'm the owner of the food shop.

45
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,160
Not to boast,

46
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
but our dishes

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,400
are unique in all of Jinshui Town.

48
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,480
My lord, just name

49
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,320
whatever you want.

50
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,400
Alright.

51
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,560
Then make me a dish

52
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,120
that could

53
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,040
bring a wayward child back home

54
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,680
and change his mind.

55
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,320
Sanniang,

56
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,680
where's Qingqing?

57
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,760
A big figure invited her

58
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,880
to the Village Chief's home.

59
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,520
What important guest?

60
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,440
I didn't get to see them,

61
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,800
but I spotted his men,

62
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,120
dressed like a military officer.

63
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,440
You...

64
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,520
As long as you can prepare this dish.

65
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,840
All these

66
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,200
will be yours.

67
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,640
My lord,

68
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,480
your offer is indeed tempting.

69
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,120
But I truly cannot make it.

70
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,240
I must ask you

71
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,600
to seek someone more skilled.

72
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,120
What do you mean?

73
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,040
Why still detain someone
who can't make it?

74
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,640
Seizing a young lady in broad daylight?

75
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,040
Let me out.

76
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,840
Let me out.

77
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,480
Why are you here?

78
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,400
He...

79
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,400
I, a commoner,

80
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,560
pay respect to General Su.

81
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,320
A commoner?

82
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,840
You've completely lost your senses.

83
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,480
You unfilial child!

84
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,200
Kneel!

85
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,680
Hey, you.

86
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,480
Why raise your hand to strike?

87
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,920
I'm disciplining my own son.

88
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,040
It's not your place
as an outsider to interfere.

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,840
Father.

90
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,120
Father?

91
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
If today,

92
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,120
it weren't for this woman being here,

93
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,480
you probably wouldn't have
come to see me

94
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,280
nor would you call me "Father".

95
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,560
Qingqing is innocent.

96
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,280
I beg you to spare her.

97
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,760
Let her go?

98
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,120
Very well.

99
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,200
As long as you're willing

100
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,920
to return and inherit the ancestral estate,

101
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,880
as your father,

102
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,560
I am willing to forgive you.

103
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,000
Naturally, I will not trouble this lady.

104
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,200
Can I say something?

105
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,600
If you truly wish to go,

106
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,440
I won't stand in your way.

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,440
But if you just fear of burdening me,

108
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,600
then please don't compromise.

109
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Do you still remember

110
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,160
what you once told me?

111
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,720
You need not be bound by others' rules.

112
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,000
"Simply follow the call of your own heart."

113
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,120
You headstrong woman,

114
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,000
even now you dare to

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,280
sway my son's mind.

116
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,600
Do you wish him to stray further?

117
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,840
He has his own dreams.

118
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,760
His way of life

119
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,000
simply didn't follow

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
the path you set for him.

121
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
How is that wrong?

122
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,680
But you...

123
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,440
using someone's weakness as leverage

124
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,600
is hardly the act of a true gentleman.

125
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,440
You...

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,840
Yanjin,

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,440
I ask you as your father,

128
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,320
are you willing to return with me?

129
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,320
I am not willing.

130
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,680
If you force me to go back,

131
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,440
I've escaped once

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,880
and I'll surely escape again.

133
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,400
Guards.

134
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,000
Lock him up for me.

135
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Lock him up

136
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,880
until he comes to his senses!

137
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,720
No need.

138
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,880
I'll walk on my own.

139
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,040
As for you,

140
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,440
when you manage to make a dish

141
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,560
that will make him change his mind,

142
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,480
I will

143
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,280
let you go.

144
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,680
That village woman's defiant manner

145
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,600
looks surprisingly similar to yours.

146
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,280
No wonder you were swayed by her.

147
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,200
She never tried to sway me.

148
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,920
I was willing from the start.

149
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,560
As your father, I thought

150
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,000
you turned your back

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,760
on generational martial heritage

152
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,680
only for what you called

153
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,120
aspiration to join officialdom.

154
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,120
But I'd never expect you

155
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,680
to discard all that

156
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,480
for the sake of

157
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,040
a village widow.

158
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,880
Yet you still say she didn't sway you.

159
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,440
She is not terrible.

160
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,400
On the contrary,

161
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,540
she is the brightest soul

162
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:00,060
I've ever met in this world.

163
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,760
With her by my side,

164
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,290
I finally understood

165
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,640
what a true family means,

166
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,200
what true kinship feels like,

167
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,280
what love is,

168
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,160
and...

169
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,560
what kind of life I truly want.

170
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,320
Utterly foolish.

171
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,320
I'll make you see,

172
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,840
she

173
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,120
is not worth your devotion.

174
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,200
A rustic thing from the countryside

175
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,880
never fits for the grand hall.

176
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,960
Which dish

177
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,080
is what I asked for?

178
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Please, have patience.

179
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,680
Let me explain it slowly.

180
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,420
This dish

181
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,200
is called Spring Breeze and Gentle Rain.

182
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,120
I use tender, silky fish fillet,

183
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,560
and bamboo shoots of the season.

184
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,200
Once you've finished it,

185
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,960
your heart will feel at ease

186
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,800
and you'll be open-minded.

187
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,800
This one is named Stubbornness Stew.

188
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,200
It's made with beef tendon and pork bones.

189
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,520
Slow-simmered over a gentle flame.

190
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,760
But when you eat it,

191
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,000
be sure to take small bites.

192
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,560
The texture is too tough

193
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,440
to digest easily.

194
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,880
If you happen to choke on it,

195
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,640
it could be life-threatening.

196
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
General Su, if you

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,880
find neither of these dishes appealing,

198
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,760
then I would strongly recommend

199
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,880
the Solitary Soup.

200
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,760
Made with the old bad-tempered roosters

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,320
who also loves to peck at people.

202
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,800
Stewed for three full hours...

203
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,640
Scoundrel!

204
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,000
You've got some nerve.

205
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,080
Daring to mock me?

206
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,080
(Next Episode)
Grandpa,

207
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,920
please!

208
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,600
Let Daddy eat.

209
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,040
If you keep swinging that sword carelessly,

210
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,220
you'll hurt yourself.

211
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,040
Grandpa's amazing!

212
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,440
If you can gather one thousand taels

213
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,600
within a single day

214
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,480
to support the army,

215
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,080
I might

216
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,000
consider reuniting your family.

217
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,640
General, there's only nine hundred taels.

218
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,280
I'll find the remaining hundred

219
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,520
as soon as possible.

220
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,040
There's no room for negotiation.

221
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,400
You'd better stop dreaming.
