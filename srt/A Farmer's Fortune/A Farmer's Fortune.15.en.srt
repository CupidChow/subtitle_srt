In just two days,

00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,520
we will open for business.

27
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,080
I'm sure it won't be long

28
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,280
before I can reopen Fengyang House.

29
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,120
He Qingqing.

30
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,800
Physician Wang.

31
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,280
What brings you here?

32
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,200
Is it about the medical fee

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,300
that I didn't pay in full?

34
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,240
Your mother doesn't take the med.

35
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,960
She asked me to tell you

36
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,240
that

37
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,440
she must see you once.

38
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,960
Qingqing.

39
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,240
You've come to see me.

40
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,080
You're not angry with me anymore?

41
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,200
Don't dwell on it too much.

42
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,600
The physician said as long as

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,480
you take the medicine properly

44
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,520
and nurse yourself.

45
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,920
You can recover fully.

46
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,800
Qingqing.

47
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,960
Do you still remember?

48
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,200
When you were little, you once said,

49
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
when you grew up,

50
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,960
you'd protect your younger brother

51
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,600
and give the whole family a good life.

52
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,400
I...

53
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,920
I beg you for one last favor.

54
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,840
Save Datian.

55
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,760
He still owes silver to Wang Cheng.

56
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,600
Help him pay it off first.

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,760
I cannot promise you that.

58
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,440
Would you really

59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,320
just watch me leave this world

60
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,640
with regrets

61
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,320
and watch your brother

62
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,560
suffer in poverty?

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,400
He Datian ended up like this

64
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,840
because you kept indulging him.

65
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
Instead of guiding him

66
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
to turn back,

67
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,480
you try to guilt-trip me.

68
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,110
You want me to become his second mother?

69
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,160
Qingqing,

70
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,310
I know I owe you.

71
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,920
But I promised your father

72
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,480
that I would protect Datian

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,760
and keep the He Family bloodline alive.

74
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,400
It means you'll have to
endure the injustice.

75
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,480
In the next life,

76
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,040
I will make it up to you.

77
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,320
No need.

78
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,320
In this life,

79
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,920
I have already chosen my own family.

80
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,320
Qing... Qingqing.

81
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,200
I...

82
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,480
I owe you an apology.

83
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,280
Just now, my mother asked me,

84
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,920
if I could help look after He Datian.

85
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,520
I turned her down.

86
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,280
I don't hate her.

87
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,560
I could have spoken kindly to her

88
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,400
but I still said those hurtful words.

89
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,640
Does that make me unfilial?

90
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,230
You did nothing wrong.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,880
Fu Qinghuai,

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
lend me your back.

93
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,440
Mother.

94
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,240
Mother.

95
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,240
No.

96
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,880
I must go get a few doses

97
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,720
for Mother.

98
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,280
I can't even afford fetal medicine now.

99
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,440
How could we pay
for life-preserving medicine?

100
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,840
Do you want to save the elder
or the child?

101
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,440
She's my mother.

102
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,120
Borrow.

103
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,440
I'll borrow some money.

104
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,560
I'll go right now.

105
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,160
Mother.

106
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,600
Take a look at your precious daughter.

107
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,920
You're nearly on your deathbed.

108
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,000
She never came to show any kindness.

109
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,000
And she's dragged our family
into this mess.

110
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,120
It's you.

111
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,880
You're the one who ruined us.

112
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,600
Old woman,

113
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,160
if you hadn't pleaded
again and again back then

114
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,840
and promised my father a hefty bride price,

115
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,720
he'd never have wed me

116
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,200
to Datian, that useless man.

117
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,160
And now you want to put the blame on me.

118
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,000
Not a chance.

119
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,440
I want Datian to...

120
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,560
divorce....

121
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,160
you.

122
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,040
Mother, you're mistaken.

123
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,840
He would never cast me aside.

124
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,440
Let me share a secret with you.

125
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,720
Truth be told,

126
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,120
I was never with child at all.

127
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,560
You kept an eye on my belly every day.

128
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,320
But now, no matter what I do,

129
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,280
he follows my lead without question.

130
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,000
You cruel woman!

131
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
When it comes down to it,

132
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,000
you're the one who raised

133
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,400
children with hearts cold as stone.

134
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
You're the true cause of all this.

135
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,760
Welcome, dear villagers,

136
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,760
thank you for coming
to support my business.

137
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,120
Qingqing, we really owe you our thanks.

138
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,720
You bought our farm produce.

139
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,680
That's why our life

140
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,600
is getting better.

141
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,120
Yes, exactly.

142
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,400
We're all from the same village.

143
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,920
Helping one another is only right.

144
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,720
Alright, I now make this announcement.

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,760
Qingqing self-service hotpot

146
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,720
is officially open for business!

147
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,320
Great!

148
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,040
Qingqing, what is a self-service hotpot?

149
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,600
No need to rush, everyone.

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,880
Follow me inside.

151
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,440
You'll see for yourselves.

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,880
Honored guests,

153
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,760
anyone who dines here in our shop

154
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:01,880
only needs to pay

155
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
a fixed meal price.

156
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,160
Within an hour,

157
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,720
you can eat everything

158
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
you see here to enjoy.

159
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,160
Everything here?

160
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,350
Of course.

161
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,440
You don't waste food

162
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,000
then you can eat as much as you like.

163
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,120
We've prepared for everyone

164
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,160
three types of meal tickets
to choose from.

165
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,720
Each ticket is different

166
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,600
and offers different limited dishes.

167
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,280
If you can't handle spice,

168
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,400
we've thoughtfully prepared

169
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,560
a tangy and refreshing tomato soup base

170
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,480
to make sure everyone eats with ease

171
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,840
and to your heart's content.

172
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,720
Come to me
if you want to buy meal tickets.

173
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,600
Come, step right up.

174
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,600
Sanniang, I want one.

175
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,680
I'll take a tomato hotpot.

176
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,290
Everyone, slow down.

177
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,160
A tomato hotpot.

178
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,000
Easy now, everyone.

179
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,460
(Qingqing Self-Service Hotpot)

180
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,680
My poor mother-in-law.

181
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,680
You died such a tragic death.

182
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,560
The meal is cooked by that cruel girl.

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,960
Yet you actually ate it.

184
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,820
You even dared to.

185
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,200
Aren't you even afraid of bad luck?

186
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,240
He Datian, what are you doing?

187
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,780
(In Memory of Madam He)

188
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,880
What happened to her?

189
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,800
You still dare to ask?

190
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,640
It was you.

191
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,320
You knew Mother was gravely ill.

192
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,000
Yet you deliberately spoke to upset her.

193
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,360
You angered her to death.

194
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,400
He Qingqing!

195
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,960
You owe me Mother's life.

196
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,240
You owe it.

197
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:36,500
(In Memory of Madam He)

198
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,360
You have no proof.

199
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,960
Don't go around slandering others.

200
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,880
This is the blood letter she wrote.

201
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,680
Every word says He Qingqing is unfilial.

202
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,360
Look at this, just look.

203
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,320
Judge fairly for my mother-in-law.

204
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,960
Is this true?

205
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
If it really is,

206
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,560
would we dare eat food

207
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,960
made by someone like her?

208
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,800
That's right.

209
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,440
Such bad luck.

210
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,640
I lose my appetite.

211
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,200
Qingqing, maybe you should leave first.

212
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,160
I'll hold the line.

213
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,520
Go.

214
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,040
He Qingqing!

215
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,360
Don't you dare leave.

216
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,080
You must repay me.

217
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,880
You owe me Mother's life.

218
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,280
If you can't repay it,

219
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,240
then give me your restaurant instead.

220
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,000
What now, He Qingqing?

221
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,160
You're gone mute.

222
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,320
Can't say a word?

223
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,960
She caused my mother-in-law's death.

224
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,120
No wonder she can't speak.

225
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,240
Tell me, how can someone be like that?

226
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,800
Truly heartless.

227
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,330
Mother.

228
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,680
The dead cannot return.

229
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,080
Please, don't grieve too much.

230
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,200
Come here, Xifeng.

231
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,440
Quick, wipe those tears away.

232
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,120
What is this?

233
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,560
What's wrong with my eyes?

234
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,960
Could you have an eye infection?

235
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,680
This sort of thing can spread to others.

236
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,200
Xu Sanniang!

237
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,120
Datian, take your wife
to get it treated.

238
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,660
- Or she'll lose her sight.
- Go.

239
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,880
He Qingqing, this isn't over.

240
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,160
Step aside.

241
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,520
Qingqing.

242
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,640
The physician clearly said,

243
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,360
as long as she takes her medicine on time,

244
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,120
her illness wouldn't be fatal.

245
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,800
There's something suspicious about her case.

246
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,240
Don't dwell on it.

247
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,720
By the way,

248
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:21,800
your mother...

249
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,880
Can she read?

250
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,360
She cannot read.

251
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,560
Then the blood letter must be a forgery.

252
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,080
But what exactly are they after?

253
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,080
I'll go check with the He Family.

254
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,840
He Qingqing.

255
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,640
He Qingqing, come out.

256
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,280
Village Chief.

257
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,600
What brings you here?

258
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,760
That's her. She's the ill-fated star.

259
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
That's nonsense.

260
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,280
Qingqing.

261
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,760
Show respect to the Taoist.

262
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,520
Last night, the village archway
was struck by lightning.

263
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,360
It broke off.

264
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,880
So we invited the Taoist

265
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,440
to divine the cause

266
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,320
and seek a way to avert the disaster.

267
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,680
Then, the reading pointed to me.

268
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,400
Exactly.

269
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,680
Your unfilial conduct

270
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,120
caused your mother's passing.

271
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,880
Heaven decreed punishment

272
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,120
and calamity followed.

273
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,680
If that lightning was brought by me,

274
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,760
why didn't it just strike me down?

275
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,560
The Heaven spares life where they can.

276
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,640
They gave you a chance
to mend your ways.

277
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,760
But if you remain stubborn,

278
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,800
even immortals won't be able to save you.

279
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,640
Taoist,

280
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,000
is there any way
to undo this misfortune?

281
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,800
This matter isn't that difficult.

282
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,440
She must guard the spirit

283
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,560
before her mother's memorial tablet

284
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,360
and seek forgiveness

285
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
from her mother.

286
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,360
Qingqing,

287
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,440
it's just keeping vigil, nothing more.

288
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,320
I'm speaking to you kindly now.

289
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,440
Don't let this spiral out of control.

290
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,040
Alright.

291
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
I'll go with you.

292
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,240
(Next Episode)
He Qingqing.

293
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,010
You caused Mother's death.

294
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:43,720
You dare to come?

295
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,440
The Widow Star harms both mother and kin.

296
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,360
It will bring great disaster

297
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,560
upon the entire village.

298
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,600
Only by cutting flesh to repay her mother

299
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,840
can the crisis be resolved.
