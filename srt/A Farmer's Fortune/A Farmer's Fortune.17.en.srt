Who are you, truly?

23
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,440
In the days to come,

24
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,440
I ask that you look after my family.

25
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,640
Fu.

26
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,610
Fu.

27
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,020
(Seal of Fu Qinghuai)

28
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,520
If you wish to keep it to yourself,

29
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,440
I won't force you to explain.

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,400
When the time comes,

31
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,720
you can tell me then.

32
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,440
Father, Mother, dinner time.

33
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,960
I made this bowl myself.

34
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,300
It didn't turn out well,

35
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,040
so Tangbao made another one.

36
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,840
For the taste,

37
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,920
it's a little off,

38
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,560
but it's already better than my cooking.

39
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,920
Tangbao is a girl,

40
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,360
born with a knack for cooking.

41
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,800
Maybe I should learn something else.

42
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,040
Remember what your mother told you?

43
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,440
Work is only about whether you enjoy it

44
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,280
or you're good at it.

45
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,240
It doesn't depend on gender.

46
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,200
That's right.

47
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,920
Xiaosheng,

48
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,760
don't let a momentary setback

49
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,920
make you give up so easily.

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,560
Once we reclaim Fengyang House,

51
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,200
we'll need you and Tangbao

52
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,240
to keep its legacy alive together.

53
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,160
Let our Fengyang House

54
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,600
stand for a hundred years,

55
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,920
even a thousand.

56
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,360
Really?

57
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,160
I have faith in you.

58
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,080
Mother.

59
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,120
I understand now.

60
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,360
I will carry Fengyang House forward

61
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,080

62
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,600
Well, how many

63
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,680
hundred years make ten thousand years?

64
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,200
Ones, tens, hundreds, thousands.

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,680
No, that's not right.

66
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,400

You think I don't know my trade?

89
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,560
I want to see Wang.

90
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,320
Our boss isn't here.

91
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,400
And he won't meet you.

92
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,840
These bits you've brought

93
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,480
only worth this much.

94
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,040
Couldn't you give me more?

95
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,760
I'm not some drifter to shoo away.

96
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,760
A drifter's better off than you.

97
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,560
See that food shop?

98
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,920
They've leftovers to spare every day

99
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,580
and give it away to those in need.

100
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,480
Each one's fed till they're rosy.

101
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,000
Go, go, go.

102
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,280
Don't hold up my business.

103
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,040
- I need to see Wang.
- Move along.

104
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,400
I said I need to see Wang.

105
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,400
Excuse me, do you know this guy?

106
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,400
Still not leaving?

107
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,840
Looks like the shop owner's husband

108
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,920
from that food shop.

109
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,680
Thank you.

110
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,160
Honey.

111
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,520
Datian.

112
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,040
Before He Qingqing married
into the Fu Family,

113
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,320
had she met Fu Qinghuai?

114
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,760
Yes, she had.

115
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,880
But she only saw him once

116
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,400
when he first arrived in He Village.

117
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Back then,

118
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,160
he wasn't even as tall as me.

119
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,280
I've always found that odd.

120
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
At the Ancestral Hall,

121
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,200
I saw Fu Qinghuai's skill.

122
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,600
Hardly looked like a man of letters.

123
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,280
Earlier today, I saw a man

124
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,880
holding a portrait, looking for someone.

125
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,960
No, my girl.

126
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,440
What are you planning now?

127
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,680
I wouldn't dare cross that family again.

128
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,600
Look at you, so spineless.

129
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,720
You want to live off scraps?

130
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,880
I'm certainly not.

131
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,280
The one with the surname Fu.

132
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,560
Something's off about him.

133
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,680
It really is you.

134
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,520
Watch your words.

135
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,600
You'd better come back with me.

136
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,260
He's been looking for you like mad.

137
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's just

138
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,880
pretend we never met.

139
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,160
He commanded us

140
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,880
to find you, alive or dead,

141
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,600
even if we have to beat you up.

142
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,960
That's so him.

143
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,000
You know him.

144
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,680
He kills without batting an eye

145
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,760
and lives by swords.

146
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,320
If I ever dared lie to him,

147
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,000
I'd be risking my very tongue.

148
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,240
What are you...?

149
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,440
If that's the case,

150
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,920
I can't let you go back.

151
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,160
Tie me up tighter this time, Young Master.

152
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,320
Lives by swords...

153
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,520
Fu Qinghuai,

154
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,600
who exactly are you?

155
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,280
Tangbao, what do you
feel like eating today?

156
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,120
Mountain bandits!

157
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,600
Mountain Bandits, you say?

158
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,040
Take a look at this.

159
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,560
Aunt Zhou, what bandits
were you just talking about?

160
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,160
This notice says: The authority

161
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,400
wiped out a den of mountain bandits.
But their chief

162
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,140
(Notice: Bandits In Town)
escaped.

163
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,600
Chances are he's slipped into our town.

164
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,440
My nephew works at the County Yamen.

165
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,560
He said the chief
looked refined and proper.

166
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,000
So he managed to evade capture.

167
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,120
We all need to keep our guard up.

168
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,280
Yes, that's right.

169
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,680
(Even the timing
of his return matches...)

170
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,260
(Could Fu Qinghuai)

171
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,280
(be the mountain bandit chief?)

172
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,400
Mother, what's a bandit?

173
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,280
They sneak into your home
to steal your treats.

174
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,280
A troublemaker.

175
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,600
Tangbao knows where the bandit is.

176
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,160
Tangbao will take you there.

177
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,020
(Notice: Bandits Roaming Into This Town)

178
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,500
(Stay vigilant, townsfolk.)

179
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,120
Listen up, little bandit.

180
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,160
(Next Episode)
We know you are inside.

181
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,120
Even if I keep quiet,

182
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,120
others sent will still find this place.

183
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,520
Qingqing,

184
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,760
I need a word with you.

185
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,600
Tangbao,

186
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,560
