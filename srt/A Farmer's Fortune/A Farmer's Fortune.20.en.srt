Right there.

23
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,760
Tomorrow in the Court Hall,

24
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,520
you must insist

25
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,560
that He Qingqing conspired with her lover

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,920
to seize wealth and take lives.

27
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
Once we get rid of her,

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,720
the Fu Family estate

29
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,240
will be entirely ours.

30
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,360
Rest assured.

31
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,680
That foolish lad Xiaosheng

32
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,200
now stands on my side too.

33
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,560
They have no way out.

34
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,440
Though, to be fair,

35
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,440
I've done so much already.

36
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,720
Yet I only get half the share.

37
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,520
That might not be enough.

38
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,360
We agreed on this beforehand.

39
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,760
Why suddenly raise the price?

40
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,440
Dear young lady,

41
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,880
if I hadn't met the real Fu Qinghuai

42
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,080
at the bandits' stronghold,

43
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,960
how could you

44
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,960
have set up such a ruthless trap?

45
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,080
Alright.

46
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,240
As long as you can get rid of them,

47
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,840
we split sixty-forty.

48
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,040
Look at you, that sly little grin

49
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,080
really makes you likable.

50
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,520
I'm already a married woman.

51
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,480
Keep your hands to yourself.

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,880
A married woman

53
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,600
is even more intriguing.

54
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,760
Let go.

55
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,520
Alright, alright.

56
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,840
I'd say He Qingqing's got some charm too.

57
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,880
If you're not willing,

58
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,760
then I'll just…

59
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,600
Alright.

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,640
Just don't go back on your word.

61
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,640
Alright, alright.

62
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,000
Take it off, this one too.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,920
Can you be gentler?

64
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
What are you doing?

65
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,040
What?

66
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,840
You tell me, what is it?

67
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,960
My dear, I...

68
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,280
What are you doing?

69
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,480
Datian, let me explain.

70
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,320
Silence.

71
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,040
Inside your belly,

72
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,320
isn't there...?

73
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,040
How could you do this?

74
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,760
I will end you.

75
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,840
I swear I will end you!

76
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,280
Datian.

77
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,320
You've slain him.

78
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,280
How could you slay him?

79
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,120
Quiet!

80
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,920
One more cry and you'll join him.

81
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,660
I'm going to report this

82
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,840
to the authorities.

83
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,200
Report it to the officials?

84
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,240
Go ahead then.

85
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,200
I'd like to see how they'll judge you,

86
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,840
a shameless woman

87
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,120
plotting with her lover
to murder her husband.

88
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,400
Right now,

89
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,680
you've got no other options.

90
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,760
Tomorrow,

91
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,200
we'll proceed smoothly

92
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,840
and take the Fu Family estate.

93
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,320
I might even spare you a way out.

94
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,920
But if...

95
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,920
you don't behave...

96
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,120
Stop crying. Close the door.

97
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,880
Get up, don't sleep.

98
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,560
Village Chief summons you.

99
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,280
At this point,

100
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,560
you should

101
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,480
reveal your true identity.

102
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,960
I am

103
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,320
Fu Qinghuai.

104
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,600
Well, well, you deceitful man.

105
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,100
Still refuse to admit?

106
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,720
There are many people

107
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,840
in this world named Fu Qinghuai.

108
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,280
You see it now.

109
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,480
And you've heard it.

110
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,840
So you're admitting

111
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,400
you're not Xiaosheng
and Tangbao's real father.

112
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,000
He's not their real father.

113
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,120
He's a swindler.

114
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,440
Are you their father?

115
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,720
I have an official document.

116
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,540
No need to prove myself.

117
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,160
What a coincidence.

118
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,000
I also have an official document.

119
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,440
It proves you're not Fu Qinghuai.

120
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,600
Ruofeng.

121
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,840
This man's real name is Pan Cai.

122
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,200
He is a wanted man
by the Imperial Court.

123
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,320
A wanted criminal, of all things!

124
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,620
(Certificate of Proof, Wanted)
What is going on here?

125
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,920
These two documents…

126
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,880
Which one is real?

127
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,720
Village Chief.

128
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,680
No matter how he managed

129
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,920
to forge this document,

130
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,000
it doesn't clear him from

131
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,880
colluding with He Qingqing.

132
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,160
Village Chief,

133
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,680
we don't know who the real Fu Qinghuai is.

134
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,280
But it was you

135
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
who dissuaded him from divorcing me.

136
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,760
Even so,

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,440
we were only raising our child

138
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,580
and doing the business.

139
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,440
How could that be collusion?

140
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,680
That's right, you all know it.

141
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,440
If they had planned this together,

142
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,840
why would they ever break up?

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,840
Exactly.

144
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,320
Sanniang,

145
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,000
everyone knows you and He Qingqing

146
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,320
are as close as family.

147
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,120
Of course you'd speak up for her.

148
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,480
Tian Xifeng, you…

149
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
I knew a shameless woman

150
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,820
like you wouldn't admit it.

151
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,040
However,

152
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,440
we have a witness.

153
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,240
Bring them in.

154
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,320
Son, come here.

155
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,280
Xiaosheng?

156
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,320
Tell everyone the truth

157
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,200
about their secret dealings.

158
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,720
You're not my father.

159
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,720
You're a killer.

160
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,440
A killer… a murderer?

161
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,720
Tian Xifeng.

162
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,120
I've never treated you unfairly.

163
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,280
Why join forces with him

164
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,200
to bring me harm?

165
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,840
I did not.

166
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,320
I... I did not.

167
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,440
No, he's talking nonsense.

168
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,160
He's lost his senses.

169
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,160
Yes, yes, he's lost his senses.

170
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,480
Last night,

171
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,440
I returned home

172
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,400
and found him

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,280
with Tian Xifeng

174
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,000
already in bed.

175
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,680
I never imagined

176
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,000
he would take my life

177
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,760
and cast my body away.

178
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,440
Thankfully, Xiaosheng found me in time,

179
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,560
pulling me from the water.

180
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Otherwise, I fear I'd already be...

181
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,000
I already...

182
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,200
I already...

183
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,000
So you two are

184
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,440
the real adulterous couple.

185
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,160
You even plotted to kill Datian.

186
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,720
No, I... I'm not.

187
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm not, Datian.

188
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,890
Datian, I'm not.

189
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,880
Da Tian, I didn't do it.

190
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,720
Get away, shameless.

191
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,240
Tian Xifeng!

192
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
How can you be so cruel-hearted?

193
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,560
I didn't.

194
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,520
I didn't.

195
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,320
Men, take these two at once

196
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,440
- to the County Yamen.
- No.

197
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,320
- He's also an impostor.
- I didn't!

198
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,720
Why did you only arrest me?

199
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,920
- Liar.
- No, Datian!

200
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,000
Take him away.

201
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,560
Arrest him!

202
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,040
Arrest him!

203
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,320
There's some truth in that.

204
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,480
For the Fu Family,

205
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,720
please don't hide the truth anymore.

206
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,760
I'm Su Yanjin, greetings.

You mean...

208
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,280
Qingqing can't manage the household?

209
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
But an outsider

210
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,840
taking in charge...

211
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,360
That's just not proper.

212
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,640
Let's not tell Tangbao, alright?

213
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,760
She has no idea about any of this.

214
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,800
Father.

We're both women after all.

219
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,340
Why make it harder for each other?
