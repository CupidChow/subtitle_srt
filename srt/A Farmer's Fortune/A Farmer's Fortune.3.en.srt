You two rascals

25
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,120
knew she had some grudge against me?

26
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,120
Before, Aunt Sanniang

27
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,580
brought us something to eat

28
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,780
and you stood at the village entrance
cursing her

29
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:36,200
as if she wanted to be a stepmother.

30
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,200
Looks like the owner of the body

31
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,440
had a bad reputation both at home

32
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,720
and in the village.

33
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,400
Such a shame about those chili peppers.

34
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,080
Mother, are you looking for

35
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,440
that bright red fruit?

36
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,800
There are some right by the road.

37
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,080
I've smelled them before.

38
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,560
Let me take you there.

39
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,080
Tangbao.

40
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,680
Tangbao, don't run off.

41
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,760
Tangbao. Tangbao, stop running around.

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,200
That's something really rare.

43
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,720
No way you can just find it...

44
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,240
anywhere.

45
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,600
It really is chili pepper.

46
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,360
How could this grow by the roadside?

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,080
A carriage tipped over here last time,

48
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,160
and the seeds just sprouted afterwards.

49
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,240
Just like that pot
at Aunt Sanniang's place

50
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,920
smells exactly the same.

51
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,400
Tangbao, your little nose is sharp.

52
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,280
You really are our little lucky star.

53
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,980
We've found it.
Can we trade it for a reward?

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,640
Let...

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,680

this isn't a grand feast.

76
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,120
It's a secret recipe: potato bean jelly.

77
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,120
I promise it's better than meat.

78
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,760
Go on, have a taste.

79
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,480
Mm, so delicious.

80
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,400
Once we're done eating, back to work.

81
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,760
Tomorrow morning, I'll set up
my stall in the market.

82
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,560
It's going to be a busy day.

83
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,480
You sure have quite the appetite, brother.

84
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Let's head out.

(Fateful Cold Bean Jelly)

86
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,120

87
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,760
Tasty potato bean jelly right here.

88
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,000
Only three wens a bowl.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,840
You won't regret

90
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:20,840
buying this, literally.

91
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,800
- One bowl?.
- Step right up.

92
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,400
Even if it's three wens a bowl

93
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,840
or you paid them to take it,

94
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,000
no one in this village would take a bite.

95
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,840
Isn't that right, Aunt Zhou?

96
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,480
Are you sure the villagers

97
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,760
always follow your word?

98
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,120
I, Xu Sanniang, am just a widow.

99
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,680
I'm hardly that influential.

100
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,720
But fairness rests in people's hearts.

101
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,440
Folks of the village.

102
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,740
Gather round.

103
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,880
Come and take a look.

104
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,440
You all know who He Qingqing is.

105
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,600
Her character is no secret.

106
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,400
Always idle and greedy.

107
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,040
Used to trickery and deceit.

108
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,300
A few days ago,

109
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,760
she even tried to swindle me.

110
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,280
Now she dares to set up
a stall selling food.

111
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
Tell me, everyone.

112
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,160
Do you think this food can be eaten?

113
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,160
- No way.
- Do you?

114
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,200
No, not at all.

115
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,160
Definitely not.

116
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,680
Taking your chili peppers is nothing.

117
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,880
She even pawned off
her children's deeds of sale

118
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,000
to Wang Cheng.

119
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,760
- That's vile.
- Indeed.

120
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,840
Granny Sun.

121
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,040
You're a grandmother too.

122
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,760
Is her way of motherhood acceptable?

123
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,720
Her heart's truly gone cold.

124
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,280
Everyone,

125
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,920
I know what I've done.

126
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,160
I won't make excuses.

127
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,400
But from now on,

128
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,160
can I not turn over a new leaf?

129
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,180
Is that so?

130
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,440
A bad habit sticks.

131
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,840
- Get back.
- Go away.

132
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,480
Go back.

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,880
Go back.

134
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,000
Everyone, calm down.

135
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,560
The owner of this body is really despised.

136
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,320
Brother,

137
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,280
do you think Mother's bean jelly will sell?

138
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,400
But only if they do sell

139
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,160
can we reclaim our deed of sale.

140
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
The Fu Family woman's being beaten.

141
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,380
- Take a look.
- Sure.

142
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Get back right now.

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,480
Go away.

144
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,560
Everyone, calm down.

145
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,480
- Go back.
- Move along.

146
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,280
Don't smash up my livelihood.

147
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,600
Xiaosheng.

148
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,200
Are you all alright?

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,600
I know you all despise me.

150
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,120
But tossing rotten leaves like this

151
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:23,990
won't ease your anger.

152
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,280
If I were you,

153
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,040
I'd ruin my business entirely.

154
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,600
Only then would you vent it.

155
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,440
Am I right?

156
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,920
My cold bean jelly.

157
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,320
Yo can try it first.

158
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,280
No need to pay.

159
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,000
If you find them tasty,

160
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,600
then leave me three copper coins.

161
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,760
If it's awful,

162
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,720
just walk off.

163
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,760
I won't take a single coin.

164
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,840
Really, no need to pay.

165
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,560
- Of course.
- Aunt Zhou.

166
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,320
We shouldn't take advantage.

167
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,120
Uncles and aunties,

168
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,840
come try some cold bean jelly.

169
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,760
They're delicious.

170
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,400
I'm only doing this
for the child's sake.

171
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,680
- Granny Sun.
- One bowl.

172
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,320
Granny Sun.

173
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
Aunt Zhou, Aunt Zhou.

174
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,120
I'll have a bowl too.

175
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,600
Me too, me too.

176
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,840
On it.

177
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,920
Plenty for everyone.

178
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,320
- One for me.
- I was here first.

179
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,400
Alright.

180
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:17,180
(Fateful Cold Bean Jelly)

181
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,160
What kind of noodles are these?

182
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,600
Never seen them before.

183
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,760
Are they edible?

184
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,160
Delicious, truly delicious.

185
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,480
I want some too.

186
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,880
Alright, another bowl coming.

187
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,160
Me too, I'll have another bowl.

188
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,200
I'll take another bowl as well.

189
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,160
Another bowl, please.

190
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,720
No problem.

191
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,000
But we agreed just now.

192
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,000
The first bowl is a free sample.

193
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,840
The second one needs to be paid for.

194
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,680
I have copper coins. One more bowl.

195
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,400
Alright, everyone line up.

196
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,880
There's enough for all.

197
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,720
Come on.

198
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,840
Queue up, queue up.

199
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,480
Coming right up.

200
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,440
Enough for everyone.

201
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,600
- Here, take this.
- I want one too.

202
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,280
I'll have another bowl.

203
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,760
The money is here.

204
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,720
I want one too.

205
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,160
Here.

206
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,200
It really is delicious.

207
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,280
Right away.

208
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,160
Here.

209
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,380
(Fateful Cold Bean Jelly)

210
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,100
Today,

211
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,540
you helped me watch over the stall.

212
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,080
This is your reward.

213
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
I don't want money.

214
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,200
I only want the deeds of sale.

215
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,360
We sold over thirty bowls today.

216
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:10,740
With the costs deducted,

217
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,120
there's barely any profit at all.

218
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,640
It seems just selling bean jelly

219
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,680
won't raise enough money.

220
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,520
I'll have to think of another way.

221
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,880
You want to talk business with me.

222
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,800
And you call this handful of goods money?

223
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,120
The trade is small

224
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,220
because I can only sell within the village.

225
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,280
Prices won't go up.

226
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,320
But Boss Wang, you're different.

227
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,360
You've traveled far.

228
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,360
You're knowledgeable.

229
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,820
In all your journeys,

230
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,200
have you seen bean jelly like mine?

231
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,760
Rarity makes things precious.

232
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,960
In another place,

233
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,640
the price won't be this low.

234
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,800
Come on.

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Interesting.

236
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,880
Bring me some first, I'll try selling it.

237
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,840
However,

238
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,640
the distribution rights of

239
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,560
these cold bean jelly
don't come for free.

240
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,840
You'll need to pay part of the cost.

241
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,520
Buy the distribution rights.

242
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,200
And once my goods are ready,

243
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
you can deduct the cost.

244
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,400
You think it's my first day in business?

245
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,440
Even though it is good,

246
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,640
why does one pay

247
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,960
before getting anything in return?

248
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,080
Everyone says,

249
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,960
you're both capable and sharp-eyed.

250
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,000
But to become a great merchant,

251
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,440
you're still missing that final push.

252
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,480
What do you mean?

253
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,320
What exactly am I lacking?

254
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,840
In business, one must dare to be first.

255
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,440
High risk is the path to high returns.

256
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,320
That is the mark of a true master boss.

257
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,440
But don't take it to heart.

258
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,840
I was just speaking casually.

259
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,640
Caution isn't a flaw.

260
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:17,920
Hold it right there.

261
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,560
Go on, let's hear it.

262
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,200
That license you mentioned,
what's it for?

263
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,220
How much are we talking?

264
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,400
Not much.

265
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,600
Six taels of silver.

266
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,560
Here's my offer.

267
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,760
Return my deeds of sale.

268
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,680
I'll count it as four taels.

269
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,080
The rest will be offset
in the goods payment.

270
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,560
Deal.

271
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,960
However,

272
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,240
let me warn you upfront.

273
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,160
If you can't deliver on time,

274
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,920
you'll regret it.

275
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,440
Don't worry.

276
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,560
Come on.

277
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,160
Tangbao, Xiaosheng.

278
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,120
Come out quickly.

279
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,320
Hurry here.

280
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,920
I bought you new clothes.

281
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,800
Take a look, see if you like it.

282
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,840
From now on,

283
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,600
you won't have to wear those worn-out rags.

284
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,240
It fits quite well.

285
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,360
I don't want it.

286
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,160
What's this in my pocket?

287
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,680
It's the deed of sale.

288
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,040
Hurry, give it to me.

289
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,280
When you've done enough work,

290
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,920
I will hand it over to you.

291
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,160
But if you catch a cold,

292
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,840
I won't find physicians for you.

293
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,360
When that time comes,

294
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,480
little Tangbao here

295
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,040
will have to stay with me.

296
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,560
This stubborn streak of our ancestors

297
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,680
truly runs in me.

298
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,320
Am I right?

299
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,800
Both ancestors are safe for now.

300
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,760
Next, then,

301
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,920
just focus on earning money.

302
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,840
Redeem Fengyang House
as soon as possible.

303
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,300
(Fengyang House)

304
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,960
Who's there?

305
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,080
Mother.

306
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,960
Tangbao wants to sleep with you tonight.

307
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,640
Come here.

308
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,400
You're not scared of me?

309
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:43,480
Mother makes sure Tangbao eats well
and stays warm.

310
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,910
I'm not a bad person.

311
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,050
You've got quite the sweet tongue.

312
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,840
Alright then.

313
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,920
I'll sleep with you.

314
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:10,420
(Fengyang House)

315
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,040
Sir, let's talk calmly.

316
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,800
Take whatever catches your eye.

317
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,840
Just don't hurt me.

318
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,800
Xiaosheng, get out of here!

319
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,760
Father.

320
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,080
Father?

321
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,900
(Next Episode)

322
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,760
Xiaosheng.

323
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,160
Take a good look.

324
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,640
These are chaotic times.

325
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,300
Don't let trouble into our home.

326
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,360
Fu Qinghuai.

327
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,840
She had only just returned.

328
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,560
Why speak of divorce so soon?

329
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,560
Village Head.

330
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,840
I need you to stand up for me.

331
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,480
She was never our mother to begin with

332
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,480
and never will be.

333
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,440
You refuse both to grant me a divorce

334
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,030
and to release my children.
