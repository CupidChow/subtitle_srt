Take it.

25
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,240
Bye.

26
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:23,280
- I want it.
- What would you like?

27
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,800
All these are new food today.

28
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,680
Delicious.

29
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,600
Brother is here.

30
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,560
Everyone.

31
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,040
Today,

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,200
we

33
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,960
launch limited edition mystery boxes.

34
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,240
Today,

35
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,120
we provide special food

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,240
and limited surprise gifts.

37
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,960
What gifts?

38
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,520
I want one.

39
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,800
Come! Open it!

40
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,960
Rising step by step.

41
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,120
This foretells

42
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,120
that in your future Imperial Examination,

43
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,720
you'll rise step by step

44
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,120
and have a splendid career.

45
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,960
This style of painting...

46
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,880
Could it be by Su Yanjin?

47
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,880
The authentic work of Great Scholar Su?

48
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,600
Su Yanjin?

49
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
(I clearly)

50
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,480
(had Fu Qinghuai help paint it.)

51
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,880
That's right.

52
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,080
I specifically sought out

53
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,840
an admirer of Su Yanjin to recreate it.

54
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,040
These smaller pieces are easy to store

55
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,520
and can be carried with.

56
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,760
Something to enjoy
both in taste and in sight.

57
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,400
Better value than the original.

58
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,680
I'll take ten.

59
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,880
Do you all want some?

60
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,560
Yes.

61
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,600
If you want it,

62
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,480
you'll have to follow my rules.

63
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,520
Who gets to buy

64
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,120
is decided by my son.

65
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,400
And who is your son?

66
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,720
Xiaosheng.

67
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,960
Xiaosheng.

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,960
For the sake of our school days,

69
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,120
save one for me.

70
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,560
Xiaosheng, we were wrong before.

71
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,840
From this day on,

72
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,440
you're my good brother.

73
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,600
Not just brother,

74
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,680
but elder brother.

75
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,680
Xiaosheng, please give me one.

76
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,240
Xiaosheng, please save one for me.

77
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,400
It's in your hands.

78
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,680
I want one, I want one.

79
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,560
I'm buying, I'm buying.

80
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,480
No need to rush.

81
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,680
Line up properly.

82
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,640
One at a time.

83
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,460
You go first.

84
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,400
Making a fuss over nothing.

85
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,320
Even cheating children out of money.

86
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,480
- I want this one.
- Let me go first.

87
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,920
(Women's Virtue Class)
Right away.

88
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,040
A woman follows four rules,

89
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,480
which encompass virtues,

90
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,840
speech,

91
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,630
- appearance,
- Mr. Fan is here.

92
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,840
- and work.
- Let's go.

93
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,920
In her virtues,

94
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,920
no exceptional talent is needed.

95
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,840
(Women's Virtue Class)
In her speech, no eloquence is needed.

96
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,040
In her appearance, no beauty is needed.

97
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,880
Sanniang,

98
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,040
we have the approval

99
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,920
from the headmaster.

100
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,280
Don't mind him.

101
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,240
Let's keep going.

102
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,560
To be well-ordered in conduct

103
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,400
and to act with self-awareness

104
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,200
is to uphold women's virtues.

105
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,480
To peddle food

106
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,840
and to brazenly show up in public

107
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,280
is to defy women's virtues.

108
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,920
It's corrupting the morals.

109
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,040
I can't bear

110
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,280
with him anymore.

111
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,280
Let me show him

112
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,560
what women's virtues truly mean.

113
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,520
Sanniang.

114
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,480
Mr. Fan.

115
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,680
You must be thirsty

116
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,200
after preaching so long.

117
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,640
Come quench your thirst.

118
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,600
Let go of me.

119
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,840
Why is your shoulder so tense?

120
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,200
Come on.
I'll help you relax your muscles.

121
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,480
Let go of me!

122
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,920
In broad daylight,

123
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,920
I, a virtuous scholar,

124
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,200
cannot tolerate such mockery.

125
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,840
Didn't you say

126
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,920
that women should be

127
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,680
gentle and considerate?

128
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,040
I'm being considerate to you right now.

129
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,480
Why aren't you appreciating it?

130
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,400
You widow.

131
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,000
A noble man

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,980
has three prohibitions.

133
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,320
In youth,

134
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,800
when one's vitality is unsettled,

135
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,420
one must abstain from lust.

136
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,720
Mr. Fan,

137
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,880
are you thinking of me?

138
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,880
Mr. Fan,

139
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,200
you must be tired from studying.

140
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,280
Come on,

141
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,680
take a break.

142
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,440
No... No.

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,280
Why are you here?

144
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,600
I...

145
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,040
should ask you the same question.

146
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,560
Come here.

147
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,160
I will...

148
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,560
help you stretch your body.

149
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
How dare you!

150
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,160
So...

151
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,840
So absurd.

152
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,680
This dream...

153
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,160
No.

154
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,880
I can not make them

155
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,200
disrupt me.

156
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,560
Let me. Thanks.

157
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,160
It's tasty.

158
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,720
Here you go.

159
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,160
Qingqing. It's fresh.

160
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,020
Let me. Thanks.

161
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,200
- Here.
- Okay.

162
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,450
Here.

163
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,320
Thanks.

164
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,880
Let me.

165
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,160
It's too bad.

166
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,160
We cannot buy it.

167
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,720
Please take it.

168
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,600
Wait.

169
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,120
These cucumbers

170
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,440
are just right for making pickles.

171
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,440
Here, ma'am.

172
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,840
Take the money.

173
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,600
You're welcome.

174
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,840
Qingqing.

175
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,120
These cucumbers are inedible.

176
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,000
Now I finally understand.

177
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,160
When you saved me,

178
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,720
it wasn't because I was special.

179
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,280
It was because...

180
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,680
your heart is too kind.

181
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,880
Am I right?

182
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,120
Kindhearted, am I?

183
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,880
Let me show you if I truly am.

184
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,600
Fan Ruolin?

185
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,840
Are you here to

186
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,200
deliver vegetables and fruits?

187
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,840
If I hadn't come,

188
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,120
how would I know you actually accept

189
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,960
rotten ingredients

190
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,000
and sell them?

191
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,920
Who said we take these

192
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,120
just to sell to others?

193
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,480
You're twisting words.

194
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,920
This cucumber.

195
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,160
I only trust my own eyes

196
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,000
and what I've seen.

197
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,410
Right here.

198
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,400
This is your dishonest way
of doing business.

199
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll go to the authority

200
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,840
and report your unjust acts.

201
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,000
You...

202
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,000
You're as stubborn as a block of wood.

203
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,280
Qingqing, wait here.

204
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,320
I'll deal with him.

205
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,280
Sanniang.

206
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,000
Fan Ruolin!

207
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,400
Stop right there.

208
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,280
I said stop!

209
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,280
You… step aside.

210
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,200
I'm going to report you.

211
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,760
Fine.

212
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,220
Then you'll have to step over me.

213
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,840
Come on, take a step, keep moving.

214
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,680
This...

215
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,440
Hey.

216
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,040
Wake up.

217
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,440
Serves you right.

218
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,750
Fan Ruolin.

219
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,600
Wake up.

220
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,440
Your body really can't take anything.

221
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,280
Fan Ruolin.

222
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,280
Wake up.

223
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,480
Wake up.

224
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't faint here.

225
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,280
Fan Ruolin.

226
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,560
Fan Ruolin.

227
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,080
Wake up.

228
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
You finally woke up.

229
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
You scared me to death.

230
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,360
How are you feeling?

231
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,080
I had another nightmare.

232
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,320
Look carefully,

233
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,560
who do you see?

234
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,000
Hey.

235
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,760
Why are you so close to me?

236
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,760
You're heartless.

237
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,440
I should've let you faint here.

238
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,960
Let Mr. Bear carry you away.

239
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,200
Thanks for saving me.

240
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,000
So, are you going to tell on us?

241
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,680
You saved my life.

242
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,760
I'll find a way to repay you.

243
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,000
But they are two different matters.

244
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,520
How can they be mixed together?

245
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,120
If you dare report us,

246
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,120
I'll tell everyone about what happened

247
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,120
between us in private.

248
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,340
(Fan Ruolin)
This is the proof.

249
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,520
No, it's not.

250
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,560
You're making things up.

251
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,000
Qingqing took pity on the old lady

252
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,320
and bought her cucumber.

253
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,760
It's not for making a profit.

254
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,760
You never even checked the facts,

255
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,860
yet you're spreading lies.

256
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,760
I may have never gone to school,

257
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,680
but I know you shouldn't do to others
what you dislike.

258
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,760
You've studied for years.

259
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Seems all for nothing.

260
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,120
Where did this guard dog come from?

261
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,560
He Qingqing.

262
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,320
Look at

263
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,440
what you've done to us.

264
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,320
Xifeng is too scared to step outside.

265
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,000
And you still dare to speak coldly.

266
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,520
Where's your conscience?

267
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,360
You snatched the recipe from us.

268
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
And those ingredients

269
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,760
were mixed by you at home.

270
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,100
Your wife traded my son away.

271
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,520
I haven't even settled it with you.

272
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,880
Well, you've come right to me.

273
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,160
If you don't leave,

274
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
don't blame my harshness.

275
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,120
You're not going anywhere.

276
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,560
- Stay here.
- He Datian!

277
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,760
Pay for the med or stay here.

278
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,720
He Datian!

279
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,200
I... I'll beat you to death!

280
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,880
Stop throwing things!

281
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,520
He Datian, you reckless fool!

282
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,800
Say bye to the seeds.

283
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,640
He Datian!

284
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,880
I'll beat you to death!

285
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,760
Stop throwing things!

286
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,180
You're ruining everything!

287
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,320
Stop!

288
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,400
Mother.

289
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,400
Mother.

290
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,280
Mother.

291
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,320
You are the elder sister.

292
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,760
Take good care of your younger brother.

293
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,960
And you need to behave yourself.

294
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,680
Mother, you've arrived just in time.

295
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,000
You must stand up for me.

296
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,190
This woman refused

297
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
to admit her fault.

298
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,800
She even struck me.

299
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,330
- Troublemaker crying foul.
- I was hurt.

300
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,190
And she still hit me.

301
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,320
- Works every time, huh?
- It hurts.

302
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,360
She hit you, did she?

303
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,800
Then I'll hit you too.

304
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,640
Very well.

305
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,540
(Next Episode)
If you're being so partial,

306
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
then I'd like to see…

307
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,320
how many days you can last without me.

308
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,080
Qingqing,

309
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,320
I know...

310
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,360
you hold resentment toward me.

311
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,520
It's my fault
I didn't take good care of you.

312
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,160
Come home with me.

313
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:00,090
Let me make it up to you and Tangbao.

314
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,430
Fu Qinghuai.

315
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,320
Will you promise me one thing?

316
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,080
