Drink up!

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,800
Hold on, everyone.

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,800
My family,

26
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,040
once the signing ceremony

27
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,280
in the Ancestral Hall is done,

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,120
Fengyang House will be officially sold.

29
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,880
Everyone will get a share of the profit,

30
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:38,880
no one left out.

31
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,600
Alright.

32
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,800
Come on, cheers.

33
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,560
Fu Datian.

34
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,760
Sister.

35
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,280
Who said you could sell Fengyang House?

36
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,360
If I decide to sell, I sell.

37
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,960
What's that got to do with you?

38
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,560
I took Fengyang House from near ruin

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,120
to opening over a dozen branches.

40
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,960
Every brick and tile was earned by me.

41
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,540
Doesn't it have anything to do with me?

42
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,960
Even so, it still won't matter.

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,920
Listen,

44
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,360
the house passes from father to son.

45
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,080
I, your brother, am the sole heir.

46
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,360
That's right.

47
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,840
Qingqing.

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,400
It runs because of your hard work.

49
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,840
But you're not your brother.

50
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,960
Qingqing, I'm not trying to put you down.

51
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,480
You're not even fit
to enter the Ancestral Hall,

52
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,160
let alone inherit the Fengyang House.

53
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,400
Exactly.

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,160
Just have Datian give you more profits.

55
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,160
Yes.

56
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:34,120
That's more reasonable.

57
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,560
My dear sister,

58
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,400
as long as our family
has a man standing,

59
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,760
you won't enter the Ancestral Hall.

60
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,020
Is that so?

61
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,580
I'd like to see

62
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,840
who dares lay a hand on me.

63
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,780
(Ultrasound Medical Imaging Report)

64
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,840
You're with child?

65
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,080
You're not even married yet.

66
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,920
This is improper.

67
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,160
She did this just to seize the house.

68
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,480
Even if that's so,

69
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,480
you still can't enter.

70
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,560
That depends on who the father is.

71
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,160
Our family has many
in the collateral line.

72
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,920
You're not the only man here.

73
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,400
By seniority,

74
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,720
you'd have to
call him great-grandfather.

75
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,280
Nonsense.

76
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,120
You can use the family rules against me,

77
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
but I can't?

78
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,800
Hurry, bow to your great-grandfather.

79
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,560
- Bow now.
- What are you doing?

80
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,210
Have you lost your mind?

81
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,280
You're crazy, Fu Qingqing?

82
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,030
I was just teasing you.

83
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,680
Told you. She fooled us.

84
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,400
This girl's temper is really something.

85
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,760
Well played, Fu Qingqing.

86
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,480
Mom.

87
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,120
Lawyer Zhang is here too.

88
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,160
Just sign this and it's done.

89
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,960
Tian Xifeng.

90
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,060
Well, well.

91
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,720
You two took advantage of Mom's dementia.

92
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,760
One blocked me.

93
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,760
And one held Mom down.

94
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:59,400
Quite the teamwork you have.

95
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,840
Qingqing,

96
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,000
it was all her decision.

97
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,680
We only acted according to her wishes.

98
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
Like I'd believe that.

99
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,840
Step aside.

100
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,240
Mom.

101
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,480
Qingqing.

102
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,400
You... you must

103
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,000
look after your younger brother.

104
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,400
You mustn't take what's his.

105
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,520
Mom.

106
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,520
Fengyang House is

107
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,760
my life's work.

108
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,840
It's also the legacy of our ancestors

109
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,040
passed down for generations.

110
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,480
We can't let

111
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,760
my useless brother sell it.

112
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,120
Our forebears decreed,

113
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,680
it shall pass to sons, not daughters.

114
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,320
You must obey.

115
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,760
Mom.

116
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,120
I've been managing the house all along.

117
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,120
I'm the one in charge.

118
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,200
Why should it be otherwise?

119
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,480
You're the elder sister.

120
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,040
You must care for your younger brother.

121
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,340
You need to behave.

122
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,070
Be good, alright?

123
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:06,990
Stay obedient.

124
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,920
Stay obedient.

125
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:21,060
(Fengyang House)

126
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,480
Passed only to sons, never daughters.

127
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,600
Such outdated thinking

128
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,160
only brings harm to others.

129

(In memory of Fu Xiaosheng)

130
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,400
What?

131
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,720
Why, are you upset now?

132
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,380
(In memory of Fu Xiaosheng)

133
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,120
Fu Xiaosheng, right?

134
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,320
If you dare, show yourself to me.

135
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,280
I'll scold you if I must.

136
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,760
This...

137
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,900
(In memory of Great-grandmother Madam Chen)

138
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,580
(Fengyang House)

139
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,680
What's going on here?

140
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,780
(Fengyang House)

141
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,760
See? My sister's been waiting for you.

142
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,280
Your sister...

143
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,880
She… she truly wants to be with me?

144
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,120
Of course.

145
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,000
Her husband's been missing.

146
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,440
She lives like a lonely widow.

147
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,280
She's just waiting for you, Boss Wang.

148
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,880
Then I'll…

149
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Go on, enjoy yourself.

150
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,280
I'll go put the child in the cart.

151
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,000
Have a good time.

152
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,280
Qingqing, I've missed you so much.

153
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,280
So you finally came around.

154
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,560
You rogue, what are you doing?

155
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,320
You foul woman.

156
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Your brother said
you wanted to be with me.

157
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,560
Changing your mind, are you?

158
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,480
My brother?

159
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,320
That scamp, he dares

160
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
pull such tricks.

161
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,880
You two siblings

162
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,840
tried to set me up.

163
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,120
If I get angry,

164
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,400
you'll be in serious trouble.

165
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,720
What's going on here?

166
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,040
Go.

167
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,000
Hurry up.

168
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,880
Go, move faster.

169
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,240
- Da Tian.
- Come on.

170
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,840
Stop right there.

171
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,280
Sister.

172
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,960
Why so fast?

173
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,400
You rascal.

174
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,120
I used to think you were just wasteful,

175
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,880
never expected you'd scheme against me.

176
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,040
It's just sleeping with Boss Wang.

177
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,880
I'm helping you find another patron.

178
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,720
I...

179
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,590
Enough, I need to sell the children now.

180
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,720
Sell the children?

181
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,960
Yeah, those two kids of yours.

182
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,480
Mother.

183
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,560
- Please don't sell us.
- Let us go.

184
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,160
We'll behave, we promise.

185
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,100
When my father returns,

186
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,480
he'll make sure you pay for this.

187
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
Let us go!

188
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
Enough with the noise.

189
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,880
Mother, please don't sell me.

190
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,480
We'll be obedient.

191
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,720
Tangbao, don't call her mother.

192
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,390
She's not our real mother.

193
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,720
Wicked woman, when my father returns,

194
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,280
he'll make sure you're punished.

195
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,920
You little brat.

196
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,080
Always running your mouth.

197
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,920
- Brother.
- Quiet.

198
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,000
I raised you.

199
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,600
No one knows

200
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
where your father died off to.

201
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,400
If it weren't for the fact you two

202
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,480
are still worth a few coins,

203
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,880
I'd tear your mouths apart.

204
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,750
Datian, come here.

205
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,040
These are the deeds of sale for them.

206
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,720
Take them to Boss Wang.

207
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,320
See if you can get a good price.

208
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,520
Sister.

209
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,210
You're worth much more

210
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,560
than them.

211
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,160
(I... What?)

212
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,120
(Mother of a child?)

213
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:41,120
(I've crossed over
into being a stepmother.)

214
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,280
Move.

215
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,360
Little rascal,

216
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,280
I'll thrash you.

217
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,180
Sister.

218
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,240
How dare you!

219
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,360
Why are you hitting me?

220
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,320
You deserve this.

221
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,900
It's just sleeping with Boss Wang.

222
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,440
Say that again?

223
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,760
It's just some money.

224
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,000
What did you say?

225
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,080
Have you lost your mind?

226
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
- You.
- You deserve it.

227
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,200
He Qingqing, are you crazy?

228
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,680
Yes, I've gone mad.

229
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,240
Mother.

230
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
No way...

231
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,440
I really transmigrated...

232
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,520
into the cruel stepmother of them.

233
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,360
This family truly is dirt poor.

234
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,880
Father, Mother.

235
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,080
Please bless my brother to wake soon.

236
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,560
Praying to them won't help.

237
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,440
Your brother

238
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,880
was knocked out.

239
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,120
A good rest will work.

240
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,200
(In Memory of Father Fu Qinghuai; Mother)

241
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,080
Tangbao.

242
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,240
Your family surname is Fu?

243
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,960
That's right.

244
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,320
Then what's your brother's full name?

245
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,000
Fu Xiaosheng.

246
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,500
(In Memory of Fu Xiaosheng)

247
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,800
These two children...

248
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,320
are my ancestors.

249
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,560
I can't believe I've ended up

250
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,360
as my ancestors' stepmother.

251
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,200
Where are the Fu Family Letters?

252
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,440
There's no such book at home.

253
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,240
They've all been thrown away.

254
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,760
We don't have any ancestral letters.

255
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,080
Which means,

256
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:01,520
if I start from today and change

257
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,560
the thinking of these two ancestors,

258
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,420
then there won't be

259
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,830
pass-only-to-sons ancestral precept.

260
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,440
And no one will

261
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,680
use this as a reason to

262
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,120
stop me from running Fengyang House.

263
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,840
Tangbao.

264
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,960
Where is our Fengyang House?

265
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,010
Head left out the door and keep walking,

266
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,120
then cross the wheat fields.

267
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,000
Reach the ferry
and take a black awning boat

268
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,200

Then give something in exchange.
