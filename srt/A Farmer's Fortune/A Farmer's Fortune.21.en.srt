=Episode 21=

22
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm Su Yanjin,

23
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,000
greetings to you all.

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,400
What?

25
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,960
You are Su Yanjin?

26
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,040
The great scholar Su?

27
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,440
Indeed.

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,960
How will you prove it?

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,440
The General token is here.

30
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,980
(Su)

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,040
You are from a noble family.

32
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,600
A man of upright character.

33
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,040
Then why

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,360
do you call yourself Fu Qinghuai?

35
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,120
Fu was my sworn brother.

36
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,200
He fell victim to the bandits

37
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,400
and has passed away.

38
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,960
I took on his entrusted duty

39
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,660
to look after his family.

40
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,120
So that's how it is.

41
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,520
It was Tian Xifeng and Pan Cai

42
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,800
who clouded my judgment.

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,080
Thankfully,

44
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,560
the wrongdoers have faced justice.

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,280
At least you were spared

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,080
such unwarranted accusations.

47
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,240
I only wish

48
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,680
that those without power can also

49
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,440
be free from false charges.

50
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,680
That's only natural.

51
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,680
Natural indeed.

52
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,860
Let's be on our way.

53
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,720
Wait a moment.

54
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,280
The Fus' matter still needs a resolution.

55
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,680
He Qingqing is, after all, a stepmother,

56
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,600
not a blood relative of the Fus.

57
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,140
Should we entrust Xiaosheng

58
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,480
with running the household?

59
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,160
After all, he is

60
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,760
the Fu Family's only male heir.

61
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,720
So what you mean is...

62
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,720
Qingqing can't manage the household?

63
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,840
We all know how Qingqing

64
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,480
treats the children.

65
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,240
She's their mother.

66
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,840
She keeps

67
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,960
the family affairs in order.

68
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,080
Fu Qinghai

69
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,480
would surely be glad to see this.

70
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,880
Why can't she take charge?

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,440
- Exactly.
- That's right.

72
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,680
The Fu Family owes

73
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,720
some credit to Qingqing.

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,480
She's even helped all of us here

75
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,680
to live better lives.

76
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,940
- She's capable.
- Absolutely.

77
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,280
But an outsider

78
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,800
taking charge...

79
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,440
It just doesn't follow tradition.

80
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,960
Why can't a woman head the household?

81
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,480
I want my mother to take charge.

82
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,680
Whatever a man can do,

83
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,480
a woman can do just the same.

84
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,560
My mother can even do it better.

85
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,680
This...

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,920
Exactly, who says we are less than men?

87
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,400
Who says we are less than men?

88
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,080
Alright, alright.

89
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,920
Everyone speaks with reason.

90
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,880
It makes sense.

91
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,920
He Qingqing's skills and dedication,

92
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,120
I have witnessed them clearly.

93
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,640
Since everyone

94
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,400
holds such respect for Qingqing,

95
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,680
then naturally she should

96
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,680
remain as head of the Fu Family.

97
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,780
That's more like it.

98
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,040
Your father often

99
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,600
shared little stories about you with me.

100
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,220
(In Memory of Father Fu Qinghuai
and Mother Chen Yue)

101
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,320
He always kept you in his thoughts.

102
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,320
Father.

103
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,040
Xiaosheng.

104
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,520
Mother.

105
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,280
Let's not tell Tangbao, alright?

106
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,400
She knows nothing about it.

107
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,760
Things can stay as they were.

108
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,760
She can keep living happily as before.

109
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,760
Alright.

110
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,920
We promise you.

111
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,240
Xiaosheng.

112
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,680
Even a true man

113
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,760
can shed tears
when he feels like crying.

114
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,040
Everyone has the right
to feel vulnerable.

115
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,680
You've done an amazing job already.

116
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
I'm proud of you.

117
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,280
If you feel like crying,

118
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,920
just cry.

119
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,680
Mother.

120
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,320
Father is gone.

121
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,280
Please don't leave me, alright?

122
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,880
Alright.

123
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,000
We won't.

124
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,480
You must be exhausted.

125
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,120
Tangbao.

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,880
Mother.

127
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,720
You're finally back.

128
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,160
Sorry for keep you waiting.

129
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,400
Good girl.

130
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,880
Can I still call you Father?

131
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,040
My silly girl.

132
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,160
Of course you can.

133
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,720
Father.

134
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,200
He Qingqing.

135
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,120
Did you come to mock me?

136
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,600
It's all because of you

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,320
that I've ended up like this.

138
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,040
Even to this point,

139
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,560
you're still clinging to your old ways.

140
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,000
Back then, my family was raising

141
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,320
silver for my brother's marriage gift.

142
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,320
They married me down into your family.

143
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,560
I thought life would be good.

144
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,320
But He Datian had big ambitions
but no skill.

145
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,400
I could only watch our days grow worse.

146
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,000
Why is that?

147
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,880
We were traded away by our families,

148
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,440
yet you ended up living better?

149
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,720
You have your chains of circumstance,

150
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,880
but why bear grudges against me?

151
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,320
I suffered the same fate as you.

152
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,160
You have everything,

153
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,840
while I have nothing.

154
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,980
All I can do is fight for it.

155
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,600
Is it wrong for me to take what I want?

156
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,200
Fighting for yourself is never wrong.

157
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,980
But it should be against this cruel world,

158
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,200
against the fate.

159
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,000
You and I are both women.

160
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,280
We should stand by each other.

161
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,320
Why make life harder for us?

162
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,880
Tell He Datian.

163
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,720
I have never carried a child.

164
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,120
All that talk is...

165
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,200
just a lie to make him dance to my tune.

166
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,000
Let him settle into resenting me.

167
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,720
Time to go.

168
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,080
The truth is Tian Xifeng

169
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,000
actually has something.

170
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,760
Her heart holds grudges.

171
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,240
Her eyes see only thorns.

172
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,000
She's bound by jealousy,

173
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
blinded by resentment.

174
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,420
(Fengyang House)

175
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
Fengyang House is finally redeemed.

176
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,720
Kids,

177
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,880
remember this historic moment.

178
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,200
Open the doors!

179
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,170
Alright.

180
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,880
Let me do it, let me.

181
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,800
Slow down, you two. No running.

182
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,800
This room is huge.

183
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,800
Quite impressive.

184
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,520
Tangbao.

185
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,560
This is the place
to serve tea to the guests.

186
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,800
You two, slow down.

187
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,200
Alright, stop running.

188
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,440
Here we come.

189
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,080
Rock, paper, scissors.

190
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,400
It's getting chilly.

191
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,800
Keep yourself warm.

192
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,320
Rock.

193
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,880
Scissors.

194
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,520
Paper.

195
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,680
Alright, alright, it's okay.

196
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,880
Mother will cover your ears.

197
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,800
Tangbao.

198
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,120
You scare so easily.

199
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,020
Xiaosheng, come here.

200
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,520
Or the noise will blow your ears out.

201
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,600
Look.

202
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,200
Such beautiful fireworks.

203
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:40,480
They're breathtaking.

204
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,200
Tangbao

205
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,360
likes

206
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,440
being here with Father and Mother.

207
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,240
Go on, sleep.

208
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,960
Qingqing.

209
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,160
I may have to leave soon.

210
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,530
What?

211
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,540
Under your care, the Fu Family

212
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,800
has grown orderly and strong.

213
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,880
I suppose that means

214
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,960
I've honored Fu's last wish.

215
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,960
But still, I must go.

216
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,240
Otherwise my father

217
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,320
will never let matters rest.

218
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,680
When that time comes...

219
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,880
it would drag you all into trouble.

220
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,800
I'm not afraid of that.

221
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,880
Even so, I can't take that risk.

222
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,440
Whether you are Fu Qinghuai

223
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,000
or Su Yanjin,

224
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,400
I have the strength to protect

225
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,320
you and the children.

226
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,560
Don't underestimate me.

227
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,560
I have never underestimated you.

228
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,120
In my eyes,

229
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,680
you're the sunshine.

230
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,320
You need no borrowed light.

231
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,080
You shine on your own,

232
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,640
radiant and striking.

233
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,600
And I

234
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,200
have always wished to be your wings.

235
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,800
If Heaven could grant me

236
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,540
one wish for the rest of my days,

237
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,200
I would only wish

238
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,120
to stay with you

239
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,200
through spring, summer,

240
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,360
autumn, winter...

241
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,990
always.

242
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,200
Then stay here

243
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,920
for your sunshine.

The Village Chief said

249
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,480
a distinguished guest

250
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,880
asked to meet you, the shop owner.

251
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Then make me a dish

252
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,920
that could

253
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,480
bring a wayward child back home

254
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,120
and change his mind.

255
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,840
But I truly can't make it.

256
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,960
So please,

257
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,320
seek someone more skilled.

258
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,960
You stubborn child.

259
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,120
He has his own dreams.

260
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,040
His own way of life

261
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,280
simply didn't follow

262
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
the path you set for him.

263
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,440
How does that wrong?

264
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,640
And you would forsake yourself

265
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,440
for the sake of a village woman

266
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,000

267
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,440
She is not terrible.

268
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,120
On the contrary,

269
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,160
she is the brightest soul

270
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,880
