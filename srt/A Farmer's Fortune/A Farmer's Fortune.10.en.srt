One of a kind.

24

Don't miss out as you pass by.

25
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:20,720
What would you like?

26
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,600
I want some too.

27
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,680
We've got everything.

28
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,600
Aunt Qingqing, I want a portion as well.

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,000
Sure, here you go, be careful.

30
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,000
A mung bean cake.

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,280
- Mung bean cake?
- Yes.

32
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,440
One at a time, here you go.

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,600
You want this?

34
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,010
- Okay, three wens.
- Qinghuai.

35
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,440
I want some too.

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,440
It's late.

37
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,280
Come in now.

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,540
Classes are important.

39
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,360
You go ahead first.

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,600
I can handle things here.

41
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,720
- Let's go home later.
- I want this one.

42
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,760
I want to try this dish.

43
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,790
The money's here.

44
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,120
Alright.

00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,070
This share is for you.

You two take care of the business.

47
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,920
I'm just extra here.

48
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,560
Don't say things like that.

49

Focus on the business.

- What do you want?

Try a sample?

52
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,180
Shouldn't you be in class?

00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,520
- Sir.
- Mr. Fan.

Hurry on now.

55
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,280
Sir,

56
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,840
want some snacks?

57
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,880
Perfect for breakfast.

58
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,840
Here you go.

59
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,760
The academy

60
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,840
is a sacred and serene place.

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
How could you

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,520
peddle food here?

63
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,360
Even in the most sacred place,

64
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,800
people need food, don't they?

65
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,000
Or could it be

66
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,960
you've chased every vendor
off the street?

67
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,040
That's hardly the same thing.

68
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,480
You two are women,

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,160
meant to tend to household matters.

70
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,480
Yet the two of you

71
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,240
show your faces in public,

72
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,160
drawing everyone's attention.

73
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,680
Let alone

74
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,280
in a place like the academy.

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,720
How could you meddle so broadly?

76
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,250
Does the academy belong to you?

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,560
Indeed.

78
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,600
The headmaster

79
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,800
is my father.

80
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,040
Even so,

81
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,400
you can't be in charge of everything.

82
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
I believe,

83
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,480
the students at the academy

84
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,480
would never buy food from you.

85
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,280
Don't listen to him.

86
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,240
We'll keep selling.

87
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,700
(Jinshui Academy)

88
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,760
Not a single person came by.

89
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,640
Everything's gone bad.

90
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,480
Such a heavy loss.

91
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,280
Set up a stall, and no one wanted it.

92
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,480
And they jumped in anger.

93
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,480
Xiaosheng's mother

94
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,560
set up a stall, and no one wanted it.

95
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,920
No one wanted it, and they jumped in anger.

96
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,120
Don't you dare speak ill of my mother.

97
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
What are you doing here?

98
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,280
Go quickly.

99
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,040
I shouldn't have fought.

100
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,480
I know.

101
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,200
You did it to protect me.

102
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,560
I'm truly touched.

103
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,400
Mother.

104
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,000
From now on, could you stop

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,680
setting up a stall at the academy?

106
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,680
Father earns enough now.

107
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,760
That should suffice.

108
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,040
Other mothers stay home too.

109
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,480
But if I don't go out to earn,

110
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,120
how could we reclaim the Fengyang House?

111
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,400
That's something men should worry about.

112
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,760
It's not for you to handle.

113
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,520
Mother.

114
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,040
Mr. Fan said

115
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,000
a man should strive for achievement

116
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,680
and protect his home and country.

117
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,280
A woman should support her husband

118
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,120
and guide the children's upbringing.

119
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,480
Oh, Fan Ruolin…

120
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,400
It's one thing to disagree with me.

121
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,920
Now you're even trying
to brainwash my child.

122
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,720
Xiaosheng.

123
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,040
Listen to me.

124
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,920
In this world,

125
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,000
there's no such thing

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,480
as jobs meant only for men or women.

127
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,320
What a man can do,

128
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,880
a woman can do just as well.

129
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,320
I can go out to earn and support the family,

130
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,880
and likewise, your father

131
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,160
can stay home and take care of you.

132
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,880
Would a father be mocked for that?

133
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,000
Mother, what you're doing is wrong.

134
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,840
That...

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,420
You ran off before others finished.

136
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,480
Mr. Fan taught you that?

137
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,440
Go,

138
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,320
go apologize to your mother.

139
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,320
Mother,

140
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,120
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,000
It's fine.

142
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,960
Go have some fun.

143
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,560
It seems

144
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,280
changing the children's minds isn't easy.

145
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,580
(Fengyang House)

146
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,880
Even harder than reclaiming
the Fengyang House.

147
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,540
(Jinshui Academy)

148
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,000
Qingqing, why are we still

149
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,440
coming here just to be turned away?

150
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,720
Backing down only leaves you

151
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,720
with nowhere left to stand.

152
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,000
They made up those strict rules

153
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,040
just to keep women confined.

154
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,920
I refuse to let them get their way.

155
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,040
Mr. Fu and Mr. Fan are arguing.

156
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,800
- They're arguing!
- They're arguing!

157
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,560
They're arguing!

158
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,720
Since ancient times,

159
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,660
women are praised for their quiet virtue.

160
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,380
They either obey their fathers

161
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,600
or their husbands.

162
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,440
She is showing herself publicly.

163
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,600
What a disgrace!

164
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,000
But if a woman has no father, brothers,
or husband,

165
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,720
who will support her

166
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,400
if she doesn't make a living?

167
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,760
What's your take?

168
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,400
Well said.

169
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,560
The sage once said,

170
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,200
a gentleman stays away from the kitchen.

171
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,600
But if

172
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,040
a man has no wife or mother

173
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,920
and still keeps away from the kitchen,

174
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,320
should he

175
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,000
starve to death?

176
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,920
That's unreasonable.

177
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,360
Men and women are different.

178
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,720
How can you generalize?

179
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,320
Why can't we generalize?

180
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,440
First and foremost, we are all human

181
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,560
and then divided by gender.

182
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,820
Everyone has ideals and ambitions.

183
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,000
Why must they be defined by gender?

184
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,680
If a woman has talent and vision,

185
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:01,320
why can't she spread her wings?

186
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,120
- Hear, hear.
- Well said.

187
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,000
Headmaster.

188
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,160
Headmaster.

189
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,120
Please listen.

00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,440
Isn't this speech of his

191
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,720
overturning tradition?

192
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,120
Qinghuai,

193
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,440
it's merely a debate.

194
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,200
You must know when to stop.

195
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,000
Qingqing,

196
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,040
this cold bean jelly,

197
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,720
bring me one more bowl tomorrow.

198
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,760
Father.

199
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,880
In the academy,

200
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,720
you must address me by my title.

201
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,440
Stop laughing.

202
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,000
Class is starting.

203
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,200
Headmaster's allowed us

204
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,040
to sell freely.

205
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,720
Idle gossip is nothing to fear.

206
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,000
(My ancestor has
such forward-thinking wisdom.)

207
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,560
(Why would he set)

208
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,200
("male heirs only" rule?)

209
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,720
You…

210
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,440
Are you truly Fu Qinghuai?

211
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,160
Why ask that?

212
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,880
Because I feel…

213
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,320
the words you just spoke

214
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,080
don't sound like something

215
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,440
a scholar would say.

216
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,760
You think so too, don't you?

217
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,720
What?

218
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,640
Could it be…

219
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,240
that you're not the real He Qingqing?

220
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,960
(Well now...)

221
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,160
(Caught off guard.)

222
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,840
Today,

223
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,210
(Next Episode)
our humble shop

224
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,760
has launched a limited edition mystery box.

225
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,480
A trick to stir curiosity.

226
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,400
Even taking coins from children.

227
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,880
This

228
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,880
shows where your trade turns unjust.

229
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,480
I'm going to sue you

230
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,320
for fraud.

231
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,880
Then step over me first.

232
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,160
- You won't get away.
- He Datian.

233
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,200
Pay for the medicine.

234
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,080
Stop.

235
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:38,590
♪A captive bird yearns for its forest,
like fish in a pond longing for the ocean♪

236

Mother.

238
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,320
