22
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,560
Are you... my father?

23
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,120
Take a good look.

24
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,560
Am I not?

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,640
Xiaosheng.

26
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,040
Check carefully.

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,520
Times are chaotic now.

28
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,180
Don't let trouble into our home.

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,400
If you're my father,

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,520
do you remember when you left years ago,

31
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,560
what I asked you to bring back?

32
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,920
Of course I do.

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,080
Then you really are my father.

34
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,120
Father.

35
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,080
Where on earth have you been?

36
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,220
When I went for the imperial exam,

37
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,600
I was robbed.

38
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,130
Spent years as their scribe.

39
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,560
Escaped only after great hardship.

40
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,340
Let's not talk about me.

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,720
Have you and Tangbao

42
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,480
been doing well these past years?

43
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,160
This wicked woman

44
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,680
keeps holding onto our deeds of sale

45
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,840
and forces us to work.

46
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,960
About this matter,

47
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,400
I can explain.

48
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,160
Where are the children's deeds of sale?

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,840
(Looks like)

50
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,900
(he's hard to deal with.)

51
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,480
(If I hand over the deeds,)

52
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,800
(what leverage will I have left?)

53
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,200
I… forgot where
I put them.

54
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,120
I can't remember where I put it.

55
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,520
How about this, give me a few more days,

56
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,800
I promise I'll find them.

57
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,840
Now where could they be?

58
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,280
Mother, are you looking for this?

59
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,720
No...

60
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,120
Actually…

61
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,920
I only redeemed it yesterday.

62
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,640
Otherwise, I would've dealt with it.

63
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,020
(Divorce Letter)

64
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,200
I want a divorce.

65
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,200
As Head of He Family and Village Head,

66
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,560
it's my duty to ask for the reason.

67
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,680
Fu Qinghuai.

68
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,560
You just got back,

69
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,280
and now you speak of divorce?

70
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,120
Village Head,

71
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,040
he's been gone for so many years.

72
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,000
I've managed the household alone,

73
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,120
and handled everything
where silver was needed.

74
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,200
He didn't care for me.

75
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
I've endured so much.

76
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,100
The first thing he asks for is divorce.

77
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,320
Does that sound reasonable?

78
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,840
Do you really think I know nothing?

79
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
You sold Fengyang House,

80
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,760
which I'd say is for our livelihood.

81
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,400
Those two children...

82
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,120
How did you treat them?

83
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,560
What's wrong with them?

84
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,040
They have food and clothes.

85
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,990
What was bad about that?

86
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,500
You sold them to Wang Cheng.

87
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,000
How will you explain it away?

88
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,560
I fell into another's trap.

89
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,660
Besides,

90
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,000
wasn't that matter resolved?

91
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,200
The deed of sale was redeemed.

92
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,400
And you tore it up yourself.

93
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,280
Why would I tear it?

94
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,280
Because you used it to force

95
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,300
the children to work?

96
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,280
Having them help at home.

97
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,200
How is that coercion?

98
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,120
Enough.

99
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,920
Let me speak a fair word.

100
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,760
Five years ago,

101
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,560
you've been away studying for years.

102
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,920
Old Madam Fu's health has been poor.

103
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,480
No one could look after Fengyang House.

104
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,000
So they decided on this.

105
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,200
They let Qingqing

106
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,280
marry into the Fu Family.

107
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,680
Qingqing mourned for three years
without remarrying.

108
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,200
By both reason and sentiment,

109
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,320
you should never

110
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,290
turn your back on her.

111
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,280
Village Head,

112
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,200
at least you see the truth of it.

113
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,040
I was an unmarried maiden,

114
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,200
yet I wed him as his second wife.

115
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,840
That alone was a sacrifice.

116
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,120
Now he's finally returned.

117
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,420
I've raised his children,

118
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,040
healthy and full of life.

119
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,760
He comes back only to bring up divorce.

120
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,560
One shouldn't treat people this way.

121
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,000
Village Head.

122
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,280
You must stand up for me.

123
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,440
She's not committed
any of the Seven Grounds for Divorce.

124
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,000
So a divorce cannot be raised.

125
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,600
Only a harmonious home
can bring prosperity.

126
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,160
Alright.

127
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,400
Look here.

128
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,560
Such a bright and lively wife.

129
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,600
Isn't she wonderful?

130
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,980
Spend more time together
and feelings will grow.

131
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Quickly take back the Divorce Letter.

132
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,160
Vi... Village Head.

133
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,560
Then, Village Head,

134
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,320
we won't trouble you any further.

135
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,540
- Please.
- Very well.

136
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,720
Qingqing.

137
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,160
Men, you know,

138
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,840
speak tough but have a soft heart.

139
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,320
You should take the initiative more often.

140
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,160
Now I see how you tricked

141
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,560
my mother into agreeing to this marriage.

142
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,860
Just like that, the wedding was arranged.

143
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,700
As for what happened back then,

144
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,720
I truly had no choice.

145
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,480
You don't have to believe me

146
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,320
or to see me as your wife.

147
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
The two of us

148
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,480
can simply live as roommates.

149
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,840
Just share the household.

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,400
Even if a divorce isn't possible,

151
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,180
I will never live with you.

152
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,180
That's not for me.

153
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,280
If you wish to stay,

154
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,600
stay as you please.

155
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,720
I'll take my children somewhere else.

156
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,440
You may leave, but the children stay.

157
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,000
A stepmother is still a mother.

158
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,840
I've cared for them,

159
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,400
pouring my heart into it.

160
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,400
And now you come back,

161
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,440
taking my efforts.

162
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,880
Besides,

163
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,380
whether they want to go with you

164
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,120
is still uncertain.

165
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,000
Then let them decide for themselves.

166
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,280
Decide it shall be.

167
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,840
Xiaosheng, Tangbao,

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,160
would you like to leave

169
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,160
with your father?

170
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,760
My work has just taken off.

171
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,440
Follow me and you'll have a good life.

172
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,600
But a new business

173
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
brings unstable income.

174
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,720
I'm a scholar.

175
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll soon be teaching
at the village academy.

176
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,440
Every month, there's steady silver coming in.

177
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,990
We won't worry about food or clothing.

178
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,040
Really, Father?

179
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,480
That's impressive.

180
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
Even the most secure post has its limits.

181
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,700
Raising a child is about
putting your heart into it.

182
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,320
I can come up with
new delicious food

183
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,160
every day.

184
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,320
Can you do that?

185
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,200
Tangbao loves the dishes Mother makes best.

186
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,720
Tangbao, you're such a good little one.

187
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,280
Tangbao.

188
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,160
Father has tasty treats for you too.

189
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,880
Mother says I shouldn't eat food from others.

190
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,600
How could I be "others"?

191
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,550
Her health is delicate.

192
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,520
Stop tiring her out.

193
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,260
Right, Tangbao?

194
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,990
Then I'll invite for her

195
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,060
the finest physician.

196
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,720
(In Memory of Mother Hu)
Med is harmful.

197
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,520
She's so young.

198
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,920
She should be nourished with food.

199
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,160
You're off studying every day.

200
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,380
Don't have time to care for us,

201
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,120
right?

202
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,300
(In Memory of Mother Hu)

203
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,720
No matter what,
she is still my daughter.

204
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,440
I must take her with me.

205
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,940
(Mother Hu)
If you take her now,

206
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:41,840
you'll risk her life.

207
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,760
Xiaosheng, who do you wish to go with?

208
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,860
I don't want to go with anyone.

209
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,720
Xiaosheng.

210
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,320
Brother.

211
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,880
This is bad.

212
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,720
- Xiaosheng.
- Xiaosheng.

213
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,710
This is your fault.

214
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,980
You forced the child to choose.

215
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,660
If you hadn't fought with me,

216
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,880
- it wouldn't have...
- You...

217
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,850
Xiaosheng.

218
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,720
Xiaosheng.

219
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,480
- Xiaosheng.
- Xiaosheng.

220
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,720
(In memory of Mother Hu)

221
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,600
Grandmother, Mother.

222
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,440
Father has returned.

223
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,040
(Late Mother Hu)
But he quarreled with that woman,

224
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,320
and never once mentioned you.

225
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,920
I truly miss you both so much.

226
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,960
Xiaosheng.

227
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,840
I was in the wrong.

228
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,200
I should've come to visit them.

229
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,080
I've been gone for so long,

230
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
unable to care for

231
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
you and Tangbao properly.

232
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,800
I have wronged you both,

233
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
your mother,

234
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,480
and your grandmother.

235
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,730
I, Fu Qinghuai, swear here today,

236
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,340
I will take good care
of Xiaosheng and Tangbao.

237
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,090
I will not let them suffer
the slightest harm.

238
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,160
Xiaosheng,

239
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,560
will you give Father another chance?

240
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,000
Tangbao.

241
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,880
Come with me and Father.

242
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
We leave tomorrow.

243
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,760
Why so soon?

244
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,440
Isn't it nice
having Father and Mother at home?

245
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,360
She was never truly our mother.

246
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,560
And she never will be.

247
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,760
But she's been kind to us lately.

248
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,680
You're just taken in by the way

249
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,680
she's acting.

250
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,640
Xiaosheng.

251
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,560
It's been a tiring day.

252
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,840
Finish your meal

253
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,000
and rest early.

254
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,880
Tangbao.

255
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,440
You should sleep too.

256
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,600
Alright.

257
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,240
I'll put Tangbao to bed first.

258
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,960
Come.

259
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,400
Let's go.

260
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,400
This is grave soil of my late wife.

261
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,390
I want to find a place to enshrine it.

262
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,460
I think your room would be perfect.

263
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,960
So that's it.

264
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,560
You fancy this kind of pastime.

265
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,680
You should've told me sooner.

266
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,800
Dear late sister,

267
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,800
if your spirit watches from above,

268
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,440
then look closely

269
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,680
and see how I care for my husband.

270
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,080
I truly underestimated
your shamelessness.

271
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,560
You refuse to divorce me.

272
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,210
And you won't release my child.

273
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,680
What exactly is your intention?

274
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,440
Is it that you want to follow your father?

275
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,320
(Next Episode)

276
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,920
So you deliberately ruined it like this.

277
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,360
Find a way to repay the money.

278
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,880
Or I'll take it to the authorities.

279
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,080
Xiaosheng.

280
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,920
Do you have chili peppers?

281
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,280
I'll pay a handsome price.

282
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,800
Twenty wens and one tael.

283
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,080
Since she won't bring the money over,

284
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,960
we'll just take her way of making money

285
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,200
and make it ours.
