00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,840
Hey everyone.

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,160
Don't just pass by, you have to see this.

24
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,890
- News!
- There's a thief at the Fu Family.

25
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,000
Yes. Attention!

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Come take a look.

27
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,480
The Fu Family's been robbed.

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,800
Everyone, come over and see.

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,220
He Datian, what tricks are you pulling?

30
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,960
Well well, He Qingqing.

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,880
I knew my family's old secret...

32
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,280
Potato cold bean jelly.

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,120
The secret Recipe for it has vanished.

34
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,600
Turns out you're the one who took it.

35
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,280
You two really flipped the truth

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,440
upside down here.

37
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,040
It was my own creation.

38
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,520
When did it become ancestral?

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,560
She claims she invented it herself.

40
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,400
With that lazy attitude of yours,

41
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,200
if you could actually create bean jelly,

42
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,400
then sows could climb trees.

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,080
Qingqing,

44
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,960
hand over the recipe

45
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,560
and we'll let it go.

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,460
- We'll drop it.
- Yeah, let it go.

47
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,760
You all came here in such a big show.

48
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,960
Just to let it go?

49
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,600
What a waste of such drama.

50
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,720
You...

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,760
Let me tell everyone,

52
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,720
this recipe is only passed to men.

53
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,120
But she stole it.

54
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,400
My mother

55
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,480
is so angry
she can't even get out of bed.

56
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,160
My poor mother.

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
He Datian, that's enough.

58
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,440
Girl,

59
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,840
what do you have to say?

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,320
Alright.

61
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,360
Since

62
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,880
you're saying it is a family recipe,

63
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,400
then tell us,

64
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,240
in the cold bean jelly,

65
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,360
what are the three most important seasonings

66
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,160
and what are the first few steps?

67
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,880
The recipe is passed down.

68
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,960
- Of course we wouldn't know.
- Exactly.

69
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,960
We're not like my eldest sister-in-law

70
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,360
who disrespects family tradition.

71
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,990
If you've never seen it, how can you know

72
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,700
it's passed down?

73
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,720
Qingqing,

74
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,440
you know what kind of person you are.

75
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,360
Everyone's seen it for themselves.

76
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,400
A few days ago,

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,600
you ran out of money

78
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,920
and came to our place to take stuff,

79
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,560
scaring me so bad
I nearly had pregnancy complications.

80
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,400
Tell me,

81
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,600
if you just wanted some rice
or flour, fine.

82
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,160
We're family after all.

83
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,440
Can't just watch you go hungry.

84
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,680
But I never thought…

85
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,240
you'd cause such a scene

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,240
all to steal our family recipe.

87
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,080
Thief.

88
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,400
You said it with such drama and conviction.

89
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,560
Sounded pretty convincing.

90
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,120
I almost believed you.

91
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,680
What's that supposed to mean?

92
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,040
- It's true.
- That's how it is.

93
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,890
- It is ours.
- Yes.

94
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,120
You took our secret recipe.

95
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,280
- It's ours.
- Alright, enough, enough.

96
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,760
You're still family.

97
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,560
No need to make this uglier.

98
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,680
Girl,

99
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,560
I believe you wouldn't steal.

100
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,400
It's just that…

101
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,040
you grabbed the wrong one by mistake.

102
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,400
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

103
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,680
Picked up the wrong thing.

104
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,480
Just return the recipe.

105
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,200
We won't hold it against you.

106
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,200
No hard feelings.

107
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,740
- You're awful!
- Tangbao.

108
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,620
- Why?
- Seriously?

109
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,480
Believe I'll slap you?

110
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,320
Get up, come on.

111
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,320
I can give you the recipe.

112
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,200
But if you touch the kid,

113
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
you'll regret it big time.

114
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,480
Right, right.

115
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,840
I said that it belongs to us.

116
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,040
That's called returning
to the rightful owner.

117
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,460
I passed through the West Market.

118
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I saw a thief caught
stealing from others.

119
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,280
He was beaten to death in public.

120
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,160
For misbehaving,

121
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,080
you'll face the consequences.

122
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,080
What do you mean?

123
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,640
Even if you put on a perfect act
these days,

124
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:05,360
your true colors showed through.

125
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,880
I'm telling you, it's time to stop.

126
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,280
Don't be a bad influence.

127
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,560
My true color is... I'm your dad.

128
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,560
You're out of your mind.

129
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,060
(Divorce Letter)

130
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,560
He Qingqing

131
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,600
has shown improper behavior.

132
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,650
(Fengyang House)

133
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,200
She stole the family secret recipe

134
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,880
and violated the Seven Grounds for Divorce.

135
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,160
(Divorce Letter)

136
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,000
Father.

137
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,920
Tangbao.

138
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,720
Come here.

139
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,160
What's up?

140
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,800
Why did you want to see me today?

141
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Father.

142
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,600
Go and cheer Mother up.

143
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,760
Me? Cheer her up?

144
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,480
Why?

145
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,920
Some people lied and said

146
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,320
Mother stole the recipe.

147
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,560
They even snatched it away.

148
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,200
She must feel terrible inside.

149
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,480
You mean

150
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,040
Mother didn't take the recipe?

151
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,760
Of course not.

152
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,480
It was Mother and Tangbao.

153
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,360
We worked it out together.

154
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,360
It took them so many days.

155
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,480
I see.

156
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,760
So I wrongly blamed her.

157
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,320
Father.

158
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,920
Mother's a good person.

159
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,930
In that case,

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,840
Tangbao.

161
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
Take Father with you.

162
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,000
Go get the recipe back.

163
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,920
How about it?

164
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,440
Sure, let's get the recipe back.

165
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,760
That'll make Mother happy.

166
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,120
Let's go.

167
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,280
Ouch, ouch, ouch.

168
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,150
What are you doing?

169
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,090
Hand over the recipe.

170
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,300
That was taken away by your wife.

171
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,480
Why should I hand it over?

172
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,160
- Still trying to keep it?
- Ouch.

173
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,280
Don't think she has no one

174
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,200
backing her up.

175
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,040
Fu Qinghuai.

176
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,920
What are you all doing here?

177
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
Mother.

178
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,040
Father and I came to help you
get the Recipe.

179
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,320
My neck's about to snap.

180
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,160
I'm reporting

181
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,320
you for intentional assault.

182
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,160
Fu Qinghuai.

183
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,640
Let him go first.

184
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,040
He Datian.

185
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,600
Is this recipe really yours?

186
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,200
You know the truth better than anyone.

187
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,040
Don't act innocent
after taking advantage.

188
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,600
The village chief awarded us the recipe.

189
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,920
That means it belongs to me.

190
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,880
I'm done wasting words with you.

191
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,320
I'm going home to make bean jelly.

192
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,160
Just let him leave.

193
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,160
If you owe me again...

194
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,160
You don't want it back?

195
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,720
Now you believe I didn't steal it?

196
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,000
Tangbao already told me everything.

197
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,400
Sorry.

198
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,320
Mother.

199
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,640
Tangbao is really upset.

200
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,040
My little treasure, please don't be mad.

201
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,360
I'll show you something exciting.

202
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,400
Let's go.

203
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,320
Honey.

204
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,200
Honey.

205
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,280
I'm back.

206
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,120
Hurry, hurry.

207
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,480
Listen,

208
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,200
I've reached out to the buyers in the city.

209
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,040
They said they'll take as much

210
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,360
the potato bean jelly as we can make.

211
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,760
Honey,

212
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,320
we might be hitting it big soon.

213
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,160
It's because I worked so well with you.

214
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,120
Otherwise your sister

215
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,560
wouldn't give in that easily.

216
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,440
You're really smart, you know that?

217
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,320
Come on, hurry.

218
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,560
The recipe.

219
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,640
- We're gonna be rich.
- Read it.

220
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,480
I've got it.

221
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,160
Two liangs of cinnamon.

222
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,880
Two liangs of star anise.

223
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,720
Five.

224
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,200
Four.

225
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,600
Three.

226
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,640
Two.

227
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,040
One.

228
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
That hurts like crazy.

229
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,080
Water, water, water!

230
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,520
How did this happen?

231
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,880
How did you pull that off?

232
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,440
Seriously,

233
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,000
no way I'd give them the real recipe.

234
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,440
I gave them
a quicklime reaction formula.

235
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,640
Let's see if he dares to steal my recipe.

236
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,230
Mother, you're so smart.

237
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,200
Tangbao's smart too.

238
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,400
Whoa.

239
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,200
He Qingqing.

240
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,440
I knew it was you.

241
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,560
He Qingqing!

242
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,440
Go, go, go! Run!

243
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
He Qingqing, you troublemaker!

244
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,000
He Qingqing, stop right there!

245
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,840
After her!

246
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,640
Mother, fireflies!

247
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,960
They're so pretty.

248
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,560
Absolutely gorgeous.

249
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,440
Aren't these just ordinary things?

250
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,880
Where I live, they're rare.

251
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,080
What I mean is

252
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,760
because they're so common,

253
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,680
that's why

254
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,440
we often overlook them in daily life.

255
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,680
People do tend to be blinded

256
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,240
by what they already believe.

257
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,640
Tangbao, come here.

258
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,480
Let's watch together.

259
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,880
See that one?
Doesn't it look like you?

260
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,000
It kinda looks like...

261
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,840
Father.

262
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,760
It makes sense.

263
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,240
And... what about that one?

264
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,160
Looks just like Mother.

265
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,600
You got it!

266
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,400
Tangbao, you're amazing.

267
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,320
Why aren't they back yet?

268
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,320
Tangbao.

269
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,200
I like

270
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,400
being with Mother and Dad.

271
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,960
Fu Qinghuai.

272
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,000
Let's call a truce.

273
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,760
Just think of it

274
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,120
as being for Tangbao.

275
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,440
You have to tell me

276
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,440
the real reason you stayed here.

277
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,000
I already told you.

278
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,880
To buy back the Fengyang House

279
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,440
and raise the two kids.

280
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:25,840
Alright.

281
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,760
Let me help you.

282
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,280
I'm the only one who doesn't belong.

283
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,360
You can't leave.

284
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,400
(Next Episode)

285
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,160
Xiaosheng, Xiaosheng, are you in there?

286
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,000
Come home with me.

287
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,880
From now on,

288
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,280
it will never be my home again.

289
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,080
- Go away or not?
- Watch out.

290
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:15,880
Can you...

291
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,720
give us a chance?

292
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,800
How did you get so many wounds?

293
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,960
I can take care of it.

294
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,840
