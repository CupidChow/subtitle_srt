Stop!

Stop!

13
00:04:03,454 --> 00:04:05,454
Stop!

14
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:07,478
Huajun, Hun army!

15
00:04:23,402 --> 00:04:25,402
Miss, behind me.

16
00:04:25,426 --> 00:04:27,426
Don't fight and come with us.

17
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,450
Sis.

18
00:04:29,474 --> 00:04:31,474
What is this?
/ Let's talk later after surviving this.

19
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:56,498
Watch out!

20
00:05:04,422 --> 00:05:06,422
Watch out!

21
00:05:36,446 --> 00:05:38,446
It's done now.

22
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,470
Miss, what's the matter?

23
00:05:59,494 --> 00:06:01,494
My arrows are running out.

24
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:03,518
How about this?

25
00:06:12,442 --> 00:06:14,442
Chase him!

26
00:07:18,466 --> 00:07:20,466
No need to chase!

27
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,490
Sis, the Hun army will be here soon.

28
00:08:36,514 --> 00:08:39,414
Miss, I'll give it back.

29
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:47,438
You'd better go.
/ How about you guys?

30
00:08:47,462 --> 00:08:49,462
No need to worry about us.

31
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:51,486
Bring my horse.

32
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,410
He ran fast.
His name is Lei Zhen.

33
00:09:02,434 --> 00:09:04,434
Be careful.

34
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,458
Look after yourself.

35
00:09:20,482 --> 00:09:22,482
Why hold dandelions?

36
00:09:56,406 --> 00:09:58,406
Knight, thank you for helping me.

37
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,430
Mengyun thanked him.

38
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,454
Do you like dandelions?

39
00:10:30,478 --> 00:10:32,478
Beautiful.

40
00:10:32,502 --> 00:10:34,502
For you.

41
00:10:42,426 --> 00:10:44,426
Professor, take a look.

42
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,450
The warhorse genetic report is out.

43
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:49,474
It's a warm-blooded horse.

44
00:10:49,498 --> 00:10:51,498
No wonder, the size of the horse is so big.

45
00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:55,422
Wang Jing, what did you find?

46
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:58,446
Professor, some of these warhorses have been excavated.

47
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,470
Nose bridle section
made of precious metal.

48
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,494
The saddle is padded.

49
00:11:03,518 --> 00:11:04,518
My assumption

50
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:06,542
a number of cavalry generals
from the Western Han Dynasty.

51
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,566
Strange.

52
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:10,590
Totem carvings and mask reliefs
on this jade pendant

53
00:11:10,614 --> 00:11:13,414
was common in Hunnic culture.

54
00:11:13,438 --> 00:11:16,438
How is this precious Hunnic jade pendant
can be on the horse of the Han people?

55
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:21,462
It could be part of the loot.

56
00:11:21,486 --> 00:11:22,486
It's possible.

57
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,410
Maybe the jade pendant that was confiscated
by the Han army

58
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,434
or this war horse that was seized
by the Huns.

59
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:29,458
What if...

60
00:11:29,482 --> 00:11:31,482
Looks so similar.
/ What is similar?

61
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:33,506
I saw it in my dream

62
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,530
a very handsome man

63
00:11:35,554 --> 00:11:37,554
but you are not as good as him.

64
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:41,478
I also dreamed about a beautiful woman.

65
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:43,502
So it must be me.

66
00:11:43,526 --> 00:11:45,526
Do not deceive yourself.

67
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,450
Didn't you get something from him?

68
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:49,474
Take it there.

69
00:11:49,498 --> 00:11:51,498
Hurry, we don't have much time.

70
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:52,522
There.

71
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,446
Professor...
/ Keep working on the horse's legacy.

72
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,470
I'll take this back to the office.
/ That's it, professor.

73
00:11:57,494 --> 00:11:59,494
Oh yes.

74
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:00,518
Professor.

75
00:12:00,542 --> 00:12:02,542
Xinran is in order
bought you this gift

76
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:04,566
spent 8 hours traveling

77
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,590
back and forth to the town under the hill.

78
00:12:08,414 --> 00:12:10,414
Have you wasted all that work time?

79
00:12:13,438 --> 00:12:15,438
Just give me this.

80
00:12:15,462 --> 00:12:17,462
I'll transfer the money to you later.

81
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:20,486
If you don't overwork yourself

82
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,510
why do I even bother?
bought this for you.

83
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:24,534
Xinran, I also have something for you.

84
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:28,458
What's that?

85
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:30,482
Here, accept it.

86
00:12:30,506 --> 00:12:32,506
Professor, lunch is at the laboratory table.

87
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,530
Don't forget to eat!
/ I know.

88
00:12:41,454 --> 00:12:44,454
He gave you what?
/ Moreover besides

89
00:12:44,478 --> 00:12:46,478
lab test list.

90
00:12:46,502 --> 00:12:48,502
One way love is difficult.

91
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:50,526
He doesn't really care about me, right?

92
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,550
It's easy for women to chase men.

93
00:12:52,574 --> 00:12:54,574
How easy is it?
/ Look at you.

94
00:12:54,598 --> 00:12:56,598
You wear the same clothes every day.
Why not dress up a little?

95
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:59,422
Why do you have to dress up at the excavation site?

96
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:01,446
Apart from that, I don't think his thoughts are that shallow.

97
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:03,470
Oh yeah, don't buy me another face mask.

98
00:13:03,494 --> 00:13:06,494
When I put it on my face
it's really sticky, I feel uncomfortable.

99
00:13:06,518 --> 00:13:08,418
Hydration is good for the skin.

100
00:13:08,442 --> 00:13:10,442
Also, his friend Wang Jing
invite us to dinner tonight.

This jade pendant

103
00:13:38,514 --> 00:13:41,414
is a symbol of the holy place.

104
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:44,438
The greatest value of the holy place

105
00:13:45,462 --> 00:13:47,462
there is no treasure in it.

106
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:51,486
More precisely, it protects the land

107
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,410
holiest and most sublime in the world

108
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,434
who holds blessings

109
00:13:58,458 --> 00:14:00,458
our ancestors and gods.

110
00:14:00,482 --> 00:14:02,482
This will bestow blessings

111
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:04,506
to you.

112
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:19,430
Thank you, Great Shaman.

113
00:14:22,454 --> 00:14:23,454
I hope

114
00:14:23,478 --> 00:14:26,478
you will be my replacement.

115
00:15:00,402 --> 00:15:03,402
This is all to pray for father's health.

116
00:15:03,426 --> 00:15:06,426
Great Shaman, please take everything with you
to the holy place.,

117
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:09,450
Your Majesty the Crown Prince,
let's just say it's done.

118
00:15:28,474 --> 00:15:30,474
Go quickly!

119
00:15:30,498 --> 00:15:31,498
Road!

120
00:15:31,522 --> 00:15:33,522
Fast!

121
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:34,546
Come on!

122
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:36,570
Road!

123
00:15:39,494 --> 00:15:41,494
One by one.

124
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:42,518
Father.

125
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,542
Older brother.

126
00:15:44,566 --> 00:15:45,566
I...

127
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,490
attacked the Han and
took their gold and silk.

128
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,514
I slaughtered everyone in the city.

129
00:15:50,538 --> 00:15:52,538
I also beheaded

130
00:15:52,562 --> 00:15:54,562
general guarding the fort.

131
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:56,586
I'm taking this home
as a gift for father.

132
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,610
You gave extraordinary service this time.

133
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:01,434
As your father

134
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,458
What reward should I give you?

135
00:16:04,482 --> 00:16:06,482
Father, I don't want anything

136
00:16:06,506 --> 00:16:08,506
besides hoping father

137
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,530
allow Mengyun

138
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:12,554
become my wife.

139
00:16:12,578 --> 00:16:14,578
Mengyun?

140
00:16:16,402 --> 00:16:18,402
Father.

141
00:16:18,426 --> 00:16:20,426
Father.

142
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,450
Mengyun?

143
00:16:23,474 --> 00:16:27,474
Dad already gave him to your sister.

144
00:16:29,498 --> 00:16:31,498
Let's make it like this...

145
00:16:32,422 --> 00:16:35,422
all the Han women you brought back

146
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:37,446
Dad gifted them all to you.

147
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,470
What do you think?

148
00:16:43,494 --> 00:16:45,494
Yes.

149
00:16:45,518 --> 00:16:47,518
I followed what your father said.

150
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:49,542
Good.

151
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:50,566
Good.

152
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:52,590
My father is not well.

153
00:16:52,614 --> 00:16:54,614
Must rest now.

154
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,438
Now I'll excuse myself to go.

155
00:16:57,462 --> 00:16:59,462
Dad, rest.

156
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,486
Older brother.

157
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:15,410
You always slaughter the people you conquer.

158
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:17,434
That's too cruel.

159
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:20,458
He was afraid that the Han people would take revenge

160
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:22,482
it will bring disaster to our people.

161
00:17:24,406 --> 00:17:26,406
Thank you crown prince for the hint.

162
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:38,430
Mother, wait for me somewhere
which we agree on.

163
00:17:38,454 --> 00:17:40,454
I will come and follow mother.

164
00:17:40,478 --> 00:17:43,478
Let's just go now together.
/ I must avenge my father.

165
00:17:43,502 --> 00:17:45,502
Let me do it.

166
00:17:45,526 --> 00:17:47,526
Go now.

167
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,450
Be careful.

168
00:18:29,474 --> 00:18:31,474
My daughter.

169
00:18:39,498 --> 00:18:41,498
You killed my father.

170
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:46,422
I feel very sorry

171
00:18:47,446 --> 00:18:50,446
over events in the past

172
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,470
but what I did afterwards

173
00:18:57,494 --> 00:19:00,494
it's out of love for you and your mother.

174
00:19:09,418 --> 00:19:11,418
My time

175
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,442
it's finished.

176
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:16,466
Let's just do it.

177
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,490
Go now.

178
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:36,514
I can still intercede for you.

179
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:38,538
Think of your mother.

180
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:45,462
Anyone come here...

181
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,486
Father.

182
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:00,510
Please forgive me.

183
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:02,534
Older brother.

184
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:04,558
Father.

185
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:06,582
Why dad?

186
00:20:10,406 --> 00:20:11,406
Older brother.

187
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:14,430
This is your chosen crown prince.

188
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:16,454
Let him go.

189
00:20:16,478 --> 00:20:18,478
For dad's sake

190
00:20:18,502 --> 00:20:21,402
I fought risking my life.

191
00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:23,426
But he...

192
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,450
just died.

193
00:20:27,474 --> 00:20:30,474
You're a monster.

194
00:20:31,498 --> 00:20:33,498
My son...

195
00:20:33,522 --> 00:20:35,522
Formerly the Great Shaman

196
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:37,546
make predictions

197
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,570
he said I couldn't be king,

198
00:20:40,494 --> 00:20:43,494
but my father

199
00:20:43,518 --> 00:20:45,518
how can you believe predictions

200
00:20:45,542 --> 00:20:47,542
rather than believe me?

201
00:20:52,466 --> 00:20:54,466
I'm sorry, father.

202
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,490
I'm not a good son.

203
00:20:59,414 --> 00:21:01,414
However

204
00:21:01,438 --> 00:21:03,438
I do this

205
00:21:05,462 --> 00:21:07,462
for our tribe!

206
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:27,486
Murderer!

207
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,410
Bring here Mengyun!

Thank you, I appreciate it.

213
00:21:44,831 --> 00:21:47,431
Your great discovery
definitely worth celebrating.

214
00:21:47,455 --> 00:21:49,455
My company has developed a new game

215
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:51,479
entitled "Legend of the Han and Huns".

216
00:21:51,503 --> 00:21:52,503
Interesting.

217
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:53,527
When I was in Beijing

218
00:21:53,551 --> 00:21:55,551
I attended your lecture about
"The War Between the Han and the Huns".

219
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:57,575
Inspired me to develop this game.

220
00:21:57,599 --> 00:21:58,599
You are my mentor.

221
00:21:58,623 --> 00:22:00,623
Professor Fang.
/ Director Wang, how are you?

222
00:22:01,447 --> 00:22:03,447
Let me introduce you

00:22:03,471 --> 00:22:05,471
the boy who found a jade pendant,

00:22:05,495 --> 00:22:07,495
Baitula, our young friend.

225
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:09,519
Pleased to meet you.
/ Professor, how are you?

226
00:22:09,543 --> 00:22:10,543
Because of you

227
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:13,467
we found an official's horse

228
00:22:13,491 --> 00:22:15,491
under the rule of the Western Han dynasty,
General Huo Qubing.

229
00:22:15,515 --> 00:22:17,515
Thank You.
/ You're welcome.

230
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:20,439
He and his family handed over the jade pendant

231
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:22,463
to the government.

232
00:22:22,487 --> 00:22:24,487
What a commendable act.
/ I'll give you lots of 'likes'.

233
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,411

00:22:35,507 --> 00:22:38,407
in the museum for public exhibition.

238
00:22:38,431 --> 00:22:40,431
Professor, please be there on time.

239
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:41,455
Yes.

240
00:22:41,479 --> 00:22:43,479
Certain.

241
00:22:43,503 --> 00:22:46,403
Professor, I especially want to join
to your team to learn more.

242
00:22:46,427 --> 00:22:49,427
I want to hire you too
as a historical advisor for our game.

243
00:22:51,451 --> 00:22:53,451
So...

244
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,475
This is something I specially prepared

245
00:22:57,499 --> 00:22:59,499
for all to enjoy.

246
00:23:27,423 --> 00:23:29,423

248
00:25:38,471 --> 00:25:39,471
Miss,

249
00:25:39,495 --> 00:25:40,495
your sword dance

250
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:42,419
really amazing.

251
00:25:42,443 --> 00:25:45,443
I wonder what my bow is
holding it like that?

252
00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:50,467
Maybe not.

253
00:25:52,491 --> 00:25:54,491
Why are you here?

254
00:25:54,515 --> 00:25:57,415
My mother and I planned to meet here

255
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:59,439
but he hasn't come yet.

256
00:26:12,463 --> 00:26:14,463
Excuse me first.

257
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:19,487
Greetings Great Shaman.
/ Stand up.

258
00:26:22,411 --> 00:26:25,411
Huduna arrested your mother.
He used it for collateral,

259
00:26:27,435 --> 00:26:30,435
so you want to marry him.

260
00:26:30,459 --> 00:26:32,459
The last thing your mother would want

261
00:26:32,483 --> 00:26:35,483
that is, you don't repeat the tragedy.

262
00:26:36,407 --> 00:26:38,407
She is my mother.

263
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:40,431
I have to go back to save him.

264
00:26:42,455 --> 00:26:45,455
It seems I have chosen the right heir.

265
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:08,479
Are you okay?
/ Are you okay?

266
00:27:08,503 --> 00:27:11,403
Knight, Mengyun still has things to do
that must be resolved.

267
00:27:11,427 --> 00:27:13,427
I say goodbye now.

268
00:27:13,451 --> 00:27:15,451
Your kindness
Mengyun will always be remembered.

269
00:27:48,475 --> 00:27:50,475
You can actually sleep.
Everyone's gone.

270
00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:54,499
Professor, I had a dream.

271
00:27:54,523 --> 00:27:56,523
I dreamed about youth

272
00:27:56,547 --> 00:27:58,547
who is very similar to you.

273
00:27:58,571 --> 00:28:01,471
I dreamed too
about a very beautiful woman.

274
00:28:01,495 --> 00:28:03,495
The beauty in real life
so mad at you that he left.

275
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:05,519
Just leave the beauty in your dreams.

276
00:28:05,543 --> 00:28:07,543
He dresses up and dances for you

277
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:10,467
you even fell asleep.
Go meet him.

278
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:13,491
OK, I'm leaving now.

279
00:28:15,415 --> 00:28:17,415
Your jacket, it's cold out there.

280
00:28:17,439 --> 00:28:19,439
Yes, thank you, Professor.

281
00:28:26,463 --> 00:28:27,463
Xinran.

282
00:28:27,487 --> 00:28:28,487
Here you are apparently.

283
00:28:28,511 --> 00:28:30,511
Finally you woke up too.

284
00:28:33,435 --> 00:28:35,435
It's very cold here.

285
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:37,459
Xinran, I didn't expect you to be so good at dancing.

286
00:28:40,483 --> 00:28:42,483
Anu, you

287
00:28:42,507 --> 00:28:44,507
watched?
/ I watched.

288
00:28:44,531 --> 00:28:47,431
Of course, while snoring loudly?

289
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:54,455
Xinran,

290
00:28:54,479 --> 00:28:57,479
actually without glasses
and wear a skirt, you look very beautiful.

291
00:29:00,403 --> 00:29:02,403
You're so petty.

292
00:29:02,427 --> 00:29:05,427
Did you use the face mask I bought you?

293
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:08,451
Oh, that's a face mask?

294
00:29:09,475 --> 00:29:11,475
Are you looking at anything else?

295
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:15,499
Work has been busy lately.

296
00:29:15,523 --> 00:29:17,523
So... I forgot.

297
00:29:20,447 --> 00:29:24,447
I'm often curious,
apart from the work in your mind

298
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,471
can you think of something else?

299
00:29:26,495 --> 00:29:28,495
For example what?
/ Eg

300
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,519
think about the people around you.

301
00:29:30,543 --> 00:29:32,543
Fine, I'll pay more attention to that later.

302
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:35,467
The Huns repeatedly attacked mainland China

303
00:29:35,491 --> 00:29:38,491
since the Qing Dynasty.

304
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:42,415
During the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty,
Shandan Military Horse Farm was built.

305
00:29:42,439 --> 00:29:44,439
Since then we have had cavalry troops

306
00:29:44,463 --> 00:29:46,463
to fight against the Huns.

307
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:49,487
Shandan Military Horse Farm
founded by Huo Qubing, correct?

308
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:50,511
That's right.

309
00:29:50,535 --> 00:29:52,535
What you see now

310
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,559
model specimen of the Heavenly Horse.

311
00:29:59,483 --> 00:30:01,483
I'm still thinking
only a white horse is fit for a prince.

312
00:30:02,407 --> 00:30:04,407
Who named you Lei Zhen?

313
00:30:04,431 --> 00:30:06,431
My mother.

314
00:30:09,455 --> 00:30:10,455
What?

315
00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:12,479
It could be Lei Zhen.
(character in classic novel)

316
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:18,403
Do you know the term "champion"
become very widely known?

317
00:30:20,427 --> 00:30:22,427
Please explain.

318
00:30:22,451 --> 00:30:25,451
Let's hear the professor's opinion.
/ 17 year old Hu Qubing

319
00:30:25,475 --> 00:30:27,475
following his uncle Wei Qing

320
00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:29,499
fought with the Huns for the first time.

321
00:30:29,523 --> 00:30:31,523
Wei Qing only gave him 800 horse troops.

322
00:30:31,547 --> 00:30:33,547
He went deep into enemy territory

323
00:30:33,571 --> 00:30:35,571
straight to the rear of the Huns...

Tell me where is the holy place?

349

The Han Army is coming!

372
00:42:27,447 --> 00:42:30,447
who surrendered to the Han Palace

373
00:42:30,471 --> 00:42:32,471
will be forgiven!

375
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:48,419
My father was a Hun general
who pledged allegiance to Han.

376
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:52,443
King Tudie invades the city
under his care,

377
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:55,467
slaughtered everyone including my father.

378
00:42:56,491 --> 00:42:59,491
To ensure my safety

379
00:43:00,415 --> 00:43:02,415
my father surrendered himself to King Tudie.

380
00:43:03,439 --> 00:43:06,439
Mom just wants me to live happily.

381
00:43:08,463 --> 00:43:10,463
The best time of my life

382
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:13,487
namely when the two of us looked for dandelions.

383
00:43:14,411 --> 00:43:16,411
But now he's gone.

384
00:43:19,435 --> 00:43:21,435
Mengyun,

385
00:43:21,459 --> 00:43:23,459
do you want to go back to the garrison with me?

386
00:43:23,483 --> 00:43:25,483
Help us train horses for battle.

387
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:28,407
Are you there?

388
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:30,431
Certain.

389
00:43:35,455 --> 00:43:38,455
Mother, I can finally return to the land of Han.

390
00:43:45,479 --> 00:43:47,479
Zhao Zhan, Hua Jun,

391
00:43:47,503 --> 00:43:50,403
you two have gone through hardships
and brought home all these stallions

392
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:53,427
which will strengthen our cavalry.

393
00:43:54,451 --> 00:43:57,451
You have done it
good service to the Han Dynasty.

394
00:43:57,475 --> 00:44:00,475
Your efforts will be rewarded.
/ We only carry out our obligations.

395

00:45:43,467 --> 00:45:45,467
Sis,

403
00:45:45,491 --> 00:45:47,491
I got a letter from home.
Dad found a job for me

404
00:45:47,515 --> 00:45:49,515
in the prime minister's office.

405
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:51,539
When this battle is over
I will work there.

406
00:45:53,463 --> 00:45:55,463
Maybe you too.

407
00:45:55,487 --> 00:45:57,487
3 generations of your family
had served in the imperial court

408
00:45:57,511 --> 00:45:59,511
and you're the only son in the family.

409
00:45:59,535 --> 00:46:02,435
People say there must be one
Don't travel far to accompany your parents.

410
00:46:20,459 --> 00:46:23,459
Sis, have you ever thought about starting a family?

411
00:46:32,483 --> 00:46:34,483
Family?

412
00:46:34,507 --> 00:46:36,507
I didn't know what a family was since I was little.

413
00:46:36,531 --> 00:46:39,431
I was born on the border.

414
00:46:39,455 --> 00:46:41,455
Huns,

415
00:46:41,479 --> 00:46:44,479
destroyed my family.

416
00:46:44,503 --> 00:46:46,503
As long as the Hun military threat remains

417
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,527
no need to discuss starting a family.

418
00:46:48,551 --> 00:46:50,551
Of course.

419
00:46:50,575 --> 00:46:53,475
Eliminating such threats is a top priority.

420
00:47:01,499 --> 00:47:03,499
The general comes.

421
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:06,423
General.
/ General

422
00:47:06,447 --> 00:47:09,447
The general has bred
a good war horse for this country.

423
00:47:09,471 --> 00:47:12,471
We are now too
already had its own cavalry regiment.

424
00:47:13,495 --> 00:47:16,495
The Huns repeatedly invaded our Han territory.

425
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:18,519
We are Han soldiers.

426
00:47:18,543 --> 00:47:21,443
Constant Hun harassment

427
00:47:21,467 --> 00:47:23,467
must be eradicated!

428
00:47:23,491 --> 00:47:25,491
I'm sure later

429
00:47:25,515 --> 00:47:27,515
in this country of China

430
00:47:28,439 --> 00:47:29,739
there will be peace and prosperity,

431
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:32,440
people live and work in peace
and happy.

432
00:47:46,464 --> 00:47:48,964
Huo Qubing built his fame
in this battle.

433
00:47:48,965 --> 00:47:50,765
with military achievements
which is incomparable.

434
00:47:50,766 --> 00:47:53,466
Emperor Wu nicknamed him
"Duke Champion".

435
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:55,490
That's how the term "champion" became widely known.

436
00:47:56,414 --> 00:47:58,414
Although Huo Qubing's life was short

437
00:47:58,438 --> 00:48:01,438
he repeatedly raises
heavy losses to the Huns.

438
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:04,462
For the Han Dynasty,
he formed a superior cavalry force.

439
00:48:04,486 --> 00:48:06,486
Then, the Han Dynasty

440
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:08,410
able to open the Hexi Corridor,

441
00:48:08,434 --> 00:48:12,434
and establishing the Protectorate of the Western Regions.

442
00:48:12,458 --> 00:48:14,458
Huo laid the foundation
for all that happened.

443
00:48:15,482 --> 00:48:17,482
Professor, general riding a white horse

444
00:48:17,506 --> 00:48:19,506
doesn't she look like Wang Jing?

445
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,530
Looks like Wang Jing?

446
00:48:24,454 --> 00:48:26,454
Not really.

447
00:48:27,478 --> 00:48:30,478
There is only Wang Jing in your mind.
/ Professor. / Not me...

448
00:48:31,402 --> 00:48:33,402
This is really interesting.

449
00:48:33,426 --> 00:48:35,426
There are lots of gold pieces.

450
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,450
It's a gold horse shoe piece.

451
00:48:37,474 --> 00:48:39,474
tell me

452
00:48:39,498 --> 00:48:42,498
about the gold donated from Han

453
00:48:42,522 --> 00:48:44,522
Where do the Huns think they kept it?

454
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:45,546
It's noted that

455
00:48:45,570 --> 00:48:48,470
Huo Qubing once confiscated it
golden statue of the Huns' god worship.

456
00:48:48,494 --> 00:48:49,494
Is it possible

457
00:48:49,518 --> 00:48:51,518
if it's gold and treasure

458
00:48:51,542 --> 00:48:53,542
sent to the holy place of the Huns for worship?

459
00:48:54,466 --> 00:48:57,466
Until now, there are no holy places for the Huns
that was found.

460
00:48:57,490 --> 00:48:58,490
However,

461
00:48:58,514 --> 00:49:01,414
because you develop games
Please just use your creativity.

462
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,438
I definitely want the elements
the treasure hunt was added

463
00:49:04,462 --> 00:49:06,462
only if you can guide us

464
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:08,486
found the holy place of the Huns

465
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:10,510
that would be cool.

466
00:49:11,434 --> 00:49:13,434
Very difficult.

467
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:15,458
It's so beautiful.

468
00:49:15,482 --> 00:49:17,482
Your taste is quite good.

469
00:49:17,506 --> 00:49:18,506
For this bracelet

470
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:20,530
we copy the exact design and size of the original

471
00:49:20,554 --> 00:49:21,554
to make gold replica souvenirs.

472
00:49:21,578 --> 00:49:23,578
Obviously the value for money is great.

473
00:49:24,402 --> 00:49:26,402
This seems right for me,

474
00:49:26,426 --> 00:49:27,426
It is not like that?

475
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,450
Gold prices have risen a lot recently.

476
00:49:38,474 --> 00:49:40,474
Professor, I have a good friend

477
00:49:40,498 --> 00:49:43,498
who is a shamanic scholar.
It just so happened that he had just returned to China.

478
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:46,422
He knew shamanic culture very well
and Hun history.

479
00:49:46,446 --> 00:49:48,446
He invited us to visit him.

480
00:49:48,470 --> 00:49:50,470
We can talk about the totem on the jade pendant.

481
00:49:50,494 --> 00:49:52,494
We can certainly compare notes.
/ I'll schedule a time.

482
00:49:52,518 --> 00:49:54,518
That's fine.
/ Okay.

483
00:49:54,542 --> 00:49:56,542
What's next?
/ Let's drink tea.

484
00:49:56,566 --> 00:49:57,566
Good.

485
00:49:57,590 --> 00:49:59,590
Let's drink tea.
/ You go first.

486
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,414
Gold is expensive.
Just forget it.

487
00:50:02,438 --> 00:50:04,438
Come on.

488
00:50:04,462 --> 00:50:06,462
Yes, too expensive.

489
00:50:19,486 --> 00:50:21,486
What's wrong?

490
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:23,410
Professor.

491
00:50:23,434 --> 00:50:25,434
Is this mask okay?

492
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:27,458
Xinran taught me how to wear it.

493
00:50:27,482 --> 00:50:29,482
The wetness and stickiness felt uncomfortable.

494
00:50:29,506 --> 00:50:32,406
Professor, may I leave?
/ Hydration is good for your skin.

495
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:33,430
Understand?

496
00:50:33,454 --> 00:50:35,454
What do you want from me this early in the morning?

497
00:50:36,478 --> 00:50:38,478
I've drawn with Artificial-Intelligence.

498
00:50:38,502 --> 00:50:40,502
This is the woman in my dreams.

499
00:50:42,426 --> 00:50:44,426
He looks a lot like...
/ Like who?

500
00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:46,450
...the woman I saw in my dream.

501
00:50:46,474 --> 00:50:48,474
Professor, how is that possible?

502
00:50:48,498 --> 00:50:50,498
The same person appears in our dreams.

503
00:50:50,522 --> 00:50:53,422
Maybe because we're still working on it
that jade pendant,

504
00:50:53,446 --> 00:50:56,446
do the same research,
that's why our dreams are the same.

505
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:01,470
Professor, why do I feel like they are...

506
00:51:01,494 --> 00:51:04,494
my memories in another time and space?

507
00:51:04,518 --> 00:51:07,418
Dreams are more than just
working of the brain's memory system.

508
00:51:07,442 --> 00:51:09,442
In our dormant state, actually

509
00:51:09,466 --> 00:51:11,466
the brain's ability to create also functions,

510
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:15,490
that's why fusion dreams
fantasy and reality.

511
00:51:17,414 --> 00:51:20,414
Dreams are not reality.
We can still return to the real world.

512
00:51:21,438 --> 00:51:23,438
Okay Professor, I have to go back.

513
00:51:23,462 --> 00:51:25,462
I have something to do.

514
00:51:25,486 --> 00:51:27,486
Where are you going?
/ I want to look for Xinran.

515
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:31,410
Man...

516
00:51:31,434 --> 00:51:33,434
have to be more initiative.
/ Okay.

517
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:36,458
Your mask.

518
00:51:40,482 --> 00:51:42,482
Professor, I'll just put it here.

519
00:52:09,406 --> 00:52:12,406
No need to clean, thanks.

520
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,430
I'm Wang Jing.

521
00:52:16,454 --> 00:52:18,454
What is it?

522
00:52:19,478 --> 00:52:21,478
I brought something for you.

523
00:52:27,402 --> 00:52:29,402
No, no, no.

524
00:52:29,426 --> 00:52:31,426
Wait a moment!

525
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:34,450
I'll be done in a moment.

526
00:52:38,474 --> 00:52:40,474
O.

527
00:52:42,498 --> 00:52:44,498
O.
/ Oh, hi.

528
00:52:45,422 --> 00:52:47,422
I brought something for you.

529
00:52:47,446 --> 00:52:49,446
What?

530
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:51,470
Here.

531
00:52:54,494 --> 00:52:56,494
This time, it's not a lab test list, right?

532
00:53:00,418 --> 00:53:02,418
Gold prices have risen a lot recently.

533
00:53:02,442 --> 00:53:04,442
I've invested money.

534
00:53:05,466 --> 00:53:07,466
What is this for me?

535
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:16,490
I'll go now.
/ Just a moment!

536
00:53:18,414 --> 00:53:19,414
I...

537
00:53:19,438 --> 00:53:21,438
make coffee.

538
00:53:21,462 --> 00:53:23,462
Do you want to?

539
00:53:23,486 --> 00:53:25,486
No, I had coffee this morning.

540
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:26,510
Thanks.

541
00:53:26,534 --> 00:53:28,534
I also have tea.

542
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:31,458
Black tea, green tea and Oolong tea.

543
00:53:31,482 --> 00:53:33,482
I have it all.

544
00:53:34,406 --> 00:53:36,406
Tea is not good for sleeping at night.

545
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:38,430
Fruit?
Soft drinks? Biscuits?

546
00:53:50,454 --> 00:53:52,454
The prisoner has been taken!

547
00:54:11,478 --> 00:54:13,478
Bring it on.

548
00:54:21,402 --> 00:54:23,402
Let me add seasoning.

549
00:54:27,426 --> 00:54:28,426
It smells good.

550
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:30,450
Mengyun.

551
00:54:30,474 --> 00:54:32,474
There's something I want to show you.

552
00:54:34,498 --> 00:54:36,498
What's that?

553
00:54:48,422 --> 00:54:50,422
This is so beautiful.

554
00:54:50,446 --> 00:54:52,446
Do you like it?

555
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:56,470
This is my family's heirloom.
I wanted to give it to you before I went into battle.

556
00:54:59,494 --> 00:55:01,494
I can't accept something so precious.

557
00:55:04,418 --> 00:55:07,418
You have to give me this
to someone you consider most precious.

558
00:55:16,442 --> 00:55:18,442
Can you save it?

559
00:55:18,466 --> 00:55:21,466
When I return from victory,
give it back to me

560
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,490
This precious thing
cannot fall into the hands of the enemy.

561
00:55:26,414 --> 00:55:28,414
General,

562
00:55:28,438 --> 00:55:30,438
Thank you for saving my son.

563
00:55:33,462 --> 00:55:35,462
Huajun!

564
00:55:35,486 --> 00:55:37,486
Let's eat!
Soon we will leave!

565
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:44,410
Let's drink.

566
00:55:44,434 --> 00:55:46,434

Please wait here.

Mr. Herbert, the guests have arrived.

594
00:58:34,406 --> 00:58:36,406
Please, sit.
/Mr. Herbert,

595
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,430
Archaeologist, Professor Fang.
Wang Jing and Xinran.

596
00:58:38,454 --> 00:58:40,454
O.

597
00:58:41,478 --> 00:58:43,478
Hello, Mr. Herbert.

598
00:58:43,502 --> 00:58:45,502
At the excavation site,
we found this jade pendant.

599
00:58:46,426 --> 00:58:48,426
I was told that you are an expert in shamanism.

600
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:50,450
I hope you can explain this more.

601
00:58:53,474 --> 00:58:55,474
Thank You.

602
00:59:17,498 --> 00:59:19,498
In shamanic culture

603
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:21,522
this is the oldest seven star god totem.

604
00:59:22,446 --> 00:59:24,446
Since the jade pendant was unearthed

605
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:27,470
every night the professor and I
dreaming of the same person.

606
00:59:27,494 --> 00:59:29,494
But not me,

607
00:59:29,518 --> 00:59:31,518
Besides that...

608
00:59:31,542 --> 00:59:32,542
There are many objects

609
00:59:32,566 --> 00:59:35,466
that allows us to communicate
with the dead,

610
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:38,490
even with gods.

611
00:59:39,414 --> 00:59:41,414
This shaman's staff

612
00:59:41,438 --> 00:59:44,438
is an antique object that I collect
several years ago in Europe.

613
00:59:45,462 --> 00:59:47,462
Crystals in this wand
also brought me

614
00:59:47,486 --> 00:59:50,486
Same experience as you.

615
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:54,410
similarity,

616
00:59:54,434 --> 00:59:57,434
Jade is an intermediary for communication with the gods.

617
00:59:58,458 --> 01:00:00,458
All things have a spirit.

618
01:00:00,482 --> 01:00:02,482
When life ends

619
01:00:02,506 --> 01:00:04,506
the spirit is still there.

620
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:07,430
Jade carries the spirits of the dead.

621
01:00:07,454 --> 01:00:09,454
Using dreams as an intermediary

622
01:00:09,478 --> 01:00:12,478
to form a connection

623
01:00:12,502 --> 01:00:14,502
with the living.

624
01:00:15,426 --> 01:00:18,426
Professor, let's meditate together.

625
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:20,450
Maybe you'll be able to find it later

626
01:00:20,474 --> 01:00:22,474
the answer you are looking for.

627
01:00:28,498 --> 01:00:30,498
Professor,

628
01:00:30,522 --> 01:00:32,522
meditation.

629
01:00:38,446 --> 01:00:41,446
Feel the energy flowing in your brain.

630
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:44,470
Translucent the boundaries of space and time.

631
01:00:44,494 --> 01:00:47,494
Expand your mind.

632
01:00:48,418 --> 01:00:51,418
Increase spiritual wisdom.

633
01:01:04,417 --> 01:01:06,417
Zzz...

634
01:01:06,442 --> 01:01:08,442
Have you fallen asleep?

635
01:01:26,466 --> 01:01:27,466
General,

636
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:30,490
we have conquered 5 Hun tribes in 6 days,

637
01:01:30,514 --> 01:01:32,514
our wounded soldiers
it took several days to recover

638
01:01:32,538 --> 01:01:33,838
before they could continue fighting.

639
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,839
General...

640
01:01:38,463 --> 01:01:39,463
General...

641
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:41,487
You rest.

642
01:01:42,411 --> 01:01:44,411
Yes.

643
01:01:50,435 --> 01:01:52,435
Briefing!

644
01:01:57,459 --> 01:02:00,459
General, Huduna combined forces with
Xiutu as well as the Zhelan tribe

645
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:02,483
near Mount Gaolan in front of us,

646
01:02:02,507 --> 01:02:04,507
a large army had gathered.

647
01:02:05,431 --> 01:02:07,431
How many troops are there?

648
01:02:07,455 --> 01:02:09,455
10,000 troops.

649
01:02:09,479 --> 01:02:12,479
General, we are outnumbered.

650
01:02:12,503 --> 01:02:14,503
Best to avoid
face to face

651
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:16,527
and take a detour.
/ General,

652
01:02:16,551 --> 01:02:19,451
We are 1000 miles away from the land of Han.

653
01:02:19,475 --> 01:02:21,475
We have to pass Mount Gaolan

654
01:02:21,499 --> 01:02:25,499
if we rotate
there is Qilian Mountain in the south,

655
01:02:25,523 --> 01:02:28,423
if you go north
we will get to Hun territory.

656
01:02:34,447 --> 01:02:37,447
When someone walks in the valley of death

657
01:02:37,471 --> 01:02:39,471
he won't lose anything anymore.

658
01:02:39,495 --> 01:02:42,495
Convey this command.
We meet again here.

659
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:44,519
Soldiers and horses

660
01:02:44,543 --> 01:02:46,543
must eat and get enough rest.

661
01:02:46,567 --> 01:02:48,567
Reinforcements must be carried out day and night.

662
01:02:48,591 --> 01:02:50,591
Order accepted!
/ Order received!

663
01:02:54,415 --> 01:02:56,415
We already know

664
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:59,439
The Hun troops were not shy about fleeing

665
01:02:59,463 --> 01:03:02,463
or withdraw when experiencing defeat.

666
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:05,487
We use the ring hilt sword regiment

667
01:03:05,511 --> 01:03:07,511
to break their formation

668
01:03:07,535 --> 01:03:09,535
to cause as many casualties as possible.

669
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:11,559
This is our best tactic to win.

670
01:03:11,583 --> 01:03:13,583
Zaho Zhan, ring hilt sword regiment

671
01:03:13,607 --> 01:03:15,607
will be under your command.
Remember,

672
01:03:16,431 --> 01:03:18,431
Huduna must be paralyzed.

673
01:03:19,455 --> 01:03:21,455
Order accepted!

674
01:03:26,479 --> 01:03:28,479
Soldiers!

675
01:03:28,503 --> 01:03:30,503
Anyone who is the only son in his family

676
01:03:30,527 --> 01:03:32,527
proceed!

677
01:03:37,451 --> 01:03:39,451
Whoever has children and wives,

678
01:03:39,475 --> 01:03:41,475
proceed!

679
01:03:47,499 --> 01:03:49,499
The rest

680
01:03:49,523 --> 01:03:52,423
will be my member in
ring hilt sword regiment!

681
01:03:53,447 --> 01:03:56,447
In this battle,
ring hilt sword regiment under my command,

682
01:03:56,471 --> 01:03:58,471
will be the first to attack.

683
01:03:58,495 --> 01:03:59,895
We face a deadly enemy.

684
01:03:59,896 --> 01:04:02,496
The moment of life and death for the Han army had arrived.

685
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:06,420
I want to join the ring hilt sword regiment.

686
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:09,444
We are soldiers defending our homeland.

687
01:04:10,468 --> 01:04:12,468
We fight on the battlefield.

688
01:04:12,492 --> 01:04:15,492
We are not afraid of death
will follow the general until our death!

689
01:04:15,516 --> 01:04:28,416
Following the general until our death!

690
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,440
Let's go!

691
01:04:48,464 --> 01:04:50,464
This jade pendant

692
01:04:50,488 --> 01:04:52,488
the Great Shaman gave me
for my safety.

693
01:04:53,412 --> 01:04:55,412
I want to give this to the general.

694
01:04:59,436 --> 01:05:01,436
Most of my life
I am a soldier.

695
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:03,460
Protecting our country and people
is my only wish.

696
01:05:04,484 --> 01:05:06,484
Please keep this jade pendant

697
01:05:06,508 --> 01:05:09,408
near you.
Hopefully that will protect you.

698
01:05:09,432 --> 01:05:11,432
The general's wish will definitely be granted.

699
01:05:12,456 --> 01:05:14,456
This jade is like my sincere heart.

700
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,480
I just hope it can
get rid of evil for the general.

701
01:05:17,504 --> 01:05:19,504
General's safety

702
01:05:19,528 --> 01:05:21,528
was Mengyu's wish.

703
01:06:06,452 --> 01:06:08,452

We are outnumbered in this battle.

707
01:07:00,448 --> 01:07:02,448
Death hovers over us.
Better to die in victory

708
01:07:02,472 --> 01:07:05,472
rather than live in shame.

709

01:12:26,496 --> 01:12:28,496
Go away from here!

735
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:38,420
Retreat!

736
01:12:39,444 --> 01:12:41,444
Come on!

737
01:12:44,468 --> 01:12:46,468
Get in position!

738
01:17:04,492 --> 01:17:06,492
General!

739
01:17:06,516 --> 01:17:08,516
Attack them!

740
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:21,440
Let's go!

741
01:17:42,464 --> 01:17:43,464
Medical!

742
01:17:43,488 --> 01:17:45,488
Medical!

743
01:17:45,512 --> 01:17:46,512
General!

744
01:17:46,536 --> 01:17:48,536
Fast!

745
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,560
Fast!

746
01:17:52,484 --> 01:17:54,484
Is General okay?
/ I'm fine.

747
01:17:54,508 --> 01:17:56,508
Medical, quick!

748
01:18:07,432 --> 01:18:09,432
Let me check.

749
01:18:12,456 --> 01:18:14,456
He's poisoned.
Take off the armor.

750
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:33,480
The wound is deep.

751
01:18:33,504 --> 01:18:35,504
I have to immediately bandage your wound.

752
01:18:35,528 --> 01:18:36,528
I'm okay.

753
01:18:36,552 --> 01:18:38,552
I'll take potions and powders.

754
01:18:40,476 --> 01:18:41,476
Hang in there.

755
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:43,500
I'll suck out the poison.

756
01:19:10,424 --> 01:19:12,424
This is a special poison made by the Huns.

757
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:15,448
Only the Great Shaman has the antidote.

758
01:19:15,472 --> 01:19:18,472
I only can
stop the spread of the poison.

759
01:19:19,496 --> 01:19:21,496
I immediately looked for the Great Shaman.

760
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:32,420
This pendant

761
01:19:33,444 --> 01:19:35,444
you take it.

762
01:19:35,468 --> 01:19:37,468
Let this be

763
01:19:39,492 --> 01:19:41,492
protect your safety.

764
01:19:56,416 --> 01:19:58,416
I'm counting on you.

765
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,440
General, don't move
or your wound could open.

766
01:20:10,464 --> 01:20:12,464
I understand.

767
01:20:12,488 --> 01:20:14,488
Sis.

768
01:20:14,512 --> 01:20:16,512
Sis.

769
01:20:16,536 --> 01:20:18,536
I almost can't
last much longer.

770
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:21,460
You stay with him to protect him.

771
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:23,484
Forgive me.

772
01:20:23,508 --> 01:20:25,508
Sis, don't talk anymore.

773
01:20:25,532 --> 01:20:27,532
I will try to protect him

774
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:29,556
and bring it back
the antidote is to cure you.

775
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:42,480
Lei Zhen, can you still do it
go through this with me?

776
01:20:52,404 --> 01:20:54,404
I will keep you company.

779
01:21:57,476 --> 01:22:00,476
definitely his holy place.
Outsiders are prohibited from entering.

780
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,500
Please wait here.
I will be right back.

781
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:17,424
Lei Zhen.

782
01:22:17,448 --> 01:22:19,448
Lei Zhen!

783
01:22:47,472 --> 01:22:50,472
Lei Zhen, you have
carry out your duties well.

784
01:23:06,496 --> 01:23:08,496
Great Shaman, please give me the antidote!

785
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:11,420
Son,

786
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:13,444
stay here with me.

787
01:23:14,468 --> 01:23:17,468
You two
not destined for each other in this life.

788
01:23:21,492 --> 01:23:23,492
My only wish is that he stays alive.

789
01:23:30,416 --> 01:23:33,416
This antidote is just enough
to save one person.

790
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,440
What do you feel?
/ I've brought the antidote.

791
01:24:28,464 --> 01:24:30,464
I'll be fine soon.

792
01:24:31,488 --> 01:24:33,488
You come back now
give this antidote to the general.

793
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:45,412
How about you?

794
01:24:47,436 --> 01:24:49,436
The Great Shaman needs me here.

795
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:57,460
Huajun.

796
01:24:58,484 --> 01:25:00,484
I'll return this bracelet to you.

797
01:25:02,408 --> 01:25:04,408
I can't help saving it anymore.

798
01:25:18,432 --> 01:25:20,432
Thank you for being kind to me.

799
01:25:46,456 --> 01:25:48,456
You have to help me
take this to the general

800
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:50,480
to save his life.
Do you understand?

801
01:25:59,444 --> 01:26:01,444
You have to get there before sunrise.

802
01:26:01,468 --> 01:26:03,468
Goodbye!

803
01:26:49,492 --> 01:26:51,492
Because of that man
you gave up your own life.

804
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,416
Is it worth it?

805
01:27:02,440 --> 01:27:05,440
I know you're here to meet
The Great Shaman asked for an antidote.

806
01:27:06,464 --> 01:27:08,464
Say

807
01:27:08,488 --> 01:27:10,488
where is the holy place?

808
01:27:16,412 --> 01:27:18,412
Today I have to avenge my mother.

809
01:27:19,436 --> 01:27:21,436
Get him!

810
01:28:36,460 --> 01:28:38,460
Mengyun

811
01:28:38,484 --> 01:28:41,484
Don't die for another man.

812
01:28:42,408 --> 01:28:45,408
If you want to die,
you can only die in my hands!

813
01:29:33,432 --> 01:29:35,432
Holy place

814
01:29:35,456 --> 01:29:37,456
where's that?

815
01:30:35,480 --> 01:30:47,280
GIVE CONTINUOUS SUPPORT AT

816
01:33:32,404 --> 01:33:34,404
Huajun!

817
01:33:35,428 --> 01:33:37,428
Huajun!

818
01:33:37,452 --> 01:33:39,452
Huajun!

819
01:33:39,476 --> 01:33:41,476
Huajun!

820
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,400
Quickly give this antidote to the general.

821
01:33:46,424 --> 01:33:48,424
Ready!

822
01:33:48,448 --> 01:33:50,448
Go now!

823
01:33:50,472 --> 01:33:52,472
Let's save the general!

824
01:33:54,496 --> 01:33:56,496
Let's save the general!

825
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:01,420
<i>Sis, I will definitely come back
bring the antidote to save you.</i>

826
01:34:02,444 --> 01:34:06,444
<i>Mengyun, I kept my promise to you.</i>

827
01:34:53,468 --> 01:34:57,468
Peace to our homeland
forged by heroes!

828
01:35:38,492 --> 01:35:40,492
General!

829
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:56,416
Huajun!

830
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:00,440
Huajun!

831
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:05,464
Mr. Herbert,
Is there a glacier ahead there?

832
01:37:05,488 --> 01:37:07,488
Yes.

833
01:37:07,512 --> 01:37:10,412
There are indeed 10,000 year old glaciers.

834
01:37:10,436 --> 01:37:13,436
Professor, I think it was
I dream of that place.

835
01:37:23,460 --> 01:37:25,460
Can we go there and see it?

836
01:37:25,484 --> 01:37:27,484
If you want to go there

837
01:37:27,508 --> 01:37:29,508
I can arrange some local guides

838
01:37:29,532 --> 01:37:31,532
to take you there.

839
01:37:31,556 --> 01:37:33,456
Possible

840
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:35,480
you can find the answer you are looking for.

841
01:37:35,504 --> 01:37:37,504
Thank you, Mr. Herbert.

842
01:37:43,428 --> 01:37:44,428
Let's go.

843
01:37:44,452 --> 01:37:46,452
Professor.

844
01:37:46,476 --> 01:37:48,476
Lei Zhen!
/ I dream too.

845
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:50,500
I dreamed about Wang Jing and me

846
01:37:50,524 --> 01:37:52,524
surfing at Sanya beach.

847
01:37:52,548 --> 01:37:53,848
I'm wearing a bikini.
/ Let's go.

848
01:37:53,849 --> 01:37:55,449
Me too...

849
01:37:55,473 --> 01:37:56,473
Wang Jing?

850
01:37:56,497 --> 01:37:58,497
Why are we going?

851
01:37:59,421 --> 01:38:00,421
My feet are tingling.

852
01:38:00,445 --> 01:38:01,445
Are you dreaming too?

853
01:38:01,469 --> 01:38:03,469
I just fell asleep, then you woke me up.
/ Am I in your dreams?

854
01:38:03,493 --> 01:38:05,493
No.
/ Am I in Wang Jing's dream?

855
01:38:36,417 --> 01:38:38,417
Professor, there's a big cave up ahead!

856
01:38:38,441 --> 01:38:40,441
Let's go there!

857
01:38:59,465 --> 01:39:01,465
Come here, we're getting ready.

858
01:39:01,489 --> 01:39:03,489
Wang Jing said
you look beautiful when you wear a skirt

859
01:39:03,513 --> 01:39:06,413
but this is too much.
/ I'm not cold.

860
01:39:06,437 --> 01:39:08,437
Apart from that, there are no organs in the legs.

861
01:39:10,461 --> 01:39:12,461
Let's take a look inside!

862
01:39:14,485 --> 01:39:17,485
This cave is really big.
Is there danger inside?

863
01:39:32,409 --> 01:39:34,409
Come on.

864
01:39:43,433 --> 01:39:45,433
This subglacial bubble
it's all methane

865
01:39:45,457 --> 01:39:47,457
very flammable.

866
01:39:47,481 --> 01:39:49,481
Beware of fire explosions.
/ Good.

867
01:39:51,405 --> 01:39:52,405
Wait for me!

868
01:39:52,429 --> 01:39:54,429
Everyone, be careful!

869
01:39:54,453 --> 01:39:56,453
Professor,

870
01:39:56,477 --> 01:39:58,477
can we rest first?

871
01:40:00,401 --> 01:40:02,401
This is a dead end.

872
01:40:04,425 --> 01:40:06,425
Let's just go back.

873
01:40:42,449 --> 01:40:44,449
Wang Jing, stand up quickly!

874
01:40:44,473 --> 01:40:46,473
Help me!

875
01:40:46,497 --> 01:40:48,497
Are you okay?

876
01:40:53,421 --> 01:40:55,421
My waist!

877
01:40:56,445 --> 01:40:58,445
My waist hurts!

878
01:41:08,469 --> 01:41:10,469
What is this place?

879
01:41:32,493 --> 01:41:35,493
We managed to find gold...

880
01:41:35,517 --> 01:41:37,517
This is so beautiful!

881
01:41:37,541 --> 01:41:38,541
Wang Jing, hurry!
/ Yes, hang on.

882
01:41:38,565 --> 01:41:40,465
Come here!

883
01:41:40,489 --> 01:41:42,489
So, the ancient Huns
it really is a holy place.

884
01:42:08,413 --> 01:42:10,413
Professor, look at that,

885
01:42:12,437 --> 01:42:14,437
seven star god totem on jade pendant.

886
01:42:18,461 --> 01:42:21,461
Professor, there must be a secret vault
at some place

887
01:42:21,485 --> 01:42:23,485
or hidden mechanisms
for you to find.

888
01:42:23,509 --> 01:42:25,409
The game has gotten to you.

889
01:42:25,433 --> 01:42:27,433
You think by pressing the button on the wall

890
01:42:27,457 --> 01:42:29,457
the top and bottom will open,

891
01:42:29,481 --> 01:42:31,481
Will your left and right rumble?

892
01:42:32,405 --> 01:42:34,405
Professor,

893
01:42:34,429 --> 01:42:36,429
what are you chanting?

894
01:42:36,453 --> 01:42:37,453
Let's go.

895
01:42:37,477 --> 01:42:40,477
We'll discuss it again when we get back.
/ Professor!

896
01:42:45,401 --> 01:42:47,401
Do I look familiar?

897
01:42:48,425 --> 01:42:50,425
Mr. Herbert?

898
01:42:54,449 --> 01:42:56,449
You were quite handsome when you were young, weren't you?

899
01:43:02,473 --> 01:43:05,473
The reason I came here is
to take back my property.

900
01:43:06,497 --> 01:43:08,497
Don't step on it.
/ Don't step on it!

901
01:43:08,521 --> 01:43:11,421
Holy texts on the wall
That should help, right?

902
01:43:12,445 --> 01:43:14,445
Humans are driven by greed

903
01:43:14,469 --> 01:43:16,469
plunder resources.
They kill other people.

904
01:43:16,493 --> 01:43:18,493
Human civilization is constantly being destroyed
and rebuilt.

905
01:43:18,517 --> 01:43:20,517
Destroyed and rebuilt.

906
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:23,441
A man who loves peace and freedom

907
01:43:23,465 --> 01:43:26,465
build beneath the earth's surface

908
01:43:26,489 --> 01:43:29,489
a utopia of peace and equality
with mutual respect

909
01:43:32,413 --> 01:43:34,413
where only a good heart can enter.

910
01:43:36,437 --> 01:43:38,437
Those who force their way in with greed

911
01:43:38,461 --> 01:43:40,461
will definitely be punished.

912
01:43:43,485 --> 01:43:45,485
A professor indeed

913
01:43:45,509 --> 01:43:47,509
that makes nonsense
sounds so serious.

914
01:43:49,433 --> 01:43:51,433
However, professor

915
01:43:51,457 --> 01:43:54,457
I want to be punished.

916
01:43:54,481 --> 01:43:56,481
How do I enter?
/ Boss.

917
01:43:56,505 --> 01:43:58,505
Take a look.

918
01:43:58,529 --> 01:44:01,429
There is a large space behind this wall.

919
01:44:05,453 --> 01:44:07,453
Thank you, professor.

920
01:44:08,477 --> 01:44:10,477
We finally found it!

921
01:44:10,501 --> 01:44:12,501
Vincent,

922
01:44:12,525 --> 01:44:13,825
TNT.
/ Yes, Sir!

923
01:44:13,826 --> 01:44:15,826
What?

924
01:44:16,450 --> 01:44:18,450
Mr. Herbert,
is it really necessary to blow it up?

925
01:44:18,474 --> 01:44:20,474
Shut up if you want
all the money!

926
01:44:23,498 --> 01:44:25,498
He's a traitor.

927
01:44:26,422 --> 01:44:28,422
Lei Zhen, you...

928
01:44:32,446 --> 01:44:33,446
Wait!

929
01:44:33,470 --> 01:44:34,470
Don't bomb!

930
01:44:34,494 --> 01:44:36,494
Wait! Civilization thousands of years old
don't blow it up!

931
01:44:36,518 --> 01:44:38,518
Don't use bombs.
/ Boss.

932
01:44:38,542 --> 01:44:40,042
I also have a bad feeling
if you use a bomb.

933
01:44:40,043 --> 01:44:42,043
This is a limited space.
With explosives, we...

934
01:44:51,467 --> 01:44:53,467
Don't bomb...

935
01:46:12,491 --> 01:46:14,491
Hibiscus Tree?

936
01:46:14,515 --> 01:46:15,515
This one?

937
01:46:15,539 --> 01:46:17,439
This is certain

938
01:46:17,463 --> 01:46:19,463
Sacred Bronze Tree.

939
01:46:19,487 --> 01:46:21,487
This is a golden tree,
what's the purpose?

940
01:46:22,411 --> 01:46:24,411
For worship.

941
01:46:24,435 --> 01:46:27,435
As a ladder for ancient people

942
01:46:28,459 --> 01:46:30,459
to reach the gods and the universe.

943
01:46:32,483 --> 01:46:35,483
Golden statue for the worship of God

944
01:46:36,407 --> 01:46:38,407
I've finally found you.

945
01:46:39,431 --> 01:46:41,431
It's not yours.

946
01:46:41,455 --> 01:46:43,455
It belongs to all humanity.

947
01:46:44,479 --> 01:46:45,479
Do you know

948
01:46:45,503 --> 01:46:48,403
relic theft
first-class national culture

949
01:46:48,427 --> 01:46:51,427
sentenced to life imprisonment?
Even if you run away to another country

950
01:46:52,451 --> 01:46:55,451
will definitely be sent home again.
Can you live according to your parents' wishes?

951
01:46:57,475 --> 01:46:59,475
Herbert,

952
01:46:59,499 --> 01:47:01,499
I no longer want money from you.

953
01:47:01,523 --> 01:47:03,523
I can return it
that you have paid to me.

954
01:47:04,447 --> 01:47:06,447
I'm done with this business.
/ Tie them up!

955
01:47:06,471 --> 01:47:07,471
What is this? Come on!

956
01:47:07,495 --> 01:47:08,495
Raise your hands!

957
01:47:08,519 --> 01:47:09,519
I'm out, okay?

958
01:47:09,543 --> 01:47:10,543
Calm down.

959
01:47:10,567 --> 01:47:12,567
Come on!

960
01:47:12,591 --> 01:47:13,591
There!

961
01:47:13,615 --> 01:47:14,615
Fast!
/ Calm.

962
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:15,639
Fast!

963
01:47:15,663 --> 01:47:17,463
Come on!

964
01:47:17,487 --> 01:47:18,487
Come on!
/ Fast!

965
01:47:18,511 --> 01:47:19,511
Don't push them!

966
01:47:19,535 --> 01:47:21,435
I'm okay.
/ Are you okay?

967
01:47:21,459 --> 01:47:23,459
Don't move!

968
01:47:25,483 --> 01:47:27,483
Take this,
look for opportunities to get out.

969
01:47:29,407 --> 01:47:30,407
Hand!

970
01:47:30,431 --> 01:47:32,431
Here's your hand!

971
01:47:33,455 --> 01:47:35,455
Bro, don't tie it too tight.

972
01:47:38,479 --> 01:47:40,479
I'll go there and check.
/ Okay.

973
01:48:00,403 --> 01:48:02,403
Guys!
TNT!

974
01:48:02,427 --> 01:48:04,427
Install the six pillars.
/ Yes, Sir!

975
01:48:13,451 --> 01:48:15,451
Boss, there's a big hole below.

976
01:48:15,475 --> 01:48:17,475
Look.

977
01:48:17,499 --> 01:48:19,499
It looks like there is a building there.

978
01:48:21,423 --> 01:48:23,423
Let's blow up the golden statue first.

979
01:48:28,447 --> 01:48:31,447
Professor!
/ Shut up!

980
01:48:32,471 --> 01:48:34,471
Don't let them blow up the artifact.

981
01:48:34,495 --> 01:48:36,495
I'll find a way to stop the bomb.

982
01:48:36,519 --> 01:48:38,519
You three get out of here quickly.

983
01:48:38,543 --> 01:48:40,543
We are all tied up.
How could that be?

984
01:48:41,467 --> 01:48:43,467
I'm not tied up.

985
01:48:46,491 --> 01:48:48,491
Xinran, prepare to carry this knife.

986
01:48:54,415 --> 01:48:56,415
Bring it on!

987
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:03,439
Kick him!

988
01:49:04,463 --> 01:49:06,463
Don't kick me, kick him!
/ Not me!

989
01:49:11,487 --> 01:49:13,487
Go now!
/ Good!

990
01:49:22,411 --> 01:49:24,411
When I count to 3...

991
01:49:28,435 --> 01:49:29,435
There's no sound.

992
01:49:29,459 --> 01:49:31,459
Lei Zhen, if you are my friend

993
01:49:31,483 --> 01:49:33,483
quickly take Xinran away from here,
and call the police!

994
01:49:33,507 --> 01:49:35,507
How about you?

995
01:49:35,531 --> 01:49:37,531
I have to help the professor.
/ No, I'm staying with you.

996
01:49:37,555 --> 01:49:39,555
We're still together.

997
01:49:41,479 --> 01:49:42,479
Bring this.

998
01:49:42,503 --> 01:49:45,403
When all this is over,
I will be your girlfriend.

999
01:49:47,427 --> 01:49:49,427
What did he say?

1000
01:49:50,451 --> 01:49:52,451
He will be my boyfriend.

1001
01:49:52,475 --> 01:49:53,875
No need to be so friendly.
Get out of here quickly!

1002
01:49:53,876 --> 01:49:55,876
Wang Jing, I will wait for you!

1003
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:58,400
Professor.
/ Why did you come back?

1004
01:49:58,424 --> 01:50:00,424
To help you.

1005
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:02,448
Stay behind me!

1006
01:50:02,472 --> 01:50:04,472
I will be waiting for you!

1007
01:50:05,496 --> 01:50:07,496
Don't look.
Take cover!

1008
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:10,420
Lei Zhen!

1009
01:50:10,444 --> 01:50:12,444
Lei Zhen!

1010
01:50:17,468 --> 01:50:19,468
There are no more bullets.
/ What to do?

1011
01:50:19,492 --> 01:50:20,492
There!

1012
01:50:20,516 --> 01:50:22,516
Kill them all!

1013
01:50:22,540 --> 01:50:24,540
Understood!

1014
01:50:30,464 --> 01:50:32,464
Zhou Bin.

1015
01:50:32,488 --> 01:50:33,488
Boss.

1016
01:50:33,512 --> 01:50:36,412
Let's not blow up this artifact.
My baby was just born.

1017
01:50:36,436 --> 01:50:38,436
I don't want to be in prison for the rest of my life.

1018
01:50:41,460 --> 01:50:43,460
Let me see.
/ Slowly!

1019
01:50:43,484 --> 01:50:46,484
Press this firmly with your hands.
/ Luckily there are no organs in the legs.

1020
01:50:50,408 --> 01:50:51,408
Herbert,

1021
01:50:51,432 --> 01:50:53,432
Do you think there is only one gold statue here?

1022
01:50:53,456 --> 01:50:55,456
The treasures of the Huns are also here.

1023
01:50:55,480 --> 01:50:57,480
Where?
/ The answer is written on the wall out there.

1024
01:50:57,504 --> 01:50:59,504
The writing on the wall?

1025
01:51:06,428 --> 01:51:08,428
You have my attention now.

1026
01:51:16,452 --> 01:51:18,452
Say!
/ Xinran.

1027
01:51:19,476 --> 01:51:21,476
Is Lei Zhen okay?

1028
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:24,400
He is fine,
only shot twice.

1029
01:51:25,424 --> 01:51:28,424
Professor, I'm waiting.

1030
01:51:29,448 --> 01:51:31,448
You let them go first,
then I'll tell you.

1031
01:51:32,472 --> 01:51:34,472
Why should I believe you?

1032
01:51:38,496 --> 01:51:40,496
Yes, I see.

1033
01:52:08,420 --> 01:52:10,420
Professor, give up.

1034
01:52:13,444 --> 01:52:14,444
That's right.

1035
01:52:14,468 --> 01:52:16,468
Release the gas.

1036
01:52:53,492 --> 01:52:55,492
Don't attack me!

1037
01:53:58,416 --> 01:54:00,416
Get away from me!
Do not come close!

1038
01:54:18,440 --> 01:54:20,440
Professor!
/ Get them out of here and call the police!

1039
01:54:20,464 --> 01:54:21,464
Good!

1040
01:54:21,488 --> 01:54:22,488
Fast!

1041
01:54:22,512 --> 01:54:24,512
Xinran!
/Wang Jing!

1042
01:54:25,436 --> 01:54:27,436
Lei Zhen lost a lot of blood,
must be taken to hospital.

1043
01:54:27,460 --> 01:54:29,460
I can't carry him!
/ I'll help you. / Okay.

1044
01:54:29,484 --> 01:54:31,484
Nobody can leave!

1045
01:54:35,408 --> 01:54:37,408
Wang Jing.

1046
01:54:42,432 --> 01:54:45,432
Why are you blocking arrows for me?

1047
01:54:45,456 --> 01:54:47,456
I see you're in danger.

1048
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:50,480
So, I...
/ Does it hurt? Where?

1049
01:54:50,504 --> 01:54:52,504
Where does it hurt?

1050
01:54:53,428 --> 01:54:55,428
In particular, no one got sick.

1051
01:54:59,452 --> 01:55:01,452
My bag!
/ My feet!

1052
01:55:05,476 --> 01:55:07,476
You lost a lot of blood!
/ Why don't you tell me your leg hurts?

1053
01:55:07,500 --> 01:55:09,500
Call the police!

1054
01:55:26,424 --> 01:55:28,424
Professor!

1055
01:56:09,448 --> 01:56:11,448
Are you okay?

1056
01:56:28,472 --> 01:56:29,472
Professor,

1057
01:56:29,496 --> 01:56:31,496
no one can oppose fate.

1058
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:38,420
Which is mine
must be mine!

1059
01:57:22,444 --> 01:57:24,444
Hang in there.

1060
01:58:03,468 --> 01:58:04,468
This.

1061
01:58:04,492 --> 01:58:06,492
Drink it.

1062
01:58:07,416 --> 01:58:09,416
Sister-in-law, let's go back.

1063
01:58:09,440 --> 01:58:11,440
It's very cold here.

1064
01:58:12,464 --> 01:58:14,464
Are you cold?

1065
01:58:14,488 --> 01:58:16,488
I don't think it's this cold.

1066
01:58:21,412 --> 01:58:23,412
This he got.

1067
01:58:23,436 --> 01:58:24,436
Did you see?

1068
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:27,460
Persistence does not betray results!

1069
01:58:27,484 --> 01:58:29,484
The fish are big!

1070
01:58:37,408 --> 01:58:39,408
This is a big fish!
/ Spirit!

1071
01:58:44,432 --> 01:58:45,432
Very big one!

1072
01:58:45,456 --> 01:58:47,456
It weighs at least 30-48 kilos!

1073
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:04,480
Broke my fishing line!
/ Not really.

1074
01:59:05,404 --> 01:59:07,404
The fish are still here.

1075
01:59:09,428 --> 01:59:11,428
I've never seen fish lips like that.

1076
01:59:12,452 --> 01:59:13,452
Do not move.

1077
01:59:13,476 --> 01:59:15,476
It's got teeth.

1078
01:59:15,500 --> 01:59:17,500
Help!

1079
01:59:17,524 --> 01:59:19,524
Does it speak human language?

1080
01:59:19,548 --> 01:59:20,548
Help!

1081
01:59:20,572 --> 01:59:22,572
It's like he said "please".

1082
01:59:23,496 --> 01:59:24,496
Help!

1083
01:59:24,520 --> 01:59:26,520
Friend, how can you go in there?
Where are you swimming?

1084
01:59:26,544 --> 01:59:28,544
Why did you ask him to chat?
/ Let's get him out!

1085
01:59:28,568 --> 01:59:30,568
Oh yes!

1086
01:59:33,492 --> 01:59:34,492
Help!

1087
01:59:34,516 --> 01:59:35,516
Help!

1088
01:59:35,540 --> 01:59:37,540
Brother-in-law, hurry up!
/ Hang in there!

1089
01:59:41,464 --> 01:59:43,464
Still no signal.

1090
01:59:47,488 --> 01:59:49,488
Xinran, if you were my girlfriend

1091
01:59:49,512 --> 01:59:51,512
take Lei Zhen away from here now!

1092
01:59:51,536 --> 01:59:53,536
How about you?
/ I'll look for the professor.

1093
01:59:55,460 --> 01:59:57,460
I can't leave him in there!
/Wang Jing!

1094
01:59:57,484 --> 01:59:59,484
We have agreed to stay together!
Wang Jing!

1095
02:00:00,408 --> 02:00:02,408
Wang Jing!

1096
02:00:07,432 --> 02:00:09,432
Help!

1097
02:00:12,456 --> 02:00:14,456
Help!

1098
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:18,480

Please, come here.

1103
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:42,500
Wang Jing, you are really handsome.

1104
02:00:43,424 --> 02:00:45,424
Professor Fang, in your story "A Legend"

1105
02:00:45,448 --> 02:00:47,448
tragic romance resonates in one's heart.

1106
02:00:47,472 --> 02:00:49,472
It's really nice.
I develop games.

1107
02:00:49,496 --> 02:00:52,496
Can I buy the game patent from your book?

1108
02:00:52,520 --> 02:00:54,520
We have developed the game.

1109
02:00:54,544 --> 02:00:56,544
We don't need anything,
except funds.

1110
02:00:56,568 --> 02:00:58,568
That's easy.
I have money.

1111
02:00:58,592 --> 02:01:00,592
Really good!

1112
02:01:00,616 --> 02:01:02,616
Let's talk about it there!
/ Can you walk? / Can!

1113
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:03,640
That's good.
/ Ayo.

1114
02:01:03,664 --> 02:01:05,464
Xinran, her book.

1115
02:01:05,488 --> 02:01:06,488
Sir, your book!
/ Professor Fang.

1116
02:01:06,512 --> 02:01:08,512
Hello.
/Mr. Wang Jing,

1117
02:01:09,436 --> 02:01:11,436
the story of Zhao Zhan and Mengyu

1118
02:01:11,460 --> 02:01:13,460
what a sad ending.

1119
02:01:13,484 --> 02:01:15,484
I feel sad.
/ Actually

1120
02:01:15,508 --> 02:01:17,508
The Professor has another version of the ending.

1121
02:01:17,532 --> 02:01:19,532
Professor, look!

1122
02:01:27,456 --> 02:01:29,456
Professor Fang, are you for real

1123
02:01:29,480 --> 02:01:32,480
have a happy ending?

1124
02:01:33,404 --> 02:01:35,404
I have another ending.

1125
02:02:19,428 --> 02:02:21,428
Mengyun preferred to sacrifice himself

1126
02:02:23,452 --> 02:02:25,452
to save your life.

1127
02:02:25,476 --> 02:02:28,476
I asked him before he died

1128
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:30,500
remembering that the two of you are not meant to be together

1129
02:02:30,524 --> 02:02:33,424
why did he insist on doing that?

1130
02:02:38,448 --> 02:02:41,448
On the first day we met

1131
02:02:43,472 --> 02:02:46,472
he doesn't know me,

1132
02:02:48,496 --> 02:02:50,496
but he risked his life
to protect me.

1133
02:02:53,420 --> 02:02:55,420
The general's kindness was sincere.

1134
02:02:58,444 --> 02:03:00,444
Mengyun couldn't forget.

1135
02:03:01,468 --> 02:03:03,468
If I could help him

1136
02:03:04,492 --> 02:03:06,492
fulfill his desire to protect
this country and people.

1137
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:11,416
Mengyun died without regret.
