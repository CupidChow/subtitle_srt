1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want to be with you.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I want to be with you.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I want to be with you.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to be with you.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I want to be with you.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I want to be with you.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I want to be with you.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to be with you.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I want to be with you.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I want to be with you.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I want to be with you.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I want to be with you.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I want to be with you.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want to be with you.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We can have an idea

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
After we have an idea

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
We can easily moment match

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:14,060
Our break on It

19
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,260
It's not too bad

20
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,020
as For now

21
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,860
The memory promised

22
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,780
Can he recover?

23
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,580
It's an accident.

24
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,180
Some people can recover in a month or two.

25
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,060
Some people

26
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,300
will never remember it.

27
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,020
Young Master Guan is right.

28
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:47,780
How about this?

29
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,220
I'll prescribe some medicine for him

30
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,580
to stabilize his condition.

31
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,220
Thank you.

32
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,020
Smells delicious.

33
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,500
Yanshu,

34
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,420
could you take me home?

35
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,140
Home?

36
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,020
I'm scared over here.

37
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,580
Liu Su,

38
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,300
clean up your mess and come home.

39
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,500
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,620
He was injured in your mansion.

41
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,540
If there's no explanation today,

42
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,500
no one can leave.

43
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,540
The thief in the mansion

44
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,540
was the wrongful owner of the Commandery Prince's mansion.

45
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,220
I'll find out the real murderer

46
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,460
and give Mu Ling an explanation.

47
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,020
The thief in the Commandery Prince's mansion?

48
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,420
Is this your reason?

49
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,660
Or do you know who the real murderer is

50
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,460
and want to cover up for him?

51
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,020
I don't believe you.

52
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,500
I believe Yan Shu.

53
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:03,820
Please don't interfere with our business.

54
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,100
It's a long-standing relationship.

55
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,380
Since it was a previous relationship,

56
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,500
it should end now.

57
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,500
You have no right to interfere with my business.

58
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,860
Please step aside.

59
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,700
You really don't remember me?

60
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,060
I'm sorry, Young Master Guan.

61
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,860
I have to stay.

62
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,100
Xiao Yue died because of me.

63
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,820
I have to avenge her.

64
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,580
each other.

65
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,820
Here it is.

66
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,900
I was just thinking

67
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,900
that the Commandery Prince's Mansion is so white.

68
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,300
I'm just a small playboy.

69
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,460
How can I deserve it?

70
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,100
Don't think too much.

71
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,900
You're my wife who's about to get married.

72
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,060
You'll be the mistress of the Commandery Prince's Mansion.

73
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,940
Don't look down on yourself.

74
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,100
Let's go.

75
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,500
Your Highness.

76
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,580
This woman has lost her memory.

77
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,460
Your Highness.

78
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,340
Could it be a trap?

79
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,020
My brother is soft-hearted.

80
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,740
I won't buy a bomb

81
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,180
from him.

82
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,900
Are you ready?

83
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,700
Your Highness, I'm ready.

84
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:19,900
Let's go.

85
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,660
I'd like to see

86
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,100
what kind of makeup this woman is wearing.

87
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,700
This way.

88
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:54,060
Some cute Martha's

89
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,780
It's delicious.

90
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,420
Okay.

91
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,300
Have a good rest after you finish it.

92
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,140
Thank you.

93
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,380
Boss Shen, are you tired?

94
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,180
How about I help you rest?

95
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,100
No need.

96
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,860
Let me stay here alone for a while.

97
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,940
You may leave.

98
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:21,820
Yes.

99
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,540
Thank you.

100
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,120
["We Chat easy and humanent." relying on partners.)

101
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:16,820
Boss Shen.

102
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,580
real estate by working alone is exact,

103
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,180
can I offer you something?

104
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,260
The landlady if you are willing to buy this,

105
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,620
the private property loan you have given,

106
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:34,940
be it leftover or barley,

107
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,060
Xintong UI project will be taken over for per capita.

108
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,820
Wait.

109
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:44,220
Lide,

110
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,260
you were coldly mistaken when asked

111
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,580
not to offer me a hand in person.

112
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,620
I just know

113
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,220
Boss Shen just recovered from his illness

114
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,100
and came to give you a gift.

115
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,900
I wonder

116
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,020
how you feel about this dress.

117
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,820
The dress that Xiao Yuan wore before he died.

118
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,860
This dress is exquisite.

119
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,260
I like it very much.

120
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,980
Thank you, Miss Xu.

121
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,300
Shen Muliang,

122
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,540
don't act rashly with me here.

123
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,620
Don't think I don't know you're a fake.

124
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:56,380
Why is Miss Xu's misunderstanding so deep?

125
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,100
Is it because she's afraid of something?

126
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,740
Goodbye.

127
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:19,540
Xu Qingqing,

128
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,220
I won't let you off.

129
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,300
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,060
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,380
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,900
Xiao Yuan,

133
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,140
I know this is dangerous.

134
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,140
But I must avenge you

135
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,900
and avenge your soul.

136
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,380
But there are some things that are strange.

137
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,140
I didn't figure it out.

138
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,540
You haven't seen Xu Qingqing for a few years.

139
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,500
I'm the one she really wants to deal with.

140
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,380
So,

141
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,740
you must have hit something.

142
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,180
There must be someone else in that room.

143
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,620
Xiao Yuan,

144
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,420
don't worry.

145
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,860
I will take good care of Xiyuan

146
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:32,020
and everyone.

147
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,380
I will also take care of myself.

148
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,380
Namebl constituency

149
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,540
Milan

150
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,260
After I work hard,

151
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,060
I will never

152
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,180
give in to you.

153
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,180
I won't let you off this time.

154
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
And...

155
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,780
And don't let Xu Qingqing

156
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,980
dare to give in to you.

157
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,620
Abdul Rahman.

158
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,620
They are here, sir.

159
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,620
Till you marry her.

160
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,620
Thank you for your hard work.

161
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,620
I'll look forward to meeting you in Palanquin.

162
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,620
I know you didn't lose your memory.

163
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,860
What happened?

164
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,940
Guan Xintai,

165
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,420
stop forcing me, okay?

166
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,460
Did Guan Qianyang

167
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,660
tell you something before he died?

168
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,140
It's about my parents, right?

169
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,700
What's going on between you and Xu Yanshu?

170
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:11,580
Stop asking.

171
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,780
You won't be able to stand it.

172
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:17,220
So I guessed it right.

173
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,620
Mo Lian,

174
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,700
my parents

175
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,340
are...

176
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,300
Am I not clear

177
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,740
about my parents' situation?

178
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,260
And Xu Yanshu,

179
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,340
did he force you?

180
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,380
Did he?

181
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,180
How dare he?

182
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,940
Let's go.

183
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,860
Mr. Hong, please make way.

184
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,180
Please make way.

185
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,420
You lost such a big living person.

186
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,220
Why should I ask you to eat?

187
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,020
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:00,740
But,

189
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,380
the First Miss suddenly appeared.

190
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,380
So I...

191
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,260
What did she do?

192
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,740
I don't know.

193
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,460
Go.

194
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,380
Yes.

195
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,180
I know that

196
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,540
you did all this for my own good.

197
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,700
But my parents love each other.

198
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,260
Even if my mother is a playwright,

199
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,820
I can't have any other opinions.

200
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,180
I'm not a playwright.

201
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,340
I won't send someone to hurt my mother

202
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,860
for my sake.

203
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,500
Then what's the matter

204
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,100
between you and Xu Yanshu?

205
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,540
When Guan Qingyang

206
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,260
told me about this,

207
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,540
Xu Yanshu heard it.

208
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,140
He threatened me

209
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,180
to persuade his sister Xu Qingqing.

210
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,900
My mother is dead.

211
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,060
How can Guan Qingyang prove

212
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,220
that he's right?

213
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,740
Besides, he hates the Guan family.

214
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,500
He hates my father, too.

215
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,580
Guan Qingyang said

216
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,860
that

217
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,740
it wasn't Master Guan who did it.

218
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,660
It was his wife, Kang Shao.

219
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,300
Kang Shao?

220
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,060
He's really my father's man.

221
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,940
But after I came back,

222
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,660
he left the Guan family.

223
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,140
I thought

224
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,820
I had to investigate it thoroughly.

225
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,860
But I couldn't

226
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,420
do anything under your nose.

227
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,460
So I had to...

228
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,540
I was afraid that after you knew it,

229
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,340
I was afraid

230
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,100
you'd get hurt.

231
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,100
But unfortunately,

232
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,660
I didn't make it in time.

233
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,940
Mu Ling,

234
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,700
I should be the one

235
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:57,100
to take responsibility for all these.

236
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,220
Thank you.

237
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,740
You're welcome.

238
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,460
I'm sorry.

239
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,020
Mu Ling,

240
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,900
if it weren't for me,

241
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:15,420
maybe Xiao Yuan

242
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,700
wouldn't have done it.

243
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:28,980
Let's go.

244
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,740
Where?

245
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,940
Let's go and see

246
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,260
how deep the water is.

247
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:36,980
Let's go.

248
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,780
I want to do my best

249
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,900
to help you

250
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,060
no matter what you become

251
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,060
or what other people think of you.

252
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,980
You've always been

253
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,620
that little girl in my heart.

254
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,380
I won't be able to be by your side

255
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,060
and help you in the future.

256
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,420
Don't be obsessed with anything

257
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,580
and take care of yourself.

258
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,980
Master has left.

259
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,260
Xing Kai

260
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,500
is going to marry that girl.

261
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,500
Second Master

262
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,540
is gone too.

263
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,100
Second Master,

264
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,300
you're so muddled.

265
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,700
Madam,

266
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,420
please be happy.

267
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,140
Be careful not to hurt yourself.

268
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,780
It's getting cold

269
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,580
these days.

270
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,740
The wind and sand

271
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,660
are making my eyes water.

272
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,940
Madam,

273
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,780
let's go back to our room.

274
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:00,580
Come on.

275
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,420
Go back to your room now.

276
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,940
Smiling and rushing

277
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,240
All kinds of travelling

278
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,040
High mountain and wide sea

279
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,900
The advance prescribed towards bursts

280
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:27,080
Full moon and clear sky
