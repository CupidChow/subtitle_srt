2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want to be returned.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I can't avoid the

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
a little white

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
in the autumn.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to love you

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
but it's an accident.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm confused and understand

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
the clouds in the sky are under the sea.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I want to be with you forever.

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The Long Ballad

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
My heart is open.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
After many years,

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
many things have changed.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I will not be long in the mortal world.

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You must live well.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't worry about the reason.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
It's my destiny.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Mom, I don't want to go to the coffin.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Listen to me, Xing.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm a daughter of a playboy.

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If you stay with me,

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
it will ruin you.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I don't want to go.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let's go, young master.

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Mom.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Mom.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Mom.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Mom.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You're the son of master?

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I can tell it at a glance.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's true.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's master's handwriting.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't know how to solve it now.

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You're not afraid that I'll kill master?

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Believe me.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If you don't have the letter

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
from Yupai and mom,

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
can you leave the police station alive?

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I will find out

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
who killed mom.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
But boss Shen,

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
you're already related to me.

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The outside world is already a dead end.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Do you dare to go

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
the way I gave you?

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Senior sister, are you okay?

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm fine.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Guan Xingkai

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
is master's son.

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What?

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What's wrong with young master Guan?

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It seems that we don't know

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
much about master.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That fire

57
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
is not that simple.

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
What's wrong?

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Senior sister,

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
there are many people in the yard today.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm afraid you're going to be on stage tomorrow.

62
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But now...

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I want to know who killed mom.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Boss Shen, why don't you think about

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
how to solve it now?

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's okay.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I don't know

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
the reason.

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But now master is dead.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It may be complicated.

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm sure there will be danger when I investigate.

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
We should avoid the danger like before.

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
In case I get you involved

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
in something

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and get our theater involved.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's okay.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Young master,

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
you told boss Shen about your background.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Can you believe it?

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What if

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
master Lan Yun is boss Shen?

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
If the murderer is really him,

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
he won't go to Liang Man today.

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
All these years,

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
he has been the one who helped me.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We should thank him.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But this fire

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
not only burned my mom,

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
but also ruined him.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Chunsheng,

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
go and buy the theater in the west of the city.

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Go.

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay, young master.

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:24,840
The

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Go away.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You are still singing the opera.

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What are you singing?

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Go away.

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Go away.

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He really thinks he is sick.

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
He just wants to

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
get the high position of the official.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So what?

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The official

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
really wants him to be

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
the wife of the official.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He just threw me away.

108
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What are you singing?

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What are you singing?

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What are you doing?

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Are you looking for a fight?

112
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Good.

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Life is like a play.

114
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It seems that the wife of the official

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
has been better than the emperor of heaven and hell.

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It seems that my play

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
should be quiet.

118
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Good.

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Boss Shen, you sing well.

120
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He is Guan Xinkai,

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
young master Guan.

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Why is he crying?

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Young master Guan

124
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
can really make a heart-pounding

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and blood-stained sound.

126
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What?

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Boss Shen,

128
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
that's it?

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What's going on?

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
As long as I'm here,

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Boss Shen won't suffer anymore.

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll play your play with you.

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Thank you, young master Guan.

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Boss Shen, do you really agree?

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Boss Shen,

137
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
you really like the high quality of the official.

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Since Boss Shen

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
is willing to go with me,

140
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
we have to let the whole Rong City know

141
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
that your play

142
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
is like Guan Xinkai.

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
How is it?

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Do you like it?

145
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Young master Guan

146
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
really wants to hug me.

147
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You have to do your best in acting.

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You can't be a little bit cold

149
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
when you're the nephew of my young master.

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What?

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You're not afraid of me?

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm not afraid of you.

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm not afraid of you.

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm not afraid of you.

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm not afraid of you.

156
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Boss Shen, don't you want to go with me?

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Of course.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It's tiring to play the play alone.

159
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's good to have a companion.

160
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Let's go.

161
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm here.

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm here.

163
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Mother,

164
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
we've been apart for many years.

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I didn't expect that when I come back,

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
we'll be separated for life.

167
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm afraid that I can't

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
see you again.

169
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Senior sister,

170
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
something bad happened.

171
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Mother asked you to go to her house

172
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and sing for her tomorrow.

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What should we do?

174
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It seems that she can't do it.

175
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'll be there on time tomorrow.

176
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Senior sister.

177
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Call me Second Madam.

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What kind of person are you?

179
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
How dare you ask me to sing for you?

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I remember that

181
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I was the one who

182
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
went to the previous party.

183
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I was the one who went out to sell incense.

184
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You've had a taste of it today.

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Kneel down.

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Wind and rain

187
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The flowers fall like a smile

188
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The noodles are being cooked

189
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You're so kind

190
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I knew that I didn't like you

191
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You didn't say a word

192
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
When a song of parting

193
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
is sung

194
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'll cry and cry

195
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
for the rest of my life

196
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The sound of the flute

197
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
is like a flower

198
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The light is always on

199
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
When a song of parting

200
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
is sung

201
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'll be happy to be with you

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The flowers are falling like mud

203
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You're so kind

204
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Your face is so clear

205
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So clear
