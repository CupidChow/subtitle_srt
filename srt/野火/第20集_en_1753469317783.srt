1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:28,340
when our

2
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,260
Master

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm here.

4
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Mu Ling.

5
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
I'm here.

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm here.

7
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You had a nightmare?

8
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,000
You wanted to kill yourself again?

9
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,800
We're clearly

10
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,400
closer to the truth.

11
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,400
But still...

12
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,800
What we can do now

13
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,200
is what we're doing now.

14
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Don't think too much.

15
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,000
Go to sleep.

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll stay here with you.

17
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Mu Ling.

18
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Mu Ling.

19
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,200
You woke up so early.

20
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
Come and eat.

21
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
I made it myself.

22
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Try it.

23
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,200
I'll try it then.

24
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,600
I don't cook often.

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,400
Try it and see if it's good.

26
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,800
As long as you cook,

27
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
I'll cook for you.

28
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
I'll cook for you.

29
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
I'll cook for you.

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,800
It'll be delicious.

31
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
Try it.

32
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,400
See if I can eat it.

33
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,400
You're so self-willed.

34
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,800
Try it.

35
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
If only

36
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,800
I could eat it for a while.

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's okay to eat

38
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,600
this thick tea and rice once in a while.

39
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
If you eat it every day,

40
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
you'll get tired.

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
As long as you're here,

42
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
I won't get tired.

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Did I put sugar in the porridge?

44
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,200
You'll know when you taste it.

45
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,200
There's soup in my kitchen.

46
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,400
I'll go and check.

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Young Master.

48
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Shantian is here.

49
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
Shantian is here?

50
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
He's here.

51
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,200
He's here.

52
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What is he doing?

53
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,400
It tastes good.

54
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,200
Young Master Guan is here.

55
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,600
Mr. Shantian is Mr. Tong Yuan's

56
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,200
most valuable treasure.

57
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,400
I'm sorry

58
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,000
for asking you to come to our village

59
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
to have a meal.

60
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,600
It's been a long time.

61
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,600
Let me introduce to you

62
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Mr. Shantian.

63
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,800
He's the first student

64
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,000
in the Japanese class.

65
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,600
But now,

66
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,000
if I remember correctly,

67
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
he's in charge of helping Mr. Tong Yuan

68
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,000
maintain a stable business in Rong City.

69
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Come on.

70
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Please sit.

71
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,400
Mr. Shantian is busy with work.

72
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,400
I wonder what you're doing here.

73
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,600
Mr. Tong Yuan has been in charge of

74
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,600
the Japanese society of Rong City for a while.

75
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,600
I believe you all have seen it.

76
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,400
Now, Rong City is

77
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,400
in full bloom.

78
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,600
I mean

79
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,200
Mr. Guan and Boss Shen

80
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,000
are the leaders of Rong City's business

81
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,600
and culture industry.

82
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
Shouldn't you

83
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,200
show your respect?

84
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Of course.

85
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
But how should I show my respect?

86
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,000
Mr. Tong Yuan has always been fond of

87
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,600
Chinese traditional culture.

88
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,400
I heard that Boss Shen is a famous person in Rong City.

89
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,600
He's very respected.

90
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,800
If Boss Shen is willing to show up,

91
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,000
Mr. Tong Yuan will definitely...

92
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,800
Don't be too stubborn.

93
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,600
Mo Lian.

94
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,800
It won't be a problem

95
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,400
if you sing it for the Japanese.

96
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Am I right?

97
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,400
I know you don't want to.

98
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
You must send out

99
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,400
your goods, right?

100
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,600
Go back.

101
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
Go back.

102
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,600
You can go back first.

103
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,600
I'll clean up.

104
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,400
Okay.

105
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,600
Young Master, you just left.

106
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
Those bastards started to act wild

107
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,400
and didn't eat or drink.

108
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,800
Shan Tian'ai said he was waiting for you to send out a message.

109
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Mr. Liu.

110
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,200
I was impulsive

111
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
and caused you...

112
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,200
You did the right thing.

113
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,400
The play is something our ancestors left behind

114
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,400
and used to serve them.

115
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,400
It's a shame for the people.

116
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,400
Mr. Liu.

117
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
Mr. Liu.

118
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,400
I might let you down.

119
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,400
Mu Ling, I know you well.

120
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,200
You can't just give up.

121
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Mr. Liu.

122
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,600
I don't want to sing this play.

123
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,600
But if I don't,

124
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,600
what will happen to the Queen?

125
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,200
What will happen to the people in Jiangbei?

126
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,400
I don't care.

127
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
I'd rather die standing

128
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,000
than kneel and sing.

129
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,800
You have your own ways.

130
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,400
But those are the lives of the living.

131
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,000
I can't just sit around and do nothing.

132
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Mr. Liu.

133
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Mr. Liu.

134
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,400
I'm sorry.

135
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
I'm sorry.

136
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,400
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
I'm sorry.

138
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
I'm sorry.

139
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
I'm sorry.

141
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
I'm sorry.

142
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
I'm sorry.

143
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I'm sorry.

144
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
I'm sorry.

145
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
I'm sorry.

146
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
I'm sorry.

147
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
I'm sorry.

148
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
I'm sorry.

149
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
I'm sorry.

150
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
I'm sorry.

151
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
I'm sorry.

152
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
I'm sorry.

153
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
I'm sorry.

154
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
I'm sorry.

155
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
I'm sorry.

156
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
I'm sorry.

157
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
I'm sorry.

158
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
I'm sorry.

159
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
I'm sorry.

160
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
I'm sorry.

161
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
I'm sorry.

162
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
I'm sorry.

163
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
I'm sorry.
