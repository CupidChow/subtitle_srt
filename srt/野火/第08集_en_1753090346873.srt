1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want to be returned.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I can't avoid the

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
the white of autumn.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's raining.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I want to love you.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's an accident.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm confused.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Clouds in the sky, dust in the ground.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I want to be eternal and be with you forever.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The Long Ballad

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Aunt, this one is better.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This one?

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This is the best.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This one is a little big.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Look, right?

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Try it.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I think you should choose one of these two.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
As you like.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I prefer this one.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Is it good?

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You're good.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Xingkai.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Xingkai.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Where are you going at this time?

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let go.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Xingkai.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Don't forget what you promised me.

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Xingkai.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I told you to let go.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't worry.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm here.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
If you insist,

34
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
you can help me now.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Come on.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I just want to

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
leave a way for Boss Shen.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
In case Boss Shen gets sad in the future,

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't know where he will go.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Thank you for your kindness.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If you have nothing else,

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
please go back.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're quite a bit of a bloodthirsty.

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Interesting.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm waiting for your answer.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Who?

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Who?

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Are you okay?

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm fine.

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why are you here?

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I bought the theater.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Why can't I be here?

53
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Xu Dujun.

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's so late.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Are you going to stay here for the night?

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Young Master.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The assassin ran away.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Are you okay?

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I can investigate him myself.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I won't bother you.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Since you don't want me to investigate,

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm afraid.

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But there's no need

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
to be so mean.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
After all, we're family.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Then we need to

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
calculate some accounts.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Otherwise,

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
everyone will think

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Du Jun is a good man.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Even if people are making trouble in Xi Yuan,

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
how about this?

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll send people to Du Jun's mansion

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
tomorrow

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
for the loss of Xi Yuan.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You...

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm leaving.

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's not what you think.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I can explain it to you now.

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I have to congratulate Young Master Guan

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
on getting married.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
When you get married,

83
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I'll definitely send you a gift.

84
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Let go of me.

85
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
There are so many people here.

86
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Try again.

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'll let everyone

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
come and see us.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Mo Lian.

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I didn't handle it well.

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Can you believe me?

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Young Master.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's my fault.

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I was hurt by Guan Xinkai's chase.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Please punish me.

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm fine.

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Sit.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Sit.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I told you to sit.

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Your ears are broken.

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The special medicine for gunshot wounds

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
is good for external use.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's good for you.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll drink it.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You two...

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I remembered

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
when I saved you two

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
from the ship,

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
it was almost five years ago.

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Now you're both dead and wounded.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's all my fault.

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I shouldn't have let your brother go.

115
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Young Master.

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Don't say that.

117
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You gave me and my brother

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
this life.

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You let us go east.

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We'll never go west.

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You...

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Even if we die,

123
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
we can't die.

124
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's Xizi and...

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
These years,

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
you and your brother

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
helped me a lot

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
in the case and in the name.

129
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll treat you well

130
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
when I'm in charge of the Guan family.

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Thank you, Young Master.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Don't worry.

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
So,

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
the Xu family

135
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
locked the Guan family's goods

136
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
on the north of the river.

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
They're here to threaten you.

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The north of the river is in a state of unrest.

139
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The sky is in the way.

140
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This batch of medicine

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
must be sent there as soon as possible.

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
You can't be too considerate

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
in front of the Great Consort.

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You saved not only the Guan family,

145
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
but also the lives of the people

146
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
of the whole river.

147
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
When the disaster happened,

148
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
people lived in a very difficult life.

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Let me help you.

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
When I was young,

151
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
my master often brought us here.

152
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He said that the Xu family was the most brilliant here.

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But it was too young at that time.

154
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
He just didn't understand

155
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
why you always liked the Xu family.

156
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Maybe people have something

157
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
they want to do but can't do.

158
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But they just like to force themselves.

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
So what?

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The world is not the heaven and the earth.

161
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's the people who make the decisions.

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The Great Wall of the Great Wall

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Meng Ling.

164
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
If the business meeting is well-organized,

165
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
it will be easier for the Guan family

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
to conduct the business in Jiangbei.

167
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Anyway,

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
thank you for helping me

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
to hold the business meeting.

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You're wrong.

171
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I didn't sing for you

172
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
or for the Guan family.

173
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I sang for the people

174
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
who have been struggling

175
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
to survive.

176
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Please.

177
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Mr. Zhang.

178
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Zhang Yan.

179
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Follow me.

180
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Come and have a look.

181
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The actor is the actor.

182
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Shameless.

183
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You seduced the other's husband.

184
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You're really a drunkard.

185
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Today is the meeting of Young Master Guan.

186
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You two should be

187
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
the guests invited by Young Master Guan.

188
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You should be ashamed

189
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
to do so.

190
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Ashamed?

191
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
This little bitch doesn't know how to be honest.

192
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
She even seduced my husband

193
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
in public

194
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and refused to let go.

195
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I was just teaching her

196
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
so that she could know

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
where her eyes should look in the future.

198
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I heard Xiao Yuan

199
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
talking about her fiancee to me.

200
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
She thought he was a young man

201
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
who was in the upper class.

202
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But he turned out to be

203
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
a disloyal Jin Shimei.

204
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What do you mean by that?

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Madam.

206
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You shouldn't be asking me

207
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
what I mean.

208
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You should be asking

209
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
your editor what I mean.

210
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Jin Ping

211
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
stopped his wife and married another woman.

212
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
He wants to be a rich man.

213
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Do you deserve

214
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
the hard work and wait

215
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Xiao Yuan has been through these eight years?

216
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Madam.

217
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Please let me explain.

218
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Madam.

219
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Go.

220
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Madam.

221
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I know how to deal with my family affairs.

222
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You're not the only outsider

223
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
who can be the judge.

224
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Shen Muliang.

225
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I can forgive you

226
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
for the sake of Young Master Guan.

227
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Why don't you

228
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
sing a song today?

229
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Come on, Madam.

230
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Sing a song?

231
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Boss Shen knows better than I do.

232
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'll sing

233
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
the song of the Zou family.

234
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What do you think?

235
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You...

236
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Go.

237
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Boss Shen is in good shape.

238
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm sure this song

239
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
will have a different taste.

240
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Don't be too harsh.

241
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Xiao Yuan.

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Xiao Yuan.

243
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
If you want to hear the lyrics of the song,

244
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
please turn left.

245
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
We, the Ru Yi Theater,

246
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
can't stand it.

247
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's right.

248
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
If you want to hear

249
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
a song,

250
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
you have to ask Madam

251
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
if I agree.

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
That's right.

253
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
We can't stand it.

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I won't.

255
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Shen Muliang.

256
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Have you thought it through?

257
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If you don't want to,

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
just hand over

259
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
this letter.

260
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Don't even think about it.

261
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You're shameless.

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't want it.

263
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Guards.

264
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Beat him.

265
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Yes.

266
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'll see who dares to do it.

267
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What's going on?

268
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This...

269
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Your Majesty.

270
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Your Majesty.

271
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Your Majesty.

272
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Your Majesty.

273
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Your Majesty.

274
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Your Majesty.

275
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Your Majesty.

276
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Your Majesty.

277
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Your Majesty.

278
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Your Majesty.

279
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Your Majesty.

280
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Your Majesty.

281
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Your Majesty.

282
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Your Majesty.

283
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Your Majesty.

284
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Your Majesty.

285
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Your Majesty.

286
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Your Majesty.

287
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Your Majesty.

288
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Your Majesty.

289
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Your Majesty.

290
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Your Majesty.

291
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Your Majesty.

292
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Your Majesty.

293
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Your Majesty.

294
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Your Majesty.

295
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Your Majesty.

296
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Your Majesty.

297
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Your Majesty.

298
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
When a song of parting is heard,

299
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I want to cry and see you again.

300
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
No sound, no sound,

301
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
the flowers wither.

302
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The light never goes out.

303
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
When a song of separation is heard,

304
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I want to see you again.

305
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The flowers are like you,

306
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
you are inseparable.

307
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Your face is clear in the snow.
