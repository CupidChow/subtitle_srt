1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want to be with you

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I want to be with you

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I want to be with you

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to be with you

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I want to be with you

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I want to be with you

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I want to be with you

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to be with you

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I want to be with you

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I want to be with you

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I want to be with you

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I want to be with you

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I want to be with you

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want to be with you

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Be bridges

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,320
My mother's gold is a bit old.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,080
You can wear this later.

18
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:35,920
Come on.

19
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,920
Try it on.

20
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,040
What is your deal?

21
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,560
Can't you come and help me?

22
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,800
Good.

23
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,600
homework.

24
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,720
Take care.

25
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,960
Master Shen,

26
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,980
you make me feel so blessed.

27
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,300
I've been with him

28
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,120
since my childhood.

29
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,440
I've never seen

30
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,560
any young master

31
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,660
give outä¾¿ions.

32
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,640
It's the uniform

33
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
You even stayed up for a few nights to monitor the situation.

34
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,640
You're afraid of making mistakes.

35
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,640
You're talking too much.

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Look, you're not even letting me tell you the truth.

37
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,640
Are you going out or not?

38
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,640
Get out.

39
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
Okay, okay. I'm going out.

40
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,440
The

41
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,440
The

42
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,440
The

43
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,440
The

44
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,440
The

45
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,440
The

46
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,440
The

47
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,440
The

48
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,440
The

49
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,440
The

50
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,440
The

51
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,440
The

52
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,240
The

53
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,240
No matter what happens in the future,

54
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,240
I will always be by your side.

55
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,240
No matter what happens in the future,

56
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,240
I will always be by your side.

57
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,240
No matter what happens in the future,

58
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,240
I will always be by your side.

59
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,240
No matter what happens in the future,

60
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,240
I will always be by your side.

61
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,240
No matter what happens in the future,

62
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,240
I will always be by your side.

63
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,240
No matter what happens in the future,

64
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,240
I will always be by your side.

65
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,240
No matter what happens in the future,

66
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,240
I will always be by your side.

67
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,240
No matter what happens in the future,

68
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,240
I will always be by your side.

69
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,240
No matter what happens in the future,

70
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,240
I will always be by your side.

71
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,240
No matter what happens in the future,

72
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,240
I will always be by your side.

73
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,240
No matter what happens in the future,

74
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,240
I will always be by your side.

75
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
Yes, my Lord.

76
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
As your love,

77
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,240
I want you to marry me,

78
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
forever.

79
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Got it.

80
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,680
after this

81
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,240
You said you'd record talented songs with me.

82
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,240
Where are they?

83
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,400
Why hasn't he come yet?

84
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,960
Boss.

85
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,800
Is Boss not here?

86
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,720
Why did he close early today?

87
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,240
He went out for something.

88
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,320
He'll be back in the afternoon.

89
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,520
Master Yan.

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,760
It's you.

91
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,520
What if you and your master

92
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,760
all better dry over that fire?

93
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,440
There could be no trouble

94
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,800
since it happened today.

95
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,560
You killed people,

96
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,160
sold opium and soil to people.

97
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:27,800
It was you

98
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,640
who deserves the most mosque.

99
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,240
There are many people who deserve to be in the Guan family.

100
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
The one who deserves to die is Guan Xingkai.

101
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240
What do you mean?

102
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,140
Didn't you save Liang Man?

103
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,240
He didn't tell you?

104
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,040
That day before we arrived at the scene, Lan Yu was already dead.

105
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,440
The first person who was there was Kang Shao.

106
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,840
He was the brother's confidant.

107
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,040
And without Guan Xingkai, Lan Yu wouldn't have died.

108
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,140
Everything was because of him.

109
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,440
So Guan Xingkai is the one who deserves to die.

110
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,040
Also, think about it.

111
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,840
Lan Yu is just a playboy.

112
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,040
How can he be worthy of the family business of the Guan family?

113
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,640
If before he died,

114
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,840
he didn't take care of the Guan family's mother,

115
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,840
how can he be at ease?

116
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,840
You are about to die. Stop making a mess here.

117
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,440
Come.

118
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,240
You don't understand the Guan family's business.

119
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,440
Think about it.

120
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,640
If Guan Xingkai knows that his mother

121
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,440
was killed by his biological father

122
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,440
and it was also because of him,

123
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,840
what would he do?

124
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,440
You're so ridiculous.

125
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,280
You want to pour the dirty water of killing people

126
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,600
onto a dead person.

127
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,600
Who will believe you?

128
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,680
If you don't believe me,

129
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,120
you can ask Kang Shao.

130
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,520
Also,

131
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,720
isn't Liang Man your senior?

132
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,320
Ask her.

133
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,600
I'm counting the days.

134
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,800
She might be leaving the city.

135
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,320
If you don't ask her,

136
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,440
you won't get the answer.

137
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,320
See her off.

138
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,400
See her off.

139
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,820
Come on.

140
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:43,900
Fei qin.

141
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,620
I can only do

142
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,420
these for you.

143
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,440
Senior Sister.

144
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Senior Sister.

145
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,440
Senior Sister.

146
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,440
Senior Sister.

147
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,440
If this is true,

148
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,440
what should you do?

149
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,440
I...

150
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Lan Yu is a playboy.

151
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
How can he

152
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,440
stand the family business of the official?

153
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,440
If before my brother died,

154
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
he didn't take care of the official's

155
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
mother,

156
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
how can he

157
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,440
be at ease?

158
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
If Guan Xingkai knew

159
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,440
that his mother

160
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,440
was killed by his biological father,

161
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
and it was all because of him,

162
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,440
what would he do?

163
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
Master,

164
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
if your death is really because of Han Yang,

165
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,440
then you really have the wrong father

166
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
in the family business.

167
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
Don't worry.

168
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
I will figure out

169
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
what happened that day.

170
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,440
But...

171
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,440
I remember when I was a kid,

172
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,440
my father would watch the stars with his mother.

173
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Maybe it was fate that made it happen.

174
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
But now,

175
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,440
they are destined to be separated.

176
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Look, how bright it is.

177
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
But my father has always loved my mother.

178
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,440
Their love

179
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
is really wonderful.

180
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,440
I can't forget those scenes for the rest of my life.

181
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,440
I also hope

182
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,440
that I can always look forward to my love

183
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,440
to be as beautiful as theirs.

184
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
Although I was sent abroad when I was very young,

185
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,440
I had no relatives or country around me.

186
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,440
But that love

187
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,440
and warmth

188
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,440
have always been in my heart,

189
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
and it has been holding me until now.

190
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
I think the most lucky thing I have

191
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
is to die.

192
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
Xing Gan,

193
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,440
forgive me.

194
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,440
If that is the truth,

195
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,440
I can only leave you forever with him,

196
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,440
until I die.

197
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,440
I'm sorry.

198
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
I'm sorry.

199
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,440
I'm sorry.

200
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,440
I'm sorry.

201
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,440
I'm sorry.

202
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
I'm sorry.

204
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
I'm sorry.

205
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,440
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
I'm sorry.

207
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:43,000
You went into my Yasekai

208
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,080
Mr. Shen.

209
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,640
I heard everything

210
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,880
you talked to Mr. Guan.

211
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,520
If you don't want him to know the truth,

212
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,400
just stay away from me

213
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,960
and come with me to the Commandery Prince's Mansion.

214
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,040
Otherwise, I won't be able to keep my mouth shut

215
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,920
and I won't be able to leak out the truth.

216
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,480
Mr. Shen,

217
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,400
I'm sorry.

218
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,520
I'm sorry.

219
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,160
I'm sorry.

220
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:41,760
I'm sorry.

221
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,400
I'm sorry.

222
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,760
I'm sorry.

224
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,560
I'm sorry.

225
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
Besides,

226
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,480
you're the only one who knows about this.

227
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,560
You're willing to tell the outside world about this.

228
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,400
You...

229
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,680
I'll wait for your news.

230
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,480
This new prop is so beautiful.

231
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,760
It's so exquisite.

232
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,520
Chunxiang.

233
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,200
It looks so beautiful with this.

234
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,760
Hongmei.

235
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,000
Hong.

236
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,200
Come on. Come and have a look.

237
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,000
Xiao Yue.

238
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,160
What's this?

239
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,120
What's this?

240
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,080
It's a Western style.

241
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,000
It's a Western style.

242
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's so beautiful.

243
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,440
It looks like a flower.

244
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,240
It's so beautiful.

245
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,200
Yeah.

246
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,720
Put it here.

247
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,400
Come on.

248
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,080
What's this?

249
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,840
What's this?

250
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,000
So beautiful.

251
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:31,960
It's so beautiful.

252
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,000
Xiao Yue.

253
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
Let me introduce to you.

254
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,520
This is a high-end product.

255
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,680
My young master

256
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,920
has spent a lot of money

257
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,760
to bring it back.

258
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,480
I saw him going to his room just now.

259
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,560
So he can keep

260
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
people's voices

261
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,880
on this plate.

262
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,160
Let me show you.

263
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,920
Why didn't you go to the recording studio?

264
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,680
Are you really afraid that I won't buy the tickets?

265
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:19,880
Let's go.

266
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,960
I bought the record.

267
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,160
Let's go and have a look.

268
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,240
What's wrong?

269
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,240
It's all over now.

270
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,600
You can handle the rest of the things.

271
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,000
I don't want to be involved in it anymore.

272
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,000
What do you mean?

273
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,320
You're not going to be with me?

274
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,080
We're on different paths.

275
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,760
You're a noble son of a high-ranking official.

276
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,720
I'm just a playboy.

277
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,280
I'm just a playboy.

278
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,280
I'm just a playboy.

279
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,280
I'm just a playboy.

280
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,880
Mu Ling.

281
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,800
What's wrong with you today?

282
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,640
Shen Mu Ling?

283
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:23,840
Senior,

284
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,120
listen to the play.

285
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:28,680
Let's go.

286
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,240
Make it clear.

287
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:40,880
Did I scare you?

288
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,920
I was just playing a play.

289
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,080
Maybe I was in the play.

290
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,520
Yes.

291
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,840
My senior was in the play and she was like that.

292
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,440
I was often scared by her several times.

293
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,280
Don't be afraid, Young Master Guan.

294
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,680
Let's go.

295
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,920
Senior, when will our new play be released?

296
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,560
When?

297
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,360
In the play?

298
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,280
Was it in the play just now?

299
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,560
I'm sorry.

300
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,360
I'm sorry.

301
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,160
I'm sorry.

302
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,920
I'm sorry.

303
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,760
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
I'm sorry.

305
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
I'm sorry.

306
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,760
I'm sorry.

307
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
I'm sorry.

308
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
I'm sorry.

309
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,760
I'm sorry.

310
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,760
I'm sorry.

311
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,760
I'm sorry.

312
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,760
I'm sorry.

313
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
I'm sorry.

314
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,760
I'm sorry.

315
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
I'm sorry.

316
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
I'm sorry.

317
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
I'm sorry.

318
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
I'm sorry.

319
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
I'm sorry.

320
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,760
I'm sorry.

321
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
I'm sorry.

322
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
I'm sorry.

323
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
I'm sorry.

324
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
I'm sorry.

325
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
I'm sorry.

326
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,760
I'm sorry.

327
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
I'm sorry.

328
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,760
I'm sorry.

329
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
I'm sorry.

330
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,760
I'm sorry.

00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,760
I'm sorry.

332
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,760
I'm sorry.

333
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,760
I'm sorry.

334
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,760
I'm sorry.

335
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,760
I'm sorry.

336
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,760
I'm sorry.

337
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,760

358
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,760
I'm sorry.
