1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want to be with you.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I want to be with you.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I want to be with you.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to be with you.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I want to be with you.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I want to be with you.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I want to be with you.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to be with you.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I want to be with you.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I want to be with you.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I want to be with you.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I want to be with you.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I want to be with you.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want to be with you.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,500
Hugging each other, and bumping into each other endlessly.

16
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,200
Senior sister.

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:14,500
What?

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,800
I just got the news.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,600
Guan Qingyang committed suicide in the rain sprang.

20
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,800
What?

21
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,600
He initially thought he'll say he'll forgive himself by saying this.

22
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,100
But how could he suicide?

23
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,100
This matter,

24
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,300
Childe Kang will be a critical no型.

25
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,100
Xiao Yuan, find two people

26
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,260
to keep an eye on Kang Shang.

27
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,180
I promise.

28
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,220
Go.

29
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:33,620
Okay.

30
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,620
Before we're completely sure,

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,860
don't let Xingkai know about this.

32
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,340
If it's true,

33
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,940
I'll keep this secret a secret.

34
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:49,900
Brother,

35
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,900
you know I don't like Xizi.

36
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,260
Why did you bring her home?

37
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,820
Don't mention Xizi in front of me again.

38
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,020
She's your future sister-in-law.

39
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,700
You really want her to be my sister-in-law?

40
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,540
Have you thought about my feelings?

41
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,020
It won't take long.

42
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,820
You'll be married into the Guan family as you wish.

43
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,940
Shen Mulin can't pose any threat to you.

44
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,340
I've made up my mind.

45
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,260
Brother,

46
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,420
you've never understood me for so many years.

47
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,060
How many people in Rong City are so ambitious?

48
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,380
Is it not because of her that I, Xu Qingqing, can't be the one?

49
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,220
I'm doing this for you, Brother.

50
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,380
We've been friends since childhood.

51
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,060
All these years,

52
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,500
you've been fighting outside.

53
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,100
How many people were injured

54
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,740
and how many brothers were killed?

55
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,420
Do you think I don't know?

56
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,060
Every time you come back from a battle,

57
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,580
you'll lock yourself up in the study.

58
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,500
I know you're unhappy.

59
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,380
So I want to help you.

60
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,260
The Guan family has been married for a hundred years.

61
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,820
As long as I can marry you,

62
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,820
as long as I can marry into the Guan family,

63
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,780
she can do anything for our Xu family.

64
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,820
Do you understand?

65
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:37,820
Forget it.

66
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,700
You've never thought about getting to know me.

67
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,660
Let's have an interview later today.

68
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,780
I'm here to interview you, Mr. Xu Qingqing.

69
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,520
Why don't you introduce yourself?

70
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,100
Hello, Mr. Xu.

71
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,900
My name is...

72
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:07,660
Zhao Longjia.

73
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:07,980
Mr. Li.

74
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:11,900
I've…

75
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,380
Speak up.

76
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,380
It's not your turn to laugh.

77
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,180
How old are you?

78
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,380
How old are you two?

79
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,020
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,780
Yin said you were looking for me.

81
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,380
Who are you?

82
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:32,020
You don't need to care about who I am.

83
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,340
You just need to know one thing.

84
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,740
I can help you solve your big problem.

85
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,940
What a joke.

86
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,180
What's my big problem?

87
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,940
Shen Muling.

88
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,100
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,620
You think you can know her?

90
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,620
I can't.

91
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,860
But she is a woman of good character.

92
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,580
She had a relationship with a man from another family.

93
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,140
After she got many benefits,

94
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,860
she married Master Guan.

95
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,260
Master Guan is a man of good character.

96
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,780
He can't be too cruel.

97
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,580
He can't be too nice to her.

98
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,700
He is a man of good character.

99
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,460
He deserves it.

100
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,340
But why should I believe you?

101
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,260
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,460
I heard the army will hold the ceremony in a few days.

103
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,140
When the time comes,

104
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,620
you just need to pour the medicine

105
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,340
into Shen Muling's wine.

106
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,180
I will give you

107
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,500
the rest of the medicine

108
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,660
when you are satisfied.

109
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,340
The medicine?

110
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,380
Shen Muling.

111
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,260
Your time is up.

112
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,260
Thank you.

113
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,900
Miss Xu, please help us in the future.

114
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,100
Of course.

115
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,660
Thank you for coming to my reception.

116
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,500
Now the situation is so bad.

117
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,500
We need to work together.

118
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,260
You are all

119
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,780
the middle-class members of the industry.

120
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,860
We need to rely on you

121
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,540
to spend time together.

122
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,300
Great.

123
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,340
That's great.

124
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,740
The capital's government is preparing a feast.

125
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,260
Enjoy yourselves.

126
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,700
Please, Mr. Xu.

127
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,620
Mr. Xu is always a man of good character.

128
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,180
Now he has a family to accompany him.

129
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:42,260
It seems that good things are coming.

130
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,020
I'm glad to hear that.

131
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,700
Congratulations.

132
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,420
Congratulations.

133
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,300
Congratulations, Mr. Xu.

134
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:47,940
Congratulations, Mr. Xu.

135
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,740
I'm late.

136
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,220
Did you get any good news

137
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,900
from Mr. Xu and Mr. Shen?

138
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,700
Don't make fun of me, Mr. Kuan.

139
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,860
If you want to get good news,

140
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,820
it should be about you and Qingqing.

141
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,180
Qingqing,

142
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,940
your fiancee is here.

143
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:09,300
You've been waiting for her all night.

144
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,700
Don't tease me.

145
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,180
Xingkai,

146
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,020
don't listen to him.

147
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,300
Speaking of which,

148
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,900
I'm very familiar with Mr. Shen.

149
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,700
If we become a family in the future,

150
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,180
we'll be a family.

151
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,220
Mr. Kuan, you must be joking.

152
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,140
I do know you.

153
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,540
But I'm not familiar with you.

154
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,900
Sister Mu Ling,

155
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,220
I was ignorant before.

156
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,860
I thought you liked Xingkai

157
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,700
and that's why I was so rude to you.

158
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,220
Now that you're in the Commandery Prince's Mansion,

159
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,140
and you're my brother's lover,

160
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,820
we're a family, too.

161
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,740
So we should get along well,

162
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,540
right?

163
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,700
Sister Mu Ling,

164
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,540
if you're willing to forgive me

165
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,820
for not remembering our past,

166
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,140
then let's drink this toast

167
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,580
to forget our past

168
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,020
and forget our grudges.

169
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,820
What do you think?

170
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,460
Okay.

171
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,300
It's rare

172
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,380
to see you two drink together.

173
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,060
Why don't we

174
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,260
have a drink together?

175
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,060
Sure.

176
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,180
The King's Mansion

177
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,500
Mrs. Zhang,

178
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,180
we're not on good terms.

179
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,140
Mr. Kang is with Han Yang.

180
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,780
It's normal to have a connection with Mrs. Zhang.

181
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,700
Why do they

182
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,140
have to pull each other out of the mansion?

183
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,460
Fine.

184
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,140
Shen Mu Ling is really worth it.

185
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,580
I want him dead.

186
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,940
Fine.

187
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,180
Let him prepare more money.

188
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,540
Oh, no.

189
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,820
Sister.

190
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:34,900
Mu Ling,

191
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,060
would you like to dance with me

192
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,740
for the first opening dance?

193
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,540
Of course.

194
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,540
Brother Xing Kai,

195
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,940
won't you invite me?

196
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,220
Sure.

197
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,580
The King's Mansion

198
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,740
Don't worry.

199
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,260
Are you okay?

200
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:39,980
seismology

201
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,780
Mr. Shen, are you okay?

202
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,420
I'm fine.

203
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,380
I was a little dizzy

204
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,700
after drinking.

205
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,100
Let me take you back to your room.

206
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:53,860
No need.

207
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,300
You should be here

208
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,060
in this kind of situation.

209
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,100
You Su.

210
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,620
Take Mr. Shen back to his room

211
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,220
and have a good rest.

212
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:01,820
Yes.

213
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,420
Ying.

214
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,580
Help him.

215
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,180
Yes.

216
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,660
You Su.

217
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,860
You Su.

218
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:10,460
Yes.

219
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,180
You Su.

220
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,060
You Su.

221
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:12,740
You Su.

222
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,500
You Su.

223
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,260
You Su.

224
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,980
You Su.

225
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,820
You Su.

226
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,700
You Su.

227
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,580
You Su.

228
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,220
You Su.

229
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:18,980
Xingkang.

230
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,740
Have some more.

231
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,500
I've prepared some cold dishes over there.

232
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,500
Let's go and have a look.

233
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,220
Okay.

234
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:23,980
Okay.

235
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:24,740
Let's go.

236
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,700
You're really a good girl.

237
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:26,980
Let's go.

238
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,780
This way, please.

239
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:28,980
Miss Li.

240
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,340
You're really a good girl.

241
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,100
You're really a good girl.

242
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,060
What's going on?

243
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,860
What's going on?

244
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,740
What's going on?

245
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,020
Mr. Shen.

246
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,900
Are you all right?

247
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,180
I'm fine.

248
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,940
I'm just a little hot.

249
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,420
I can't breathe.

250
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:57,900
You Su.

251
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,540
Mr. Shen must be drunk.

252
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,780
Go to the kitchen and make a bowl of hangover soup.

253
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,180
I'll take him back to his room.

254
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:08,940
Mr. Shen.

255
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,860
You won't feel bad after drinking the hangover soup.

256
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,820
I'll go and get it.

257
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,580
Okay.

258
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,420
Okay.

259
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,060
I'll be right back.

260
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,060
I'll be right back.

261
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,660
Thank you.

262
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,220
Wait a minute, Ying.

263
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,420
What's wrong?

264
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:24,860
Your lady asked me to call you over.

265
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,540
That's impossible.

266
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,540
I have to send Mr. Shen back to his room.

267
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,660
Can't Mr. Shen go over there himself?

268
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:32,860
I'm leaving then.

269
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,100
I've brought the painting.

270
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,500
I'll be punished later anyway.

271
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,460
Wait.

272
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,020
Mr. Shen.

273
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,580
Can you go into the room yourself?

274
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,580
I'm fine.

275
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,540
Go ahead.

276
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,660
This is your room.

277
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,540
Miss.

278
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,500
Okay. Let's talk next time.

279
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,300
Okay.

280
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,460
He's sent to his room?

281
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,860
Miss.

282
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,820
What's the matter that you asked me to come here?

283
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,700
Who asked you?

284
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,340
Didn't you ask Chunsheng to call me here?

285
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,500
You useless thing.

286
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,220
Why can't you do anything about it?

287
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,060
Brother Xingkai just left with an excuse.

288
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,940
Chunsheng drove you away.

289
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,540
It's all over.

290
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,900
Help me get another one.

291
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,060
Hello.

292
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:56,860
Hello.

293
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,020
Where is Mr. Shen from Ruyi Theater?

294
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,420
Mr. Shen? I don't know.

295
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,700
Thank you.

296
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:05,540
You're welcome.

297
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,200
Yay!

298
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,580
The light never leaves

299
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,580
When a song is turned off, the song is heard

300
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,580
How lucky to be in the middle of the desert

301
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:28,580
The flower is like you, out of nowhere

302
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:35,580
The face in the ruins is clear

303
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:49,580
The Long Ballad
