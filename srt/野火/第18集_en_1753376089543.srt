I will never forget your kindness

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I will never forget your kindness

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I will never forget your kindness

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I will never forget your kindness

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I will never forget your kindness

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I will never forget your kindness

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I will never forget your kindness

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I will never forget your kindness

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I will never forget your kindness

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will never forget your kindness

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I will never forget your kindness

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Enjoy aこる caring love

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,400
O отвatching love

17
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,400
Young Master

18
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,400
How are you doing?

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,540
It's the elder daughter of judge Lv

20
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,920
Miss Xu,

21
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,760
I don't care what you do.

22
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,280
Within three days,

23
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,120
the two thousand silver dollars must be collected.

24
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,360
Otherwise,

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,400
I'll tell everyone

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,880
that you're the murderer.

27
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,560
Are you crazy? Three thousand silver dollars?

28
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,240
Do you think I'm a bank?

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,240
I can get as much as I want.

30
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,560
Fine.

31
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,600
Since you don't want to cooperate,

32
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,520
then let's wait for the truth.

33
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,840
Don't forget.

34
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,720
We're all on the same side.

35
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,080
You're also responsible for the death of the sword-laying man.

36
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,160
Don't forget.

37
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,600
You killed him.

38
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,600
It's him.

39
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,840
That girl is Shen Mulin's best junior.

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,240
Once the truth is out,

41
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,240
we'll all be in trouble.

42
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,120
If I'm in trouble,

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,960
don't think about the rest, Miss Xu.

44
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,680
Think about it.

45
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,040
Empty hand?

46
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,920
Yes.

47
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,840
That's right.

48
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,360
He's the one who said

49
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,240
that the mastermind is your father.

50
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,080
Let go of me.

51
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
Come.

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,760
It's Boss Shen.

53
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,520
We meet again.

54
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,800
Why are you so lucky?

55
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,640
What a pity.

56
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,400
Your junior

57
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,880
is not as lucky as you.

58
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,640
Tell me.

59
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,880
Did you kill him with Xu Qianqing?

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,760
Did you?

61
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,720
All the people in your theater should die.

62
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,200
You don't know that.

63
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,480
Bastard.

64
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,960
Bastard.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,720
Young Master Kong.

66
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,920
Long time no see.

67
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,760
Come in.

68
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,440
Brother, you want to see me?

69
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,880
Where did you go?

70
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,640
There are some new stores on the street.

71
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,840
I think they're pretty,

72
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,160
so I went to have a look.

73
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,760
Brother.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,280
You still think I'm your brother?

75
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:01,560
Tell me the truth.

76
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,760
What happened that night?

77
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,960
Brother, I didn't kill him.

78
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,320
It's Young Master Kong.

79
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,360
He wanted Shen Mulin's life.

80
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,000
I...

81
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,160
I just...

82
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,720
I just...

83
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,760
I just...

84
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,520
What?

85
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,320
I just gave him some medicine.

86
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,560
Officer Zhang.

87
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,160
Yes.

88
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,280
General, what's the matter?

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Take him back.

90
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,400
Lock him in the room.

91
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,760
And banish him from the Commandery Prince's Mansion.

92
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,280
Yes.

93
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,160
Brother.

94
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,520
No.

95
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,600
Brother.

96
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,320
Brother.

97
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,200
Miss.

98
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,040
Don't make him angry.

99
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Brother.

100
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
Go back to the room.

101
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,280
Brother, be careful.

102
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,280
Are you okay?

103
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,600
I'm here.

104
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,280
Miss,

105
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,800
remember to pass either both bags on him

106
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,200
first.

107
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,120
Or else there's nothing we can do.

108
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,520
Miss,

109
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,440
you do this to me both times.

110
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,720
At first,

111
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,040
it didn't mean anything.

112
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
But now,

113
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,480
I'll soon

114
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,720
have a Beijing butler that she can哎

115
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,440
Say it.

116
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,600
I'll say it.

117
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,440
I'm also under the order of others.

118
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,400
Boss Shen entered the Commandery Prince's Mansion.

119
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,760
Miss Xu didn't like him.

120
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,320
So she asked me to help her.

121
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,400
Who knew Xiao Yuan

122
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,200
broke in without any reason?

123
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,280
Miss Xu could only let me kill him.

124
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,360
Murderer!

125
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,800
Murderer!

126
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,080
I must kill you all!

127
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,040
What do you want?

128
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,920
Call the police?

129
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,280
Go!

130
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,240
Unless you two don't want to know

131
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,880
the truth of Lan Yu's death.

132
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,640
By the way,

133
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,080
I almost forgot

134
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,160
Lan Yu is your biological mother.

135
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,480
Who did this to my mother?

136
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,400
Say it!

137
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,120
Who did this to my mother?

138
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,160
Who?

139
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,080
You are.

140
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,240
To find out the answer is simple.

141
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,000
In this way,

142
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,520
let me go.

143
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,360
Besides,

144
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,120
prepare

145
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,120
a day after tomorrow.

146
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,240
The ticket that I sent the day after tomorrow

147
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,480
and 10,000 slight bonus.

148
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,120
I'm afraid...

149
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,720
What?

150
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,480
You don't want to?

151
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,280
Fine.

152
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,400
Let's make all the secrets

153
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,120
come down to hell with me.

154
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,400
Lord Dong Hua,

155
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,840
Kang Shuo has been arrested.

156
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,160
Excuses can't be kept to the end.

157
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,320
They're just lies.

158
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,960
Just make it clear,

159
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,140
and let the requests

160
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,640
of each one of you

161
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,680
stop.

162
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,320
No way.

163
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,440
I won't spare you two.

164
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,640
The poke sure lost the Rong Jinz�.

165
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:29,860
To a Medical Officer from the

166
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,660
Dongwoo's тысяч of dollars.

167
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:38,120
It's as if it isn't in the Third genres

168
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,120
that would be still around.

169
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,920
So as to be Same 많이

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,240
Have be like him

171
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,000
But if I examine him

172
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,080
Take advantage of this

173
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,920
Mr. Du,

174
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,340
if they're really different,

175
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,640
can someone tell me

176
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,240
what's going on?

177
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,160
Come here.

178
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,980
If you give me a time,

179
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,540
I'll send you back to the city.

180
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,720
If any situation

181
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:05,780
shows up in Xuzhu company,

182
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,740
and there's a custom in the neighborhood about a hunger strike,

183
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,020
I'll also send our men there.

184
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,180
What?!

185
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,920
But that's looking bad.

186
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,700
Just ask them probably,

187
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,340
and the men in West Lake

188
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,180
I hope

189
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,020
Xiao Yuan's death

190
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,260
can be changed.

191
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,100
If you and Guan Xingkai

192
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,820
want to hurt my sister...

193
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,340
Take my life.

194
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,060
Xu Dujun,

195
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,740
do you really think I dare not kill you?

196
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,660
You and Guan Xingkai are together.

197
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,340
What's the benefit of being

198
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:11,940
so shameless with me?

199
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,260
You can give up everything

200
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:20,660
to avenge your master

201
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,740
and Xiao Yuan

202
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,460
for your master

203
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,860
and Xiao Yuan.

204
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,780
I can also give up my life

205
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,060
to protect my sister.

206
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:33,180
Actually, we are all the same.

207
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,180
But we met too late.

208
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,460
If it had been earlier,

209
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,780
no one would have been

210
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,540
in the way between us.

211
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,780
Maybe the result would have been better.

212
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,260
It's us.

213
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,460
I'm sorry.

214
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,620
I can't accept your offer.

215
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,780
Your sister

216
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,580
is cruel,

217
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,100
overbearing,

218
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,180
and evil.

219
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,220
She has her own evil.

220
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,820
She should bear the consequences.

221
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,460
I can't forgive her for Xiao Yuan.

222
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,500
So,

223
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,380

224
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:22,100

00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,980
What can I do?

226
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,380
Where is he?

227
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,140
I'll go send an axle.

228
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,740
It's not like he wouldlived here.

229
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,700
Thank you for taking care of me.

230
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:43,980
We'll meet again.

231
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,260
Mu Ling.

232
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,780
If you still want to persuade me,

233
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,980
please don't ask.

234
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,580

Excellent.

Good.

244
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,180
Please take care of it.

245
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,140
Good.

246
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,980
You're quite smart.

247
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,460
If you leave like this,

248
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,460
where should I look for you?

249
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,820
What?

250
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,460
Sincerity.

251
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,540
You have my sincerity.

252
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,540
What about your voice?

253
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:14,940
Alright.

254
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,340
What do you want to ask?

255
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,860
Who killed my mother?

256
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,660
Do you think I'm stupid?

257
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,220
I'll tell you now.

258
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,980
Can I get out?

259
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,940
We'll talk when I get out.

260
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,420
How dare you play tricks on me?

261
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,380
What are you doing?

262
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,180
Don't be impulsive.

263
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,500
Don't come over.

264
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,540
How dare you play tricks on me?

265
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,460
What else do you want?

266
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,580
I can promise you anything.

267
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,940
Promise me?

268
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,700
Look at yourself.

269
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,980
How can you promise me?

270
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,020
Brother, it's him.

271
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,180
He tried to kill Boss Shen by casting a spell on Boss Shen.

272
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,940
He also killed Xiao Yuan.

273
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,140
I saw it with my own eyes.

274
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,180
Xuan Yue, are you crazy?

275
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,180
Brother.

276
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,220
He's a thief.

277
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,140
He broke into the Commandery Prince's Mansion

278
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,500
and killed the thief who escaped.

279
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,740
I'm catching the thief.

280
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,020
Commandery Prince Xu is so powerful.

281
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,980
If I'm not wrong,

282
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,380
you care about this woman, too.

283
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,140
How about this?

284
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,020
I'll give this woman to you.

285
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,020
What if you let me go?

286
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,620
Dream on.

287
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,700
I don't care about a mere play.

288
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,620
Just tell me the truth.

289
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,140
There's only a woman.

290
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,060
No.

291
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,060
Stop.

292
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,180
Let's go.

293
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:35,620
