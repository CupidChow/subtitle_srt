00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,440
Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,440
Episode 17

3
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,400
Senior Sister.

4
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,760
You're here.

5
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,720
You really have changed.

6
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,800
You've been having a hard time lately.

7
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,240
I always have to take care of your business.

8
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,160
Then I really have to thank you.

9
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,560
I remember that I was the one

10
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:47,580
who went out to sell the

11
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,180
I can't let you suffer like this.

12
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:51,980
Okay, Senior Sister.

13
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,460
Kneel down!

14
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,940
Call me Second Madam.

15
00:01:56,940 --> 00:02:00,660
What kind of person are you to try to get in my way?

16
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,460
Okay, Second Madam.

17
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,900
Father, it's okay.

18
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,540
Now, Boss Shen can hold it in much more than he did before.

19
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:39,420
Not long ago, there was endless scenery in this city.

20
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,140
Does this taste very good?

21
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,700
You want to kill me?

22
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,420
You want to kill me?

23
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,580
Do you think I don't hate you?

24
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,140
Why do you

25
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,180
have the highest standards?

26
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:55,700
Why do you have the highest standards?

27
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,060
I should have

28
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,220
burned you and Master to death

29
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,820
to quench your mother's love.

30
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,100
The people in the theater said

31
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,500
I was a lowly concubine.

32
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,020
Now,

33
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,340
you're a lowly concubine.

34
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,780
What did they say?

35
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,420
Look at my mouth.

36
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,460
I was wrong.

37
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,580
I'm a concubine.

38
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,500
I have a decent name.

39
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,740
But you, Boss Shen,

40
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,020
are just a toy

41
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,060
that others keep outside.

42
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,300
You're not even as good as me.

43
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,500
Yes.

44
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,100
Wait.

45
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,140
Kneel down.

46
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:22,460
The

47
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,220
What are you doing?

48
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:40,860
Second Madam.

49
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,940
Second Madam.

50
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:42,940
I'm sorry.

51
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,220
I didn't mean to.

52
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,820
Where is the Second Madam from?

53
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:46,980
You...

54
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,020
What's going on?

55
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,660
Madam.

56
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,540
It's all my fault.

57
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,700
I was too clumsy.

58
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,340
I made you angry.

59
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,700
Second Madam?

60
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,900
What do you mean?

61
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,100
There's only Second Madam in the House of Guan.

62
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,420
Where did you get her?

63
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,420
It seems that Second Madam

64
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,940
is really a sister in the garden.

65
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,780
A wife of a playboy.

66
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,300
She's so obsessed with the play.

67
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,020
Why did you come to the House of Guan?

68
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,020
Mrs. Zhang.

69
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:37,900
Yes.

70
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,460
Liang Man.

71
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,900
Since you married into the Guan family,

72
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,220
you should follow the rules of the Guan family.

73
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,940
Now,

74
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,620
Master is sick and in bed.

75
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,100
Xingkai just came back.

76
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,340
You should know the principle of

77
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,860
family and everything.

78
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,780
Madam.

79
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,780
It's him.

80
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,060
How dare you!

81
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,500
How dare you

82
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,820
say such a thing!

83
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,340
Second Madam just came to the House of Guan.

84
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,380
Mrs. Zhang.

85
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,940
It seems that you

86
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,140
don't teach the rules well enough.

87
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,580
Yes, Young Master.

88
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,060
Guards.

89
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,260
Take her away.

90
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,620
Yes.

91
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,460
Madam, I'm sorry.

92
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,100
Madam.

93
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,180
Madam.

94
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,500
I didn't do it. Madam.

95
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,620
Madam.

96
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,740
Madam.

97
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,220
Madam Liang is not a good girl.

98
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,740
From now on, you'll be punished to copy the Fahua Sutra.

99
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:27,460
You'll stay in the hall and reflect on your mistakes.

100
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,820
Senior Sister.

101
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,500
You have to hold on.

102
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,180
The play has just begun.

103
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,620
How dare you!

104
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,260
You dare to cause trouble to my woman.

105
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,580
Today, I'll take you back to the play.

106
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,460
Young Master Guan.

107
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,620
How dare you bully my woman?

108
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,420
You guys scold her.

109
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,740
When she's done,

110
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,700
she'll get 10 yuan less.

111
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,660
No wonder the Ruyi Theater

112
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,620
couldn't hold the stage.

113
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,700
It's a dead end.

114
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,180
Look at how you've been treated

115
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,860
by Boss Shen.

116
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,740
You're the only one

117
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,580
who knows how to harm others.

118
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,620
You're really a bad person.

119
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,420
Exactly.

120
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,580
You're so cruel.

121
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,660
You're ridiculous.

122
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,300
You're a little bit rude.

123
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,700
You're really like her father.

124
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,100
You've suffered a lot these years.

125
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,860
Get up.

126
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,260
You're just a playboy.

127
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,660
Look at this place.

128
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,980
Look at you.

129
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,700
You're a bad person.

130
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,020
You've suffered a lot.

131
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,900
You'll stay in the government for a few days.

132
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,500
I want to see

133
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,140
who dares to cause you trouble.

134
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,660
Get out of here.

135
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:39,540
You're a bad person.

136
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,820
Thank you, Young Master Guan.

137
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:42,100
Look at you.

138
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,300
Shen Mo Li.

139
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,060
Exactly.

140
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:46,340
Do you think you can avenge

141
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,220
your family by bullying them?

142
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,060
You're a bad person.

143
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,020
Don't blame yourself

144
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,820
for not knowing how we died.

145
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,580
Boss Shen.

146
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,180
There's someone outside.

147
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,060
Hurry, drink.

148
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,340
Is it an act?

149
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,500
Yes, we gave someone an eye flat deceived.

150
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,300
We can't explain

151
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,140
how bad it is now.

152
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,580
and then start wanting such things as

153
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,980
if Beiyan was water for two years

154
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,820
and only one person who could scare that,

155
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,060
how else would it last?

156
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:28,860
I remember Master used to like to live alone

157
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,860
in the school.

158
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,300
Boss Shen, tell me about my mother's past.

159
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,700
Stand up straight.

160
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,700
Stand up straight.

161
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,700
Master always told me

162
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,140
that the wind is not in the eyes of others,

163
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,220
but in the heart.

164
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,580
If you're too strong,

165
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,700
you'll suffer sooner or later.

166
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,060
Thank you.

167
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,020
Thank you for being with my mother

168
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,580
for so many years.

169
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:33,260
Since I was a child,

170
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,460
Master has always protected me.

171
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:37,500
But now,

172
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,580
no one in this world can protect me.

173
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,060
I'm sorry.

174
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,020
Don't cry.

175
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,500
I'll protect you in the future.

176
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,060
Sleep.

177
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,060
I'll protect you outside.

178
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,060
Master.

179
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,180
Master.

180
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,180
What's wrong with you?

181
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,980
Master.

182
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,740
Open your eyes and look at me.

183
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,980
What's going on?

184
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,980
Master.

185
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,580
Master!

186
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,060
Master!

187
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,860
Master!

188
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,580
Liang Man.

189
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,580
I should have killed Shen Mulin

190
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,300
together with you.

191
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,740
Look, I'm suffering.

192
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,300
Shee Ying Ling.

193
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:45,940
Please..

194
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,900
I'm sorry.

195
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,020
Be gentle.

196
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,420
Mr. Cheng,

197
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,940
you don't even care about him.

198
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,260
If that bitch keeps messing around,

199
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,580
I'll be in trouble sooner or later.

200
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,860
Ignore her.

201
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,820
What do you think this is?

202
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,940
Didn't the bowl of the bamboo

203
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,620
fall in Lanyu's room?

204
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,540
Where did you get it?

205
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,820
It's exactly the same as that one.

206
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,500
I'm sorry.

207
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,540
Mr. Cheng,

208
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,940
I know you're nice to me.

209
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,500
Otherwise,

210
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,900
you wouldn't have helped me get out of the theater

211
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,420
and made me come to the Guan family

212
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,300
to enjoy the luxury and wealth.

213
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,020
But I just can't stand

214
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,740
that old woman's face.

215
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,780
Can you take me away?

216
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,300
Wait a little longer.

217
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,620
The Guan family is going to change.

218
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,140
By then,

219
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,620
you can do whatever you want

220
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,980
as you like.

221
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,420
Change?

222
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,020
Greetings your Highness.

223
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:52,140
The wind and rain fall

224
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:56,140
The flowers fall like a smile

225
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,140
The noodles are embroidered

226
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,140
You have a long love and hate

227
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:07,140
I knew that I didn't like it

228
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:12,140
You are unwavering

229
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:17,140
When a song of parting is heard

230
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:21,140
In this life, don't cry and look at it

231
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:25,140
No sound, the shadow cries and turns into flowers

232
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:29,140
In the light, I will never leave

233
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:33,140
When a song of separation is heard

234
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,140
How much love is in the moon and the beach

235
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,140
The flowers are like you, out of nowhere

236
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:45,140
Your face is clear in the ruins
