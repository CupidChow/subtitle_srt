Eternal Love of Dream

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Xing Ke.

4
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Wake up, Xing Ke.

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Xing Ke.

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why are you still standing here?

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You're such a bad person.

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You made Xing Ke suffer.

9
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Get out of here.

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why did you do something wrong

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and blame it on others?

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You're a lowly woman.

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Why are you blaming me?

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Get out.

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Go.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Qingqing.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Qingqing.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Stop it.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
This is the hospital.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let me go.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Kang Shao has been arrested by the police.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You can ask him anything.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
As for him...

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Sorry.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Go.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Brother, let go.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I said let go.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Don't think I didn't see it.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You shot Guan Xing Ke with a gun.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
If the officials know about this,

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
let alone the engagement,

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
they'll punish you.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Brother.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll make Brother Xing Ke

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
change his mind and come back to me.

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I won't lose to that Xizi.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Are you crazy?

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Aunt.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You've disappointed me.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Xing Ke.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Xing Ke.

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Auntie is here.

73
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Mother.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's my fault.

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If I didn't force you

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
to marry Qingqing,

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
you wouldn't be like this.

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Mother.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Don't say that.

80
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
You'll be embarrassed.

81
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,760
This has nothing to do with Mu Ling.

82
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,360
You don't blame her.

83
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,640
It's all fate.

84
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,040
I've thought a lot

85
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,040
about the days when you were away.

86
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,480
You're my son.

87
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,280
If you're unhappy,

88
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,040
I won't feel good.

89
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,560
The Guan family is like an empty shell.

90
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,400
Since you and Miss Shen are in love,

91
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
how about this?

92
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,840
As long as Miss Shen

93
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,080
can promise you,

94
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,000
I'll give her the house of the Guan family.

95
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,680
Mother.

96
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,400
You mean...

97
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,120
I still feel...

98
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,320
I still feel embarrassed.

99
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,280
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

100
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,440
Go.

101
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,400
Don't you need to get up?

102
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,760
I'm leaving.

103
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,120
How is it?

104
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,240
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

105
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,040
What are you doing?

106
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:53,920
Nothing.

107
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,440
I'm happy.

108
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,600
I've changed a lot.

109
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,520
Stop.

110
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,440
Stop.

111
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,480
Stop.

112
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,320
Stop.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,920
Stop.

114
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,960
Not me.

115
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,920
Not me.

116
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,720
Stop.

117
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,960
how interesting.

118
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,720
Someone is cooking.

119
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,520
Here.

120
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:31,880
Here.

121
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,320
Do you want to eat it?

122
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:33,960
You eat it.

123
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,280
Young Master.

124
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,000
Young Master Kang

125
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,040
committed suicide.

126
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,600
And...

127
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,920
And what?

128
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,000
The medicine that the Chamber of Commerce sent to Jiangbei

129
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,960
might be received by Young Master.

130
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,320
This is the address and the code of all the warehouses in Jiangbei.

131
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,040
Where is Mr. Zhao?

132
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,480
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,400
I'm afraid I'll have to trouble you

134
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,320
in Jiangbei in the future.

135
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,400
Be careful in everything in the future.

136
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,160
Ye Hong.

137
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,240
Mr. Liu is so주 여기.

138
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,560
I think it won't be boring

139
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,000
even if we live together here,

140
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,720
right?

141
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,160
You heard me just now.

142
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,280
I know what you all are thinking.

143
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,600
And I'm sorry for that.

144
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,400
I deserve your shamedness.

145
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,960
At least you can have more confidence.

146
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,880
Not bad!

147
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:54,560
Well

148
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,040
Well

149
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,240
to go to the wedding, right?

150
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,640
By the way,

151
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,600
you were absent

152
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,720
at the last meeting

153
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,720
because of Mr. Zhang, right?

154
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,520
I should have

155
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,280
agreed to it then.

156
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:26,840
I'm here.

157
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,040
You take it for me.

158
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,440
Your wound hasn't healed yet.

159
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,440
My wound has healed.

160
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:30,960
Give it to me.

161
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,600
How can I let you do this?

162
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,680
Give it to me.

163
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,240
It's okay.

164
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,480
You two are fighting over it.

165
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,760
Your luggage

166
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,080
is almost stolen by you.

167
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,120
Help Young Master Guan take it.

168
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,040
Young Master Guan, let me do it.

169
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:45,560
Thank you.

170
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,040
Thank you.

171
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,640
Mr. Liu.

172
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,240
Your luggage.

173
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,840
Thank you.

174
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,440
It's okay.

175
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,120
It's okay.

176
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,720
It's okay.

177
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,240
It's okay.

178
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,560
It's okay.

179
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,280
It's okay.

180
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,960
It's okay.

181
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,520
It's okay.

182
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,160
Mr. Liu.

183
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,200
I haven't seen you for a while.

184
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,880
You two are close.

185
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,120
You look more like old friends.

186
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,600
This is...

187
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,480
It seems that

188
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,960
I can really drink

189
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,080
your wedding wine this time.

190
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,280
Come in.

191
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,520
Let's go.

192
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,400
What's wrong, Mu Ling?

193
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,960
I'm a little worried.

194
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,520
About what?

195
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,400
Don't worry.

196
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,400
Except for Mr. Liu,

197
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,200
no one here

198
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,240
knows our identity.

199
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,480
I put the street address here

200
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,320
to be safe.

201
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,960
After all, it's the first time.

202
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,680
I have to be careful.

203
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,200
I didn't mean that.

204
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,760
What is it?

205
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,720
I'm worried about you.

206
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,720
I'm worried about you.

207
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
I'm worried about you.

208
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,720
I'm worried about you.

209
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
I'm worried about you.

210
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,800
Ooo!

211
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,360
What's wrong?

212
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,800
Sun Yui.

213
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,560
You are all right.

214
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,480
I'm fine.

215
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,960
You didn't see me today.

216
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,000
I miss you.

217
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,040
How are you?

218
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:57,960
I'm fine.

219
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,120
Xinkai.

220
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:05,840
Can you promise me

221
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,880
that whatever I do in the future,

222
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,120
you must island my safety first?

223
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,440
I will always beievous.

224
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,720
I've checked. There's no problem.

225
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,040
Make sure the medicine is safe.

226
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,560
Send more people to keep an eye on it.

227
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,400
Yes, Young Master.

228
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,040
Please.

229
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,920
Sorry to keep you waiting.

230
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,880
The luggage is in the room.

231
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,920
Please follow me.

232
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:34,560
By the way,

233
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,040
I forgot to tell Young Master Guan and Boss Shen

234
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,800
that you two have been here

235
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,920
for a while.

236
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,520
It's been raining all the time.

237
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,600
Many of the rooms

238
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,360
are flooded.

239
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,400
We can't help anyone.

240
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,520
Now,

241
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,160
we can only make one room.

242
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,520
We'll have to share the room.

243
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,320
I wonder if you two...

244
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,080
The room is on the left.

245
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,240
It's okay.

246
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,440
Okay.

247
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,360
We're here.

248
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,840
I'll leave now.

249
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:03,800
If you need anything,

250
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,760
just tell me.

251
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,760
Thank you.

252
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,400
Thank you.

253
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,360
Why don't you come in?

254
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,160
Are you going to sleep outside tonight?

255
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,200
Guan Xingkai.

256
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,240
Go to sleep.

257
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,640
What about you?

258
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,960
I'll sleep on the sofa.

259
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,360
Let's talk tomorrow.

260
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,000
Have an early night.

261
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,960
Okay.

262
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,700
Should we go then?

263
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,000
Snowflakes, Being neighbour or far from each other

264
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,880
elling the lovesickness to

265
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,520
see through our fate

266
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,260
Is itD tickling in your face

267
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,960
is so clear
