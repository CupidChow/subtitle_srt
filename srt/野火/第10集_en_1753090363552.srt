00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The Legend of Chusen

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Episode 16

4
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Xing Ke!

5
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Guan Xing Ke!

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Wake up!

7
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Xing Ke!

8
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Xing Ke!

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Ah!

10
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Do you know how dangerous it was just now?

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I almost thought...

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Shen Meng Liang.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You don't care about your life,

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
which doesn't mean that nobody else cares about it.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What about Tang Hui?

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Where is he?

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
During the security period,

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
keep everything secret today.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Don't disclose anything.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,920
Liar.

21
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,520
I shouldn't have trusted you.

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,600
You're a liar.

23
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,000
Let me explain.

24
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,160
Qin Xian was in trouble at that time.

25
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,520
The theater last night

26
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,960
was also a temporary place.

27
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,440
What's this?

28
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,280
It's fake.

29
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,320
Someone invited Jin Ping to the court on purpose.

30
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,080
He's cheating on she's not,

31
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,800
which makes things complicated.

32
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,160
It's Bai Cheng.

33
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,400
So you're trying to

34
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,600
fix everything

35
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,280
by yourself and

36
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,200
I'll just take it.

37
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,520
Guan Qingyang has been married for many years.

38
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,280
He's very thoughtful.

39
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,120
If I don't risk it,

40
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,440
he won't show his feet.

41
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,600
From my mother

42
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,520
to Liang Man

43
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,480
and to Bai Xiaodi.

44
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:17,680
Zhusheng.

45
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,280
Young Master.

46
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,160
Take him back first.

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,200
Okay.

48
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,280
Come on.

49
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,760
Come on.

50
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,720
Think about it.

51
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,600
Don't be sold out.

52
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,560
You should count the money.

53
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,440
Let's go.

54
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,640
These people are

55
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,520
just dead men to the officials.

56
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,400
Only when they're in danger,

57
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,320
they can be taken back.

58
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,760
Mu Ling.

59
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,560
I know you've always wanted to avenge your master.

60
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,120
But it's too dangerous this time.

61
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,680
What do you think of

62
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,840
telling me?

63
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,240
I'll go with you.

64
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,760
But here,

65
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,480
only I can help you.

66
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,760
What about your reputation?

67
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,080
No.

68
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,040
Absolutely no.

69
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,800
Women's reputation

70
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,040
is not under Luo Qun.

71
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,560
Nor is it in the eyes of the world.

72
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,240
I know what I'm doing.

73
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,400
Butさらは

74
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,040
aş imprudent

75
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,980
will be

76
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,640
seen in sprinkle

77
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,060
by things

78
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,480
like

79
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,740
the

80
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,360
나는

81
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,200
canter.

82
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,400
Morning, Ms.ار.

83
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:54,960
Yes.

84
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,640
I've sent

85
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,640
Does Brother Xingkai

86
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,400
not remember my birthday today?

87
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,080
Why hasn't he come yet?

88
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,760
Mrs. Zhang.

89
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,760
Qingqing,

90
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,600
today is your birthday.

91
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,000
I'll give you this bracelet

92
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,200
on behalf of Xingkai.

93
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,600
When he's not busy,

94
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,160
I'll let him

95
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,440
prepare a gift

96
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,920
for you.

97
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,680
No, no, no, Aunt.

98
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,320
This is too important.

99
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:22,520
Come on.

100
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,080
I can't accept it.

101
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,320
You're his family.

102
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,040
Take it.

103
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,880
I really can't accept it, Aunt.

104
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,560
Qingqing.

105
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:27,920
Take it.

106
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,640
Brother.

107
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,760
Aunt is so kind.

108
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,600
Just take it.

109
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,520
Why are you here?

110
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,080
Didn't you say

111
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,240
something important

112
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
happened today?

113
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,240
If it's important,

114
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,720
your birthday is more important.

115
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,200
You're right.

116
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,680
Here you are.

117
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,440
What is it?

118
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,400
Open it.

119
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,160
Do you like it?

120
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,440
Let me put it on for you.

121
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,680
Mrs. Zhang.

122
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,360
Qingqing.

123
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,280
Well,

124
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,640
I'm a rough guy.

125
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,640
I'm not good at it.

126
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,240
Take it back to your room

127
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,440
and buy it yourself.

128
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,840
Aunt, I'm leaving.

129
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,640
Mr. Zhang, please have a seat.

130
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,280
I didn't expect

131
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,720
you to come here in person.

132
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,920
I've received

133
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,640
the painting you sent.

134
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,640
Don't worry.

135
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,840
In the Guan family,

136
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,360
marriage has always been

137
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,600
between parents.

138
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,960
It's the fate of parents

139
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,280
to get married.

140
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,680
This marriage

141
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,480
is a fixed marriage.

142
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,520
It's also the end

143
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,240
of the old master's wish.

144
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,600
I'm relieved to hear that.

145
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,920
Madam.

146
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:41,840
Madam.

147
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,880
You're so reckless.

148
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,840
How can you be so modest?

149
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,440
Really?

150
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:57,800
Leave us.

151
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,320
Yes.

152
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,120
Madam.

153
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,600
Nonsense!

154
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,800
How could Xingkai

155
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,200
elope with a playboy?

156
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,360
Tell me.

157
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,800
When did it happen?

158
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,920
Madam.

159
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:30,960
This morning,

160
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,600
Young Master went to the theater

161
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,400
for a while.

162
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,640
Boss Shen...

163
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,520
The theater director

164
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,720
quarreled with Young Master.

165
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,600
He said

166
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,160
you're getting married anyway.

167
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,400
Why did you come to the theater?

168
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,760
Young Master heard it

169
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,160
and got anxious.

170
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,480
He said marriage

171
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,760
is not his wish.

172
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,840
If he doesn't believe it,

173
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,080
they can elope

174
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,760
right away.

175
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,360
I heard it

176
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,400
and thought Young Master was joking.

177
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,680
I didn't expect

178
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,880
I saw this letter

179
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,240
in the theater.

180
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,640
Madam.

181
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,080
Did Young Master

182
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,880
really elope?

183
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:04,560
Nonsense!

184
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,960
Xingkai is the only son of the official.

185
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,800
He has been

186
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,160
different from others since childhood.

187
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,120
How could he

188
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,240
do that for a playboy?

189
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,320
How could he?

190
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,200
They...

191
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,120
They're both

192
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,920
so useless.

193
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,040
Madam.

194
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,200
Don't be angry.

195
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,280
Young Master...

196
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
He may have

197
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,280
his reasons.

198
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,840
And...

199
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,800
And you!

200
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,320
You don't follow the rules.

201
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,120
That's it.

202
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,120
You can't even

203
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,680
stop a person at the critical moment.

204
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,480
Guards!

205
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:37,880
Drag him out and beat him!

206
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:38,840
Madam!

207
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,360
Madam, I'm sorry!

208
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,800
Madam!

209
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,480
Madam!

210
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,560
Madam!

211
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,360
Stop it! Stop it!

212
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,920
Young Master.

213
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,600
Young Master.

214
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,520
You have to save me.

215
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,240
I didn't mean it.

216
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,320
I really didn't mean it.

217
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,360
Don't tell the truth.

218
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,160
Don't tell the truth.

219
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,280
No one can save you.

220
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,760
Tell me.

221
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,600
What's going on?

222
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,520
So,

223
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,480
they eloped first

224
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,000
and you met them.

225
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,080
You pushed them away.

226
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,680
Right?

227
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,920
Since the accident at the theater,

228
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,280
I've been worried about him.

229
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,760
Although a fake love letter

230
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,160
can make the party

231
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,240
in a mess,

232
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,200
Shen Mulin is alive.

233
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,920
As long as he's alive,

234
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,320
I can't be at ease.

235
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,120
So I followed him.

236
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,720
But I met two people eloping.

237
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,400
Young Master.

238
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,560
Young Master.

239
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,480
You didn't let me kill Young Master.

240
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,680
This time,

241
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,160
you have to save me.

242
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:55,880
Young Master.

243
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,080
You have to save me, Young Master.

244
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,720
It's okay. It's okay.

245
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,120
Come on.

246
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,000
Get up. Get up.

247
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,160
Get up.

248
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,320
Didn't you ask me

249
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,080
when I could take charge of the official family?

250
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,840
Now is the best time.

251
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
Look at you.

252
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,720
You take the last batch of goods

253
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,440
in the warehouse

254
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,960
and transport them away.

255
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,800
Then,

256
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,680
spread the news of their elopement.

257
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,560
Yes.

258
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,600
My good nephew.

259
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,200
I didn't force you to do that.

260
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,800
Just blame yourself.

261
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,640
It's been a long time

262
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,280
since we had such a leisure time.

263
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,200
I remember when we were young,

264
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,000
when the drama was over,

265
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,480
Master took us to the roof of the room.

266
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,240
Then we watched the stars together.

267
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,040
I've never used police or a GPS before.

268
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,840
I'm pretending that I didn't do that.

269
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,440
Herbal jam is cooked.

270
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,240
Congratulations.

271
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,240
Your 오늘 bokon

272
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,520
is ready.

273
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,120
Guan Xingkai.

274
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,400
Guan Xingkai!

275
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,280
Where are you?

276
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,520
When a song is turned off, the song is heard

277
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,520
How lucky to be in the middle of the sea

278
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,520
The flower is like you, indescribable

279
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:06,520
The face in the ruins is clear
