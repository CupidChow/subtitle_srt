1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want to be returned

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The path is too long

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Even if it's a little white

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's raining outside

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to meet you or love you

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
It's an accident

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm confused and I understand

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The sky is cloudy and the ground is dark

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I want to be with you forever

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The Long Ballad

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hello

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Mr. Liu's work

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Ruyi Theater is on fire

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
According to the real person, real poem, new acting, love and affection

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Hello

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Today is the birthday

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let me see

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I almost got it

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let me see

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I can't even get it right

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Is it good?

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Good

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's amazing

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Mr. Liu and Mr. Shen are in sync

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Amazing

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And more importantly

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The real person really changes this acrobat

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's really hard to hold the right number

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Really?

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Who?

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You don't even know

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The royal family's son-in-law, Jin Ping

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I heard that

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The royal family took him to the private meeting of the official

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
He met his ex-wife who had been in the cold for eight years

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The theater people couldn't get over it

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He was hit on the spot

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He deserves it

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Sister

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I have read the words you asked me to bring to Xu Dujun

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sister

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Today is the private meeting of the official

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I asked Xu Dujun to come

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Will it be appropriate?

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You will know later

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't think too much

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Everyone is waiting for the opera

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I will sing for you today

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What are you looking at? Move

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Madam

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Let go

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Madam

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let go

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I will smash this opera class

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Madam

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Calm down

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Everyone is singing

59
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Those ladies must be laughing at me

60
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
How can I calm down?

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If it's not because of you

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Forget it

63
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let go

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Madam

65
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Great

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Great

67
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I will see who can do it

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Madam

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Shen Muliang

70
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What?

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You have the guts to sing

72
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You don't have the guts to meet people?

73
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Madam Jin

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I am looking for you

75
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We have someone

76
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
who wants to talk to you

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What do you mean?

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I am looking for you

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I am looking for you

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What do you mean?

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Great

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I knew it was you

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I will kill you today

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't be angry

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I recognized Mr. Jin

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It's not fake

87
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I saw him hiding from me

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He became the son-in-law of Wang's family

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I gave him and hated him

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's not fake

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But I didn't get him involved

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He got me involved

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You are lying

95
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I proposed to you to break off the engagement

96
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
in the countryside

97
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You got me involved

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Now I am so tolerant

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
But you want to hurt me

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You even made a big play to slander me

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You are so mean

102
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Madam

103
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
No wonder you are a drunkard

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Mr. Jin

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I want to ask what this is

106
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What is this?

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What is this?

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What is this?

109
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What is this?

110
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Look

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Look

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Look

113
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What is this?

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What is this?

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's a fake

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's so disgusting

117
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's not fake

118
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
He is so shameless

119
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What is this?

120
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He wants money

121
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What is this?

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What is this?

123
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
It's a white face

124
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He is so shameless

125
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I will give it to you

126
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I will give it to you

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's disgusting

128
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Madam

129
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You and Mr. Jin got married

130
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Mr. Jin often wrote me letters

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He didn't care about the outside world

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
He just wanted to learn

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
After I met Mr. Jin

134
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
He saw me singing and acting

135
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He mocked me and said

136
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
If I wanted to

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
He could treat me as an outsider

138
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Then he and I should get along

139
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
We should get the royal property

140
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Madam

141
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I will be your wife

142
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yes

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Madam Jin

144
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I will not be your father

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
On the contrary

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I don't want to see you, me or any girl in Rong City

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
be fooled by him

148
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And then I will be humiliated

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Madam

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We are not wrong

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
He is the one who is wrong

152
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Yes

153
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Madam

154
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Listen to me

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Everyone

156
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
We have been in the business for years

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We value the dignity

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I was so ungrateful

159
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Now I can't let such a man

160
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
who is so ungrateful

161
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
ruin our reputation

162
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Today

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Today

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I will be your witness

165
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I will be your husband

166
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
From now on

167
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Our family will be cut off

168
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Madam

169
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Madam

170
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What are you doing?

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This is not a man

172
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I will pay for it

173
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
How can this be?

174
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What?

175
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
How can this be?

176
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Madam, please forgive us

177
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What are you doing?

178
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Madam

179
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Madam

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Madam

181
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Madam

182
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Madam

183
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Madam

184
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Madam

185
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is it good?

186
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Good

187
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Good

188
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's good

189
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't know which one is the play today

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But this time

191
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I really want to thank young master Guan

192
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If it weren't for young master Guan

193
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
My girl

194
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
may still be in the dark

195
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Come

196
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I propose a toast to you

197
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't dare

198
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I am always grateful to those seniors

199
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
It's my honor to be able to help them

200
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Why?

201
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You still think about the meeting?

202
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Xingkai

203
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I tell you the truth

204
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
If it weren't for this accident

205
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I think

206
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
it would be difficult

207
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Of course

208
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Of course

209
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's not that we old antiques want to save

210
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's really a mess

211
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's not worth it

212
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Boss Wang is right

213
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But I think

214
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
We should help the group to warm up

215
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Today is the day of my senior's passing

216
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Who's going to be the next day?

217
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But as long as everyone is in the job

218
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
We will have the day to disperse

219
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
A few seniors in the business field

220
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I have been through many hardships

221
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I have more experience than me

222
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I think

223
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I should be more familiar with this

224
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The meeting is not over yet

225
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Good

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Good

227
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You are so young

228
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
How about this?

229
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Think about it

230
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
We old antiques

231
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You will take care of this

232
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What do you think?

233
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Thank you

234
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I will not let you down

235
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Good

236
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Good

237
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Come

238
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Young master Guan

239
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I heard that young master Guan is going to marry boss Shen

240
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
When will the wedding be fixed?

241
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Not yet

242
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't think it's a good idea

243
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
It depends on him

244
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Good

245
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Come

246
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Good

247
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Don't be afraid

248
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Tell me when you are ready

249
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I can wait

250
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I heard that the meeting is in a hurry

251
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What do you think about this?

252
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I heard that young master Guan proposed to boss Shen in public

253
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Is this true?

254
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Yes

255
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Please come back

256
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Don't go any further

257
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Young master Guan

258
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Do you need to die?

259
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Young master Guan

260
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I can answer your question today

261
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Since everyone cares about my private life

262
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I will clarify it again today

263
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I have no relationship with young master Guan Xingkai

264
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I will tell you the truth

265
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I like someone else

266
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What are you doing?

267
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You are here

268
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I am late for some work

269
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I am not late

270
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What are you doing?

271
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Are you ok?

272
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Do you have any difficulties?

273
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Shen Muli

274
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Are you lying to me?

275
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Young master Guan

276
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I have always been a playboy with you

277
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
There is nothing real in a play

278
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I can only blame you for being too deep in the play

279
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Let's go

280
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Look

281
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I am here

282
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I am late

283
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I am late

284
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I am late

285
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I am late

286
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I am late

287
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I am late

288
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000

291
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I am late

292
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000

293
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000

294
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000

295
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I am late

296
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I am late

297
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I am late

298
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I am late

299
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I am late

300
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000

310
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I am late

311
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
