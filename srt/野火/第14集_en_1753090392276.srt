1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want to be with you.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I want to be with you.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I want to be with you.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to be with you.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I want to be with you.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I want to be with you.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I want to be with you.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to be with you.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I want to be with you.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I want to be with you.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I want to be with you.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I want to be with you.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I want to be with you.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want to be with you.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I want to be with you.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Get off.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
If you still miss your ex-girlfriend,

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
you can go back now.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Since I promised,

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I will follow you.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I won't go back easily.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Besides,

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
you should thank me.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If I didn't make the decision,

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
you and Miss Xu

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
don't know when you can touch the door of the official's house.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You are really smart.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Boss Shen invited me

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
to attend the meeting of Master Guan.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Senior said

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
it must be what the Lord of the City wants the most.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I remember

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Lord of the City said before

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
that as long as I have nothing to do with the official,

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
you will set up a stage for me

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
in the Lord of the City's mansion.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Does that count?

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Of course.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The Lord of the City will be your backer.

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Whether it's me

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
or other members of the Lord of the City,

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I won't ask you for money.

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Thank you, Lord of the City.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Shut up!

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Boss Shen?

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What do you mean?

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I invited Mr. Kang here today

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
just to ask you one thing.

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Did Guan Hanyang kill my master?

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Boss Shen,

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
you know that

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I've been with the Lord for so many years.

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
My master has been working hard for so many years.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He doesn't even deserve an answer.

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Boss Shen,

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
what are you doing?

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Guan Hanyang is dead.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I can't get revenge on him.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I just want an answer.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
How about this?

64
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
As long as you tell me the truth,

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'll get my revenge.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
My master was very young

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
and was very stubborn.

68
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But after so many years,

69
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
he has changed.

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
My master has grown up.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
He has been sick for a long time.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He will inherit the family business.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The existence of Lan Yu

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
has become the biggest wild problem.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
As long as the future master of the Guan family

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
is Guan Xingkai,

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Lan Yu must die.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The Guan family doesn't allow

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
the mother of the master of the family

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
to be a playboy.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Boss Shen,

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I can see that

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
you love Young Master very much.

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But you should understand that

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
if he knows that

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
his mother's death

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
was caused by his father,

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and he is willing to die for him,

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I think he will have a hard life.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
According to the autopsy report,

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
the victim died of

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
excessive opium.

93
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But it's strange that

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
the victim didn't have the habit

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
of taking opium and opium in his life.

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Opium.

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Opium again.

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
So,

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
the death of him and my father

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
is the same as the death of my father.

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I think

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
the death of him and my father

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
is the same as the death of Guan Qingyang

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
in the prison.

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Who is behind this?

106
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Tell me.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That day,

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
when they found two bodies

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
in the small courtyard of the southern suburb,

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
someone said that

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Boss Shen was also at the crime scene.

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You still want to catch him?

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No.

114
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm just telling you.

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But the police station

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
has to make a report, right?

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If one day,

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Boss Shen is asked to come here,

119
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
we should...

120
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Then you should thank me.

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I can go to help you

122
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
to find out the truth.

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
After all,

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I have something to ask him.

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Boss Shen.

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Come in.

127
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You are...

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm Liu Su.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Mr. Xu told me

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
to take you back to rest.

131
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'll pick you up after I finish my work.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Let me do it.

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Boss Shen, please rest assured.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You'll be used to it in the future.

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This way, please.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Boss Shen, please come with me.

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Boss Shen,

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
the first floor is our living room

139
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and the dining room.

140
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The office of the capital is on the first floor.

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The capital's bedroom is here.

142
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The big lady's bedroom is here.

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Boss Shen,

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
please stay on the second floor for now.

145
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
When the time comes,

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
you can marry the capital.

147
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Who said she could marry my brother?

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Miss, I'm asking you.

149
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Don't you know the rules?

150
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I...

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Miss, I'm sorry.

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Please spare my life.

153
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Since you know your mistake,

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
why don't you open your mouth?

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I...

156
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Wait.

157
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Mr. Xu,

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Miss Xu,

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
if you have any problem,

162
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
just come at me.

163
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Don't make it hard for a servant.

164
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Fine.

165
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Since Boss Shen wants to marry into the capital,

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll teach Boss Shen

167
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
the rules of the capital.

168
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Guards,

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
put him under my arm

170
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and slap his mouth.

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You can't hit him.

172
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You can't hit him.

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Why are you standing there?

174
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Go on.

175
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Go.

176
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Why are you here?

177
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm here to see

178
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
how you're doing after I left.

179
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It seems you're not doing well.

180
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Brother Xingkang.

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
If you dare to go any further,

182
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't mind

183
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
the bloodshed in the capital.

184
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Where's the medicine box?

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Upstairs.

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Mr. Guan,

187
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll take you there.

188
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
This way.

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Go out and close the door.

190
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What are you doing?

191
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What are you doing?

192
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
This...

193
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What are you doing?

194
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Boss Shen.

195
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Boss Shen.

202
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You should thank me.

203
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I saved your life just now.

204
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You didn't have to do this.

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This is in the Commandery Prince's Mansion,

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
not in the Guan's Mansion.

207
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
For Yan Shu's sake,

208
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Miss Xu wouldn't have done anything to me.

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yan Shu?

210
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't know

211
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
when Boss Shen and the Commandery Prince

212
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
became so close.

213
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
When did it start?

214
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
When we were hitting the factory,

215
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
or when Xiaoyun was in trouble?

216
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
This is my private matter.

217
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I don't need to explain it to you.

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What on earth is it

219
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
that you insist on staying with him?

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What are you doing?

221
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Let go of me!

222
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'll let Boss Shen know today

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
what a real private matter is.

224
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Let go of me!

225
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Let go of me!

226
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Let go of me!

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Then kill me.

228
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Let go of me!

229
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Let go of me!

230
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Why?

231
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Don't you understand?

232
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I never really treated you sincerely.

233
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I was just acting.

234
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It was because of Master.

235
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Now I have a great revenge.

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
So I'm going to find my own reward.

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Can't I?

238
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What about Na Lian Man?

239
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You know she's dead,

240
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
but you don't tell me.

241
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Mo Lian,

242
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
we agreed

243
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
that we would face everything together.

244
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Mo Lian,

245
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
why are you leaving me alone now?

246
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I have nothing to say.

247
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Just go.

248
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Boss Shen means to ask you to leave.

249
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Don't you understand?

250
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Please.

251
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Are you all right?

252
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Boss Shen,

253
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I think Young Master Guan

254
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
seems to be quite caring to you.

255
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Why are you...

256
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
You're so lucky.

257
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Why can't God

258
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
treat him better?

259
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You suffered today too.

260
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Go back and rest early.

261
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Take this back.

262
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's the secret medicine of the Guan family.

263
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'll take it.

264
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Why is he so talented?

265
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Why does he miss the long night market?

266
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Why is he so worried?

267
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What's wrong with you?

268
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Tell him

269
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,120
You nabbed my men!

270
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,360
Let go of me!

271
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,080
My beauty.

272
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,080
My beauty, my beauty.

273
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,080
Let go of me!

274
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,080
Don't make things hard for me, the little police chief.

275
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:30,080
I wish I could die without regret.

276
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,080
You are the only thing I want to say.

277
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,080
When a song of parting is heard.

278
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,080
I want to cry and look at you.

279
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,080
The sound of the flute is bitter.

280
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,080
The light is always on.

281
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,080
When a song of sad songs is heard.

282
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,080
How lucky to be in the middle of the desert.

283
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,080
The flower is like you, out of nowhere.

284
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:10,080
The face in the ruins is clear.

285
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,080
The song of parting is bitter.

286
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,080
The light is always on.

287
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,080
The flower is like you, out of nowhere.

288
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,080
The face in the ruins is clear.

289
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,080
The face in the ruins is clear.

290
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,080
The face in the ruins is clear.

291
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,080
The face in the ruins is clear.

292
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,080
The face in the ruins is clear.

293
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:52,080
The face in the ruins is clear.
