1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
No B lunch

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,200
to be with you forever.

3
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,600
Tonight,

4
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,640
the fire of Ruyi Branch

5
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,360
will shock the whole city.

6
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,160
It's on fire!

7
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,920
The red-hot bomb Lan Yu

8
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,520
was killed in the fire.

9
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,000
The murderer is his apprentice,

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,600
Shen Muling.

11
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,200
He claimed that he didn't do it,

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,080
but he also said it.

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Master!

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Master!

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Master!

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Master!

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Master!

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Master!

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Master!

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Senior Sister,

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
what's going on?

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Shen Muling

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
is a cruel and ungrateful beast.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Chief,

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
it's him.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Go!

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes!

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I heard Shen Muling

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
and my master

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
having a big fight before I went up to the stage.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But the theater turned into a fire,

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
and burned the master's yard.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If the murderer is not him,

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
who else can it be?

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Junior Sister,

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
it seems that

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
you are not confident

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
about this troupe.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm not.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You don't have your own thoughts

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
about this troupe.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You have thoughts

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
about the leader of the troupe.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The leader of the troupe, Shen Muling,

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
was set on fire and killed on purpose.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Take her away!

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Boss Shen,

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
do you admit it or not?

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I said it.

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's not me.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's not me!

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Who are you?

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Master Guan,

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
you just came back from Liuyang.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You may not know.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The one next door is in Rong City.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He is the leader of the troupe.

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He is the leader of the troupe.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He is the leader of the troupe.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He is the leader of the troupe.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If you don't take him away,

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
how many young men

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
in Rong City

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
can't replace him?

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I think

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
if you like him,

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
we can...

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I want him.

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Master Guan.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Hmm.

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Sorry to bother you.

72
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's my pleasure.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What's up?

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Do you like Boss Shen?

75
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I heard about you.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You don't want to live?

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What's wrong with him?

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He is not a good man.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Excuse me.

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
My master, Guan Hanyang,

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
will marry Kunlun Liang Man.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
News!

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Boss Shen?

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Why are you here?

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Let's go.

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Okay.

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm afraid

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Boss Shen will not be able to

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
live in Rong City.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Stop, Shen Muliang!

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You are a murderer.

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Don't try to take a step forward.

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I haven't checked the details.

95
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You should be punished.

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Stop talking nonsense.

97
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Get out!

98
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Get out of the Yixiyuan.

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yixiyuan is lively today.

100
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
But today,

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I not only want him to come back,

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I also want him to be the leader of the troupe.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Let go of me.

104
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You are not

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
dead enough.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Let's go.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What's going on?

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It seems that I can come out alive

109
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
because of Guan Xinggan.

110
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But why did he do that?

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's my honor

112
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
to have a word with Boss Shen today.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm not going to the Yixiyuan

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
tonight.

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm going to the Yixiyuan.

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm going to the Yixiyuan.

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's different now.

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Thank you, Young Master Guan.

119
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Please have some tea.

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Boss Shen can be so

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
careful.

122
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
He doesn't even have a chance to check the details.

123
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Is there anything else?

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I've been thinking these days

125
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
that I'm a playwright

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
and a poet who has a history of killing.

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
How can I live with this?

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What do you mean?

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
There must be a master behind it.

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
He must be the first person

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I saw when I came back to the Yixiyuan.

132
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Young Master Guan, you.

133
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
How are you going to

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
repay me?

135
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You haven't repaid me much.

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Since Young Master Guan has spent so much time

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
on me,

138
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm sure it's useful to you.

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The government will hold a banquet in three days.

140
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I want to ask Boss Shen to sing.

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Young Master Guan.

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If I say I admire Boss Shen,

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
will you be willing to believe it?

144
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm just a playwright.

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Don't make fun of me.

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm here to help you.

147
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But you have to pay

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
back what you owe me.

149
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Boss Shen has experienced such a thing.

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He's still so calm.

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It's quite eye-opening.

152
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Let's wait and see.

153
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Let's go.

154
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Shen Muliang?

155
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Didn't he kill Lan Yue?

156
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
How did he come out so suddenly?

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You can't even tell?

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He's playing the role of Young Master Guan.

159
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The play is all

160
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
a joke.

161
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The old ones were all just pretending.

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Young Master Guan is also ridiculous.

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
But with Shen Muliang,

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
he can only be the outsider of the government.

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He's just a playwright.

166
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
He's just a playwright.

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
He's just a playwright.

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He's just a playwright.

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Xingkai is really a child of

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
the elder brother and the younger sister.

171
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
He's very similar to the elder brother.

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I remember that the elder brother

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
was also obsessed with the playwright.

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He was obsessed with the playwright.

175
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Young Master, you're so wise.

176
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Xingkai, you're here.

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Sit down.

178
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What are you talking about with your mother?

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's so lively.

180
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Nothing.

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
But you,

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
you're the eldest young master of the Guan family.

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It's not good to be so ridiculous every day.

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Mother,

185
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
don't worry.

186
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I won't let those who are not

187
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
honest to themselves have a chance.

188
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Look, Xingkai is so successful.

189
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Why isn't Shen Muliang here?

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Where is he?

191
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Second Aunt, you're so lucky.

192
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I heard that Young Master

193
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
specially invited a playwright to live in the alley.

194
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
A playwright?

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Which playwright?

196
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It's Shen Muliang,

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
the playwright you used to play.

198
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
How dare you!

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Why are you standing there?

200
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Go change the playwright.

201
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yes.

202
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Why are you standing there?

203
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Go!

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes.

205
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What's going on?

206
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
How could it be him?

207
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
He's not dead yet.

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's impossible.

209
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
How could he come to the Guan family to play?

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Senior Sister,

211
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
how are you?

212
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Why are you so surprised?

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
What?

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You don't want to see me on your wedding day?

215
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Or you have feelings for me?

216
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Gu Yao.

217
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Tell me.

218
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Which eye saw me kill Master?

219
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
When it was on fire,

220
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
only you and Master were in the room.

221
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
So many pairs of eyes

222
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
were watching.

223
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Senior Sister,

224
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
for such a small fame,

225
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
even your own master

226
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
could bear to kill him.

227
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You're so cruel.

228
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Someone is coming!

229
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What's wrong?

230
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Let's go and check.

231
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
As long as I find out

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
that Master's death is related to you,

233
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'll let you see

234
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
what's really cruel.

235
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Where is he?

236
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He disappeared so quickly.

237
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You go over there.

238
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yes.

239
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Master Shen is really bold.

240
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Why are you here?

241
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
If I remember correctly,

242
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
the stage play is not in the room of the second stage.

243
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What are you doing?

244
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's really here.

245
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Master's jade pendant.

246
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Why is the other half with you?

247
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Lan Yu is my mother.

248
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Why do you think

249
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
the other half is with me?

250
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The fire burns the tears.

251
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Thousands of lives are calling for the truth.

252
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
The wind and rain fall.

253
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The flowers fall like the smile.

254
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
The noodles are being cooked.

255
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You have been loving me for too long.

256
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I should have known that you were so kind.

257
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I should have known that you were so kind.

258
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You are so kind.

259
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
When a song of parting is heard,

260
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I want to cry and look at you.

261
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The sound of the flute is like a flower.

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
We will never leave each other in the fire.

263
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
When a song of parting is heard,

264
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I want to cry and look at you.

265
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The sound of the flute is like a flower.

266
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Your face is clear.

267
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The End
