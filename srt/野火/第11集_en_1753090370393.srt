1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm afraid I can't protect you from the danger of death.

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm afraid I can't protect you from the danger of death.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm afraid I can't protect you from the danger of death.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm afraid I can't protect you from the danger of death.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm afraid I can't protect you from the danger of death.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm afraid I can't protect you from the danger of death.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm afraid I can't protect you from the danger of death.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I'm afraid I can't protect you from the danger of death.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm afraid I can't protect you from the danger of death.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm afraid I can't protect you from the danger of death.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Gang Master

12
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Episode 48

13
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,700
— disturbing my husband's home? — That's right.

14
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,200
His past was expatriate of the 31 of the Great Valor.

15
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,800
I wanted to ask him to leave the mountain

16
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,100
and write Xiyuan's story into the Great Valor.

17
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,200
But you also know that his past is already closed.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,440
Mr. Liu and I are old friends.

19
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,960
No matter what,

20
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,880
as long as you like it,

21
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,160
we'll try it.

22
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,200
The weather is beautiful,

23
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,480
the world is beautiful.

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,040
This is also the rumor

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,120
about us running away.

26
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,240
Let's go.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,640
Come on.

28
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,200
It's cold at night.

29
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,440
You should dress more.

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,400
No need to see me off.

31
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,000
Brother,

32
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,120
we'll leave now.

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:13,800
Mr. Liu,

34
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,720
you should go back to your work.

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,240
Okay.

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,080
Take care.

37
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,760
Yes.

38
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,160
See you.

39
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,520
See you.

40
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,000
It seems that many families are clear-minded

41
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,200
and know that Mr. Liu will be back to the official family sooner or later.

42
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,920
Congratulations, Mr. Liu.

43
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,360
You've made a great achievement.

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,480
I'm afraid that

45
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,280
people outside the door can understand it.

46
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,200
People in the door are still confused.

47
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,120
Recently,

48
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,120
have those people said anything?

49
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,560
That night,

50
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,640
when Mr. Liu heard the news,

51
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,360
he was so angry that he couldn't get up.

52
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,600
The fourth room stood in the yard

53
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,480
and scolded him.

54
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,440
But

55
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,920
I got a news.

56
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,400
Tell me.

57
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,640
Madam killed Master.

58
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,200
What did you say?

59
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,280
Mr. Liu,

60
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,560
please forgive me.

61
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,000
Madam wants you

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:54,480
to extinguish this same lamp

63
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,280
to warm her sweat.

64
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,560
I've lost weight.

65
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,260
Nana,

66
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,620
take good care of yourself.

67
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
I promise.

68
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,160
Brother 했iang

69
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,900
will ask for a help soon.

70
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,380
It's something important.

71
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,900
Recently,

72
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,000
you have dust on your face.

73
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,860
You're not home.

74
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,380
I see you've lost weight.

75
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,420
I'm back.

76
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,740
I'm leaving the city.

77
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,780
I heard that Lingquan Temple is in a good mood

78
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,380
and is in a good mood.

79
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,060
Qingqing.

80
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,700
Peiqin.

81
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,700
Mr. Cheng.

82
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,100
We are brothers-in-law.

83
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,420
You should be careful of your health.

84
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,380
Don't make it too hard for me.

85
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,220
Peiqin.

86
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,500
You can't be so cold to me.

87
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,180
Mr. Cheng.

88
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,100
The total price of the gift is 21...

89
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,740
Get out!

90
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,420
The new play of Mu Ling has been written.

91
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,620
When are you going to go back?

92
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,780
Not now.

93
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,700
Xingkai.

94
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,860
Whether it's chess or the form,

95
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,260
you always like to play the game.

96
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,020
But this time,

97
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,540
you are facing your uncle.

98
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,180
You should

99
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,460
be careful.

100
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,420
You are born to be a man of your word.

101
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,300
Mr. Liao.

102
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,620
You lost.

103
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,980
Good.

104
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,220
I'm glad you know it.

105
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,820
I was careless.

106
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,660
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,340
Young Master.

108
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,180
Okay, Young Master.

109
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,380
What's wrong?

110
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,180
Has anything changed?

111
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,260
Nothing.

112
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,940
The official family is under

113
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,180
my uncle's control.

114
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,060
I'm afraid...

115
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,380
Mu Ling.

116
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,380
From now on,

117
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,220
all the promises we made

118
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,220
are not valid.

119
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,900
You can choose again.

120
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,980
But no matter what,

121
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,540
I won't blame you.

122
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,220
What to do?

123
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,820
If you have any decision,

124
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,740
show me.

125
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,620
Okay.

126
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,060
It doesn't matter.

127
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,940
When I go back,

128
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,140
if you are questioned,

129
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,300
I will say I have been released...

130
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:46,940
I've packed my things.

131
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:47,860
Let's go.

132
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,140
Let's go.

133
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,540
Let's go.

134
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:54,140
Let's go.

135
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,580
Who are you?

136
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,180
What are you doing?

137
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,380
Do you know where we are?

138
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,500
It's early in the morning.

139
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,380
Why are you making a fuss here?

140
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,500
Madam,

141
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,140
I don't know what they are doing.

142
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,580
They are coming to our mansion.

143
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,020
What are you doing?

144
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,500
Madam.

145
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,940
Mr. Cheng.

146
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,380
Mr. Cheng, you are so cunning.

147
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,380
What are you doing?

148
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,220
Madam,

149
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,580
you don't know, right?

150
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,620
Recently,

151
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,740
we lost several goods in the warehouse.

152
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,460
Xing Kai is not at home.

153
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,620
He called me.

154
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,260
I was thinking

155
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,380
there must be a mole in the house.

156
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,100
Madam,

157
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,940
we need to investigate it.

158
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,100
Keep an eye on the yard.

159
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,180
No one is allowed to go out.

160
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:48,900
Yes.

161
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,540
Yes.

162
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,220
Qingyang, what are you doing?

163
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:58,900
Mr. Cheng,

164
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,740
the official is doing his job.

165
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,540
Xing Kai is not at home.

166
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,260
Someone has to do it.

167
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,100
What do you think, Mr. Cheng?

168
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,260
It's a good idea.

169
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,100
I think you want to take advantage of Xing Kai's absence

170
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,100
and take over the power.

171
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,180
You are so selfish.

172
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:14,140
Don't talk nonsense.

173
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,260
I don't mean that.

174
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,780
I'll see who dares to enter from me.

175
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,580
Sister-in-law,

176
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,020
don't you feel hot

177
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,740
holding this tablet?

178
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,020
Don't worry.

179
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,660
No matter who takes the position of the master,

180
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,180
your position will not change.

181
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,220
Come on, do it.

182
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,620
Uncle Cheng.

183
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:47,540
Well...

184
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,700
You still can't get rid of

185
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,260
your heart disease.

186
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,740
Xing Kai.

187
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,300
Mother,

188
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:06,980
sorry.

189
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,300
Guan Xing Kai.

190
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,940
Where have you been these days?

191
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:16,220
Your mother was worried about you.

192
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,780
You came back at the right time.

193
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,260
Fine.

194
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,140
Since you are back,

195
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,500
you will take care of the mole

196
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,700
today.

197
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,140
Okay.

198
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,580
Mr. Cheng,

199
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,380
the people below said that Guan Xing Kai is back.

200
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,380
Just keep watching.

201
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,060
Okay.

202
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,860
Where are you going?

203
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,500
I heard that Xing Kai is back.

204
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,220
I'll go to him.

205
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:46,940
Wait a minute.

206
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,740
Take him back to his room.

207
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,220
Why don't you let me go?

208
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,340
Miss.

209
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,260
No.

210
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,180
Xu Yanshu, why do you...

211
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:53,700
Miss.

212
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,940
Xu Yanshu.

213
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,500
Miss, let's go.

214
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,180
Why doesn't he let me go?

215
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:02,780
Miss.

216
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,020
Just listen to your brother.

217
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,700
Go back to your room.

218
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,460
Just listen to what he says.

219
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,340
I don't listen to your brother.

220
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,140
Who else?

221
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,380
Miss, just don't listen to him.

222
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,540
He doesn't want to be punished.

223
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,820
You should tell me why.

224
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,740
Just stay in your room.

225
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:14,220
Okay.

226
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,700
Mr. Cheng.

227
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,420
Uncle.

228
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,540
You still remember?

229
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,300
When Mr. Cheng sent someone to kill me,

230
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,540
I don't think it would happen today.

231
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,380
Xing Kai.

232
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,020
What's going on?

233
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,540
Isn't Liang Man dead?

234
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,060
My senior died to escape.

235
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,380
Otherwise, how could she stand here

236
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,220
and expose your true face?

237
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,540
Kill him.

238
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,420
Mr. Cheng, you have to kill me.

239
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,140
Senior sister, listen to me.

240
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,420
Listen to me.

241
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,540
If you want to kill me,

242
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,140
I'll find a way to help you.

243
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,100
You may not know that

244
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,100
this handsome and kind-hearted

245
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,380
Mr. Cheng

246
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,460
is actually a cruel and ruthless

247
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,540
murderer.

248
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,820
Bullshit!

249
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,820
You are all pretending to be gods

250
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,260
and playing well.

251
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,340
Where is the evidence?

252
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,540
Chun Shang.

253
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,300
Here comes the young master.

254
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,740
Uncle.

255
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,380
Do you recognize this?

256
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,380
You are so stubborn.

257
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,540
Mr. Cheng.

258
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,060
I'm loyal to you.

259
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,180
You can just use me.

260
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,260
But you sent someone to kill my brother.

261
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,860
Not only that,

262
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,820
he also burned Lan Yu to death

263
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,780
in order to find the master's seal.

264
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:17,900
And,

265
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,100
you killed

266
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,260
my uncle.

267
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,220
Me?

268
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,340
Fine.

269
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,020
So what if it's me?

270
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,820
He deserves to die.

271
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,940
What has he done for the Guan family

272
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,860
all these years?

273
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,580
I'm the one who has developed the Guan family

274
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,980
to this point.

275
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,740
Without me, who are you?

276
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,060
Who do you think you are?

277
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,820
You are still a noble family.

278
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,820
You are dreaming.

279
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,060
You keep saying that it's for the Guan family.

280
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,700
Then look at what these are.

281
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,820
A seal?

282
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,060
How dare you put a seal in the Guan family's medicine?

283
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,260
How could you do this?

284
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,260
Guan Xingkai.

285
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,740
You are so cruel.

286
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:46,780
Uncle.

287
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,980
Do you have anything else to say?

288
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Why don't you go to the police station

289
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,860
and explain it to Xingchu?

290
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,620
What are you doing?

291
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,220
Don't move.

292
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,100
Let me go.

293
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,380
Guan Xingkai.

294
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,740
You are a good singer.

295
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,180
You have done enough.

296
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,580
I have developed the Guan family.

297
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,180
If you send me in now,

298
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,500
you will be the one to take the throne.

299
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,180
Don't forget that I'm your second uncle.

300
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,300
I'm the second master of the Guan family.

301
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:16,540
Second master of the Guan family?

302
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:17,980
Don't forget that

303
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,340
if you betray the interests of the Guan family

304
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,340
and get rid of your reputation in the family history,

305
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,900
I'm afraid that

306
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,980
the Guan family will never protect you again.

307
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,860
Guan Xingkai.

308
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,140
Let me go.

309
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,780
You are blocking Guan Xingkai.

310
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,340
Wait for me.

311
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,620
Guan Xingkai.

312
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,180
Come on.

313
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,260
You are so thin.

314
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,260
Eat more meat.

315
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,660
Thank you, mother.

316
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:04,980
Qingqing.

317
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,700
Come on.

318
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,180
Eat meat too.

319
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,180
Thank you, aunt.

320
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,180
Qingqing has been with me

321
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,420
the whole time you were away.

322
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,380
I discussed with the Xu family

323
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,180
about the marriage a while ago.

324
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,220
You should be more careful

325
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,660
about the marriage.

326
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,940
The marriage is at stake.

327
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,660
You should be more careful

328
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,140
about the marriage.

329
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,900
I'll take it as your agreement.

330
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,460
Mother.

331
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,020
I can get married.

332
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,260
Good.

333
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,020
Come on.

334
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,260
But not with the Xu family.

335
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,580
Brother Xingkai.

336
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,260
What do you mean?

337
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,140
You can't get married with anyone

338
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,460
if you don't marry me.

339
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,540
I want to marry Shen Muling.

340
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:56,620
You...

341
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,420
Xingkai.

342
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,660
You are so stupid.

343
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,140
How can you find a playboy?

344
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,620
It will ruin our family's reputation.

345
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,660
You...

346
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,060
Sister-in-law.

347
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:06,660
Sister-in-law.

348
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,460
Help me.

349
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,580
Shen Muli.

350
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,980
But I...

351
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:25,820
I'm still pregnant.

352
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:36,180
I can't keep a baby.

353
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,420
What are you talking about?

354
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,140
Make up.

355
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,260
aplicative,

356
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,140
and make-up,

357
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,060
please take it slowly.

358
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,840
I'll leave soon,

359
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,220
okay?

360
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:29,980
The flower of love is like you, inseparable, the face in the ruins is clear
