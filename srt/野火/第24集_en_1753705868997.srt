Episode 5

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,540
The Long Ballad

5
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,540
Episode 18

6
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,540
Where is Gua Xintai?

7
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,540
You're awake.

8
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,540
Where is he?

9
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,540
My men only have time

10
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,540
to save you from the back door.

11
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,540
The fire is too big.

12
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,540
We can't get in.

13
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,540
Gua Xintai...

14
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,540
Gua Xintai

15
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,540
You've been unconscious for three days.

16
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,540
Your little sisters

17
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,540
died because of the blood.

18
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,540
They were taken to the south together.

19
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,540
They went to the capital.

20
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,540
Don't you want to avenge yourself

21
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,540
and Gua Xintai?

22
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,540
He's Xintai's foster mother.

23
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,540
He wants to kill me.

24
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,540
Xintai died to save me.

25
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,540
It's meaningless

26
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,540
to avenge yourself.

27
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,540
What if

28
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,540
he killed Lan Yu?

29
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,540
What do you know?

30
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,540
You need to cheer up.

31
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,540
It's the birthday of the foster mother.

32
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,540
You still have half a month.

33
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,540
You have plenty of time

34
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,540
to find evidence and witnesses.

35
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,540
You must let the truth

36
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,540
be known to the world.

37
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,540
I'll do it.

38
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:23,540
These three people

39
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,540
were killed by you

40
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,540
or by the sword.

41
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,540
By the way,

42
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,540
there's also the eldest master of the Guan family,

43
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,540
Guan Hanyang.

44
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,540
You don't know

45
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,540
what I'm talking about.

46
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,540
Nonsense.

47
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,540
You caused my son

48
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,540
to die on the day of the wedding.

49
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,540
You're a vicious woman.

50
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,540
Guards,

51
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,540
take him to the police station.

52
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,540
You don't take me seriously, do you?

53
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,540
Mrs. Guan,

54
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,540
don't worry.

55
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,540
Let Boss Shen explain it to us.

56
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,540
Now,

57
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,540
Police Chief Su is outside.

58
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,540
After explaining it to us,

59
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,540
we'll see

60
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,540
who should go to the police station.

61
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,540
Mrs. Guan,

62
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,540
you always

63
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,540
look like a merciful woman

64
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,540
who always thinks about Buddha.

65
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:15,540
When you're back from the wedding night,

66
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,540
won't you be alerted?

67
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,540
Today, I'll burn three incense sticks

68
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,540
for you

69
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,540
to tell the people

70
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,540
who killed you.

71
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,540
The first one

72
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,540
is to tell the son

73
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,540
you raised for more than ten years.

74
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:30,540
I'm Guan Xingkai.

75
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,540
Nonsense.

76
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,540
My son died to save you.

77
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,540
That's right.

78
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,540
If it weren't for Xingkai,

79
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,540
I wouldn't be here today.

80
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,540
You pretended to agree

81
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,540
to my marriage with Xingkai.

82
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,540
You made me and Xingkai

83
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,540
to be together.

84
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,540
But on the wedding day,

85
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,540
you changed your mind

86
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,540
and asked Xu Qingqing

87
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,540
to marry me.

88
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:06,540
You locked me in the theater.

89
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,540
You sealed me in the coffin.

90
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,540
You wanted to burn me to death.

91
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,540
You also destroyed

92
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,540
the theater.

93
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,540
Xingkai found Duan Ni

94
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:16,540
and rushed into the sea of fire.

95
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,540
Everyone thought

96
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,540
we were both in the sea of fire.

97
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,540
But in fact,

98
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,540
Xingkai saved me.

99
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,540
I'm the only one who survived.

100
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,540
The second incense

101
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,540
is to tell

102
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,540
my junior sister, Xiao Yuan.

103
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,540
I don't know her at all.

104
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,540
That's right.

105
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,540
You really don't know her.

106
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,540
But you know Kang Shao, right?

107
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,540
Everyone present

108
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,540
knows him.

109
00:06:58,540 --> 00:06:59,540
That's right.

110
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,540
He's the new wife of Master Guan.

111
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,540
He was kicked out of the family a few years ago.

112
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,540
Later,

113
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,540
he became a dog

114
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,540
who did things for Madam.

115
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,540
Kang Shao took the money to do things.

116
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,540
He instigated my senior sister, Liang Man,

117
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,540
to drug Master.

118
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,540
He joined forces with Master Guan

119
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,540
to steal the seal,

120
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,540
kill people,

121
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,540
destroy the world

122
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,540
and fabricate lies along with Kang Shao.

123
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,540
If Guan Xingkai knew his mother

124
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,540
was killed by his biological father,

125
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,540
what would he do?

126
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,540
You know you're the biggest suspect.

127
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,540
You've been involved in such a big circle

128
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,540
just to pour the dirty water

129
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,540
onto me.

130
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,540
When Kang Shao was in the dark,

131
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,540
we were about to catch him.

132
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,540
But he was with Xu Qingqing

133
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,540
and wanted to kill me.

134
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,540
Unfortunately,

135
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,540
my junior sister Xiao Yuan

136
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,540
broke everything.

137
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,540
Xiao Yuan was killed

138
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,540
because of this.

139
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,540
It's ridiculous.

140
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,540
The third incense

141
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,540
I'd like to tell you

142
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,540
that one is my master

143
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,540
Xingkai's biological mother,

144
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,540
the other is my stepmother,

145
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,540
and the third is my stepmother,

146
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,540
who was poisoned by you

147
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,540
and died.

148
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,540
Ridiculous.

149
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,540
I'm close to Han Yang.

150
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,540
I treated Xingkai like my own daughter.

151
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,540
Why would I harm them?

152
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,540
That's because you only care

153
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:38,540
about your mother's position.

154
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,540
My master and Master Guan

155
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,540
loved each other and were close.

156
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,540
But you were so different.

157
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,540
You married Master Guan

158
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,540
with your own mother's power.

159
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,540
My master was forced

160
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,540
to become an outsider.

161
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,540
Xingkai was also killed.

162
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,540
My lady.

163
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:58,540
My lady.

164
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,540
Luckily,

165
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,540
you have no children.

166
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,540
You could only bring Xingkai back.

167
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,540
But for many years,

168
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,540
you still envied

169
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,540
Master Guan and my master's relationship.

170
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,540
You were afraid that one day

171
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,540
Xingkai would recognize his own mother.

172
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,540
You were not a good person.

173
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,540
So you tried everything

174
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,540
to kill my master.

175
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,540
You also killed Master Guan

176
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,540
out of love and hatred.

177
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,540
Xingkai and I worked together.

178
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,540
In order to keep things from getting worse,

179
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,540
you killed Liang Man and Kang Shao.

180
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:34,540
Later,

181
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,540
Xingkai and Master Guan

182
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,540
fought for the position of the master.

183
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,540
In order to stabilize your position,

184
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,540
you poisoned Master Guan

185
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,540
and helped Xingkai

186
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,540
to become the master.

187
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,540
My lady.

188
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,540
Do you admit

189
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,540
what I said?

190
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,540
You are a playwright.

191
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:55,540
You are good at writing and acting.

192
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,540
You are so good at acting.

193
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,540
Do you have any evidence?

194
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,540
Police Chief Su.

195
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,540
Go inside.

196
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,540
Behave yourself.

197
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,540
Let's go.

198
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,540
Did he do it?

199
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,540
This is Master Guan's doctor.

200
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,540
He can prove that

201
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,540
you have been giving Master Guan

202
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,540
the medicine for so many years

203
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,540
to make his illness worse

204
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,540
and make you do whatever you want.

205
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,540
This is your personal servant,

206
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,540
Zhang Ma.

207
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,540
He has done a lot of bad things

208
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,540
to you these years.

209
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,540
My lady.

210
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,540
Are you sure you want me

211
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,540
to continue talking?

212
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,540
Is he telling the truth?

213
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,540
Did you really kill Han Yang?

214
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,540
You are a vicious woman.

215
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,540
We have been treating you

216
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,540
with great care for so many years.

217
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,540
You are so ungrateful.

218
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,540
I didn't expect you to be a wolf

219
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,540
and ruin our family.

220
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,540
Ungrateful?

221
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,540
You are still laughing.

222
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,540
You are so ungrateful.

223
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,540
You are a noble lady.

224
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,540
You envy marriage.

225
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,540
You are the head of the family.

226
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,540
Do you know

227
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,540
these words

228
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:24,540
are like the thorns on the thorns

229
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,540
stuck in my heart?

230
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,540
They have been stuck in my heart

231
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,540
for twenty years.

232
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,540
Do you know?

233
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,540
Do you know

234
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,540
how much my heart hurts?

235
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,540
Why?

236
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,540
Why do they love me

237
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,540
and sacrifice my son?

238
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:58,540
If it wasn't for Guan Han Yang

239
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,540
and your master,

240
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,540
that bitch,

241
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,540
to date him,

242
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,540
my son...

243
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,540
How could my son not be able to protect him?

244
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,540
These years,

245
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,540
I have seen Guan Xing Kai

246
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,540
and several wild animals.

247
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,540
I can't wait for him to die.

248
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,540
I have seen him once.

249
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,540
My heart...

250
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:36,540
My heart hurts.

251
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,540
Why?

252
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,540
Why?

253
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,540
Why don't they let me live well?

254
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,540
I want their son to live well.

255
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,540
No.

256
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,540
I want him to die.

257
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,540
I want Guan Han Yang and that bitch

258
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:08,540
to see their son die.

259
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:09,540
I want him to die.

260
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,540
I asked you what Guan Xing Kai did wrong.

261
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,540
What do you think

262
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,540
has anything to do with Guan Xing Kai?

263
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,540
It doesn't matter.

264
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,540
It's too late.

265
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,540
But I'm telling you,

266
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,540
I don't regret

267
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,540
everything I did.

268
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,540
I'm sorry.

269
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,540
Please forgive me.

270
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,540
Police Chief Su.

271
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,540
Why are you standing here?

272
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,540
Go back to the police station.

273
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,540
Let's talk about it.

274
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,540
Take them away.

275
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,540
Yes.

276
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,540
How dare you!

277
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,980
I didn't expect that she would die like this.

278
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,580
Master.

279
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,900
Wake up.

280
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,500
Xiao Yue.

281
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,860
You all can't get away with this.

282
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:45,420
I've found the justice you want.

283
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:29,280
Hiding

284
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,140
Meng Liang

285
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,860
I can protect you

286
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,260
if you have nowhere to go.

287
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,900
I promised Xinggan

288
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,380
that I would never leave her

289
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,860
because I heard that there is a fire in the front line of the north.

290
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:56,140
I decided to go there

291
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,580
and go to the place where Master used to study

292
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:00,860
to continue the study.

293
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,020
The fire is just a code.

294
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,340
Anyone can become a fire.

295
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,300
Do you really think that

296
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,300
they can be saved

297
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,980
without any worries?

298
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,580
I never ask for anything.

299
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,100
As long as there is a little hope,

300
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,500
even if it is a long journey,

301
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,260
I must find her.

302
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,580
If she is really gone,

303
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,140
I will live for her

304
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,380
and complete the things that she wants to do.

305
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,300
No matter what,

306
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,700
I have to thank you, Uncle Yan.

307
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,420
Uncle Yan,

308
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,500
the front line is a barrier.

309
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,660
You will leave soon, right?

310
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,620
Since there is a paradise,

311
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,380
protect yourself

312
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,020
and come back safely,

313
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,900
we may see each other again.

314
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,140
I will definitely see you again.

315
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,700
The fire is just a code.

316
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,100
Anyone can become a fire.

317
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,100
I will live for her

318
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,540
and complete the things that she wants to do.

319
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,740
I will live for her

320
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:41,300
and complete the things that she wants to do.

321
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,700
I will live for her

322
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,300
and complete the things that she wants to do.

323
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,620
I will live for her

324
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,220
and complete the things that she wants to do.

325
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,420
I will live for her

326
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:50,020
and complete the things that she wants to do.

327
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,300
I will live for her

328
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,820
and complete the things that she wants to do.

329
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,220
I will live for her

330
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,820
and complete the things that she wants to do.

331
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,180
I will live for her

332
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,900
and complete the things that she wants to do.

and complete the things that she wants to do.

339
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,700
I will live for her

00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,500
and complete the things that she wants to do.

341
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,100

and complete the things that she wants to do.

345
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,900
I will live for her

346
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,700
and complete the things that she wants to do.

347
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,500
I will live for her

00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,300
and complete the things that she wants to do.

349
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,900
I will live for her

00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,700
and complete the things that she wants to do.

351
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,500
I will live for her

352
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,300
and complete the things that she wants to do.

353
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,100
What is it?

354
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,700
Do you want to know drones out there?

355
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,420
Yes, I want to know.

356
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,700
Pixi,

357
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,980
I like a kommets like you.

358
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,100
Thank you,oredone.

359
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,500
King.

360
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,020
King,

361
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,740
Always keep septic.

362
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,380
By my side.

363
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,380
Succeed.

364
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,020
Wind and rain, rain and rain

365
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,020
The flowers fall like a smile

366
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,020
The noodles are in the sleeve

367
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:17,020
You say goodbye, love is like a game

368
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,020
I knew that I didn't want to die

369
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:25,020
You said it without hesitation

370
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,020
When a song of life and death is separated

371
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:38,000
And I clouds

372
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
The light of the past will never leave

373
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
When a song of sadness ends, what will be the end?

374
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
How lucky to be in the middle of the night, the moon and the beach

375
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The flowers are like mud, unreachable

376
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The face in the ruins is clear

377
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The Long Ballad
