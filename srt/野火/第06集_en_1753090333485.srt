1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,200
Temporary

2
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:23,200
Episode Natin

3
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,480
Old old待著

4
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,300
人流光依采

5
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:04,020
I want to be with you forever.

6
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:09,420
Love with Princess

7
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:10,860
What?

8
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,700
He was taken away by the police?

9
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,260
And he was locked up with Junior Brother Bai.

10
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,820
Junior Brother Bai?

11
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,980
How could he be locked up with Boss Shen?

12
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,740
Junior Brother Bai sent someone to rob us.

13
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,660
We did send him to prison.

14
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,740
But this time,

15
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,020
it was so coincidental.

16
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,740
Could there be something wrong?

17
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,420
Someone must have given him a way out.

18
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,780
Young Master, you mean

19
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,940
those boxes were filled with the drug of the opium.

20
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,420
It was Young Master's goods.

21
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,660
Young Master.

22
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,460
He is in danger.

23
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,820
Tech.

24
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,780
Open the door!

25
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,740
Anyone?

26
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,380
Open the door!

27
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:09,860
I want to die!

28
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,780
Open the door!

29
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,780
Little girl.

30
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,060
Even if your horizontal injuries are changes of death,

31
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,500
Why don't you let me enjoy my life

32
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,780
so that you won't feel lonely

33
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,100
when you arrive at the hell?

34
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,060
I've thought it through.

35
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,420
Anyway,

36
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,460
I'll die if I die.

37
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,940
Master.

38
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,300
Mr. Su.

39
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,460
Mr. Su.

40
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,180
Mr. Su.

41
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,020
We've agreed

42
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,500
that you won't be late.

43
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,460
I know.

44
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,060
But he's an important suspect now.

45
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,220
It's a bit difficult for me

46
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,300
to see him all of a sudden.

47
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,700
Mr. Su, you're right.

48
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,140
Smart.

49
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,020
I don't need you to kill him.

50
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,100
Come on.

51
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,580
Shen Muling.

52
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,220
Shen Muling.

53
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,380
I'm late.

54
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,540
I'll take you back now.

55
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,100
Young Master.

56
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:58,820
Boss Shen is...

57
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,700
Young Master Guan.

58
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,860
Young Master Guan.

59
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,980
You can't take him away.

60
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,740
Mr. Su.

61
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,860
I'm here.

62
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,340
Don't worry.

63
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,380
No, no, no.

64
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,060
I'm fine.

65
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:11,860
Young Master Guan.

66
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,060
The servants saw Boss Shen kill Liang Man.

67
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,460
He's a suspect now.

68
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,300
You can't take him away.

69
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,300
Besides,

70
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,140
the General Police Department is investigating it.

71
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,260
It's not safe.

72
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,060
It's dangerous.

73
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,940
It's dangerous.

74
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,860
It's dangerous.

75
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,220
The General Police Department is investigating it.

76
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,860
If anything goes wrong,

77
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,740
I can't afford to take it.

78
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,180
I'm here for the case.

79
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,340
In this case,

80
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,580
shouldn't you arrest me too?

81
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,580
No.

82
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,420
Chunsheng.

83
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,980
Follow the police officer

84
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,140
and help Boss Shen's bodyguard.

85
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,140
Mr. Su, let's go.

86
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,620
No.

87
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,500
Let's go.

88
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,340
It's not about money.

89
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,100
Besides,

90
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,060
about what happened today,

91
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,420
shouldn't you

92
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,860
tell Boss Shen too?

93
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,620
Otherwise, I can't guarantee

94
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,580
that he won't go to the General Police Department.

95
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,060
By then,

96
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:00,260
I'm afraid you'll be the head of the police.

97
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,220
Young Master Guan.

98
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,020
Mr. Su.

99
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:03,900
Please.

100
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,220
Let's go.

101
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,820
Go away.

102
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,820
Go away. Don't touch me.

103
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:26,140
It's good that I'm here.

104
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,940
Just be at ease

105
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,460
and be your boss.

106
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,060
It seems that

107
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,380
Young Master still remembers

108
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,780
that playboy.

109
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,780
Madam.

110
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,020
What should we do?

111
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,020
Your Highness.

112
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,380
Doctor.

113
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,980
How is he?

114
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,620
After a prescription,

115
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,180
Mr. Guan's condition

116
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,020
has been stable.

117
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,140
As long as the procedure goes on,

118
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,660
he'll recover from the inflammation

119
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,660
in the next month.

120
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,700
Next month?

121
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,780
Maybe it will be too late.

122
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,980
Have you prepared

123
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,340
everything I asked you to prepare?

124
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:27,420
Madam,

125
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,300
everything is prepared.

126
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,140
Xiaotan, are you okay?

127
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,140
You're back.

128
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:46,820
Yes.

129
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,380
What's wrong?

130
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,660
I'm happy.

131
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,580
Your clothes are dirty, right?

132
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,900
You don't feel well.

133
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,140
Change a new one.

134
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:11,980
Change this one.

135
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,820
I'll go to the kitchen.

136
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,420
Be careful.

137
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,180
Okay.

138
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,180
Young Master.

139
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:29,940
Young Master.

140
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,580
Young Master.

141
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,900
Did you cook this ginger soup?

142
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,620
Where is he?

143
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,260
What's wrong?

144
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,940
Tell me.

145
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,420
Senior Sister.

146
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,380
Let me tell you.

147
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,860
Guan...

148
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,820
Master Guan is sick.

149
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,500
Is Dad's condition stable?

150
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,100
Why did he suddenly die?

151
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,100
Everyone.

152
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,420
The matter has come to this.

153
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,900
Why don't you tell me what to do?

154
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,420
Old Seven.

155
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,540
What do you mean by that?

156
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,180
Dad.

157
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,060
What do you mean by that?

158
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,740
What can I mean?

159
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,700
The Guan family has such a big family.

160
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,820
There must be someone who is not the head of the family.

161
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,260
Yes.

162
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,740
You didn't see

163
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,860
those people's faces just now.

164
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,220
It's just a bad omen.

165
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,980
Zi Ming is right.

166
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,220
But this matter

167
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,740
can't be rushed.

168
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,260
If it's not done properly,

169
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,020
I don't know how outsiders will mock

170
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:18,780
our Guan family.

171
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:19,940
There is no law.

172
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,020
In theory,

173
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,700
the head of the Guan family

174
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,540
should be inherited by Xing Kai.

175
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,260
But...

176
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,140
No.

177
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,940
Xing Kai just came back.

178
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,500
He's not familiar with the family business.

179
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,740
In your heart,

180
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,020
is the head of the family

181
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,740
more important than one's life?

182
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,180
He's been in charge for many years.

183
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,900
He can continue to take over the position.

184
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,580
We can rest assured.

185
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,500
Yes.

186
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:46,820
Back then,

187
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,780
Han Yang was seriously ill.

188
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,580
If Qing Yang didn't

189
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,220
use his own strength to fight against the enemy,

190
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,380
I'm afraid our Guan family

191
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,820
would have been destroyed long ago.

192
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,780
Yes.

193
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,820
Han Yang just left.

194
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,940
After the funeral is over,

195
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,540
we can discuss it slowly.

196
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,340
Sister-in-law.

197
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,100
It's not the right time.

198
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,980
The family's position is vacant for a day.

199
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,420
The Guan family will be restless for a day.

200
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,940
In my opinion,

201
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,460
we should settle it as soon as possible.

202
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,060
Xing Kai.

203
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,740
What do you think?

204
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,700
Are you so desperate, Uncle Yushan?

205
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,580
This is my father's funeral.

206
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,300
Elders,

207
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,020
my father just passed away.

208
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,700
I believe everyone is the same as me.

209
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,980
You must be sad and unable to accept it.

210
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,780
But now,

211
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:47,540
the funeral is not over yet.

212
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,060
Someone is eager to

213
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,700
take over the position in the Hall of Spirituality.

214
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,340
Are you really not afraid of

215
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,940
disturbing the peace of his family?

216
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,020
Uncle Yushan.

217
00:11:58,820 --> 00:11:59,700
What do you think?

218
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,260
What do you mean?

219
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:01,940
Uncle Yushan.

220
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,180
You know what you've done.

221
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,100
I'll let you know later.

222
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:09,460
But today,

223
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,060
before my father's funeral,

224
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,580
I want him to see

225
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,260
whether his beloved brother

226
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,140
really

227
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:22,540
believes in the real Guan family.

228
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,140
Your Majesty.

229
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,100
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,100
I'm sorry.

231
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,100
I'm sorry.

232
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,100
I'm sorry.

233
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,100
I'm sorry.

234
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,100
I'm sorry.

235
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,100
I'm sorry.

236
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,100
I'm sorry.

237
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,100
I'm sorry.

238
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,100
I'm sorry.

239
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,100
I'm sorry.

240
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,100
I'm sorry.

241
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,100
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,100
I'm sorry.

243
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,100
I'm sorry.

244
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,100
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,100
I'm sorry.

246
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,100
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,100
I'm sorry.

248
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,100
I'm sorry.

249
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,100
I'm sorry.

250
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,100
I'm sorry.

251
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,100
I'm sorry.

252
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,100
I'm sorry.

253
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
I'm sorry.

254
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,100
I'm sorry.

255
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,100
I'm sorry.

256
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,100
I'm sorry.

257
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,100
I'm sorry.

258
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,100
I'm sorry.

259
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,100
I'm sorry.

260
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,100
I'm sorry.

261
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,100
I'm sorry.

262
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,100
I'm sorry.

263
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,100
I'm sorry.

264
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,100
I'm sorry.

265
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,100
I'm sorry.

266
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,100
I'm sorry.

267
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,100
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,100
I'm sorry.

269
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,100
I'm sorry.

270
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,100
I'm sorry.

271
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,100
I'm sorry.

272
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,100
I'm sorry.

273
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,100
I'm sorry.

274
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,100
I'm sorry.

276
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,100

284
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,100
I'm sorry.

285
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,100
