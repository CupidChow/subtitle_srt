00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,180
Parasite

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,500
My Dear Brothers EP13

3
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,320
If I don't come out for an hour,

4
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,360
take someone up there.

5
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,280
I must get the goods back.

6
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,320
Don't worry about me.

7
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,000
Okay.

8
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,880
If I don't come back,

9
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,440
don't investigate my mother's case.

10
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,120
No.

11
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,960
I will keep investigating.

12
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,920
So you must come back to protect me.

13
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,200
Young Master.

14
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,560
I sent you away

15
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,680
before I came back.

16
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,520
I know you're on the phone.

17
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,440
Peek-a-boo!

18
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,160
Great professional.

19
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,880
Be good.

20
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,880
Promise me you will come back!

21
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,560
Let them move to the warehouse.

22
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,040
It's all Jin Qiao's goods.

23
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,920
We didn't want to hurt anyone

24
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,600
after we robbed the goods.

25
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,840
You sent them to the warehouse by yourselves?

26
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
Let's make a deal.

27
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,480
I have to take this batch of goods away.

28
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,200
You're quite talkative.

29
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,600
Do you believe that I won't let you

30
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,080
leave this warehouse?

31
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,360
I'm sure Chief has checked the goods.

32
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,360
He should know it very well.

33
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,440
If this batch of goods moves,

34
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,240
do you think

35
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,680
the people in the stockade

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,600
will be in danger?

37
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,080
Good.

38
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's do it according to the rules.

39
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,840
Do you dare to bet your life?

40
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,560
Whoever wins

41
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,800
will get the goods.

42
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,320
If you don't dare to do it,

43
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,520
you can leave.

44
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,880
The goods will stay.

45
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,080
Senior, be generous.

46
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,360
That's another attitude,

47
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,760
little tradition.

48
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,000
I hope Chief

49
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,880
Young Master!

50
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,880
Your life is more precious than mine.

51
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,880
Think it over before you continue.

52
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,880
One-twenty.

53
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,880
No!

54
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,880
No!

55
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,880
No!

56
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,880
No!

57
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,880
No!

58
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Senior Sister.

59
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,880
We all know

60
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,880
that it's impossible for you to make such a big decision on your own.

61
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,880
But it's obvious that the people behind you have abandoned you.

62
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
If you still want to live,

63
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
then cooperate with us.

64
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
What are you doing?

65
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,880
You're a bitch!

66
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,880
No!

67
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,880
No!

68
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Murderer!

69
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
Murderer! Master, you're going to kill me!

70
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
Let's go. Pack up.

71
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Young Master.

72
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,880
What do you mean?

73
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,880
Hurry up.

74
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
Check these two boxes.

75
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
Make the boxes more solid.

76
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Yes.

77
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,880
Young Master, you scared me.

78
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,880
How did you do it?

79
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
Weibulli MK2 revolving pistol.

80
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,880
It's 1.08kg.

81
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
The weight of the bullet is 17 grams.

82
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,880
There's no bullet in it.

83
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
I knew you wouldn't leave me alone.

84
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,880
I didn't tell you.

85
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,880
You've suffered.

86
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,880
I can't stand it anymore.

87
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,880
I can't stand it anymore.

88
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
I can't stand it anymore.

89
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:58,880
I can't stand it anymore.

90
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,880
I can't stand it anymore.

91
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
I can't stand it anymore.

92
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,880
When will you take me out?

93
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
I won't leave you alone.

94
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,880
Drink the medicine.

95
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,880
I'll take you out.

96
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,880
Drink it.

97
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,880
I'll take you out after you drink it.

98
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,880
Okay.

99
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,880
Be careful.

100
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,880
Be careful.

101
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,880
Be careful.

102
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,880
Hurry up.

103
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
Hold on.

104
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,880
Hold on.

105
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,880
Your Majesty.

106
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Liang Man is the only clue.

107
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,880
I have to find a way.

108
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,880
Boss Shen.

109
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,880
According to the report,

110
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,880
Liang Man died in the house next to the house.

111
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,880
According to the guard testimony,

112
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,880
Shen Muling was suspected of murder.

113
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,880
Boss Shen, please.

114
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,880
Young Master.

115
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,880
Young Master, something happened.

116
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,880
Young Master, you went out.

117
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,880
Madam has been looking for you for a long time.

118
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
She is waiting for you in the ancestral hall.

119
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
Okay.

120
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
Let's go.

121
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Boss Shen was taken away by the police.

122
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,880
What?

123
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
Mother, you want to see me?

124
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,880
Come here.

125
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,880
Kneel down.

126
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Put incense on your mother.

127
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,880
Your mother is a good person.

128
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
She is both talented and handsome.

129
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,880
If it weren't for the old master's disagreement,

130
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,880
you and your mother wouldn't have separated.

131
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:11,880
Your father and I wouldn't have

132
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:14,880
taken care of each other for so many years.

133
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
But you...

134
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,880
Mother, in my heart,

135
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,880
you and mother are the same.

136
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
Wake up.

137
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,880
It's lucky to have you all these years.

138
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,880
Otherwise,

139
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,880
I don't know how to get through

140
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,880
my aunt for decades.

141
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
Father.

142
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,880
Come in.

143
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,880
I didn't kill Liang Man.

144
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,880
How many times have I told you?

145
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Boss Shen, you don't count.

146
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
You should know better about Shen Shen.

147
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
You are a regular here.

148
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,880
You know the rules.

149
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,880
Please.

150
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,880
Come in.

151
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,880
Come in.

152
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,880
Yes.

153
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,880
Your Majesty.

154
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,880
Your Majesty.

155
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880

00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
Your Majesty.

166
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Your Majesty.

167
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,880
Your Majesty.

168
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,880
Your Majesty.

169
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Your Majesty.

170
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
Your Majesty.

171
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,880
Your Majesty.

172
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,880

173
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Your Majesty.

174
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
Your Majesty.

175
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,880
Your Majesty.

176
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,880
Your Majesty.

177
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,880
Your Majesty.

178
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
Your Majesty.

179
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,880
Your Majesty.

180
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,880
