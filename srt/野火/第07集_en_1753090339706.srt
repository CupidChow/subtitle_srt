00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The Legend of Chusen

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Eternal Love

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Episode 16

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But today,

6
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
before my father's funeral,

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I want him to see

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
whether his beloved brother

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
has recognized him

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
or the real official's token.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
This...

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Come, let me see.

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Really?

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Really?

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Qu Yini.

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The Legend of Chusen

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Look.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's really the official's token.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
All these years,

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
we thought that the seal was lost.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
But you...

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
That's right.

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Isn't it lost?

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Where did you get it?

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You got it from the coffin.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If it's always in your hands,

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
why didn't you tell me today?

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
What have you done for the official's family

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
all these years?

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You took an unknown fake seal today

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and wanted to be the master.

32
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Are you worthy?

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Uncle,

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
don't worry about it.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Only the official's family

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
can have the seal.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is the rule of the official's family.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You should know better

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
than I do.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
As for the real and fake,

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
the chief has verified them.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Unless you don't trust them,

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I don't trust anyone.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm the official's family.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I know the rules of the official's family.

46
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But you'd better prove to me

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
that the seal is real and fake.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The chief has to convince everyone.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Uncle,

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll send someone to get the keys

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
to the account book and the warehouse.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Please be prepared.

53
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Here are the accounts of the past years.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Young Master,

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
some accounts of the private and private rooms

56
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
are not organized.

57
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm afraid you'll forget them.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll send someone to get them

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
after I'm done.

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Alright, you may leave.

61
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes, Madam.

62
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Xingkai,

63
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
although you inherited the position of the master

64
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
with the seal,

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
you have a strong foundation.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's natural that they don't agree.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
If you really want to change,

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
you'll have to

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
make a schedule

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
for the marriage between you and Qingqing.

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Mother,

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
marriage is a big thing in life.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't want to take it as a trade.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's not fair

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
to me and Qingqing.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's not fair

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
to be born in our family.

78
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I can see that

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Qingqing

80
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
really likes you.

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The House of Guan and the Xu family

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
are a family.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If you really marry her,

84
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
you can use the power of the Xu family.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Otherwise...

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Take a good look.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The House of Guan wants all the medicine

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
in Jiangbei.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's all locked up by this Xu Yanshu.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Xingkai,

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
there are many people

92
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
who have succeeded in the past

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
and have been successful in the future.

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't want to force you.

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Think about it.

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Aunt, I'll go over there.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You've been arrested

98
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
in the police station several times.

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Boss Shen can still

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
stand here safely.

101
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You're really capable.

102
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But it's a pity.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
No matter how hard you try,

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
the House of Guan

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
will not have your place.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You're joking, Miss Xu.

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We're now

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
standing in the same place.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You...

110
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
You're from a playboy

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and you're smart.

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But do you think

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Xingkai

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
will believe you?

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Why are you here?

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I heard that

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Master Guan is in the room.

118
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm worried about you.

119
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's go.

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's windy outside.

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Let's talk inside.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay.

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Open the door.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes.

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Please, Master Guan.

126
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You mean

127
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
he's a member of Master Guan?

128
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Yes.

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You can trick him later.

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
If he's our target,

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
we'll be in trouble.

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm afraid

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
he'll be a little suspicious.

134
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm afraid

135
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
if he's our target,

136
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
he might

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
see the truth.

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Okay.

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
How is it?

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Boss Shi,

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
are you satisfied?

142
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Take him away.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Yes.

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Let me ask you.

145
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Let me ask you.

146
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Who sent you to harm me?

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Little girl,

148
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
no one wants to harm you.

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:20,200
It's just that you have some

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
evil spirits.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yes.

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
No one wants to harm you.

155
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're not the one

156
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
who can harm me.

157
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You're not the one

158
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
who can harm me.

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm not the one

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
who can harm you.

161
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm not the one

162
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
who can harm you.

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You can't die.

164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,560
Fatty, keep an eye on Zifeng.

165
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:03,640
The Comedy Girls' Hal Mei's

166
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,800
sketchbook!

167
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,980
How could you do this?!

168
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,320
I couldn't understand the contents of it.

169
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,480
Wenrange???

170
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,200
Go away.

171
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,820
The prize is duty free.

172
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,040
Everything is in the corners of the defects!

173
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,340
Just take it!

174
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,560
Yes, sir!

175
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,960
Obviously!

176
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,960
It's okay.

177
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,960
Everything will be fine.

178
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,960
Look at this.

179
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
It's exactly like the one

180
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,960
that Master carved out.

181
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,960
Liang Zhu is my favorite.

182
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
I'll take her away

183
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
after I go.

184
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,960
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,960
Good.

187
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Good.

188
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Good.

189
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Good.

190
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
Good.

191
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Good.

192
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,960
Good.

193
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,960
Look at this.

194
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
It's so beautiful.

195
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
It's so beautiful.

196
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Good.

197
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,960
Move aside.

198
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
It's so beautiful.

199
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,960
It's so beautiful.

200
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Master,

201
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
it's just a play.

202
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
It's not worth

203
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
you to be so embarrassed

204
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
when you just came back.

205
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
How about this?

206
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
I'll take my brothers

207
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
to the lantern path first.

208
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,960
The five families are together.

209
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
The beauty is so beautiful.

210
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,960
The two hands are so beautiful.

211
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
What's wrong?

212
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
What's wrong?

213
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
What's wrong?

214
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
What's wrong?

215
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,960
What's wrong?

216
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,960
What's wrong?

217
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,960
What's wrong?

218
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
What's wrong?

219
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,960
What's wrong?

220
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
I don't understand.

221
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,960
What's wrong?

222
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
I don't understand.

223
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
What's wrong?

224
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,960
What's wrong?

225
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
What's wrong?

226
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,960
What's wrong?

227
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
Don't ears.

228
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,960
Go.

229
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,960
What's wrong?

230
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
What's wrong?

231
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Move aside.

232
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
You all stay here

233
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
and show me together.

234
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,960
What's wrong?

235
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,960
Move.

236
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
What's wrong?

237
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,960
Move.

238
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:14,960
I will cross theinki river

239
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:28,760
The sun yellow-green novel

240
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:34,280
Grave frost monkey

241
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:39,280
One, two, three, four.

242
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,280
One, two, three, four.

243
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Why is she suddenly back?

244
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,880
Xu Dujun and the Lady of Xu's family

245
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,280
have been close friends since childhood.

246
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,280
She must be here to support us this time.

247
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
Brother Xingkai.

248
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Brother Xingkai.

249
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
I was discussing

250
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,280
whether we should go to the garden or not.

251
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
Let's go.

252
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,280
Aunt.

253
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Which dress do you think is better?

254
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
It depends on your taste.

255
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,280
You're so beautiful.

256
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,280
You look good in any dress.

257
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,280
I might prefer this one.

258
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
It suits me better.

259
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Then I'll take this one.

260
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,280
You can get a hair style like this, too.

261
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,280
I'll give you a flower.

262
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,280
Or a butterfly.

263
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
I'll give you a different shape.

264
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Right.

265
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,280
Is this the trick that you used

266
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,280
to win the title of the Lady of Xu's family?

267
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,280
Let's compete with each other.

268
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
Xu Dujun also used this trick

269
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,280
to make us like a couple in the Western Courtyard.

270
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,280
I just want to remind you

271
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
that the character must be in the same style.

272
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,280
Or else,

273
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
you'll be a bad person.

274
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
You'll ruin your reputation.

275
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,280
By the way,

276
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,280
the person you're waiting for

277
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,280
won't come today.

278
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,280
Not only today,

279
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,280
but also in the future.

280
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
What do you mean?

281
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,280
You don't know yet.

282
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
The two families of Guan Xu

283
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
will get married in three months.

284
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
Now,

285
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,280
he's having dinner with his sister

286
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,280
at his home

287
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,280
to discuss the marriage.

288
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
But Boss Shen,

289
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,280
if you're willing to do it,

290
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
I'll send someone

291
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
to take all the people

292
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
in the theater to my house tomorrow.

293
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,280
They'll be raised in the Dujun Mansion.

294
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,280
You're acting for the six provinces of Jiangbei.

295
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,280
I'm a little self-aware

296
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,280
of my own self-sacrifice.

297
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
I'm just thinking.

298
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,280
Why don't you go to another place?

299
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,280
I'll go.

300
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
What if I say I only want you?

301
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
I'm not patient.

302
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,280
You only have two choices.

303
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,280
Either agree to it

304
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
or die here.

305
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,280
My master once said,

306
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,280
this play is for the audience.

307
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
If you can't do it,

308
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,280
you'd rather die.

309
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
If you insist,

310
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
why don't you help me now?

311
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,280
Come on.

312
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,280
Wind and rain,

313
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,280
rain and rain,

314
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
flowers and flowers,

315
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,280
like a smile falling from the sky.

316
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,280
The three-sided peach is embroidered.

317
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
You're too tall,

318
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,280
love and hate are like stars.

319
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:47,280
I knew that I didn't like you.

320
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:51,280
Your eyes are so clear.

321
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,280
When a song of farewell

322
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,280
becomes a kiss,

323
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,280
I want to cry and look at you.

324
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,280
The sound of the flute and the flowers wither.

325
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,280
We'll never leave each other in the fire.

326
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,280
When a song of sorrow

327
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,280
becomes a song of farewell,

328
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,280
I want to hide my feelings from the sand.

329
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
You're too tall,

330
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,280
love and hate are like stars.

331
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:26,280
Your eyes are so clear.

332
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
When a song of farewell

333
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,280
becomes a song of farewell,

334
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,280
I want to cry and look at you.

335
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,280
The sound of the flute and the flowers wither.

336
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,280
We'll never leave each other in the fire.

337
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
When a song of farewell

338
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,280
becomes a song of farewell,

339
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
I want to hide my feelings from the sand.

340
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,280
You're too tall,

341
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
love and hate are like stars.

342
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
You're too tall,

343
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
love and hate are like stars.

344
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
You're too tall,
