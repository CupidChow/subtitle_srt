1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I will never forget your kindness.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I will never forget your kindness.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I will never forget your kindness.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I will never forget your kindness.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I will never forget your kindness.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I will never forget your kindness.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I will never forget your kindness.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I will never forget your kindness.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I will never forget your kindness.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I will never forget your kindness.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I will never forget your kindness.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I will never forget your kindness.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will never forget your kindness.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I will never forget your kindness.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Until we meet again.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,120
Annoying. пом 식으로.

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,620
Annoying.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Are you alight?

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why are you here?

20
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,680
Who do you think I am?

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Let go of me!

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,600
Boss Shen,

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,600
you're really laughing at the new person

24
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,840
but not at me, the old man.

25
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,640
Guai Xingkai,

26
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,800
this is the seal of the capital's military governor's mansion.

27
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,400
You're going to take it by force?

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,800
By force?

29
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,800
I'm just taking it by force.

30
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,240
So what if I'm just taking it by force?

31
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,800
Now everyone in the city knows

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,280
that you're my Guai Xingkai's woman.

33
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,520
You're only following Xu Yanshu.

34
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,280
Boss Shen,

35
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,320
do you really think I'm a gentleman

36
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,880
who wouldn't dare to do anything to you?

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,920
Let go of me!

38
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,040
Let go of me!

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,800
Guai Xingkai,

40
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,680
I didn't expect you to be like this.

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,080
I've told you many times.

42
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,400
We're no longer related.

43
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,000
Why are you still forcing me?

44
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,240
It's not good.

45
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,560
I'm warning you one last time.

46
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,840
Don't entangle me again.

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,080
Do you understand?

48
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,720
Young Master,

49
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,360
do you still want to take Boss Shen away?

50
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,400
Drive.

51
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,160
Okay.

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,760
You're a brainless man.

53
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
Shen Mulin is here.

54
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,320
You won't drag him in.

55
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,720
There are others outside,

56
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,240
Young Lady.

57
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,240
I finally created an opportunity.

58
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,680
As long as you ruin Shen Mulin today,

59
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,840
he'll be defeated.

60
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,520
No matter it's the Commandery Prince's Mansion or the government,

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,680
he won't be able to take it.

62
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,040
And you're just doing this?

63
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,120
Miss Xu,

64
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,640
I'm here to help.

65
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,480
I'm not your servant.

66
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,960
Okay.

67
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,080
I'll go find someone.

68
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,800
I hope you won't get into trouble again.

69
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,440
Help!

70
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,400
Help!

71
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,440
What...

72
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,440
What to do?

73
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,280
Take her away.

74
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,280
That rascal!

75
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:34,720
Thank you.

76
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,800
You actually planned to get in my way.

77
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,680
I'll just clapping you dead!

78
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,560
Xiaoyue,

79
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,680
Xiao Yuan.

80
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
What should we do?

81
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Xiao Yuan, is that you?

82
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,680
Xiao Yuan.

83
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,680
Kill him.

84
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,680
Kill him.

85
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,680
He is Shen Mo Lin's good sister.

86
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,680
Once things are exposed, we will be in trouble.

87
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,680
Please, Bai Lu. We are in trouble.

88
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
Xiao Yuan, is that you?

89
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Shut up.

90
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,680
Xiao Yuan, is that you?

91
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
Xiao Yuan.

92
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,680
Xiao Yuan.

93
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
Xiao Yuan.

94
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
Xiao Yuan.

95
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
Xiao Yuan, wake up.

96
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Can you hear me?

97
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
What's going on?

98
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
Xiao Yuan.

99
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
Xiao Yuan, wake up.

100
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Xiao Yuan.

101
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Xiao Yuan.

102
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
Boss Shen, what happened?

103
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Help.

104
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
Shun Sheng, stop the car.

105
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
What's wrong, Young Master?

106
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Hurry and turn around.

107
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
The state of the wood is not right.

108
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
He seems to have been drugged.

109
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Hurry and drive.

110
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,680
I heard something when I went upstairs.

111
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,680
It was Sister Mu Ling screaming.

112
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,680
When I ran over from the room,

113
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,680
I saw someone running out of the window.

114
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,680
Then I saw Sister Mu Ling lying on the ground.

115
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,680
There was a corpse beside her.

116
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
Brother,

117
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
what happened?

118
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
I don't know.

119
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,680
I don't know.

120
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
I don't know.

121
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Brother, what should we do?

122
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
I'm so scared.

123
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,680
Sister Mu Ling will be fine, right?

124
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
You rushed into the Commandery Prince's Manor at this time.

125
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:58,680
You killed someone and let him run away.

126
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
If this gets out,

127
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,680
my wish book will be a joke.

128
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
Go back first.

129
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
I'll take Mu Ling to the hospital.

130
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,680
You two,

131
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,680
carry the corpse.

132
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,680
Yes.

133
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
Mu Ling.

134
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
Mu Ling.

135
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
Shut up.

136
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
If it gets out,

137
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,680
the military law will punish you.

138
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,680
Yes.

139
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,680
Xu Yan Shuo, I'm asking you what happened.

140
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
This is about our Commandery Prince's Manor.

141
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
It has nothing to do with you.

142
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
Joke.

143
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,680
You killed someone in your Commandery Prince's Manor.

144
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,680
Did you really care about him?

145
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,680
Can you protect him?

146
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
This is about me and Mu Ling.

147
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
It has nothing to do with you.

148
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,680
I want to take him away.

149
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
You dare?

150
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
What can't I dare?

151
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
Put him down.

152
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,680
If you're not afraid that the officers will trouble you,

153
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,680
shoot me.

154
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
You're so stubborn.

155
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,680
You're so stubborn.

156
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,680
Your sister can marry whoever she wants.

157
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,680
I'll only marry Shen Mu Ling in my life.

158
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,680
Lan Xukai.

159
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
Mu Ling.

160
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
Mu Ling.

161
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,680
Are you okay?

162
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,680
I'm fine.

163
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,680
Yan Shuo.

164
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
Yan Shuo.

165
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,680
I'm here.

166
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

167
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,680
Come.

168
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,680
Your Highness.

169
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,680
I'm here.

170
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

171
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

172
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

173
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

174
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

175
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

176
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

177
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

178
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

179
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

180
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

181
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

182
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

183
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

184
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

185
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

186
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

187
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

188
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

189
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

190
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
I'll take you to the hospital.

191
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,680
I'm sorry to say goodbye to you.

192
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,680
Love is like a game.

193
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,680
I knew that I didn't want to die.

194
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,680
Your eyes are so beautiful.

195
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,680
When a song of farewell

196
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,680
is sung in this life,

197
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:00,680
tears are falling.

198
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,680
No sound, no words,

199
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,680
the bitter and bitter words.

200
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
In the fire,

201
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,680
we are not apart.

202
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
When a song of farewell

203
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,680
is sung in this life,

204
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,680
the moon and the beach are in the heart.

205
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
The flowers are like you.

206
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,680
You are unforgettable.

207
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,680
Your face is clear in the ruins.

208
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,680
The Long Ballad
