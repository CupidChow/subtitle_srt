1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want to be with you.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I want to be with you.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I want to be with you.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to be with you.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I want to be with you.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I want to be with you.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I want to be with you.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to be with you.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I want to be with you.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I want to be with you.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I want to be with you.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I want to be with you.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I want to be with you.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want to be with you.

15
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:04,000
Be brave and bold when we're together run.

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,480
Subbers troubles foreigners

17
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,700
pandem obviously

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,540
Young Master.

19
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,960
He's crazy.

20
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,460
After taking the initiative to establish a family with you,

21
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,000
you'll do it with hope, right?

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,560
No need.

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,960
I was wrong and they can support a family!

24
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,480
I'll ask Wei Bryce to blend in with you

25
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,500
so that you enjoy family life when you grow up.

26
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,800
I don't want to hear another thing!

27
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,720
Sir...

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,680
Sorry, I was wrong

29
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:23,160
Astute

30
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,780
ering to that girl in such a cruel way?

31
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,080
That young lady

32
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,880
who stabilize My Mate is Mr. Shen Ye.

33
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,420
Who are you?

34
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,860
Just her!

35
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,860
What are you saying?

36
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,800
That young lady

37
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,560
and my friend

38
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,020
are fighting over XieⅣ,

39
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,940
and HK's mon掅 are alltechicl puddings

40
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,620
which Self-ing rồi

41
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,500
that woman is 你们If

42
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,560
I miss you.

43
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,240
Did you have a nightmare?

44
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,600
You can't see your bride

45
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,960
before you get married.

46
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,000
It's not a good idea.

47
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,600
I don't care.

48
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,520
I just know

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,880
I'll come to see you

50
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,480
when I miss you.

51
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,320
Mu Li.

52
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,000
The wedding is held by an outsider.

53
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,520
But I prepared it

54
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,040
for you tonight.

55
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:30,920
What?

56
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,040
Come with me.

57
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,520
When I was studying in France,

58
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,120
I thought

59
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
I must dance this song

60
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,600
with my beloved one.

61
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,480
But that day in the Commandery Prince's Mansion,

62
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,640
I saw you dance with Xu Yanshu.

63
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,960
I wish I could take you over.

64
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,480
Really?

65
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,400
I saw you and Xu Qingqing

66
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,080
danced happily.

67
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:47,960
Mu Li.

68
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,200
From now on,

69
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,400
no one will be between us.

70
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,960
I'll be your wife.

71
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,080
Except for life and death,

72
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,480
nothing can separate us.

73
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,800
I'll protect you with my rest of my life.

74
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,280
Xingkan.

75
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,520
Xingkan.

76
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,880
Mu Li.

77
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,200
Will you marry me?

78
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Love is not easy.

79
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,160
It's not easy to be together.

80
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,760
I will.

81
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,040
Gabi.

82
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,560
You ox~~

83
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,440
You should go back.

84
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,760
About everything between you and Xingkai,

85
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,680
let me think about it.

86
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,760
Aunt.

87
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,720
I'm afraid

88
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,560
there's no room for him to turn back.

89
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,280
Leave the rest to me.

90
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,040
Guan Hanyang,

91
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,000
why do you

92
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,240
sacrifice my child?

93
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,320
You deserve to die.

94
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,600
Guan Xingkai

95
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,640
is a bastard.

96
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,720
I won't let him be a good man.

97
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,680
I will make your family

98
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,600
suffer.

99
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,520
The first uncle is a good man.

100
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,480
The second uncle has a fair complexion.

101
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,800
The third uncle has a good family.

102
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,920
The fourth uncle...

103
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,440
Time flies.

104
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,120
I didn't expect you to get married

105
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,320
this time.

106
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,440
If Master can see it with his own eyes...

107
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,640
What are you doing?

108
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,480
Why are you crying on a happy day?

109
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,800
Don't be like this.

110
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,840
It's a good thing

111
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,840
that Senior Sister married into the Guan family.

112
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,280
It's a blessing.

113
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,320
It's a blessing.

114
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,360
It's a blessing.

115
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
It's a blessing.

116
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,080
It's a blessing.

117
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,760
We should be happy.

118
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,200
You're right.

119
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,600
Yes.

120
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,360
That's right.

121
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,360
Although I'm going to marry into the Guan family today,

122
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,320
Ruyi Theater

123
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,240
is my family forever.

124
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,480
You're my family forever.

125
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,240
Don't worry.

126
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,760
I'll come back often to see you.

127
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,120
And I'll come back often

128
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,640
to check your homework.

129
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,960
You can't be lazy.

130
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,120
Okay.

131
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,680
What are you doing here?

132
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,960
It's almost time.

133
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Why are you still here?

134
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,080
Senior Sister hasn't left the house yet.

135
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:31,840
Why?

136
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,040
Can't you talk to me?

137
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,160
Mrs. Zhang,

138
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,400
thank you for your hard work.

139
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,360
This is my little gift.

140
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,840
Please accept it.

141
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,920
Boss Shen is so sensible.

142
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,080
Madam,

143
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,280
I'm the one who's going to pick up the bride.

144
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,720
If anything happens

145
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,080
and the wedding is delayed,

146
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,080
I can't afford it.

147
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,280
Congratulations, Boss Shen.

148
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,680
Boss Li, welcome.

149
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,680
Please come in.

150
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,280
Boss Gao, welcome.

151
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
Please come in.

152
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,040
Please come in.

153
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,280
Congratulations.

154
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
Congratulations.

155
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,000
Young Master,

156
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,360
are you in a hurry?

157
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,520
It's not the auspicious time yet.

158
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,600
The wedding sedan

159
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,200
will take a long time.

160
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,320
Don't worry.

161
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
You're so smart.

162
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,160
I didn't expect

163
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,360
you to come here today.

164
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,440
I'm surprised.

165
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,240
The wedding day

166
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,760
is coming.

167
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,680
I'll have to

168
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,200
propose a toast to you later.

169
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,800
I wish you a good luck.

170
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,320
No need.

171
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,680
I've already made a wish.

172
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,520
Please.

173
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,360
Firm.

174
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,560
We can't let them go dizendo.

175
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,600
presents are so interesting.

176
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:22,960
Looks pretty good.

177
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,640
Start.

178
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,720
No wonder.

179
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,280
Congratulations.

180
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
Good.

181
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Good.

182
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
Good.

183
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
Good.

184
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
Mo Ling.

185
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,520
I've waited for too long.

186
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,520
Mrs. Zhang, are we there yet?

187
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Mrs. Zhang.

188
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,520
Mo Ling.

189
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
Good.

190
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,520
The bride is coming in.

191
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,520
Bring the treasure basin.

192
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
May the family be safe.

193
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,520
The son of the nobility, Cao Cao, wins.

194
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,520
Go.

195
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Go.

196
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,520
I know I'm not as good as I thought.

197
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,520
Your eyes are so clear.

198
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:53,520
When a song of parting is heard.

199
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,520
I cry and look at it.

200
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,520
The sound of the flute is bitter.

201
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,520
I want to never leave you.

202
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,520
When a song of sad songs is heard.

203
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
I want to never leave you.

204
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,520
The sand is like a flower.

205
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,520
It's unforgettable.

206
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:23,520
Your face is clear in the ruins.
