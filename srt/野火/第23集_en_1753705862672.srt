I will never forget your kindness

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I will never forget your kindness

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I will never forget your kindness

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I will never forget your kindness

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will never forget your kindness

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I will never forget your kindness

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I will never forget your kindness

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Congratulations, Young Master

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Congratulations, Young Master

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Congratulations, Young Master

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
First bow to the heaven and earth

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Who are you?

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Who are you? Let me out

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let me out, help

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Is there anyone?

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Is there anyone?

25
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Second bow to the parents

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Good

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Second bow to the husband and wife

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Good

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Good

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Send her to the bridal chamber

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Good

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,480
Please Kings G words

33
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,480
ah

34
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,700
yeah

35
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,160
People

36
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:18,760
yes

37
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Open the door!

38
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,920
public

39
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,560
House arrest!

40
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,560
House arrest!

41
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,040
Great!

42
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,720
Mu Li, why did you forget my45,610 thieves?

43
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,760
I...

44
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,280
Where is Shen Muling?

45
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,800
Brother Xing,

46
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,520
we've already defeated the Heavenly Emperor.

47
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,400
I'm your wife now.

48
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,600
Listen,

49
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,400
my wife can only be Shen Muling.

50
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,680
Brother Xing.

51
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,600
Stop.

52
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,240
Where are you going?

53
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,280
I'm going to the Palace of Heaven.

54
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,840
Where?

55
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,240
Mother,

56
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,320
you never really wanted me

57
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,800
to marry Muling, right?

58
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,360
Why did you do that?

59
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,160
Where is Muling?

60
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,720
She's in the place where she should be.

61
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,240
A playboy.

62
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,200
She thinks she can marry into the Guan family.

63
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,040
So back then,

64
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,440
my biological mother, Lan Yu,

65
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,840
you also think so?

66
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,680
Did she

67
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,960
have something to do with you?

68
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,200
Xingkai,

69
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,920
all these years,

70
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,160
I've been doing everything for you.

71
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,240
Everything I've done

72
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,720
is for you,

73
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,280
for the Guan family.

74
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,000
But I never thought

75
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,920
you would suspect me like that.

76
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,000
It really makes me sad.

77
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,400
For the Guan family and for me,

78
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,960
you've always been

79
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,080
only concerned about the position of your mother.

80
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,760
I really hate myself.

81
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,680
I hate myself for not having found my love earlier.

82
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,720
Where is Shen Muling?

83
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,760
Go.

84
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,520
How did this happen?

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,320
Young Master! Young Master!

86
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,440
Mother, what should we do?

87
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,920
What if Brother Xingkai finds out

88
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,000
that Shen Muling was...

89
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,000
Chase him!

90
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,880
Yes!

91
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,080
Remember,

92
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,560
I didn't do anything.

93
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,840
The place and the people

94
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,560
in Ruyi Theater

95
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,840
should have been abandoned long ago.

96
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,280
What's going on?

97
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:01,840
Young Master!

98
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,560
Young Master!

99
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,840
What's going on?

100
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,880
What's going on?

101
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,040
What's going on?

102
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,040
Do you know?

103
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,800
Isn't that Xing Lang?

104
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,000
How did Xing Lang escape?

105
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,600
Xing Lang?

106
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
Xing Lang?

107
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,320
How did he escape?

108
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,240
Hurry up!

109
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,040
What should we do?

110
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,880
Young Master!

111
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,880
Step aside!

112
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,240
Muling!

113
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,400
Muling!

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,720
Muling!

115
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,680
Muling!

116
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,080
Muling!

117
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,360
Muling!

118
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,440
Muling!

119
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,240
Muling!

120
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,800
Muling!

121
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,800
Muling, hang in there.

122
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,040
I'll take you out.

123
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,840
No.

124
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,880
Muling,

125
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,760
push!

126
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,040
Go!

127
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,040
I won't go!

128
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,040
Go!

129
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,040
Go!

130
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,040
I won't go!

131
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,040
Go!

132
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,040
Get off!

133
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Get off!

134
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
Get off!

135
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Get off!

136
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,040
I want to

137
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,040
be with you.

138
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,040
Get off!

139
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Get off!

140
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Get off!

141
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,040
Wake up!

142
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,040
Get off!

143
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,040
Get off!

144
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Wake up!

145
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,040
Get off!

146
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,040
Wake up!

147
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,040
Wake up!

148
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Wake up!

149
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Wake up!

150
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,040
This is too big!

151
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,040
Young Master!

152
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,040
Young Master!

153
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,040
Save me!

154
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,040
Young Master!

155
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,040
Save me!

156
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Save me!

157
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
Save me!

158
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,040
Young Master!

159
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,040
Save me!

160
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,040
Save me!

161
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,040
What are you doing?

162
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
What are you doing?

163
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,040
This is too big!

164
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,040
This is too big!

165
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,040
News! News!

166
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,040
The day of the young master's wedding

167
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,040
is the same as the death of

168
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,040
Boss Shen and Ru Yi Xie!

169
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,040
Mother,

170
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
although the hot-sounding period in the mansion is not over yet,

171
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
your birthday can't be missed.

172
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Brother Xing Kai is gone.

173
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,040
I'll be there to help him.

174
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,040
I've discussed with the elders in the tribe.

175
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,040
I've invited my close friends

176
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,040
to come to the mansion to have a simple gathering.

177
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,040
It's a kind of comfort.

178
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
Qingqing,

179
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,040
you're a good child.

180
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,040
From now on, we'll be left

181
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,040
to depend on each other.

182
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,040
It's just a pain in the neck.

183
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,040
Xu Du Jun is here!

184
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
Mother, look.

185
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,040
Brother Xing Kai and Du Jun Fu are still supporting us.

186
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,040
We're a family.

187
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Let's go.

188
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,040
Xu Qingqing,

189
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,040
you're hopeless!

190
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,040
Shen Muling, the son of King Wei of the Guan Xingkai,

191
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,040
is here to pay his respects.

192
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,040
Isn't this...

193
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,040
Shen Muling,

194
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,040
aren't you dead?

195
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,040
I'm the wife of King Wei of the Guan Xingkai.

196
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,040
As a daughter-in-law,

197
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,040

Whose face are you facing?

230

You disliked her for too long.

231
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,820
I wish my因為'd happy.

232
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,800
It's such an easy way to forget.

233
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,660
When a poem ends and we parted.

234
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,340
This life, it's our last farewell, we let� flying tears fall.

235
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:33,040
aboost on twinweeds, words so bitter

236
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,040
The light of the fire will never leave

237
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,040
When a song is played in the back garden

238
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,640
How lucky to be in the sand of the moon

239
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,440
The essence is like you, out of nowhere

240
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:55,440
The face in the ruins is clear

241
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:10,040
The Long Ballad
