1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want to be with you.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I want to be with you.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I want to be with you.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I want to be with you.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I want to be with you.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I want to be with you.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I want to be with you.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to be with you.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I want to be with you.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I want to be with you.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I want to be with you.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I want to be with you.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I want to be with you.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want to be with you.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I want to be with you.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Love with Princess

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No one is here.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Step aside.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Step aside.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,280
to promote Shen's Academy.

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,040
Here we are.

22
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,440
Why is he here?

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,200
Is he Japanese?

24
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:32,840
Yes.

25
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,760
He's Japanese.

26
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,440
How can he be Japanese?

27
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,760
Is he Japanese?

28
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,040
Is he Japanese?

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,920
Why is he Japanese?

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,760
Why is he Japanese?

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,960
Isn't he a Japanese?

32
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,960
Isn't this Boss Shen?

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,760
Why is Mr. Shantian

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,520
so eager to come here today?

35
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,840
So, Boss Shen is the one who opened the umbrella.

36
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,640
Yes.

37
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,160
Look at my memory.

38
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,880
Isn't this Boss Shen's territory?

39
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,320
I remember a few days ago,

40
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,200
you were here

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,640
and you scolded me

42
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,720
with a bad temper.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,120
How about this?

44
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,240
You stay with me for one night.

45
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,360
I'll say a few nice words

46
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,680
in front of Mr. Shantian.

47
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,040
How about that?

48
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,280
Xingkai.

49
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,520
He's really a scoundrel.

50
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,800
It's urgent.

51
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,560
Gu Dan.

52
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,640
Wait for me.

53
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,200
Wait for me.

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,000
Are you all right?

55
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,360
Stop standing around.

56
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,520
Let's continue.

57
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,960
Hurry up.

58
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,400
Let's go.

59
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,640
Be careful.

60
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,680
Be careful.

61
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,400
Let's go.

62
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,200
Be careful.

63
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,000
Be careful.

64
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,600
Hurry up.

65
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,760
Gu Dan.

66
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,760
Be careful.

67
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,160
Be careful.

68
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,960
Be careful.

69
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,480
Open it.

70
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,080
Good.

71
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,960
I, Shen Muling, was born in the year of the rat.

72
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,800
Since the day I became a teacher,

73
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,560
I've been swearing

74
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,760
to spread the good things of my ancestors.

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,960
I've been doing all these years

76
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,880
and I can't say I've done all the good things.

77
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,880
But I'm not guilty.

78
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,200
But today,

79
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,920
I feel guilty to my ancestors and my teacher.

80
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,800
So I ask you all to witness it.

81
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,080
From today on,

82
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,000
I, Shen Muling, will make up for it.

83
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,480
The

84
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,800
evidence needs more.

85
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,400
Time is limited.

86
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:46,920
Everyone comes up.

87
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,280
Come out.

88
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,000
Come.

89
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,640
Everything will be okay.

90
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,680
Hurry up.

91
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,040
Kill them!

92
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,400
What are you doing?

93
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,440
Kill them!

94
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,040
You're going to kill them!

95
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,080
You son of a bitch!

96
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,200
Calm down.

97
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
Kill them!

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,040
You son of a bitch!

99
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,920
Kill them!

100
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,160
Kill them!

101
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Kill the bull!

102
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
Kill the bull!

103
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
Kill the bull!

104
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,160
Kill the bull!

105
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,160
Kill the bull!

106
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,160
Kill the bull!

107
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Kill the bull!

108
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
Villagers! Villagers!

109
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Listen to me!

110
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
Move aside! Move aside!

111
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,160
Where were you when they were here?

112
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
You can't find your way when they are gone!

113
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,160
How can you go to the front line?

114
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,160
Go!

115
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,160
Get out! Get out!

116
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,160
You are so annoying!

117
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,160
You are so annoying!

118
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,160
Go! Go!

119
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,160
It's good to make the crowd feel good.

120
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,160
If we don't feel anything at this time,

121
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
that's the real sadness.

122
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,160
Xingkai,

123
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,160
when do you think we can live

124
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,160
in a peaceful life?

125
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,160
Soon.

126
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
I hope so.

127
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
Mu Ling,

128
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,160
marry me.

129
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,160
You want to marry me?

130
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
I care about this life.

131
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,160
I will marry you in this life.

132
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
Now?

133
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
At this time?

134
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,160
Are you sure?

135
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,160
Marrying you

136
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,160
is the best time.

137
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,160
Mr. Xu.

138
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
You don't want to?

139
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
You...

140
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,160
Of course I do.

141
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,160
But I'm still being scolded.

142
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
My mother left this to me.

143
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
She asked me to give her this.

144
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Since you agreed,

145
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,160
you can't go back on your word.

146
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,160
Fine.

147
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,160
Since they dared to come to Rong City,

148
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,160
they will have no regrets.

149
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
So we have to make this

150
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
an accident.

151
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
You two must do well

152
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
and not prove it on the spot.

153
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
I'll arrange the rest.

154
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,160
The two brothers are so happy.

155
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,160
They are so happy.

156
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
Mr. Guan,

157
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,160
if I stop singing,

158
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,160
you will be more intimate.

159
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,160
Mr. Guan is really crazy.

160
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,160
He is still being scolded.

161
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,160
Damn it.

162
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,160
Why is the warehouse empty?

163
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,160
This is the news I got.

164
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,160
It shouldn't be.

165
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,160
Mr. Guan, listen to me.

166
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,160
No. 1! No. 1!

167
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
Buy the newspaper! Buy the newspaper!

168
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
Give me a newspaper.

169
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,160
Come on, give me one.

170
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,160
No. 1! No. 1!

171
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,160
The enemy's men were attacked by the King of Yi of Ai!

172
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,160
The fire burns my tears

173
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Thousands of lives are calling for the end

174
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,160
The wind and rain

175
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,160
The flowers fall like a smile

176
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,160
The noodles are being cooked

177
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,160
You have been loving me for too long

178
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,160
I knew I would die for you

179
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,160
I will never forget your words

180
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,160
When we parted in the night

181
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,160
I cried in the song

182
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,160
The sound of the flute and the flowers

183
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,160
We will never leave each other

184
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,160
When we parted in the night

185
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,160
The moon and the beach are like a flower

186
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,160
You are unforgettable

187
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Your face is clear in the ruins
