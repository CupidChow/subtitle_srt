1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I want to be returned

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The path is hard to avoid

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Even if it's a little white

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's a promise

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I want to love you

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Even if it's an accident

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm confused and understand

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Clouds in the sky, dust in the ground

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I want to be represented

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Like a great chest user

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
來

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
What does love mean?

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,840
汐梅

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,600
Who are you?

15
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:54,920
Stop licence of entrance.

16
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,320
Are you eating wild cat?

17
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,160
Mr. Cheng.

18
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,960
It's dangerous to come out

19
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,160
without a sound in the middle of the night.

20
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,200
It's them.

21
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,960
It's them who killed my master.

22
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,640
I saw that bead just now.

23
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:10,920
What bead?

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,040
When I went in that night,

25
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,960
my master was out of breath.

26
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,640
That fire was obviously

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,480
to cover up the truth.

28
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,120
What?

29
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,720
The bead in Guan Jingyang's hand

30
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,280
is exactly the same as the one in front of my master's bed.

31
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,440
That bead

32
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,640
is the gift that Guan Jingyang gave to Liang Man.

33
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,360
Since you know it's them,

34
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,720
then find out the truth.

35
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,480
Let's go.

36
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,700
The discord between rapsody and sweetness

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,080
What?

38
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,000
Eight Yin Styles.

39
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,440
What's the other sign for?

40
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,880
Rappelling.

41
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,720
What is it?

42
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,480
That's the sound of flowing moon.

43
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,920
It's coming.

44
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,640
I don't understand it.

45
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,720
It's coming.

46
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,240
It's coming.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,800
It's coming.

48
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,000
It's coming.

49
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,960
It's coming.

50
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:21,960
What's this?

51
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:22,880
There's the sound of that sound.

52
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,640
What?

53
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Ghost!

54
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
Ghost!

55
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,840
Ghost, Madam.

56
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,240
I saw blood on the scroll.

57
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:42,880
What blood?

58
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,800
Look at it.

59
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,200
There's no blood on it.

60
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,400
There's clearly Master's...

61
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,120
Madam, I didn't lie to you.

62
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,480
There's really...

63
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,880
It's you.

64
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,560
You did it.

65
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,600
Madam,

66
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,520
I don't know what ghost and scriptures she's talking about.

67
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
You're the murderer.

68
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,200
What are you trying to do?

69
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,840
Are you trying to spill the blood on me?

70
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,640
Mother,

71
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,880
since Second Madam is claiming to be a ghost,

72
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,120
why don't we invite a magician to take a look?

73
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,640
If there's really a ghost,

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,200
it can comfort the hearts of the people in the mansion.

75
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,240
Brother Xingkai, you're right.

76
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,440
Aunt,

77
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,680
there are so many people in this courtyard.

78
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,280
Why does Madam Liang

79
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,360
always keep an eye on Boss Shen?

80
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,080
Everyone knows

81
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,040
that Boss Shen is...

82
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,440
I mean,

83
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,880
the blood may not be on someone.

84
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,680
If there's a problem,

85
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,800
both of them are suspicious, right?

86
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,560
Miss Xu, you're really on time.

87
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,280
I think Qingqing is right.

88
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,080
Miss Shen, what do you think?

89
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,400
Madam,

90
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,120
if I can find out the truth,

91
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,400
and bring peace to the soul-guards,

92
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,680
and clear my name,

93
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,080
I'll be willing to do it.

94
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Good.

95
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
That's it.

96
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,360
Xingkai,

97
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,520
you'll be in charge of the evil-doers.

98
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,600
Okay.

99
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,360
Boss Shen.

100
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,160
Boss Shen,

101
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,320
I was just looking at that cold and crazy man.

102
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,960
I just want to help you clear your suspicion.

103
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,760
If there's anything wrong,

104
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,480
don't blame me, okay?

105
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,400
No.

106
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,160
That's great.

107
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,960
I knew you were a kind person.

108
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:06,800
By the way,

109
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,680
I heard from Brother Xingkai

110
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,520
that Boss Shen sings very well.

111
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,160
Can you invite Boss Shen

112
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,680
to sing a song

113
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,560
at the mansion some other day?

114
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Miss Xu,

115
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,400
we have to go.

116
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:21,920
See you.

117
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,160
This is Mr. Liu.

118
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,360
He is well-versed in the heaven and the earth.

119
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,760
He can understand the spirit of the eight directions.

120
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,280
You only need to drink

121
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,800
the golden talisman water.

122
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,280
After three sips,

123
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,600
the evil spirits will naturally appear in the mirror.

124
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,080
You can do it later.

125
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,480
Drink it.

126
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,800
What a strange place this is.

127
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:32,040
Losing the armors and smashed people

128
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,120
himself is like that.

129
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,440
If I could see master,

130
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,200
of course I would drink it.

131
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,920
Wait a moment.

132
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,880
Be lenient and hit it one more time.

133
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,480
Wait.

134
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,080
You're a sinner.

135
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,400
One more.

136
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,560
Are you feeling guilty, Second Aunt?

137
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,600
No!

138
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,320
I'm a sinner!

139
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:22,760
Mr. Liu.

140
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,280
What should we do?

141
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,320
Mr. Liu.

142
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,120
Where are they?

143
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,960
Where are they?

144
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,720
Mr. Leng!

145
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,960
Xiaowan.

146
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,160
Xiaowan.

147
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,840
Xiaowan.

148
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,680
Xiaowan.

149
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,280
Xiaowan.

150
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,800
Master.

151
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,520
Xiaowan.

152
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,680
Why did you...

153
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,960
Master.

154
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,480
I'm sorry.

155
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,280
I didn't mean to.

156
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,920
I didn't mean to kill you.

157
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,880
It's...

158
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,960
The End

159
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
Young Master.

160
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,560
It's time to go to the dock.

161
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,280
Young Master.

162
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,720
Young Master.

163
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Young Master.

164
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
Are you tired?

165
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,600
Why now?

166
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,120
You're acting like a young master.

167
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,600
Let's go.

168
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,600
Young Master.

169
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,800
This way.

170
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,560
Still grab on.

171
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,440
Come.

172
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,760
We're too close.

173
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,000
Kill!

174
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
Go!

175
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,320
Send the person to the police station

176
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,240
and knock him out.

177
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,280
Let's see who's calling me.

178
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,200
This is indeed a problem.

179
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,120
It's all smoke.

180
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
Go.

181
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:54,920
Young Master,

182
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,080
the officials have been on the lookout for a long time.

183
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,520
How could someone do such a despicable thing?

184
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,120
If this gets leaked,

185
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,920
the officials' reputation will be ruined.

186
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,360
Maybe it's leaked.

187
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,640
Go tell Dr. Zhang

188
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,800
to deduct all the medicine

189
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
that's needed for the front line

190
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,200
and check it thoroughly.

191
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,320
Go.

192
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,600
It seems that the ghost of the officials

193
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,280
can't be hidden anymore.

194
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,200
Brother Xingkai.

195
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,600
Brother Xingkai.

196
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,840
If you like to listen to opera,

197
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,000
why don't you invite Boss Shen

198
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,160
to sing at your house?

199
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,040
He can listen to you and send him back.

200
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,160
I know

201
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,920
men are all like that.

202
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,480
But don't go too far.

203
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,000
But if you really like it,

204
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,640
I can accept it.

205
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,200
You and I are not married.

206
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,160
What I like

207
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,600
is not something you can accept.

208
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,440
Miss Xue,

209
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,360
are you really willing

210
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,360
to share your beloved

211
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,600
with others?

212
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,400
Mother and Aunt

213
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,480
are all like that.

214
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,440
Why not?

215
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,840
What I want

216
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,600
is a lifetime

217
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,320
and a pair of people.

218
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
Your Majesty?

219
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,440
Master,

220
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,040
Liang Man has confessed to his crimes.

221
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,840
I will find the people behind it.

222
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,560
I won't forgive

223
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,360
anyone who hurt you.

224
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:06,280
Where are the broken pairs of concerts?

225
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:13,680
faults of Love

226
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,640
are a noteworthy thing for the beauty to chicly

227
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,760
Dong Saber is otherwise vas一些

228
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,040
If you used my sword when you left

229
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,920
who would have thought that

230
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:27,760
relief noticing

231
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,240
would be far less likely

232
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,820
experience

233
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,520
I'm doing greenhouse peat

234
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,460
and every since I was an infant

235
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,180
till I'm football раст

236
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,180
I'm sorry.

237
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,980
Master.

238
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,180
This is the first play you gave me.

239
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,580
Do you still remember?

240
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,180
Yes.

241
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,180
Mu Ling.

242
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,780
Did you see that?

243
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,980
Master was right there.

244
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,180
He was smiling at me.

245
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,780
Mu Ling.

246
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,380
Mother is gone.

247
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,180
Master died.

248
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,580
Liang Man entered the government.

249
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,180
Master's death is not that simple.

250
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,780
He and Second Uncle must have been colluding.

251
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,580
The person behind this

252
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,980
must be Guan Jingyang.

253
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,380
Why did he kill Master?

254
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,980
They have nothing to do with each other.

255
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,780
I think they have something to do with

256
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,180
the civil war that has been going on for so many years.

257
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,180
Only when we know what happened to the Guan family

258
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,780
can we know what mother meant.

259
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,180
We can't let anyone who killed Master go.

260
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,380
Promise me.

261
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,580
No matter who he is,

262
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,780
I will never let him go.

263
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,180
I miss Master so much.

264
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,580
No one can ever love me anymore.

265
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,780
I will always be by your side.

266
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,180
Master.

267
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,180
Master.

268
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,380
Something bad has happened.
