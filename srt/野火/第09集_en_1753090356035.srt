1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I will never forget your kindness

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I will never forget your kindness

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I will never forget your kindness

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I will never forget your kindness

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I will never forget your kindness

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I will never forget your kindness

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I will never forget your kindness

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I will never forget your kindness

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I will never forget your kindness

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I will never forget your kindness

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I will never forget your kindness

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I will never forget your kindness

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I will never forget your kindness

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I will never forget your kindness

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:14,280
One person w

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,520
Demant

17
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,520
What?

18
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,420
Fei-Zhang is already dead

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,920
If you come back at once

20
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,920
He will be a Prophet

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,920
I won't allow that

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,440
Okay.

23
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,360
Xingkai,

24
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,080
I've exposed myself.

25
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm afraid we can't go back to Jiangbei.

26
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,160
But there are many things

27
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,360
that need to be changed.

28
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,400
We've been working together for many years.

29
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,240
I trust you.

30
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,600
Besides,

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,120
you always said

32
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,400
you wanted to go to the front line.

33
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,440
Now the opportunity is in front of you.

34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,280
Mr. Zhang,

35
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,480
it's just a joke.

36
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,760
I can't do it.

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,720
You...

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,240
You're worried about your identity?

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,200
I can send an urgent message now.

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,400
From now on, you'll handle

41
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,800
all the grudges in Jiangbei.

42
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,720
From now on, you're the wild fire.

43
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,760
Mr. Zhang,

44
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,480
I'm a businessman, not a kind person.

45
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,760
We can cooperate in business.

46
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,320
But as for the rest...

47
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,640
Okay.

48
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,320
During the security period,

49
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,440
everything that happened here today,

50
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,080
you'll find out by yourself...

51
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,720
Don't worry.

52
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,440
I won't tell anyone.

53
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,440
Take care.

54
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,440
Send more people.

55
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,320
Be careful.

56
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,880
Guards!

57
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,800
Beat them!

58
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,680
Yes.

59
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,520
I'll see who dares to do it!

60
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,000
Congratulations.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,720
Let's go.

62
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,880
Mr. Zhang,

63
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,560
I don't want to see

64
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,080
anyone except Boss Shen today.

65
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,800
Did you hear that?

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Our army has taken over the factory today.

67
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,160
If you don't leave,

68
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,240
stay here and eat guns.

69
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,480
Shen Muling,

70
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,080
I forgive you for the sake of

71
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,000
Governor Xu.

72
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,600
But it's not over yet.

73
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,840
Half a month.

74
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,280
I want you to come and apologize within half a month.

75
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,600
Otherwise,

76
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,400
the Chamber of Commerce will stop.

77
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
Madam.

78
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,600
So many people, madam.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,800
Madam.

80
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,040
Are you all right?

81
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,400
Thank you.

82
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,880
There are so many good men in the world.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,200
Why are there so many?

84
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,240
Look at how hurt he is.

85
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
What good is he, Yuan?

86
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,080
Don't worry, Boss Shen.

87
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,120
I'm just passing by for work.

88
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,000
But you should be glad that

89
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,360
I'm passing by.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,640
Otherwise, you, the theater girl,

91
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,520
will be hit again.

92
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,920
It seems that Governor Xu admitted that

93
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,600
last time he came to our theater,

94
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,960
he was a little inappropriate.

95
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,680
It seems that Young Master Guan is not sad about you.

96
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,880
I won't bother you.

97
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,040
Take care.

98
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,000
Xiaoyue.

99
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,840
Come down, Xiaoyue.

100
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,400
Xiaoyue.

101
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,440
You can't get up.

102
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,600
Yes.

103
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
Come down.

104
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,840
What are you doing, Xiaoyue?

105
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,840
Come down.

106
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,840
Come down.

107
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,760
I'm sorry, Sister.

108
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,840
I got you and Young Master Guan

109
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,840
and the whole theater involved.

110
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,800
I'm sorry.

111
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,920
What are you talking about?

112
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,160
Do you remember what you said

113
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,920
when you knelt in front of Master?

114
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
You said that you would make a decision one day.

115
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,600
You will make three rounds of the Eastern Lian and the Western Lian.

116
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,040
You have suffered so much for him

117
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,360
all these years.

118
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,560
You also suffered for yourself.

119
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,600
Don't you feel sorry for yourself?

120
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,480
Xiaoyue, listen to me.

121
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,640
Come down first.

122
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,880
Don't worry.

123
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,160
I'm here.

124
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,000
I will never let you suffer for nothing.

125
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,920
God doesn't give you justice.

126
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,880
I'll get it back for you.

127
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,400
But...

128
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,280
But what's the use of getting justice back?

129
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,720
I have nothing left.

130
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,960
Sister.

131
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,200
I'm in so much pain.

132
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,600
I'm sorry.

133
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,680
I'll pay you back for your kindness.

134
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,920
I'll pay you back in the next life.

135
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,560
Xiaoyue.

136
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,680
If you really feel sorry for your sister,

137
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,760
you shouldn't have died here.

138
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,800
If the news spreads out in the future,

139
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,440
how can I do business?

140
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,560
What are you doing?

141
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,280
If you don't want her to die,

142
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,960
you have to trust me.

143
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,120
Jump.

144
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,640
Jump.

145
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,200
Why don't you jump?

146
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,040
Jump.

147
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,600
That's right.

148
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,200
Xiaoyue.

149
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,840
If you jump today,

150
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,360
I'll use your ashes to break into the pond tomorrow.

151
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,560
I'll go to Jin's Mansion.

152
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,320
I'll apologize to Jin's Mansion.

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,960
Xiaoyue.

154
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,760
Xiaoyue.

155
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,880
Xiaoyue.

156
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,960
Are you okay?

157
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,640
Sister.

158
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,920
It's okay.

159
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,320
I'm here.

160
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,800
Are you stupid?

161
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,960
Let's go back to the room first.

162
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,720
Are you hurt?

163
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,920
Let's go.

164
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,400
Can you stand up?

165
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,560
Let's go.

166
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,160
Be careful.

167
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,080
Go.

168
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,920
When are you and my sister's marriage scheduled?

169
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,680
You knew that I like Miss Xu so much,

170
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,120
but I באקre to give die ini step of the wrongs on your wound.

171
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,880
Don't you care about her happiness at all?

172
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,640
As long as she wants it,

173
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,880
she can get it at all costs.

174
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,480
Then this time,

175
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,680
I'm afraid I'm going to let you down.

176
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,000
I didn't poison it.

177
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,640
You're so arrogant.

178
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,120
Believe it or not,

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,760
it's up to you.

180
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,360
From now on,

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I owe you

182
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,880
less trouble.

183
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,800
Young Master,

184
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,280
your move is amazing.

185
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,280
Go back on it.

186
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,680
Jia Bosong,

187
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,760
come.

188
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,000
Listen.

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,760
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,720
It can only be delayed for a while.

191
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,120
But we need to prepare for the meeting as soon as possible.

192
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,680
It's a good time to

193
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,320
make the best of the situation.

194
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,720
If it's too late,

195
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,880
we'll die on the tree.

196
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,360
But Tang Hui has been robbed.

197
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,840
I'm afraid it's too late.

198
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,160
By the way,

199
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,200
how are Xiao Yuan and Boss Shen?

200
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:44,840
They've arranged it.

201
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,600
The doctor prescribed some medicine for Xiao Yuan.

202
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,800
He said he was on a break.

203
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
He'll recover in a few days

204
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,960
if he doesn't suffer from the shock.

205
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,760
Boss Shen?

206
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:53,880
He's in such a hurry.

207
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,600
Boss Shen.

208
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,640
Who are you?

209
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,840
What are you doing?

210
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,760
Put me down!

211
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,360
Boss Shen,

212
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,920
you deserve to die

213
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,560
for a long life.

214
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:05,880
Bai Xiao Di,

215
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,560
aren't you dead?

216
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,200
Shut up!

217
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,760
That's my brother!

218
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,480
Shen Muliang,

219
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,240
you and Guan Xingkai tried so hard to find me.

220
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,040
I didn't expect

221
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,720
you'd end up

222
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,480
in my hands.

223
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,960
You deserve to die.

224
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,640
This is what you did to my brother!

225
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
You were the one

226
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,280
who fired the gun at the theater that day.

227
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,680
What's that look on your face?

228
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,360
You didn't even know who the real murderer was.

229
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,240
You just found someone to avenge you.

230
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,800
You're so stupid.

231
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,480
You're so funny.

232
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,200
Funny?

233
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,280
I'll make you laugh today!

234
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,560
I'll take his life!

235
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,360
Xingkai!

236
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,360
Stop!

237
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,800
If you go any further,

238
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,000
I'll cut your rope right now!

239
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,680
Your brother was a police officer.

240
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,320
I sent someone to arrest him.

241
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,320
I should be the one

242
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,880
who should die.

243
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,320
How about this?

244
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,360
Let him go and get me.

245
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,720
Guan Xingkai, what are you doing?

246
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,200
I told you.

247
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,040
We didn't kill your brother.

248
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,080
Don't you understand?

249
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,600
I heard that Guan family had a lover.

250
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,360
But I didn't expect it to be true.

251
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,440
You're a traitor.

252
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,920
You didn't even know who killed your brother.

253
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,880
And you want to avenge him?

254
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,920
Chunsheng!

255
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,120
What do you mean?

256
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,960
Who's a traitor?

257
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,920
You're so stupid.

258
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,640
Don't you understand?

259
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,280
Chunsheng.

260
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,680
Young Master, be careful!

261
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,520
Xingkai!

262
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,440
Mu Ling!

263
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:23,960
Hold on!

264
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,960
I'll save you!
