will go down with me.

190
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,520
Use all connections,

191
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,680
all strength.

192
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,160
No matter what it takes,

193
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,200
we can't let them survive this!

194
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,200
Yes.

195
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,600
Hear that?

196
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,240
Yes, yes.

197
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,040
Prosecutor,

198
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,280
this is the witness
in the Song family gang crime case.

199
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,240
I formally

200
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,560
hand him over to you.

201
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,760
Okay, Inspector Huo.

202
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,720
It's finally over.

203
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,720
Why?

204
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,920
We're colleagues.

205
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:46,120
Why help Song Pa silence him?

206
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
Inspector Huo.

207
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,080
Song Pa took my family hostage.

208
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,600
He said
if I didn't kill Jiang Meng by 3,

209
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,800
my whole family would die.

210
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,360
I didn't have a choice.

211
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,280
Take him away.

212
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,000
Yes, sir.

213
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:12,640
Wait.

214
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:13,440
No.

215
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,400
No...

216
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:14,880
Move!

217
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,440
- Move!
- No.

218
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,840
[Huo Xiao]

219
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,040
I shook off the killers

220
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,960
and reached the chief's office.

221
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,040
Jiang Meng is dead.

222
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,960
There's a mole.

223
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,760
Go, now!

224
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,400
Ye Ying.

225
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,160
Ye Ying!

226
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,720
What a pity.

227
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,760
You almost made it.

228
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,240
But with Jiang Meng dead,

229
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,160
the fence-sitters
are back to me.

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,240
Now

231
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,200
it's my turn to strike back.

232
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,080
The best strategy is to retreat.

233
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,600
Time to slip away first.

234
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,160
Ye Ying.

235
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,120
Didn't expect to
end up in my hands, huh?

236
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,160
This is called

237
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,720
"Wait for the prey
to come to you."

238
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,040
So what do you want?

239
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,200
To kill me?

240
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,160
If you fell into
my dad's hands,

241
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,360
you might be dead.

242
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,760
But in mine,

243
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,800
I'm willing to

244
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,560
take the risk

245
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,480
to take you

246
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,240
far away.

247
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,600
The old me might've said no,

248
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,680
but now it's different.

249
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
But...

250
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,600
how will you protect me?

251
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,240
As long as
you obediently follow me

252
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,000
and do as I say,

253
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,040
I'd never let anything
happen to you.

254
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,720
Then I better show you
what I've got.

255
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,760
So kinky.

256
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,000
Quite a few tricks, huh?

257
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,160
Why pretend to be
a pure saint before?

258
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,240
See.

259
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,640
Showing your wild side at last.

260
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,680
The exciting part

261
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,160
is yet to come.

262
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,240
Remember your masterpiece?

263
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,480
You're not Ye Ying.

264
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:18,680
You're An Ning!

265
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,920
You're alive.

266
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,160
You shameless woman.

267
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,000
You dared to lie to me!

268
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,440
I just love
your unrepentant ways.

269
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,600
