gave you those photos.

If this gets out,
it'll damage the company's image.

with a sense of duty,

188
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,720
Longxing Group will never tolerate

189
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,120
such unfounded slander!

190
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,120
As the group's main shareholder,

191
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,280
I'm not even rushing this.

192
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,400
So why are you all panicking?

193
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,720
Before figuring out the truth,

194
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,200
you're already desperate to cut ties.

195
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Isn't that exactly what the person
behind this wants?

196
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,960
If we don't find
who's pulling the strings,

197
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,640
whoever takes that chairman seat

198
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,680
won't have it easy.

199
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,560
Chairman An,

200
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,080
the board really can't be accused of

201
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,720
not giving you a chance now.

202
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,240
I'm here to handle
the resignation procedures.

203
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,480
The process isn't done yet,

204
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,240
so I can't leave for now.

205
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,440
Luckily I got to
catch this drama unfold.

206
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,680
Otherwise I'd have missed
my best friend's brilliant move.

207
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,520
That would've been such a shame.

208
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,320
I'm really curious.

209
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,080
With such a huge scandal
hanging over you,

210
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,720
the whole group's about to
sink with you.

211
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,560
How do you plan to make a comeback now?

212
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,160
- Chairman An.
- Make way, please.

213
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:44,920
Chairman An, can we get a comment?

214
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,600
Stop filming, stop filming!

215
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,720
- Chairman An.
- No more filming!

216
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,480
Chairman An!

217
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,680
What do you want to say

218
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
about this incident?

219
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,120
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

220
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,560
Exactly, any comment on this incident?

221
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,000
- About this incident...
- Please look at the camera.

222
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,640
Will there be any further impact?

223
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,040
Please answer our question.

224
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,280
- Please say something.
- Yeah, give us an answer.

225
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,280
Exactly, please respond directly
to our question.

226
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,960
You must be very proud now, right?

227
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,400
The woman in that video
has a mole on her left shoulder.

228
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,840
But I don't.

229
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,840
She's got two studs on her right ear.

230
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,040
And I don't wear any.

231
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,480
I know spreading rumors is easy,
but clearing them isn't.

232
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,920
Many people only care about
clicks and sensationalism,

233
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,440
not the truth.

234
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,960
I'm not just explaining this

235
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,760
to prove my innocence.

236
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,680
I also want to ask one thing.

237
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,600
Can't you see how shoddy

238
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,400
this computer-generated video is?

239
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,200
Do you think you can fool everyone

240
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,960
with just a few vague words

241
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,600
to prove the video is fake?

242
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Then do you think

243
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,120
it's real?

244
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,160
Stop filming, all of you, stop!

245
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,600
Stop filming!

246
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,520
An Ning, how dare you!

247
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,040
It's fake, completely fake!

248
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,200
Of course it's fake.

249
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,560
I was just using you as an example.

250
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,760
After all,

251
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,120
you're the one behind all of this.

252
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,800
I've already found
the original IP address of this video

253
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,560
and the on-site
surveillance footage.

254
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,960
Fang Yao,
do you have anything else to say?

255
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,440
Miss Fang,

256
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,480
is any of this real?

257
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,640
Could you please explain?

258
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,960
An Ning, I...

259
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,840
You don't have to explain it to me.

260
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,800
You should explain it to the police.

261
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,120
Even if the video's fake,

262
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,480
flirting with

263
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,720
the Inspector as a married woman

264
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,000
is totally true.

265
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,560
Nonsense!

266
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,960
You think you know my wife

267
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,320
better than I do?

268
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,120
Honey.

269
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,000
Fang Yao,

270
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,360
you're a woman too.

271
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,520
Don't you know

272
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,720
how harmful

273
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,440
these rumors are once they spread?

274
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,480
They can even

275
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,200
destroy her whole life.

276
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,560
I don't care at all.

277
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,400
I just want you gone!

278
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,320
Yao.

279
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,320
What a pity.

280
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,720
Justice always wins.

281
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,120
Justice always wins.

282
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,800
I'm Police Inspector Huo Xiao.

283
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,720
I'm also the person involved in

284
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
the so-called slut-shaming incident
you all stirred up.

285
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,520
I know many of the media love
stirring up trouble

286
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,560
and make things up out of nothing.

287
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,160
Let me give you one piece of advice.

288
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,000
There's no limit to
how far wrongdoing can go,

289
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,760
but being a decent person
takes conscience.

290
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,600
Do too many bad things,

291
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,080
and you'll have to
face the consequences.

292
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,320
If you dare to report this again,

293
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,800
just feel free to write that

294
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,480
it was me, Huo Xiao,
who seduced the married woman An Ning.

295
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,240
During such a sensitive period,

296
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,480
you really didn't have to come.

297
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,320
After all,
they're using my identity as a headline.

298
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,200
And that could hurt your reputation.

299
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,240
But lies like these

300
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,400
will fall apart
the moment you question them.

301
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,480
Do you really think
the law is just for show?

302
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,960
Let me help you apply some medicine.

303
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,200
Honestly, to me,

304
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,960
you're not that so-called married woman.

305
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,240
Nor are you "An Ning" they talk about.

306
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,680
You're just yourself.

307
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,400
No matter who I am,

308
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,960
being in this position,

309
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,480
I have to play the role well.

310
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Are you alright?

311
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,000
Did I hurt you?

312
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,320
If one day,

313
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,000
your memory comes back,

314
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,400
have you thought

315
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,120
how you'd handle it?

316
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,560
Without a past,

317
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,440
how can I plan the future?

318
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,000
I just want a happy ending.

319
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,280
Waiting for a good outcome.

320
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We'll only know what the future holds

321
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,080
when it comes.

322
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,720
Whether the ending is good or not

323
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,720
