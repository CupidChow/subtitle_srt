[Episode 17]

9
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,120
Get out.

10
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,560
Why should I leave?

11
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,280
This is my house.

12
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,560
You're my wife.

13
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,440
I can do whatever I want.

14
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,640
An Ning.

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,600
Have I been too nice to you lately?

16
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,440
You think you're tougher now, huh?

17
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,800
Giving me attitude?

18
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,680
Cheating on me?

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,200
What does Huo Xiao have that I don't?

20
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,200
You're a beast.

21
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,640
How can you compare to a human?

22
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,360
You'll never be his equal
in this lifetime.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,800
You shameless one.

24
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,120
Have you forgotten?

25
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,640
Have you forgotten
how you begged to marry me?

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,720
How you cried
and begged to sleep with me?

27
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,800
I...

28
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,240
Seems like you're asking for trouble.

29
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,600
Tonight I'll make sure you remember
who's in charge.

30
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,840
So that

31
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,000
you stop fooling around

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,320
with other people all day long.

33
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,920
I'll hit...

34
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,240
You...

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,680
You dare to hit me back?

36
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,760
Since we're saying everything out loud,

37
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,160
let's settle all our scores today.

38
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,480
Do you hear me?

39
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,960
This...

40
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,400
When you hit me back then,

41
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,960
weren't you so proud of yourself?

42
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,240
You sneaky woman.

43
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,160
How dare you steal the videos
from my phone?

44
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,680
How else could I stand up for myself?

45
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,480
You were the one
who had your eye on me first

46
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,360
and begged me
again and again to marry you.

47
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,920
I once had hope for you.

48
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,680
I once looked forward to a good life.

49
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,880
But what about you?

50
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,320
What did you give me in return?

51
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,160
I...

52
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,000
Your cruel words.

53
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,080
Your violence.

54
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,840
And endless pain!

55
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:32,840
Today,

56
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,240
this little bit of pain

57
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,280
is just a small part of what you owe me.

58
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,720
From now on,

59
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,600
I'll settle with you one by one!

60
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,600
We've arrived at the company?

61
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,920
You've been exhausted lately,
haven't you?

62
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,760
Share restructuring

63
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,120
and staff reorganization

64
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,200
take a lot of energy.

65
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,440
Why are you following me?

66
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,360
You…

67
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,480
You're our young lady, Ye Ying.

68
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,240
Miss.

69
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,400
Huo Xiao...

70
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,520
Huo Xiao is the one
who killed your father.

71
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,560
How could you be with the man
who ended your father's life?

72
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,200
Although there were
some errors earlier

73
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,720
when verifying your identity,

74
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,840
from your movements and habits,

75
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,920
your combat stance,

76
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,600
even the way you draw a gun,

77
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,000
you could never be the housewife,
An Ning.

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,720
You're our young lady,

79
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,080
Ye Ying.

80
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,440
Miss.

81
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,760
This is a video secretly recorded
by our guy

82
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,520
before the boss was killed.

83
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,720
After we left,

84
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,920
only the boss and Huo Xiao
stayed on the rooftop to talk.

85
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,640
So the boss's death
must be connected to Huo Xiao.

86
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,240
Don't let Huo Xiao fool you.

87
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,800
Why Huo Xiao?

88
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,400
Why him?

89
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,480
That's impossible.

90
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,120
Miss.

91
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,640
Are you alright?

92
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,280
I'll go find him myself
and get the truth.

93
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,040
Why are you here?

94
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,520
What do you mean?

95
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,440
Is this...

96
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,760
a special surprise?

97
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,000
Why you?

98
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,160
Why did you kill Ye Hong?

99
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,920
Why ask that?

100
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm the one asking you.

101
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Answer me!

102
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,160
An Ning.

103
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,040
Calm down.

104
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,400
Don't trust everyone too easily.

105
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,720
Don't be used as a pawn.

106
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,840
Believe it or not.

107
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,160
I can make my own judgment.

108
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,920
Huo Xiao.

109
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,760
I came to find you.

110
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,720
All I want is the truth.

111
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,600
The truth.

112
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,520
What truth are you looking for?

113
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,680
I'm a policeman.

114
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,240
He is a gangster.

115
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,320
It was my duty to arrest him,

116
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:01,920
wasn't it?

117
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,760
As for his death,

118
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,440
the case hasn't been closed yet.

119
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,760
So I can't give you a definite answer.

120
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,000
You know everything.

121
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,600
But you're just hiding it from me.

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,920
Huo Xiao.

123
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,160
Since you won't tell me the truth,

124
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,480
I'll find the answers myself.

125
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,880
I know you
have a lot of questions now,

126
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:25,080
but this isn't the best time
to answer them.

127
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,920
You need to remember who you are.

128
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,000
You're An Ning now.

129
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,120
You're Ti Cha's wife.

130
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,440
You're the chairman of Longxing Group.

131
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,120
I don't know what game you're playing,

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,600
and I don't know

133
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,920
what role I'm supposed to play.

134
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,240
But starting today,

135
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,880
you're you,

136
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,760
and I'm me.

137
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,160
Huo Xiao took down our warehouse before,

138
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,600
and he found that shipment.

139
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,840
We suffered

140
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,080
heavy losses.

141
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,920
I was planning to
take advantage of him at first.

142
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,640
Didn't expect that guy to be
so uncooperative.

143
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,720
He's been opposing us at every turn.

144
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,440
We have to get rid of him now.

145
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,960
Alright.

146
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,440
I'll go finish him off right now.

147
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,120
I was just about to
come looking for you.

148
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,600
Didn't expect you to
come to me yourself.

149
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,760
You want to kill me?

150
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,720
What's wrong?

151
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,640
Trying to beg for mercy now?

152
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,200
Too late.

153
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,600
You don't even realize the end is near.

154
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,960
No wonder
you've never amounted to anything.

155
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
Huo Xiao.

156
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,280
I did give you a chance.

157
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,080
But you

158
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,880
never learned where you truly stand.

159
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,960
You thought I was just against you,

160
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,200
but you never realized

161
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,720
I was trying to save you.

162
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,240
Huo Xiao.

163
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,520
You checked our accounts,

164
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,600
stole our goods,

165
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,240
and almost took down Jiang Meng.

166
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,240
You even backed that scheming An Ning,

167
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,480
trying to take our place.

168
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,760
You call that saving us?

169
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,840
Huo Xiao.

170
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,080
Have you lost your mind?

171
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,640
The audit order
came from above long ago.

172
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,840
Checking accounts means clearing debts.

173
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,960
The warehouse location
was already exposed.

174
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,200
Seizing the goods
was cutting losses.

175
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,800
Not finishing you off was unexpected,

176
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,160
since you dared to pull a gun on me.

177
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,800
Huo Xiao.

178
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,720
Do you think saying this

179
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,880
will get you off the hook?

180
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,880
Well?

181
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,520
You really want to kill me?

182
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,480
Are you so sure

183
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,480
that you can clean up every mess?

184
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,240
Jiang Meng.

185
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,960
Calm down first.

186
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,200
Let him finish.

187
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,520
Right.

188
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,480
Now that's how partners should talk.

189
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,320
Don't get cocky.

190
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,560
You still haven't told me

191
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,000
why you want An Ning

192
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,680
in the chairman's seat.

193
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,520
This is the final step
to becoming legitimate.

194
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,200
Everything I did before

195
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,240
was just trimming the group's excess.

196
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,640
As for the final result,

197
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,720
someone still has to take the fall.

198
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,520
I told you before,

199
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,960
the police are digging into
Longxing Group.

200
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,280
Did you really think their silence now

201
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,640
means that order is nothing
but empty words?

202
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,080
Huo, my dear nephew.

203
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,960
You should've said so earlier.

204
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,320
If you had spoken up sooner,

205
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,720
we wouldn't have had
so many misunderstandings.

206
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,000
With that, we wouldn't have been acting
so convincingly.

207
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,240
If you said something else,
maybe I'd believe you.

208
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,640
But there must be something fishy

209
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,520
between you and An Ning.

210
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,800
Unless,

211
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,920
you arrest her

212
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,360
in front of everyone.

213
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,000
Huo.

214
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,320
This pledge of loyalty

215
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,200
isn't hard, is it?

216
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,040
The police confirm Longxing Group is
deeply involved in gang crime.

217
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,420
[Arrest Warrant]
The group's leader, An Ning, is hereby

218
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,800
