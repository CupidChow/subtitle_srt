that hold it back.

185
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,160
I won't tolerate it.

186
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,000
Any other questions?

187
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,880
If there are no questions,

188
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,400
I'll officially start at the group
on Monday.

189
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:07,980
♪Rules quietly
fall into a street without light♪

190
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:13,790
♪Falling like an extinguished spark♪

191
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:20,320
♪I break through
every preset blurry line♪

192
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,880
I thought you had left.

193
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,120
When you need me,

194
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,080
I'll be there.

195
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,200
When you can handle things alone,

196
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,880
I'll step back.

197
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,400
Do you remember

198
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,120
the question you asked me before?

199
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
If one day,

200
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,360
I find out you're not
who I think you are.

201
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,760
Will I still treat you this way?

202
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,640
Now I can give you the answer.

203
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,960
Who I'm willing to risk everything for

204
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,000
is the you right here.

205
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Not the past.

206
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,040
Just focus on what's ahead.

207
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:23,640

from endless lies♪

208

thorns of woven lies♪

shatter this dream tonight♪

218

and find the way♪
