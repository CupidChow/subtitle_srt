[Episode 2]

00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,680
If we remove the chip
from the flash drive,

10
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,120
we can crack the data inside.

11
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,760
But this kind of drive
has an anti-tamper system,

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,880
if we force the chip out,

13
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,360
all the data will erase itself.

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,040
Ye Hong is already dead.

15
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,320
The only one who might know the password

16
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,480
is probably his daughter, Ye Ying.

17
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,920
Inspector,

18
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,200
this month,

19
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,280
we've received three reports
about Song Pa's gang crimes.

20
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,760
And letters accusing him of murdering An Yuan,
ex-chairman of Longxing Group.

21
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,480
I'll handle this case personally.

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,800
Keep tracing that person's whereabouts.

23
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,480
You were drugged and confused back then.

24
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,240
The clues you gave were quite vague.

25
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,800
And that person is overseas.

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,560
It's hard to find the girl
who saved you.

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,400
Inspector.

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,760
It was me who called the police.

29
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,360
Inspector.

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,400
I called the police.

31
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,480
Is there a problem with that?

32
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,520
You...

33
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,480
Don't recognize me?

34
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,160
Xiao.

35
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,680
Uncle.

36
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,880
What brings you here?

37
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,880
Xiao.

38
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,120
Come on.

39
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,720
Have some tea.

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,880
Thanks, Uncle.

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,560
You're too kind.

42
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,280
You're the police inspector.

43
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,440
That's a position
everyone dreams of connecting with.

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,280
For me to serve you tea,

45
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,600
it's my honor.

46
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,720
Xiao.

47
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,960
These are the shares
your father left in the group.

48
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,200
From now on,

49
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,840
you'll keep them yourself.

50
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,240
To be honest with you,

51
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,320
the company right now

52
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:11,000
has attracted some unwanted attention.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,320
We run many businesses.

54
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,000
Dealing with all sorts of people
is unavoidable.

55
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,520
But someone

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,840
took advantage of that detail,

57
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,960
and reported the group.

58
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,320
Saying we're linked to some gangs.

59
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,480
Recently,

60
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,840
the authorities have been
cracking down hard on gang crimes.

61
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,440
This matter could turn big
or stay small.

62
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,040
Some groups

63
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,400
have already been fined into bankruptcy.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,840
Xiao.

65
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,960
You're the inspector here.

66
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,760
This issue

67
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,080
only you can resolve it.

68
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,000
Longxing Group

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,560
was also built from
your father's hard work.

70
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,720
Just do something.

71
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:41,720
You took over the company
from An Yuan back then.

72
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,920
And you treated
Huo family quite well.

73
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,760
Don't worry.

74
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,000
I won't let my own interests be harmed.

75
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,320
But to resolve this matter completely,

76
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,520
we have to find whoever reported it.

77
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,400
The group's transactions
are confidential.

78
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,640
Maybe the problem lies in this house.

79
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,520
How about this.

80
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,840
I'll stay here for a few days.

81
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,760
Let's see if we can find any clues.

82
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,600
Sure.

83
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,000
Xiao.

84
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,920
You're willing to help.

85
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,120
That really puts me at ease.

86
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,320
I heard you're Ti Cha's wife,

87
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,920
An Ning.

88
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,440
He's pretty close with Song Pa.

89
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,240
No matter who I really am,

90
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,160
I'll just play An Ning for now.

91
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,520
Right.

92
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,280
I lost my memory.

93
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,640
I don't remember anything from before.

94
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,200
Someone who doesn't even know
who she is,

95
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,960
yet reports that
someone here is trying to hurt you.

96
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,040
Before my dad died,

97
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,840
he gave me shares of Longxing Group.

98
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,400
The Song family wanted to harm me
to get the shares.

99
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,280
Since you lost your memory,

100
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,400
how do you know these things?

101
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,160
Let go of me.

102
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
I can prove it.

103
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,280
There are records on the tablet.

104
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,560
I just lost my memory.

105
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,400
It doesn't mean I'm stupid.

106
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,280
I can still read the records
on the tablet.

107
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,800
This is a photo of me and my dad.

108
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,000
He's not Ye Hong.

109
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,120
Since you've lost your memory,

110
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,760
maybe,

111
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,560
there's been a misunderstanding
between you and the Song family.

112
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,160
I can prove what I'm saying.

113
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,840
But you have to promise me,

114
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,000
you won't twist the law
for personal reasons.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,880
It's not your place
to question me.

116
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,360
Until your claims are verified,

117
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,720
I'll keep an eye on you myself.

118
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,080
I don't even know what went wrong

119
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,600
to make An Ning misunderstand me.

120
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,880
She actually called the police.

121
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,760
Luckily, the one who came was Xiao.

122
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,720
Otherwise, people might think
I'm a terrible mother-in-law.

123
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,640
An Ning.

124
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,560
You're hurt and still weak.

125
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,240
I asked the kitchen to make your
favorite dumplings.

126
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,240
No matter how much resentment you have,

127
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,600
just take it out on me.

128
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
Please don't blame anyone else at home.

129
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,760
An Ning.

130
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,640
You were the one
causing trouble for no reason.

131
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,520
Your mother-in-law was kind enough
not to hold it against you.

132
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,360
Well,

133
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,400
eat the dumplings now.

134
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,960
Then we'll forget about that false
police call.

135
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,600
That's quite a blessing.

136
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,320
Why are you still hesitating?

137
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,200
My mom told you to eat,

138
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,120
so just eat!

139
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,440
Don't be ungrateful.

140
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,120
That car crash didn't kill you.

141
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,760
Then I'll poison you instead.

142
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,760
Huo Xiao is on our side.

143
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:24,520
We'll have an inspector
to back us up.

144
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,200
You'll die as silently as
your father did.

145
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,600
Steward.

146
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,960
Looks like An Ning doesn't know
how to eat these dumplings.

147
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,120
Give her a hand.

148
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,760
Since it's a blessing,

149
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,000
I'll let you have it.

150
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,360
Madam.

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,960
You... you...

152
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,440
Such a clumsy trick.

153
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,440
Can't tell if you're bold,

154
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,400
or just foolish.

155
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,640
An Ning.

156
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,280
You're still recovering from
that accident.

157
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,960
You need more rest.

158
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,280
Have a cup of ginseng tea
to rebuild your strength.

159
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,280
I don't want it now.

160
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,120
Come on, drink it, it's good for you.

161
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,920
You're the well-known steward
of the Song family.

162
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,320
How dare An Ning force you
to eat dumplings?

163
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,000
She clearly doesn't respect you at all.

164
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,840
She's just a tool

165
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,600
for Master Song Pa
and Young Master Ti Cha.

166
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,640
That woman's not worth a dime.

167
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,000
Even if I kill her,

168
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,080
no one would even
bother about her.

169
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,840
Killing her would be
letting her off too easy.

170
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,360
As long as you
get something on her,

171
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,480
she'll be under your control
from then on.

172
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,760
This drug

173
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,240
is really strong.

174
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,040
Just wait until
she falls for your charm.

175
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,520
Then take a video.

176
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,200
From then on,

177
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,960
she'll do whatever you say.

178
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,480
I...

179
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,680
Dare to fool around?

180
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,920
Dare to sneak around!

181
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,920
Homewrecker!

182
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,520
How dare you cuckold me!

183
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,360
Ti Cha.

184
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,960
Why are you here?

185
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Then where should I be?

186
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,680
- No.
- Here?

187
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,640
Steward?

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,840
Fang Yao?

189
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,560
Why are you both in my room?

190
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,200
And...

191
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,840
In this state?

192
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,720
Y...Young Master, please let me explain.

193
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,080
You dared to lay hands on my woman!

194
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:24,480
I...

195
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,200
Young Master.

196
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,280
Young Master!

197
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,640
It's time for my medicine.

198
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,680
Yao.

199
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,120
It's in the cabinet behind you.

200
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,120
Help me get the medicine.

201
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,440
Mm.

202
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,520
Master, Madam.

203
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,640
It wasn't me.

204
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,000
Inspector Huo.

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,360
I swear it really wasn't me.

206
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,840
I know you couldn't have done
this alone.

207
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,400
Just tell me who's working with you.

208
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,040
I can ask Young Master Ti Cha
to spare you.

209
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,040
Inspector Huo

210
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,200
will stand up for you too.

211
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:16,840
An Ning.

212
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,280
We have shown you endless patience.

213
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,800
Why would you sink to something
so despicable?

214
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,120
You even tried to
harm your closest friend!

215
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,480
The Song family won't
tolerate a ruthless heart.

216
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,240
If you act up again,

217
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,360
don't blame us for being unforgiving!

218
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,000
Dad.

219
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,440
Hurry and get Inspector Huo over here.

220
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,600
Send her straight to jail.

221
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,480
Otherwise,
she'll drag Song family down with her.

222
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
Exactly.

223
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,560
Call our lawyer to let her
sign the share transfer agreement.

224
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,320
She must pay for what she's done.

225
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,440
Have you all finished?

226
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,000
Inspector Huo.

227
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,040
Isn't it time the steward
had his turn to speak?

228
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,280
It was Fang Yao.

229
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,920
Fang Yao tried to drug An Ning.

230
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,720
And frame her for being unfaithful.

231
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,600
Luckily, karma stepped in.

232
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,960
She ended up facing her own punishment.

233
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,920
I heard Song Pa intends to set you up

234
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,680
with a wealthy businessman's widow.

235
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,520
If your scandal gets out,

236
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,960
that rich lady
may not fancy you anymore.

237
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,360
You...

238
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,440
Shut up.

239
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,760
Making me shut up is possible.

240
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,520
You need to show some sincerity.

241
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,640
You're slandering me!

242
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,000
Ti Cha.

243
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,680
Believe me.

244
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,800
I really didn't do it.

245
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,840
It's...it's An Ning.

246
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,120
An Ning must have bribed the steward
to frame me.

247
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,320
To catch a thief, you need evidence.

248
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,600
If it was you who did it,

249
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,680
we'll know after a body search.

250
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,240
Right?

251
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,080
Inspector Huo.

252
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,040
Don't come over.

253
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:46,760
You...

254
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,040
You've got no proof.

255
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,280
Inspector Huo.

256
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,160
I told you someone here
wants to harm me.

257
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,240
This is the evidence.

258
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Get up.

259
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:25,920
An Ning.

260
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,000
It's all a misunderstanding.

261
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,200
We've been best friends for years.

262
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,160
Best friends?

263
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,400
Would a best friend seduce her husband?

264
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,920
Or side with outsiders to bully her?

265
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,680
Or scheme to ruin her forever?

266
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
No way.

267
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,920
How could you...

268
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,040
How?

269
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,280
How come I'm not as stupid as before?

270
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,800
Right?

271
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,760
If it weren't for our old friendship,

272
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,520
you wouldn't have just been kicked out
of the Song family.

273
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,600
If you're smart,

274
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,640
then get out of here.

275
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,200
If I see you again,

276
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,000
you won't be so lucky next time.

277
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,120
Useless fool!

278
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,600
You can't even handle
such a simple matter.

279
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,120
Let that skank An Ning come back alive.

280
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,880
And causing so much trouble.

281
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,240
Not even a car crash could take her out.

282
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,840
What else can I do?

283
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,560
Besides,

284
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,200
didn't you also...

285
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,920
Just shut up!

286
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,640
Right now.

287
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,520
Immediately.

288
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,720
Teach An Ning a lesson!

289
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,160
Your daughter-in-law suffered
severe head trauma,

290
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,720
which caused retrograde amnesia.

291
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,280
But familiar people and places

292
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,680
