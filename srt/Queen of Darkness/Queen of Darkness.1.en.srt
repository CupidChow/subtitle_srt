187
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,680
Are you okay, Mom?

188
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,360
Just drop dead!

189
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,160
Where did this crazy woman come from?

190
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,960
If you lose control again,

191
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,000
I won't mind breaking your other arm.

192
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,600
Mom.

193
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,240
Are you okay, Mom?

194
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,200
You mean woman.

195
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,360
You should take a look
at yourself first.

196
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,320
Who do you think
you are?

197
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,840
Daring to hit my mom.

198
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,240
Well, I finally get it now.

199
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,160
A spiteful mother-in-law

200
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,480
and her clingy son.

201
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,080
I must've been blind to
fall for your messed-up family.

202
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,880
An Ning.

203
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,200
I used to treat you like a punching bag.

204
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,920
You don't even dare to make a sound.

205
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,800
So what?

206
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,520
Did that car crash shake up
your whole personality?

207
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,480
Now,

208
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,600
get on your knees
and kowtow three times to me!

209
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,400
I'll

210
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,960
let you keep serving
the Song family!

211
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,680
You perfectly exemplify

212
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,800
what it means to be a brute.

213
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,240
All you do is insult women

214
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,640
to patch up your sad little pride.

215
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,880
Try being a decent person in this life.

216
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,240
In the next one,

217
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,560
being a fly

218
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,960
is the upper limit of
your reincarnation!

219
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,560
You... What are you doing?

220
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,520
Son! Son!

221
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,600
You...

222
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,200
Son!

223
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,320
- You're not An Ning
- It hurts!

224
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,720
What do you mean?

225
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,280
Then who am I?

226
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,560
Your words and actions

227
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,160
don't match her at all.

228
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,280
So that question

229
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,720
should be mine to ask you.

230
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,880
Mr. Song,

231
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,000
after consulting with specialists,

232
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,080
we believe your daughter-in-law suffered
severe head trauma,

233
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,560
which caused retrograde amnesia.

234
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,560
It might lead to
major personality changes.

235
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,120
How long will it take for me to regain
my memory?

236
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,920
Hard to say.

237
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,320
But familiar people and places

238
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,720
could help trigger your memory.

239
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,720
However,

240
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,200
do either of your arms...

241
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,400
No need.

242
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,640
I don't trust any of you.

243
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,280
Until my memory comes back,

244
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,440
I'll request 24-hour police protection.

245
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,440
You've come just in time.

246
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Since coming back with you,

247
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,800
I realized all the wrongs
you've done to me before.

248
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,960
The police are on their way.

249
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,320
Please explain yourselves clearly.
