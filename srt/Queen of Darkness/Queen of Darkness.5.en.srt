[Episode 5]

9
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,160
An Ning.

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,760
A dock of Longxing Group was

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,080
taken over by the Qingyun Gang.

12
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,080
You're one of the shareholders too.

13
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,840
So you'll represent the group fully.

14
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,600
Go talk to Qingyun Gang,

15
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,680
and get the dock back.

16
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,240
Miss.

17
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,440
Miss.

18
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,760
You're finally back.

19
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,080
Miss? What are you talking about?

20
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,480
You've got the wrong person.

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,800
Miss, please don't joke like that.

22
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,920
We have been looking for you
for days.

23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,760
Ever since the Boss passed away,

24
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
guys left

25
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,560
one by one.

26
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,960
The gang is in chaos now.

27
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,120
Only you can take charge.

28
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,600
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

29
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,640
I'm a representative of Longxing Group.

30
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,000
My name is An Ning.

31
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,000
An Ning?

32
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,120
Longxing Group?

33
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,040
An Ning...

34
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,480
Tell me, in this world,

35
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,760
can two people really look
that much alike?

36
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,680
Exactly the same.

37
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,960
No wonder Song Pa asked me to
handle the negotiation.

38
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,720
He must've noticed this beforehand.

39
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,760
So he's doubting my identity.

40
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,000
Just two similar faces.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,120
No big deal.

42
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,200
Besides,

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,360
what can one photo prove?

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,800
Bring me the Young Lady's tablet.

45
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,760
Yes.

46
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,640
Jiang Meng,

47
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,000
the moment she blows her cover,

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
show no mercy.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,080
Shoot to kill right away.

50
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,360
Mom.

51
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,880
But suppose she

52
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,720
really is Ye Ying.

53
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,080
Even if she's dead,

54
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,720
what if An Ning somehow comes back?

55
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,000
As long as we insist
the dead one is An Ning,

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,040
everything else becomes a lie.

57
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,080
But won't the Qingyun Gang

58
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,320
want revenge?

59
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,320
She died on their turf.

60
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,080
None of our business.

61
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,360
They dared to take over our territory.

62
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,160
They're definitely swallowing this loss.

63
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,760
Mom, you always think ahead.

64
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,680
Once that sneaky woman is gone,

65
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,040
you'll save so much trouble.

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,880
Don't worry.

67
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,920
If you do a big favor this time,

68
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,800
you'll get a share of
her holdings for sure.

69
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,920
Thank you, Mom.

70
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,280
Inspector.

71
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,680
You're gonna
save that An Ning

72
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,720
or Ye Ying, are you?

73
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,080
This is a Song family matter.

74
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,000
I think, professionally and personally,

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,880
you shouldn't get involved in it.

76
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,320
It's exactly because
her identity isn't confirmed

77
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,640
that we need to keep observing her.

78
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,960
If she really
turns out to be our target,

79
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,560
then one mistake could ruin everything.

80
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,480
This tablet

81
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,240
only registers
the Young Lady's fingerprint.

82
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,120
She's the only one who can open it.

83
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,480
Want me to believe your identity?

84
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,320
Prove it.

85
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,040
No way.

86
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,480
I couldn't have mistaken it.

87
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,560
Just as I thought.

88
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,320
Verify identity through fingerprint.

89
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,200
However,

90
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,640
I've already replaced all the clues

91
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,800
you left in Qingyun Gang.

92
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,280
The setup has been done.

93
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,360
Ye Ying.

94
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,480
Now, let's see how you make your move.

95
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,440
Qingyun Gang's being so tricky.

96
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,720
Are you trying to stall for time?

97
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,920
And refuse to give the dock back?

98
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,040
Since you're not the Young Lady,

99
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
then I won't

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,120
bother with feelings anymore.

101
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,560
You want the dock?

102
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,240
Did you ask my gun first?

103
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,080
We haven't even started talking yet,

104
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,120
and you jump to violence?

105
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,880
Is this how Qingyun Gang works?

106
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,280
No rules at all?

107
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,840
This dock has always belonged to
the Qingyun Gang.

108
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,040
We only lent it to you
before for some business.

109
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,280
You could call that cooperation.

110
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,960
But your money-making methods
got a little too wild.

111
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,320
You crossed the line.

112
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,080
We don't wanna get dragged down
for no reason.

113
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,600
That's why we ended the deal.

114
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,520
Yeah.

115
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,560
You really dare to
earn any kind of money.

116
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,960
Even darker than us.

117
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,560
A beauty like you.

118
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,560
Why not come work at our club

119
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,600
as the top girl?

120
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
We'll make sure you earn

121
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,440
lots, and safe.

122
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,480
Exactly.

123
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,920
And I'll bring all the guys

124
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,960
to patronize you every day.

125
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,880
Make sure you live

126
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,280
better than anyone else.

127
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,480
Go on, hit me.

128
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,160
Right here.

129
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,600
The more you hit me,

130
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,800
the more I like it.

131
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,240
Don't just have fun yourself,

132
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,840
let us have some fun too.

133
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,800
Alright.

134
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,600
Guys.

135
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,200
Get her!

136
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,640

Bullying a lady, huh?

142
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,440
The Qingyun Gang

143
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
sure is "growing" lately.

144
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,280

145
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,600
You killed our Boss,

00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,240
yet you still dare
show up in front of us.

Huo Xiao.

148
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,560
Don't get too full of yourself.

149
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,040
At worst,

150
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,480
we'll go down together.

151
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,200
I know you want to avenge Ye Hong,

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,760
but dragging all these guys
to their deaths.

153
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,480
Do you have
that kind of nerve?

154
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,320
Let's go.

155
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,120
We haven't finished talking.

156
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,080
I can't leave now.

157
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,400
Huo Xiao.

158
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,840

What on earth are you trying to do?

165

You've got yourself
tangled in too much trouble.

166
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,880
I just don't want you to die this early.

167
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,440
It's all traps set by you anyway.

168
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,640
So why pretend to care now?

169
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,200
Song Pa is Song Pa.

170
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,960
And I am me.

171
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,480
Don't lump us together.

172
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,520
It's all about my shares.

173
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,320
How are you any different?

174
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,360
If you don't want me
to shoot you in the head,

175
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,920
then stay right where you are.

176
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,880
Done watching the show, huh?

177
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,360
So, what's the plan now?

178
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,120
We can't let that scheming girl

179
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,160
come back to this house again.

180
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,680
How could there be a sniper?

181
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,280
Judging from the sniper's position,

182
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,880
it doesn't seem to be the Qingyun Gang.

183
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,480
Looks like unless we settle
this Qingyun Gang mess,

184
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,200
it'll be hard for us
to get back smoothly.

185
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,080
We?

186
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,240
Of course.

187
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,280
Right now...

188
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,520
we're partners through thick and thin.

189
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,560
You ran away,

190
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,600
and yet you dare come back?

191
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,040
Seems like you two really don't take
the Qingyun Gang seriously.

192
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,000
No need to say that out loud.

193
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,040
We're not done talking yet.

194
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,280
So we can't leave now.

195
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,680
With Inspector Huo backing you up,

196
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,120
the Qingyun Gang will

197
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,560
swallow that grudge.

198
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,480
Go ahead.

199
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
How do you want to settle this?

200
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,240
This is between us.

201
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,680
He's got nothing to do with this.

202
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,320
As for who gets the dock,

203
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,240
we'll go by gang rules.

204
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,720
Bet on dice rolls.

205
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,040
Loser dies.

206
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,400
Winner takes all.

207
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,640
It seems you don't just want to
gamble on luck.

208
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,240
You also want to gamble with your life?

209
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,280
So what?

210
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,440
You scared?

211
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,920
I think you're being naive.

212
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,080
Why would I risk my turf against you?

213
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,880
What if I put up 20% share of

214
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,600
Longxing Group?

215
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,440
Deal.

216
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,520
Bring the dice.

217
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,400
Get the dice!

218
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,360
You go first.

219
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,400
Looks like luck's not on your side.

220
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,080
Do you mind

221
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,600
if I act as the witness?

222
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,160
Of course not.

223
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,800
