00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,280
It's stuck.

187
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,280
The fire's spreading fast.

188
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,640
All the doors are blocked.

189
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,480
How much longer?

190
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,640
Almost done.

191
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,760
What about you?

192
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,560
I can handle it.

193
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,400
If only one of us makes it out alive,

194
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,080
I hope it's you.

Dad, don't worry.

199
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,760
They must've burned to death.

200
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,720
Got it.

201
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,880
I heard on the news about
a man and a woman found dead.

202
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,400
That's when I dared to show myself.

203
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,440
What's taking so long?

204
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,280
Hurry and drive.

205
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,480
Didn't expect it, did you?

206
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,840
We're still alive.

207
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,000
Inspector, are you alright?

208
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,920
Check the surveillance footage.

209
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,880
Compile the clips of him meeting

210
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,080
with the customs official into evidence.

211
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,080
Got it.

212
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,960
Wait.

213
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,440
Since he wants us dead,

214
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,080
then we'll pretend to die for him.

215
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,240
Fake our death and lure him out.

216
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,520
Daming.

217
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,040
Get in touch with the media right now.

218
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,400
And put out a news story.

219
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,680
Yes.

220
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,840
No way.

221
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,160
You dare treat me like this, you brat?

222
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,040
All these years,
you've been pulling these little tricks

223
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,200
and doing those evil deeds
behind the scenes.

224
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,640
Today I'll settle the score
with you properly.

225
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,480
Chairman An asked me to look into you.

226
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,000
And I had no idea till I looked into it.

227
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,160
Cooking the books.

228
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,520
Colluding with customs.

229
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,960
Smuggling and money laundering.

230
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,880
Instigating staff bullying.

231
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,720
Leaking the group's trade secrets.

232
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,240
All those dirty tricks of yours

233
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,360
just keep coming one after another.

234
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,880
Just a small token.

235
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,440
Then I'll gladly accept it.

236
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,600
You're quite straightforward.

237
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,360
Make sure that
shipment of ours stays safe.

238
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,440
Don't worry.

239
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,560
I admit it.

240
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,800
All of that was done by me.

241
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,320
I just lost my head for a moment.

242
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,600
Hand the footage to the media.

243
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,160
And issue a public statement.

244
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,840
Saying this was entirely a personal act.

245
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,920
It has nothing to do with the group.

246
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,840
Chairman An.

247
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,320
Please, just give me one more chance.

248
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,600
Please, one last chance.

249
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,040
Someone like you
doesn't deserve forgiveness.

250
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,960
From now on,

251
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,240
you're relieved of
all duties in the group.

252
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,920
You'll handle the fines yourself.

253
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,560
All losses to the group fall on you.

254
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,360
You want to ruin me.

255
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,440
Then I won't let you walk away safe!

256
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,560
