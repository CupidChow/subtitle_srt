186
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,680
All these years,

187
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,160
I've been investigating in secret.

188
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,400
I've gathered a lot of
proof of Song Pa's gang crime

189
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
and found out
he colluded with Jiang Meng.

190
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,800
But I really didn't expect

191
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,560
it was Song Pa's wife

192
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,080
who bribed Jiang Meng

193
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,320
to kill my parents.

194
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,120
Song Pa is cunning.

195
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,200
A master of disguise.

196
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,920
Back then,
after earning my father's trust,

197
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,560
he took over Longxing Group.

198
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,840
I just never thought
he was so greedy

199
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,320
that he'd even
kill my father

200
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,640
and seize
the remaining shares.

201
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,760
That night, I went out.

202
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,080
It was to meet a lawyer about
the equity transfer

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,360
I didn't expect to
get into a car accident.

204
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,160
Taking down Song Pa

205
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,480
isn't an easy thing to do.

206
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,720
But the misunderstanding
is already set in stone.

207
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,520
Ye Ying still thinks

208
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,400
I killed her father.

209
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,440
If it's just a misunderstanding,

210
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,480
then it can be cleared up.

211
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,960
That day I crashed the welcome party
Leader Ye arranged for you,

212
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,640
it was indeed
for the USB drive.

213
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,000
But I didn't kill him.

214
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,040
Song Pa killed my father

215
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,840
and your entire family.

216
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,400
All because they had proof
of Song Pa's gang crimes.

217
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,720
That's why
they were both killed.

218
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,240
Your wound.

219
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,280
It must hurt a lot, right?

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,160
If it weren't for that bullet,

221
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,360
the misunderstanding
between us

222
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,640
might never have been
cleared up.

223
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,760
I'll make sure
he pays for what he did.

224
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,760
He already knows who I am.

225
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,800
Normal methods
won't work on him.

226
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,720
He must be on guard.

227
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,960
You're an Inspector.

228
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,640
There are things
you can't get involved in.

229
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,800
I can handle this alone.

230
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,880
What's your plan?

231
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,520
According to our rules,

232
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,400
"Three strikes, six wounds".

233
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,640
He still owes quite a few.

234
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,920
I...

235
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,280
I really don't know anything.

236
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,520
I'll say it.
I'll say.

237
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,960
My man works at customs.

238
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
The money
Song Pa paid to bribe him

239
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,360
is kept in the bedroom safe.

240
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,040
The account books
were given to the shareholders.

241
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,440
I'll confess.

242
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,680
In the safe,

243
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,360
there are the account books
of the Song family's smuggling.

244
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,720
Is it...

245
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,880
a bit outdated, huh?

246
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,720
Did you prepare all this?

247
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,040
Why?

248
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,880
We got the account books.

249
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,480
And traced his overseas account.

250
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,960
Even raided
the entire supply chain

251
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,240
of Song Pa's smuggling business.

252
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,440
Isn't it a bit too early

253
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,200
to celebrate now?

254
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,640
Who said
I'm celebrating that?

255
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,240
Right now,

256
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,800
it's our romance chapter.

257
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,760
I've been waiting for
this moment

258
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,320
for three years.

259
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,480
That time,

260
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,040
it was me
who pulled you into that door

261
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,480
at the nightclub.

262
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,280
Back then, I almost got exposed
during my undercover mission.

263
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,560
Luckily, you saved me.

264
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,960
I actually remembered that
long ago.

265
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,720
I just wanted to wait for you
to admit that.

266
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,560
But you didn't handle it well.

267
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,360
I never agreed to date you.

268
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,320
I thought

269
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,960
we were already dating,

270
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:51,840
weren't we?

271
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,040
Are you worried

272
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,800
that in many people's eyes,

273
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,760
you're still An Ning?

274
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,240
She can't show up for now.

275
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,760
Once the case is closed,

276
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,520
I'll help clear your identity
right away.

277
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,720
Even if I'm still An Ning,
so what?

278
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,000
I've already divorced Ti Cha

279
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,880
on behalf of An Ning.

280
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,760
But

281
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,240
I've never been
in a relationship.

282
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,920
I don't know
what being in love feels like.
