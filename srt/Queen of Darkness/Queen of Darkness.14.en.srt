Don't do that, keep it decent.

185
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,080
Hit him!

186
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,320
That's what you get for stepping in.

187
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,320
Aren't you guys going to stop them?

188
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,040
There's no stopping him.

189
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,720
He's the former owner of this hotel.

190
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,320
Also a well-known local ruffian.

191
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,080
Now the hotel's been taken over
by Vincent.

192
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,120
He just can't accept that.

193
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,840
So he comes here every day,
causing scenes and driving guests away.

194
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,080
Like a stubborn shadow
that won't go away.

195
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,160
And we can't get rid of him
no matter what.

196
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:21,920
Hit him!

197
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,120
Hit!

198
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,600
I only invest in people.

199
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,120
Show me you've got
what it takes to impress me.

200
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,000
This hotel is one I acquired.

201
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,240
You probably understand
the current situation.

202
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,440
How you solve this nuisance

203
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,720
is my test for you.

204
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,560
Remember to keep it
on speaker the whole time.

205
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,960
You can head back first.

206
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,720
I'll handle this.

207
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,880
So you're the former owner
of this hotel?

208
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,600
Girl,

209
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,320
you came to see me for something?

210
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,320
Smells good.

211
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,800
As long as you please me a little,

212
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,080
the price is negotiable.

213
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,320
You dare hit me?

214
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,880
Watch your mouth.

215
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
I'm here to talk about
the hotel business.

216
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,840
Not to deal with
your shameless behavior.

217
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,600
Listen,

218
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,120
I'm staying at this hotel
for the New Year.

219
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,040
And as for you,

220
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,680
don't even think about

221
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,040
leaving this room easily today!

222
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,520
So there's no room for discussion?

223
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
If you spend the night with me,

224
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,440
we can negotiate.

225
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,840
A woman like you with such charm

226
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,640
is the most alluring kind.

227
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,760
Just help me relax,

228
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,320
and maybe I'll let you go.

229
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,000
Do you really think that's possible?

230
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,160
Just one look from you
makes me feel filthy.

231
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,520
You shameless thing!

232
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,680
You've got quite a sharp tongue, huh.

233
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,800
Seems I'll have to strip you naked,

234
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,520
string you up
and make you suffer.

235
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,080
Make you get on your knees
and beg like a dog.

236
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,360
Let's see if Vincent
dares to show up then!

237
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,560
Oops, that shot went off.

238
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,240
What about the next one?

239
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,120
Will you be lucky again?

240
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,320
Guess you've got some guts.

241
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,560
Just you wait, come on!

242
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,160
I don't want to hear another word
from you.

243
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,200
Keep your mouth shut.

244
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,800
If that gun slips out,

245
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,440
you're done for.

246
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,440
Heard you made some money
selling that hotel.

247
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,400
And now
you're using this hooligan method

248
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,600
to make Vincent sell it back to you
at a low price.

249
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,680
Bought low, sold high,
played both sides.

250
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,840
You really have a dark heart.

251
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,560
I was wrong, please don't...

252
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,840
Please don't.

253
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,680
You've got two options now.

254
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,000
Either

255
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,840
I end you right here,

256
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,360
and they carry you out flat.

257
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,200
Or

258
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,440
I give you
one percent of the hotel shares.

259
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,200
If you manage it well,

260
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,280
I can

261
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,600
offer you extra shares
as a bonus every year.

262
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,920
I...I want the shares.

263
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,920
But your words don't mean much
without proof.

264
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,040
I've never even met him.

265
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,240
How do I know you're not tricking me?

266
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,640
Looks like I finally got my chance.

267
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,720
I'll beat you to a pulp!

268
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,760
Where's that arrogance
from a minute ago?

269
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
We finally meet.

270
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,760
