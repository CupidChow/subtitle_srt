189
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,040
You heartless woman.

190
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
You're literally a demon
crawled out of hell!

191
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,760
I'll make your ancestors

193

You...

194

You're just jealous that

195

Yao can carry on
the Song family line.

196
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,200
That's why you came up with
such a vile scheme.

You...

198
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,080
You're a vicious woman
worse than beasts!

199

You destroyed
the Song family's unborn child.

200
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,720
Once you've taken the family punishment,

201
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,360
you'll be handed over to the police!

202

I'll beat you to death!

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,760
About the baby,

214
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,880
why not ask the prenatal doctor first.

215
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,840
Come in.

216
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,920
People's hearts can be bought,

217
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,840
but it depends

218
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,720
[Pay to the order of Fang Yao, $5,000]
on who pays more.

00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,640
Go ahead, speak.

221
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,160
The fetus had already shown
signs of stalling.

222
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,560
Chromosomes and progesterone
all showed clear abnormalities.

223
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,920
There was no way to keep the baby.

224
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,560
She got abortion pills from me.

225
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,840
And paid me hush money.

226
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,640
Yao.

227
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,240
You can go out now.

228

Dad.

229
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,440
Now the truth is finally out.

230
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,520
I want to see
how you'll make this right.

231

Ti… Ti Cha.

I… I…

233
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,560
I only did it
because I love you so much.

234
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,040
I lost my head for a moment and then…

235
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,920
I really had no other choice.

236
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,040
I can still have another baby.

237
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,440
This one is gone.

238
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,080
But I can still have another child.

239

Yao. Dad's here.

240
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:51,960

Yao.

242
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,640
What are you all doing?

243
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,560
[Fang Tao, Fang Yao's Father]
Song Pa, I've been with the group

244
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,840
for more than twenty years.

245
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,640
Always working hard
by your side until now.

246
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,480
Even if I've no merit,
I've put in the effort.

247
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,680
Have you forgotten this?

248
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,280
That year when it was raining,

249
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,200
there was a car crash,

250
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,160
and I was the one who shielded you.

251
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,800
I carried you on my back alone

252
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,080
and walked over ten kilometers
to get you to the hospital.

253
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,120
Now my daughter's been through
all this pain.

254
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,760
Not only do you not compensate her,

255
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,320
but you blame her.

256
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,840
How can you do this to me?

257
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,080
So you're using your daughter

258
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,920
as a bargaining chip for compensation?

259
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,640
Even if my daughter made mistakes,

260
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,400
she's still carrying Ti Cha's child.

261
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,520
Doesn't Ti Cha have any responsibility?

this is between me and the Song family.

What does it have to do with you?

266
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,360
If you keep stirring things up,

267
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,720
I'll shut you up myself!

268

Even if you want compensation,

269
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,280
you shouldn't ask Ti Cha for it.

270
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,120
Because,
