Claiming it was to blend into
the company culture.

A large enterprise like Longxing Group

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,520

Otherwise,

just false accounting reports.

get them so easily.

involves gang crime?

133
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,200
Then the company must
conduct an internal audit first.

And Song Pa won't have a reason
to stop me.

135

means going against Song Pa.

the chief financial officer.

184
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,920
The safe holding the accounts

185
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
was secured with iris scanning.

186
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,680
Only your and your father's
irises were registered.

187
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,480
A small finance manager like me

188
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,600
doesn't have that kind of access.

189
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,400
[Signatory: An Ning]

190
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,960
He suspects my identity.

191
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,240
So he tried using the iris scan
to confirm my identity.

192
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,600
What's wrong, Chairman An?

193
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,960
Is there something off?

194
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
Nothing.

195
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,400
Let's go open it.

196
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,480
There are quite a lot of accounts
over the years.

197
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,200
We

198
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,800
should ask the security team
to help.

199
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,440
Your father chose
iris scanning back then

200
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,640
because it's far more

201
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,760
accurate than fingerprints.

202
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,920
And it's almost impossible to replicate.

203
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,440
If anyone attempts to
steal the company's accounts,

204
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,600
the system will trigger
an alarm instantly.

205
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,960
The accounts are highly confidential.

206
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,920
So caution is a must.

207
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,720
Everyone got that?

208
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,400
If anyone tries to cover things up

209
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,160
or steal company secrets,

210
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,760
according to group rules,
they'll be fired on the spot.

211
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,240
And the company bears no responsibility.

212
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,680
Is that clear?

213
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,480
Yes.

214
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,080
Chairman An.

215
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,000
Please.

216
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,360
Please scan.

217
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,880
Scanning.

218
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,160
Verification passed.

219
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,600
Unlocked.

220
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,240
Mr. Fang.

221
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,560
Now you don't need to worry

222
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,560
about anyone covering things up, huh?

223
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,040
Yeah.

224
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,880
Then I'll organize these files
and hand them over to you.

225
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,240
Please, go ahead.

226
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,360
But why could I pass the iris scan?

227
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,680
All access for iris verification
has been unlocked.

228
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,680
The audit results are in.

229
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,080
It's a hidden warehouse
owned by Longxing Group.

230
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,360
Longxing Group's shady goods

231
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,440
are probably all inside.

232
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,600
Get a team ready right away.

233
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,400
Start the search immediately.

234
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,440
Yes.

235
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,280
Remember,

236
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,960
we're running out of time.

237
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,280
They actually dared to hide cameras
to spy on you.

238
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,600
How about

239
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,120
I'll have someone
hack into their surveillance system.

240
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,880
And use pre-recorded footage
to fool them.

241
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,400
With Song Pa's sharp mind,

242
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,800
this trick won't fool him for long.

243
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,000
But we can delay the footage
by ten minutes.

244
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,640
That should be enough to pass it off.

245
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,560
Ten minutes?

246
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,600
Once the move starts,

247
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,440
ten minutes should let us outrun them.

248
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,120
Longxing Group's shady goods

249
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,200
are probably all inside.

250
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
Get a team ready right away.

251
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,040
Start the search immediately.

252
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,640
Jiang Meng.

253
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,120
Huo Xiao has already taken a team
to the hidden warehouse.

254
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,000
There's still
a large cache of weapons inside.

255
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,120
Leave it to me.

256
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,040
Alright.

257
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,520
Move all this stuff out, hurry.

258
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,320
- Yes.
