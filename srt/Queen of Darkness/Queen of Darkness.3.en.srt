from now on.

187
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,760
I did save you once.

188
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,680
A glass of wine in return.

189
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,240
That's not too much, right?

190
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,000
But I remember Inspector Huo said
it was his own fault.

191
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,840
Besides, we're not at the point

192
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,720
where we can toast together,
are we?

193
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,120
If I want,

194
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,240
we can be any kind of relationship.

195
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,960
He seems to be
deliberately getting closer to me,

196
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,720
trying to dig out something from me.

197
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,880
What are you talking about?

198
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,040
Come on, dinner's ready.

199
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,960
Let's go eat.

200
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,280
Inspector Huo.

201
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,080
Join us for dinner.

202
00:13:59,080 --> 00:13:59,800
Sure.

203
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,480
Come on.

204
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,880
Let's all

205
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,640
have a toast.

206
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,760
Don't get too proud just yet.

207
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,720
Soon you'll be burned half-paralyzed.

208
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,800
If not dead, then disabled.

209
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,600
Dad.

210
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,320
What kind of drink is this?

211
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,440
It's so strong.

212
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,960
I had it shipped from France.

213
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:25,560
It's a bit strong.

214
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,400
Yeah, it's kinda strong.

215
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,080
But it's good stuff.

216
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,720
Take it easy though.

217
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,040
Then...I...

218
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,760
I'll have some more.

219
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,680
You're really playful.

220
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,080
Dad, don't drink too much.

221
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,400
Alright, let's eat first.
