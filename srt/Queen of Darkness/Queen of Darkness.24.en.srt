[Episode 24]

00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You sneaky woman.

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,520
How dare you hurt me!

11
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,520
Call an ambulance now!

12
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:02,960
Otherwise,

13
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,800
I'll make you pay dearly!

14
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,800
That An Ning who swallowed her pride
is long gone.

15
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,160
You're not Ye Ying.

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,680
Stop imitating her.

17
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,760
You know what?

18
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,000
You're nothing
but a complete copy.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,640
What's wrong?

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,920
Think a tiny knife is enough
to scare me?

21
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,840
You'll never

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,560
never become Ye Ying!

23
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,000
You're right,
I'm not her.

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,480
But Ye Ying
gave me a chance to survive.

25
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,000
She helped me break free
and start over.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,400
The Song family
pushed me to the edge.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,760
You cheated and abused me.

28
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,440
Mom is cruel and petty.

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,680

34
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,000
really kill me, right?

35

Letting you die

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,400
would be too easy.

pay you?

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,880

so many shady things.

There'll always be traces
left behind.

How could he help you
with the case?

81
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,200
I was being merciful
not to kill you right away.

82
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,040
You better worry about

83
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,760

84
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,560

Don't rush.

87

Soon,

00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,840
Okay.

93
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,800
Let him come down.

94
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,240

95
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,120
Dad, dad.

96
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,960
I don't want to live anymore.

97
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,720
I'm not a man anymore!

98
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,680
Dad, dad.

99
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,560
Alright,
tell me who did this to you.

100
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,440
It was An Ning.

101
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,920
An Ning did this!

102
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,200
She's back.

103
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,280

It's you.

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,640
You must've teamed up with
An Ning.

108
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,000
And set Ti Cha up, right?

109
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,320
Didn't expect
karma to come this fast.

110
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,440
Since you've done
so many evil things,

111
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,120
someone will help me
make your family end with no heirs.

112
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,160
So what if I've done evil?

113
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,080
Huo Xiao's father never knew
what was good for him

114
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,440
and got in the way of
my money.

115
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,320
Ye Hong refused the merger

116
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,360
and even
threatened me with

117
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,800
Longxing Group's
gang crime business.

118
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,920
The An family
was even stupider.

119
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,600
Clinging to those group shares.

120
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,640
Thinking they could take the company
back from me.

121
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,560
But in the end?

122
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,040
All those who opposed me

123
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,760
ended up with

124
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,240
no proper burial.

125
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,640
Huo Xiao has transferred
all his shares to An Ning.

126
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,280
Even if we all die,

127
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,680
you'll never
get Longxing Group.

128
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,680
Longxing Group?

129
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,560
That's just a cover.

130
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,880
The global illegal business group
I control

131
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,200
is the real big business.

132
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,040
I've bribed all systems,

133
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,200
including the police force.

134
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,800
With those systems
clearing my path,

135
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,320
my way to profit

136
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,480
is completely unobstructed.

137
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,600
Just for gain,

138
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,240
you've killed
so many innocent lives.

139
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,680
You're nothing but
a heartless monster!

140
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,240
Being a monster

141
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,400
is still better than

142
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,680
being weak.

143
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,960
I've run out of patience.

144
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,800
You

145
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,480
should take your final walk.

146
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,440
Go find your so-called justice
in the afterlife.

147
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,320
I'll remember your face clearly.

148
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,720
Even as a ghost,
I won't let you go.

149
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,520
Good.

150
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,040
Let's see

151
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,840
how exactly
you won't let me go.

152
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Kill her.

153
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,200
You...

154
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,560

155
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,320
I thought you were already...

156
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,520
You'll never know

157
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,560
who the real winner is

158
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,920
until the end.

159
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,280
All the crimes
you just confessed to

160
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,880
have been livestreamed
across the internet.

161
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,400
Turn around.

162
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,360
I heard them report to Song Pa

163
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
that they caught you.

164
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,440
Okay.

165
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,400
Don't let anyone know
I left the station yet.

166
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,240
We can't alert them too soon.

167
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,320
Got it.

168
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,160
[An Ning]

169
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,320
Song Pa sent Ti Cha a message,

170
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,240
saying he caught Ye Ying

171
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,760
and is on his way
back to the Song mansion.

172
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,360
Ye Ying.

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,720
Huo Xiao?

174
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,920
Why are you here?

175
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,440
- Are you okay?
- Are you alright?

176
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,680
What do we do now?

177
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,360
All the evidence is gone.

178
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,120
Only Song Pa's confession

179
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,920
can bring him to justice.

180
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,600
I've already

181
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,840
set up cameras in advance.

182
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,080
I know
what you're trying to do.

183
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,880
Leave it to me.

184
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,440
Police?

185
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,720
How did it end up like this?

186
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,880
An Ning!

187
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
Take him down!

188
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
You okay?

189
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,680
Looks like today

190
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,440
we might not
make it out alive.

191
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,920
Scared?

192
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,120
No.

193
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,320
I'll never lose you again.

194
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,440
Out of bullets, huh?

195
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,600
At death's door

196
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,040
and still being lovey-dovey?

197
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,800
Don't move!

198
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,600
Put down your weapon!

199
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,120
An Ning has submitted
evidence of your crimes.

200
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,680
The chief has signed
the arrest warrant.

201
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:10,440
Resisting will only lead to death!

202
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,280
Don't move!

203
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,480
If anyone moves,
I'll shoot them.

204
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,440
You hired killers to

205
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,720
murder my father Ye Hong.

206
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,000
I've waited too long

207
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,320
to settle this blood debt.

208
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,160
Today is the day you pay for it.

209
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,440
You seized group interests.

210
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,960
Stay back!

211
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,120
You're completely out of your mind.

212
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,360
You staged accidents
to silence people.

213
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,680
I endured in the darkness.

214
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,640
All for this very moment

215
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,360
to tear you apart completely.

216
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,360
Now, meet your end!

Welcome back, Chairman An.

222
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,760
Let me make a statement.

223
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,400
It's about our group's
ten-year plan.

224
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,480
Ying, thank you.

225
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,120
You've carried too much for me.

226
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,240
I'll do everything I can
to make it up to you.

227
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,000
Sis,

228
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,960
back then
human traffickers targeted us.

229
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,400
You lured them away alone
to save me,

230
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,000
and we were separated for years.

231
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,040
Now that Father has passed away,

232
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,520
we went through so much.

233
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,560
I never thought

234
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,520
we'd meet again.

235
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,160
And even stay by each other's side.

236
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,400
That's already healed
so many regrets.

237
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,240
Sis.

238
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,560
It's time for me to
find my own path.

239
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,040
Dad.

240
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,320
Song Pa has finally faced justice.

241
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,280
Now,

242
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,760
you can rest in peace.

243
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,200
Boss.

244
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,520
Thanks to all your trust.

245
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,520
I officially take over
as the new Leader.

246
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,280
From this day on,

247
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,920
Qingyun Gang will never
engage in illegal activities.

248
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,080
If I, Ye Ying,
ever break this vow,

249
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,400
may heaven and earth
destroy me.

250
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,600
A major gang crime case was recently
solved in the city.

251
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,160
The crime group led by Song Pa
has been completely wiped out.

252
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,840
Why not sleep a bit longer?

253
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,520
It's already morning.

254
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,840
What are you up to again?

255
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,560
Getting my breakfast.

256
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Stop messing around.

257
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,640
Some people

258
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,600
burn their bridges
once they've crossed them.

259
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,080
Not answering calls.

260
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,040
Nowhere to be found.

261
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,560
I have no choice

262
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,440
but to seize every second.

263
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,720
I was just busy.

264
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,520
Then when Leader Ye
finally has some free time,

265
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,480
maybe pay a bit more attention
to me?

266
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,160
Is this enough?

267
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,400
What about this?

268
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,720
How about…

269
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,240

00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,240

How about…

272
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,040
