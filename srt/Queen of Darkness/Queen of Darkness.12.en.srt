00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,680
I didn't know you liked to
show off so much.

187
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,160
Feeling sorry for her now?

188
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,280
We're all the bad ones here.

189
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,400
And you play the righteous one, huh?

190
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,280
Then you can take her place.

191
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
Fine.

192
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,160
What are you trying to do?

193
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,000
Stop it! Stop right now!

194
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,800
Stop!

195
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,800
Stop it!

196
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,080
Stop it!

197
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,080
Stop!

198
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,400
You guys, st...

199
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,720
Stop!

200
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,400
Got quite the temper.

201
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
What are you listening to?

202
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,640
This is Inspector Huo.

203
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,200
He's also one of
the company's shareholders.

204
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,560
I heard the newly appointed
Chairman An

205
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,920
was brought here, right?

206
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,360
An...

207
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,600
Chairman An?

208
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,000
Did you see her?

209
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,280
No.

210
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,160
Honestly, I didn't.

211
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,680
Let go!

212
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,400
Are you alright?

213
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,720
Police! Don't move!

214
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,960
Inspector.

215
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,160
How should we deal with these people?

216
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,040
Leave everything for
the new Chairman An to decide.

217
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,320
This is...chairman.

218
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,760
Now.

219
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,560
As the company's chairman,
I officially inform you all.

220
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,520
Anyone

221
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,640
who took action just now

222
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,480
is fired.

223
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,480
Chairman, I was wrong.

224
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,880
I won't ever do it again.

225
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,920
I'm sorry, I'll never dare again.

226
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,280
- Chairman, I was wrong.
- I was wrong.

227
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,640
- I'll never do it again.
- Chairman.

228
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,880
I was wrong.
I'll never do it again.

229
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,360
- Chairman.
- Chairman, I was wrong.

230
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,240
- Chairman.
- I was wrong.

231
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,840
I was wrong.
I'm worthless.

232
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,760
I'll work hard for the company
from now on.

233
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,880
Chairman, please have mercy.

234
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,160
Spare me, please.

235
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,280
I've got a whole family to support.

236
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,840
Chairman, I was wrong.

237
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,760
Chairman.

238
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,640
Chairman, I was wrong.

239
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,320
Chairman.

240
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,760
- Chairman, I was wrong.
- I won't ever do it again.

241
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,440
Chairman, I know I was wrong.

242
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,760
Now you want to plead your case?

243
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,200
So your hardships
justify bullying others?

244
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,440
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

245
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,760
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

246
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,800
If the person here today
were really a new hire,

247
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,320
without the title of chairman,

248
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,840
would you still be
kneeling and begging like this?

249
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,040
If it weren't for me today,

250
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,240
more and more new colleagues
in the company

251
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,960
would be bullied.

252
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,920
I'll have HR note the reason for

253
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,760
your dismissal in your files today.

254
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,640
So you'll pay for what you did today

255
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,360
for the rest of your lives.

256
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,440
Chair...

257
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,960
Chairman.

258
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,600
Chairman, this wasn't my idea.

259
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,560
It was Mr. Fang.

260
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,600
Mr. Fang from Finance Division
told me to do it.

261
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,320
It's just a bit of cream.

262
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,000
And a splash of ice water.

263
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,920
Nothing serious.

264
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,120
You know how capable I am.

265
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,120
A few more couldn't hurt me.

266
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,000
It's my first day here.

267
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,920
Just playing along with them.

268
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,680
You did this

269
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
to draw out the person behind them.

270
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,760
Everyone here seems to be
watching me closely.

271
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,280
I'll expose them one by one.

272
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,920
But I didn't expect

273
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,320
you'd always catch me
when I'm at my worst.

274
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,160
Fang Tao's actions

275
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,080
have already constituted
personal injury and abetment to crime.

276
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,880
You can hand him over to the police.

277
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,760
But I have to make them pay.

278
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,440
And I'll do it myself.
