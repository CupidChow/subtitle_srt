186
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,640
The underwear size is wrong too.

187
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,360
According to the records,
An Ning is a housewife.

188
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,280
Timid

189
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,560
and weak.

190
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,800
But I have a hot temper

191
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,280
[An Ning's personal habits and likes]
and I know how to fight.

192
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,000
So,

193
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,080
I can't be her.

194
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,040
Longxing Group was taken from
the An family by Song Pa.

195
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,440
The cause of An Ning's father's death
was suspicious.

196
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,600
Song Pa must be involved somehow.

197
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:19,400
I hold shares in Longxing Group.

198
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,920
So they definitely won't let me go.

199
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,160
Huo Xiao also seems to
suspect my identity.

200
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,320
So, who am I really?

201
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,200
