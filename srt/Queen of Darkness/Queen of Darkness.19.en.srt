You have the nerve to come back?

10
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,680
Reporting your father-in-law
for power-for-money transactions.

11
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,040
You're dragging the Song family
into the fire pit.

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,760
You ungrateful jinx.

13
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,080
And fooling around with
Huo Xiao outside.

14
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,520
Everything you do
brings shame to our family!

15
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,800
A woman like you

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,480
would've been punished harshly
in ancient times!

17
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,800
I don't care who you are outside.

18
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,560
At home,
you're still my daughter-in-law.

19
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,720
Today, I'll teach you
some proper manners.

20
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,560
Go.

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,000
Mop the floor.

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,160
And wash the dishes in the kitchen.

And your violence, cheating,
and toying with women.

32
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:52,600
By law,
you should be chemically castrated!

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,680

I set up
many surveillance cameras.

42

But I didn't expect

43
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,880
they unknowingly

44
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,400
captured our moments.

46
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,080

If you want to save her, come alone.

57
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,360
Don't play tricks.

58
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,240
You know what I'm capable of.

59
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,320
You can't beat Huo Xiao,

60
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,600
so you take your anger out on me.

61
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,880
I'm honestly embarrassed for you.

62
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,120
Of course,
I'd go after Huo Xiao's weak spot.

63
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,840
That's the only way to take him down.

64
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,040
As for the method,

65
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,720
it doesn't really matter.

66
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,720
Are you so sure

67
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,280
he would risk everything for me?

68
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,320
If he doesn't show up, that's fine.

69
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,040
Then I'll tear you apart

70
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,480
piece by piece.

71
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,760

72
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,200

I'll send Huo Xiao

a piece of you.

76
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Let him live

77
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,680
in the pain of
losing his beloved forever.

78
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,360
You monster.

79
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,120
Then I'll show you
how monstrous I can be.

80
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,280
Starting with your arm.

81
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:28,280
As punishment for Huo Xiao being late.

82
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,720
Stop it!

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,240
Thought you'd hide like a coward.

84
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,600
But who knew

85
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,440
you're such a romantic fool.

86
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,120

00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,480

play the hero saving the beauty.

88
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,840
The grudge between us

89
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,920
has nothing to do with her.

90
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,600
Let her go.

91
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,640
Who do you think you are,

92
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
telling me what to do?

93
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,840
Huo Xiao.

94
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,840
You're the reason I lost my career.

95
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,520
So I'll torture her,

96
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,800
abuse her,

97
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,720
right in front of you.

98
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,840
The more painful you are,

99
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,400
the more excited I get!

100
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,840
Jiang Meng,
come at me if you have the guts!

101
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,720
Fine.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,840
Then get on your knees.

103
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,160
Beg me like a dog.

104
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,840
Maybe once I've cooled down,

105
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,560
I'll show some mercy.

106
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,360
Let her live a bit longer.

107
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,120
Didn't expect you to fall this low.

108
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,200
You said I was Song Pa's dog.

109
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,320
But now

110
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,280
you're my dog, Jiang Meng's dog!

111
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,360
I've done everything you asked.

112
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,440
Is that enough?

113
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,880
I'm not done yet.

114
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,400
This is just the beginning.

115
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,960
Crawl over here like a dog.

116
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,240
You've got ten seconds.

117
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,320
If you're late,

118
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,680
I'll cut her in half.

119
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,400
Even if they had nine lives,

120
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,480
none of them would survive today.

121
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,360
They teamed up to set me up.

122
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,680
Then let them

123
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,280
go to the underworld together.

124
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,640
Dad.

125
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,760
Didn't we agree

126
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,040
to spare An Ning's life?

127
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,560
Spare her for what?

128
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,400
Who cares about
that transfer agreement now?

129
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,600
Just kill her first.

130
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,040
To get released on bail,

131
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,320
I gave the higher-ups
30% of the profits.

132
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,880
Anyone standing in my way

133
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,200
has no way out.

134
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,920
The situation's already set.

135
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,600
Let's go.

136
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,240
Don't get stained with this mess.

137
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,000
Let's go.

138
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,240
You crawl so fast.

139
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,440
What a loyal follower.

140
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,320
Almost had me touched there.

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,080
Now can you let her go?

142
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,640
Not yet.

143
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,160
Shamelessness, meanness,

144
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,000
and ruthlessness
are the standard for a villain.

145
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,400
I was lying to you just now.

146
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,800
I brought you here

147
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,680
so I could take you all

148
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,760
and tear you apart together.

149
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,680
Then mix you into one.

150
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,280
You in me,

151
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,480
and me in you.

152
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,080
That's also a kind of reunion.

153
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,120
Go! Don't let a single one escape!

154
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,640
It's over now.

155
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,680
You killed my father.

156
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,000
Even if you saved me,

157
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,640
no matter what you've done for me,

158
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,280
it'll never settle that debt.

159
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,160
So it seems

160
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,320
you've regained your memories.

161
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,520
What if I told you

162
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,240
I didn't kill Ye Hong,

163
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,320
would you believe me?

164
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,000
I only believe

165
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,000
what I see with my own eyes.

166
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,480
After all we've been through,

167
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,760
you still don't trust me.

168
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,280
Stop making excuses.

169
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,280
You got close to me.

170
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,480
Did all this for me.

171
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,720
Just to get my drive password, right?

172
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,680
I admit it.

173
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,120
At first, I approached you

174
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,600
with a hidden motive.

175
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,240
But after we spent time together,

176
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,280
those little moments,

177
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,360
were they all fake?

178
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,560
Can't you feel

179
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,440
my feelings?

180
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,360
I can't tell the difference

181
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,440
between your sincerity and pretense.

182
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,200
And honestly,
I don't want to figure it out.

183
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
All I know is

184
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,200
that you had many chances
to tell me the truth.

185
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,560
But you kept lying.

186
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,720

195
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,640
to say this now?

196
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,680
