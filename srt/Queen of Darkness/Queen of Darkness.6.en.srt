I need to keep him steady.

103
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,840
Let him stay at my place.

104
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,240
Keep him right under my nose.

105
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,720
Better than him hiding in the shadows.

106
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,760
Turns out Huo Xiao never
teamed up with Song Pa.

I said, out!

187
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,400
Dad.

188
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,120
Why should we listen to him?

189
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,200
Just go out first.

190
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,600
Dad.

191
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,080
Lend me your lighter.

192
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,760
Undo his shirt.

193
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,680
Hurry, hurry up.

194
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,760
- Hurry.
- Take it easy.

195
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,960
- Move slow.
- Come on, hurry.

196
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,000
- Hurry.
- Slow down.

197
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,640
Watch out.

198
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,840
Slow down.

199
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,840
Can you go any faster?

200
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,440
Take it easy.

201
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,880
Doctor,

202
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,080
how's my grandson?

203
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,000
A spontaneous pneumothorax
caused by extreme tension.

204
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,800
In cases like this,

205
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,640
there's often only four or five minutes
to save the person.

206
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,440
This lady's first aid method
was spot on.

207
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,920
She used a pen cartridge
as an oxygen tube

208
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,000
to get oxygen into the boy's lung.

209
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,720
Otherwise,

210
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,480
he wouldn't have made it until we came.

211
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,960
You were brave back there.

212
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,680
But scared now?

213
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,600
I'm not scared.

214
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,280
The wind's too strong.

215
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,040
Does it hurt?

216
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,600
How did you know I'd save him?

217
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,400
Do you think I can't tell

218
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,280
who genuinely wanted to

219
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,320
save that kid?

220
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,280
What if...

221
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,760
What if I couldn't save him?

222
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,880
What if I failed?

223
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,680
There's no "what ifs".

224
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,120
Even if there were,

225
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,520
I'd face the consequences with you.

226
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,200
I thought

227
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,440
you were covering for Song Pa
and his family's wrongdoings.

228
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,040
Turns out the real dirty cop
was someone else.

229
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,360
But if it's not about Song Pa,

230
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,880
why are you staying here?

231
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,920
And even help me when they picked on me.

232
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,120
Who are you,

233
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,520
really?

234
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,320
Who I am doesn't matter.

235
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,600
What matters is

236
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,120
what you think of me.

237
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,160
Didn't expect that

238
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,040
An Ning actually wanted to
save the baby.

239
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,440
She just got lucky.

240
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,480
But she actually managed to
save the baby.

241
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,320
If anything happens to the baby,

242
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,640
I'll never let her off the hook.

243
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,880
Miss.

244
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,560
Madam.

245
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
The family doctor is here.

246
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,400
Let him go for now.

247
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,440
No need to fuss today.

248
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,280
Yes.

249
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,040
Wait.

250
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,040
Mom.

251
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,800
Did An Ning get her hand cut by a pen

252
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,480
and bleed today?

253
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,720
You...you...

254
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,720
What are you doing?

255
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,360
Mom.

256
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,560
Don't you remember?

257
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,040
An Ning faints at the sight of blood.

258
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,200
But today, she saw blood

259
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,560
and didn't react at all.

260
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,320
You mean...

261
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,880
This woman is definitely
hiding something.

262
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,520
Steward.

263
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,400
Go tell the family doctor.

264
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,840
Have An Ning

265
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,080
get a blood test right away.

266
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,680
Yes.

267
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,800
An Ning, open the door!

268
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,880
I'm warning you, you troublemaker.

269
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,600
Open the door now!

270
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,920
- If I break it down,
- Open it now!

271
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,920
you'll regret it even more!
