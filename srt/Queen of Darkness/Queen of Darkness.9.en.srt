is just an estimate.

185
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,760
Who remembers the exact time?

186
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,400
Let's drop this topic.

187
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,480
It's been so long since we met.

188
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,800
Did you miss me at all?

189
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,040
You've taken a lot of anger
from An Ning, huh?

190
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,040
How about

191
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,000
just thinking of me
as her,

192
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,040
and get

193
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,160
that anger off your chest.

194
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,920
Do you like what I'm wearing today?

195
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,760
Wait…

196
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,880
You're wearing An Ning's clothes?

197
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,280
That's so bold.

198
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:27,880
Fang...

199
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,880
Now, I am

200
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,080
An Ning.

201
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,600
An Ning.

202
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,320
What's with that pride of yours?

203
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,120
In the end,
you still became my plaything!

204
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,920
Yeah.

205
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,600
And a useless one at that.

206
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,840
Can't even have a child.

207
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,240
Can't keep a man either.

208
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,120
What is this?

209
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,240
Role-playing?

210
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,360
Or just self-deception?

211
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,840
- Hey, don't...
- Keep going.

212
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,560
Go on.

213
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,520
Maybe I'll find a use for this someday.

214
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,520
Let more people see

215
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,360
the so-called love of a mistress.

216
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,000
No, wait.

217
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,600
You...

218
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,800
You should be the one feeling ashamed.

219
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,400
Being humiliated like that by me.

220
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,360
Shamelessness is invincible.

221
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,840
But when it comes to dealing with you,

222
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,680
I've got plenty of ways.

223
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,040
You two.

224
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,640
Mom.

225
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,080
What are you doing?

226
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,440
Get down here.

227
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,160
- Mom.
- You crazy kid!

228
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,160
She's pregnant, you know.

229
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,360
And you still dare to mess around?

230
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,440
And you.

231
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,440
Behave yourself.

232
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,200
Don't egg him on.

233
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,160
You little brat!

234
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,000
- You brat!
- Mom, don't hit me.

235
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,960
- I'll hit you.
- I'm sorry, Mom!

236
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,400
- You hit her?
- You...

237
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
I'll hit you!

238
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:49,960
Hit her instead!

239
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,720
No, I'll hit you!

240
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,960
- Hit her, not me!
- I'm hitting you!

241
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,080
- She stirred things up.
- You brat.

242
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,080
That troublemaker An Ning.

243
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,920
She keeps getting in my way.

244
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,600
I thought I could use
this pregnancy to rise up.

245
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,280
Now I can't even share a room.

246
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
Someone, help!

247
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,040
Help!

248
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,240
An Ning pushed her mother‑in‑law down!

249
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,040
Mom, mom.

250
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,600
Mom.

251
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,520
- You okay?
- What happened, mom?

252
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,920
Mom.

253
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,040
- You alright?
- Mom.

254
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,680
Even if you don't get along with her,

255
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,800
you can't put her life in danger.

256
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,840
You've already lost your own parents,

257
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,720
and now you'd raise a hand
against your in‑law?

258
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,280
If such a jinx stays in this family,

259
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,960
who knows

260
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,160
what else might happen next.

261
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,640
Every word out of your mouth is a lie.

262
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,320
Such a low-level frame-up.

263
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,600
Only a fool would believe it.

264
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,160
I swear on the child I carry.

265
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,440
I saw you push your mother-in-law
down the stairs.

266
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Fang Yao's words aren't baseless.

267
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,480
You've never
shown your mother-in-law respect.

268
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,840
Always giving sarcastic looks,

269
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,920
or talking back whenever she speaks.

270
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,720
Do you wish for her
to die sooner?

271
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,480
Now I finally see it clearly.

272
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,280
You don't care about right or wrong.

273
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,880
You just want an excuse to trouble me.

274
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,720
You scoundrel!

275
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,160
No manners, no upbringing.

276
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:10,720
You hurt someone,

277
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,880
and still act this defiant?

278
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,320
Even your late father

279
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,520
would feel ashamed to
have a daughter like you!

280
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,120
The ashamed one should be you!

281
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,240
Doing anything

282
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,720
for my shares.

283
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,920
Like father, like son.

284
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,360
Had both parents,

285
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,960
and still ended up with
a scumbag like Ti Cha!

286
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,800
You...

287
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:28,880
Fine.

288
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,920
You won't yield
until you see the coffin.

289
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,480
If you can't prove your innocence,

290
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,920
I'll carry out the family punishment.

291
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,440
Bring it.

292
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,560
I have

293
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,560
the evidence here.

294
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,320
My stomach hurts so much.

295
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,320
Anything else you want to say?

296
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,120
Without this video,

297
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,840
I'd be the one taking the blame.

298
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,640
Th...this video is edited.

299
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,880
You all teamed up to frame me.

300
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,800
Mom.

301
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,480
Please, take it slow.

302
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,040
I'm fine now.

303
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,160
The baby comes first.

304
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,720
Alright, forget it.

305
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,200
Good thing you're okay.

306
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,160
I'm just clumsy from pregnancy,

307
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,840
so I slipped and knocked into you.

308
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,240
I swear, I didn't mean to do it.

309
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,520
From now on,

310
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,400
I'll bear more heirs
for the Song family as compensation.

311
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,000
Alright.

312
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,760
So feudal-minded you don't even
care about your own life.

313
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,160
You truly deserve all this suffering.

314
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,760
How come the missing cufflink
from father-in-law's right sleeve

315
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,760
fell out of my clothes?

316
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,120
Fang Yao wore this dress before.

317
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,240
Could it be that
Fang Yao and my father-in-law...

318
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,800
I was so scared today.

319
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,840
You'd better do something

320
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,640
to help me calm down.

321
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,640
My special aphrodisiac oil.

322
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,040

323
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,160
