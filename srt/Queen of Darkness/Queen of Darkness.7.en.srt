[Episode 7]

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,760
An Ning, open the door!

10
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,840
I'm warning you, you troublemaker.

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,560
Open the door now!

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,000
- If I break it down,
- Open it now!

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,800
you'll regret it even more!

14
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,440
- Open the door now.
- Come on!

15
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,280
Open the door!

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,920
I know you're inside, come out.

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,120
- Open the door.
- Stop pretending.

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,400
Open the door, An Ning!

19
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,400
Open the door!

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,400
Just open it!

21
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,760
If you don't open up,
I'll break it down!

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,640
Sis, if you want to thank me
for saving your son,

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,040
there's no need for
such a grand gesture.

24
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,600
I... I...

25
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,240
Focus on the serious matter first.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,840
Doctor.

27
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,520
Yes.

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,520
Draw her blood.

29
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,600
What's the meaning of this?

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,600
Why draw blood?

31
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,360
As Ti Cha's wife,

32
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,640
keeping yourself clean is basic.

33
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,960
We've arranged annual physicals
for you before.

34
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,440
This year is no exception.

35
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,040
Then why didn't you notify me earlier?

36
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,080
I had a drink today.

37
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,240
The sample wouldn't be valid.

38
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,800
High blood alcohol concentration

39
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,200
is indeed unsuitable for testing.

40
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,480
If you want blood,

41
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,760
try another day.

42
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,120
An Ning.

43
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,200
Mom wants to draw your blood
for your own good.

44
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,440
A little alcohol isn't a big deal.

45
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,440
It'll dissipate in just an hour.

46
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,680
We can ask the doctor to
wait a bit longer.

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,600
You awful woman.

48
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,200
Don't you dare play tricks on me!

49
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,320
Until the test is done,

50
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,520
no one leaves this house.

51
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,400
Steward.

52
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,880
Take all the alcohol from her room.

53
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,320
Yes.

54
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,360
Mom.

55
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,040
An Ning

56
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,120
she never drinks

57
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,160
but today.

58
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,880
Right when we need her blood test,

59
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,120
she downs so much.

60
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,600
Could it be she's figured something out?

61
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,000
And she's deliberately stalling now.

62
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,560
If she really knows something,

63
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,000
she'll keep finding ways to delay.

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,440
If she has something to hide,

65
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,040
no matter what we do,

66
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,080
she'll always be on guard.

67
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,440
We'll have to think of another way.

68
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,760
An Ning,

69
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,720
you're the best at brewing medicine
in the family.

70
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,120
Hurry and get it ready.

71
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,280
Xuan is waiting to take it.

72
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,440
My new nail art is way too sharp.

73
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,720
You don't mind, do you?

74
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,440
You troublemaker.

75
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,000
Trying to slack off again, huh?

76
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,720
How do you make such a mess
just brewing medicine?

77
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
Useless.

78
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,360
Clean up and get dinner started.

79
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,800
You better protect this thing.

80
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,160
If something goes wrong,
you can't afford the loss.

81
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,720
Before tomorrow's banquet,

82
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,280
you must bring me the results.

83
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:52,000
Madam, Miss.

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,680
Don't worry.

85
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,840
Even if you manage to
get the blood sample back this time,

86
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,640
they'll still find new ways to
harm you next time.

87
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,600
That's none of your business.

88
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,520
Give it back to me.

89
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,840
I do mean well, really.

90
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,000
But you don't have to rush to
cozy up to thank me.

91
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,840
Since you know
they want to harm me,

92
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,920
why won't you let me save myself?

93
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,080
Even if that doctor
took the blood sample,

94
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,400
they can't harm you.

95
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,480
Ridiculous.

96
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,680
During my time in Song Pa's house,

97
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,520
have I ever hurt you?

98
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,680
What happened?

99
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,120
Didn't you tell me to trust you?

100
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,480
Then tell me,

101
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,320
why help me?

102
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,280
What grudge is between you and Song Pa?

103
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,440
You tell me nothing.

104
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,280

It also makes the show

Inspector Huo wants to

127
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,800
see how I get crushed
by the Song family?

128
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,440
Is that so?

129
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,400
Then you're bound to be disappointed.

130
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,200
No matter what happens,

131
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,600

Let's wait and enjoy the show.

Congratulations to Mr. Song for
regaining the dock.

135
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,600
With this dock,

136
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,800
it's only a matter of time
before you become the richest man.

137
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,680
I heard

138
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,960
it was Ti Cha's wife
who got it back this time.

139
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,960
Ti Cha sure is a lucky man.

140
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,840
He married such
a beautiful and capable wife.

141
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,040
Sir.

142
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,240
Just so-so.

143
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,640
An Ning really is good at everything.

144
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,000
But she's always saying

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,160
she didn't come from a great family,

146
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,520
and that she's not worthy of our Ti Cha.

147
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,440
Well, things are better now.

148
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,560
She helped our family get the dock back.

149
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,800
She...

150
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,960
won't have to feel guilty towards
our Song family

151
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,480
for not being able to
have a child anymore.

152
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,320
Even a hen I raise
lays an egg every day,

153
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,000
yet she still can't have a child.

154
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,400
Getting scolded like that
by her in-laws,

155
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,120
how does she even have the face
to stay here?

156
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,600
The Song family's loaded.

157
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,200
Even if she gets scolded,

158
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,360
she gets to spend the money.

159
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,920
If it were me,

160
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,160
I wouldn't want to leave either.

161
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,600
She's been scolded like crazy.

162
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,520
How can she put up with that?

163
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,080
Must be a turtle reborn.

164
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,120
Sir, you're right.

165
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
What are you talking about?

166
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,360
What nonsense...

167
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,600
Inspector Huo, long time no see.

168
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,720
Let me propose a toast.

169
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,920
But that glass is way too small.

170
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,200
I can't see your sincerity.

171
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,320
Uh...

172
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,040
Smooth talker.

173
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,880
Finish this bottle first.

174
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,760
Then I'll call it a real toast.

175
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,120
W...wait.

176
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,600
This...

177
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,680
Can't drink?

178
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,560
Let me help you.

179
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,080
Hey, wait, what are you doing?

180
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,240
That's an expensive bottle, you know.

181
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,000
Perfect for washing your mouth out.

182
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,840
Are you crazy?

183
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,840
Everyone.

184
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:55,800
Everyone.

185
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,600
Today,

186
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,560
I brought you all here

187
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,400
not just to cheer for An Ning's success,

188
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,520
but also to ask you to be our witnesses.

189
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,680
Madam, the doctor is here.

190
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,440
Let him in.

191
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,480
There wasn't any mistake, right?

192
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,040
From collecting the blood

193
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,760
to sending it to the testing center,

194
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,480
I handled every step myself.

195
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,120
Don't worry.

196
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,320
There's absolutely no problem.

197
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,520
An Ning.

198
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,280
Do you want to know
what's inside this bag?

199
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,000
I truly never expected

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,440
you're so treacherous.

201
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,200
You've lied to every single one of us!

202
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,360
Stop wasting words on her.

203
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Open it up.

204
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,240
I'd like everyone here
to be a witness today.

205
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,240
This woman standing here

206
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,640
is not An Ning at all.

207
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,000
She is just

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,040
an impostor.

209
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,760
That's nonsense!

210
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,600
Still talking tough
at your final moment.

211
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,560
Listen.

212
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,280
This test report in my hand

213
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,840
is a genetic comparison

214
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,760
between your blood
and An Ning's blood sample.

215
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:00,520
Ti Cha.

216
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,600
Expose this fraud.

217
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,880
A face can be faked.

218
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
But DNA doesn't lie.

219
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,360
I won't let anyone
trick the Song family.

220
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,840
Guys.

221
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,920
We

222
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,000
chose the most reputable testing center.

223
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,080
Based on the analysis of
the blood sample,

224
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,240
this...

225
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,520
This DNA...

226
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,640
DNA

227
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,560
shows a perfect match.

228
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,040
Sis.

229
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:27,880
Mom.

230
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,120
The tested person's DNA
aligns with the sample.

231
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,880
[Genetic matching index: 99.99%]
99.99%.

232
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,200
What does that even mean?

233
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,320
How could that be?

234
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,840
That's impossible.

235
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,080
You really are An Ning.

236
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,360
No...no way.

237
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,760
How did you handle this?

238
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,040
You told me

239
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,120
to bring the report sealed
as soon as it was ready.

240
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,840
No one was allowed to take a peek.

241
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,240
Not even me.

242
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,600
The Song family totally shot themselves
in the foot.

243
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,000
They tried to frame
their daughter-in-law,

244
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,440
but ended up
embarrassing themselves instead.

245
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,840
I heard

246
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,960
they wanted to destroy
their daughter-in-law.

247
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,600
And take away all her shares.

248
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,080
So this so-called wealthy family

249
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,640
is actually this despicable?

250
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,720
Wait, what are you saying?

251
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,120
Mom.

252
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,480
What on earth is going on?

253
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,680
Could it be…

254
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,040
I got it all wrong?

255
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,960
No way!

256
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,920
It must be her stirring up trouble.

257
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,640
Mom, mom.

258
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,960
Still dare to lay a hand on me?

259
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,480
Listen,

260
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,080
I've already signed
the donation agreement.

261
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,880
If I die,

262
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,560
my shares will automatically
go to the welfare institution.

263
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,440
An Ning.

264
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,160
Haven't we treated you well enough?

265
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,160
How could you accuse us of trying to
harm you?

266
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,960
Sis, you wronged me.

267
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,760
But I wouldn't wrong you.

268
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,400
Mom, you might not know this yet.

269
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,040
The necklace around your neck

270
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,280

by her with a fake one.
