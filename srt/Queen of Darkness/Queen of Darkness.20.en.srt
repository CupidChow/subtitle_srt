00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,200
Back then,

187
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,280
you said you'd comfort me
for your sister's sake,

188
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,160
but it turns out you were deliberately
plotting

189
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,440
to marry into the Song family!

190
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,120
No, it's not.

191
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,320
Dear, it's not like that.

192
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,800
Don't let that awful woman fool you.

193
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,440
Liar!

194
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,760
Zhen was your own sister.

195
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,800
What did she do to wrong you?

196
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,680
Yet you killed her so cruelly!

197
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,680
I knew it.

198
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,560
You never forgot her.

199
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,080
Zhen was gentle and kind.

200
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,680
I'll remember her forever!

201
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,280
I bore your children for you,

202
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,080
took care of everything
in the family,

203
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,040
and we've stood by each other
for over ten years.

204
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,320
Does that still lose to

205
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,800
a fleeting crush you had
when you were young?

206
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,040
What makes you think
you can compare to her?

207
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,240
Everything you enjoy now,

208
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,480
the role of Mrs. Song,

209
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,760
was meant for Zhen.

210
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,920
You snatched it

211
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,000
with disgraceful tricks!

212
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,240
Snatched it away?

213
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,680
So what?

214
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,920
This happened over twenty years ago!

215
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,360
This video means nothing now.

216
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,840
Even the law can't touch me.

217
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,320
I'm still Mrs. Song.

218
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll always be a noble lady
above everyone else!

219
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,640
You scheming woman.

220
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,920
If the law can't punish you,

221
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,440
I will!

222
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,400
Guards!

223
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,520
Get this vile woman

224
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,880
out of the Song family.

225
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,000
Don't let her
take a single cent with her.

226
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,040
If she steps into here again,

227
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,280
beat her to death!

228
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,440
- I'm a billionaire's wife!
- Move!

229
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,040
Let me go!

230
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,480
Let me go!

231
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,960
I'm Mrs. Song!

232
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,880
I'm a billionaire's wife!

233
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,040
Let me go!

234
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,800
Let me...

235
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,560
Mom.

236
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,000
Th..this...

237
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,200
What happened here?

238
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,760
Ti Cha.

239
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,640
An Ning set me up.

240
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,080
Your father kicked me out.

241
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,600
Hurry, take mom back home.

242
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,200
No.

243
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,000
That's impossible.

244
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,320
Why would dad do that?

245
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,760
Mom.

246
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,160
I... this...

247
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,920
Ti Cha.

248
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,200
She killed your dad's first love.

249
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,960
And that woman was her own sister.

250
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,560
Do you think your dad

251
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,040
would ever forgive her for that?

252
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,320
No, no.

253
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,120
Ti Cha, Ti Cha.

254
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,040
Ti Cha!

255
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,480
Go.

256
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,040
Ti Cha!

257
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,880
Ti Cha!

258
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,720
Mom, mom!

259
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,640
That happened so many years ago.

260
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,880
How could it suddenly resurface?

261
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,880
Was it you?

262
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,960
Mother-in-law ruled
her home for half a lifetime.

263
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,160
But now she's a discarded woman
of a wealthy family.

264
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,720
So, from now on,

265
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,640
her life is bound to
get pretty interesting.
