[Episode 8]

9
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,600
Sis, you wronged me.

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,400
But I wouldn't wrong you.

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,960
Mom, you might not know this yet.

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,440
The necklace around your neck

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,680
has already been replaced
by her with a fake one.

14
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,440
Impossible!

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,560
What nonsense are you talking?

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,800
Watch your mouth,
or I'll tear it apart!

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:07,960
An Ning.

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,040
Even if our family looks down on you,

19
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,760
I've always been on your side!

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,080
But instead of thanking me,

21
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,520
now you're sowing discord
between me and Mom?

22
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,160
Mom.

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,600
You have to stand up for me.

24
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,200
Whether it's real or fake,

25
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,520
we can test it and see.

26
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,640
The necklace on Mom's neck
is just plastic.

27
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,520
Just hold it over a flame,

28
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,120
and you'll see the truth right away.

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,600
Who do you think you are?

30
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,600

Are you all dead?

Hurry up and get her out of here!

35
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,720

for her husband to start a company!

42
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Mom, I didn't do that.

43
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,800
What are you doing? Let go!

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,720
- What are you doing?
- What's your problem?

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,640
Is just a knock‑off too.

What do you even know?

The Song family

75
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,280
never needs jewelry to show off.

76
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,160
Wow, that sounds noble.

77
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,400
You think that can hide
the fact your husband's a gambler,

78
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,160
who owes billions in loan sharks?

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,360
She...

80
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,600
Is what she said true?

81
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,400
She's talking nonsense.

82
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,560
You didn't just steal the jewelry.

83
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,960
You even schemed to grab my shares.

84
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,600
You try everything to get money.

85
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,000
All because if you can't pay
your husband's gambling debts,

86
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,280
he'll be beaten to death,

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,440
and you'll be thrown out
by your mother-in-law.

88
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,640
I'll tear your mouth out!

89
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,040
Some people love to
call others low‑born.

90
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,200
But when it comes down to it,

91
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,200
it's because they're doing
shameful things.

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,360
Mom, mom.

93
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,560
Mom.

94
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,400
They're all fakes now, mom!

95
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,360
Our treasures have all turned fake!

96
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,440
See.

97
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,920
Mom, dad.

98
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,000
Everything's become fake.

99
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,920
Our beloved treasures...

100
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,480
Heartless wretch!

101
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,920
How dare you cheat me?

102
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,080
I won't let you get away with this!

103
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,360
Mom, I didn't do that.

104
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,200
I didn't do that.

105
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,840
She did.

106
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,440
That heartless woman did it.

107
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,360
She set me up!

108
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,920
She swapped everything.

109
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,320
She's trying to
turn us against each other.

110
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,280
Mom, I'm your real daughter.

111
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,600
You have to believe me.

112
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,560
Mom.

113
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,840
Mom.

114
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,080
Mom, you're lying.

115
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,600
You opened Grandma's safe
and stole things.

116
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,920
I saw it with my own eyes.

117
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,720
What are you saying, you little brat?

118
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,560
If you keep talking nonsense,

119
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,720
I'll teach you a real lesson!

120
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,720
Mom.

121
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,640
You can't
take a child's words seriously.

122
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,920
Mom.

123
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,800
Didn't you say Grandma has
plenty of money,

124
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,120
and taking these things was nothing?

125
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,160
Stop talking.

126
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,880
Quiet.

127
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,160
Mom.

128
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,680
I'll beat you!

129
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,600
- Mom!
- I'll beat you!

130
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,240
Stop fighting!

131
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,800
- I'll kill you!
- Stop fighting!

132
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,840
Stop it, Mom!

133
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,800
- Stop it!
- I'll beat you!

134
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,560
Stop it!

135
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,840
- I'll smack you!
- Mom, stop hitting.

136
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
Mom! Mom, please stop!

137
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,080
- I'll beat you!
- Dad! Dad!

138
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,960
Do something!

139
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,000
Go and stop them!

140
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,280
- I can't...
- I'll beat you.

141
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,320
- I'll smack you!
- Stop, stop, please!

142
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,120
Mom, I was wrong.

143
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,720
Mom.

144
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,080
Mom, don't kick me out.

145
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,120
Mom, I'm sorry.

146
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,920
Get away from me.

147
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,480
Mom.

148
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,760
I'm your own daughter.

149
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,680
Don't fall for their tricks.

150
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,840
Mom.

151
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,280
Now you say you're my own daughter?

152
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,200
I'm your birth mother.

153
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,320
Listen,

154
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,040
you've got one week to
return my jewelry.

155
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,120
Or you'll never set foot in here again!

156
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,680
Get out!

157
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,600
You today…

158
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,400
are a little different.

159
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,560
How so?

160
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,000
The you right now

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,320
is like a sexy little wildcat.

162
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,720
You actually managed to
drive my tough sister away.

163
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,160
I never expected

164
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,640
you'd call her a tough sister.

165
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,160
Guess she really did
push you around before.

166
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,600
It looked like she was bullying me,

167
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,160
but actually, I was letting her win.

168
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,760
She's not as capable as she seems.

169
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,240
But

170
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,800
today you really helped me
get my revenge.

171
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,080
I must reward you.

172
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,520
Conquering you, little wildcat,

173
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,520
is very interesting.

174
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,240
So what?

175
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,720
Changed tactics today?

176
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,440
No swinging punches this time?

177
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,840
I suddenly realized

178
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,920
there's another way to win you over.

179
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,920
And it might just be more fun.

180
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,120
What a shame.

181
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,640
I don't want to be conquered by you.

182
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,960
These things...

183
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,400
You can keep and wear them yourself!

184
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,120
Honey.

185
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,560
Please, let me explain.

186
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,960
Didn't expect tonight
to be this exciting.

187
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,360

Ye Ying

00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,400
and An Ning are twins.

239
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,840
And they're monozygotic twins.

240
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,800
So not only do they look the same

241
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,200
their DNA is identical too.

242
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,680
Like this,

00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,920
even if we do nothing,

244
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,320
after the family doctor compares
the blood samples,

245
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,880
he'll only come to one conclusion that

246
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,320
Ye Ying is An Ning.

247
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,320
Inspector,

248
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,400
since we already know the truth,

249
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,920
why not just take her away?

he'll definitely find a way

treat Ye Ying as An Ning and kill her.

256
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,280
Then naturally seize An Ning's shares.
