00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,200
Time: 8:30-11:00

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,160
Day

3
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,920
Alright, students.

4
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,840
Yesterday, the poetry appreciation question

5
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,770
was about expression techniques.

6
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,479
As we just discussed.

7
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,080
Speaking of expression techniques,

8
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,800
on your end,

9
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,479
that thing

10
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,420
should be happening soon.

11
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,880
Objects

12
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,200
to express our emotions.

13
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,800
It's called

14
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,240
expressing feelings through objects.

15
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,280
And there are some other things,

16
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,160
but let's talk about our current situation.

17
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,760
We use some ancient stories.

18
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,320
We need to refer to the slope of the asymptote.

19
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,280
This asymptote

20
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,960
has a slope of 1.

21
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,320
The slope here is 2,

22
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,600
which is greater.

23
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,560
The upper part of this hyperbola

24
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,760
has an intersection point.

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,480
Let's see.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,800
That thing

27
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,640
should happen very soon.

28
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,520
Students,

29
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,400
in this class

30
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,160
we'll cover reduction reactions.

31
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,560
High school oxidation-reduction reactions

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,400
and valence.

33
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,000
After class,

34
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,760
based on the teacher's knowledge framework today.

35
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,490
Copper oxide

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,880
in this reaction

37
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,079
underwent a change.

38
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,640
Oxidation reaction.

39
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,800
Third,

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,720
redox reactions,

41
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,320
analyzed from the patterns of gaining or losing oxygen

42
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,320
and changes in oxidation states.

43
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,920
That's all for today's class.

44
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,720
Class dismissed.

45
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,380
Thank you, teacher. Stand up.

46
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,440
Goodbye, teacher.

47
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,650
Goodbye, students.

48
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,920
The current Beijing time is

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:10,880
February 26th, 2012,

50
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,040
at

51
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,320
12:30 PM.

52
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,500
Welcome to the weather forecast.

53
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,560
Zhenzhen,

54
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,480
weren't you hungry?

55
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,240
You were the first one to rush to the cafeteria,

56
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,500
why aren't you eating?

57
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,520
Stop staring.

58
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,780
He rarely comes to the cafeteria.

59
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,760
Jiangling.

60
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,180
Hey, you with the glasses,

61
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,160
outside food isn't allowed at school.

62
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,640
Why is he here again?

63
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,040
You'll be responsible if something goes wrong,

64
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,120
just come and eat properly,

65
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:42,980
it's meal time.

66
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,320
I'm talking to you.

67
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,380
What are you doing?

68
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,200
You're hurting my arm, you know?

69
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,930
What's that?

70
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,890
Chicken cutlet,

71
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,720
want some?

72
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:53,740
Not for you.

73
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,920
I heard the chicken cutlet he bought outside

74
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,400
was thrown away by the cafeteria lady.

75
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,000
He got into an argument with her right away.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,120
These tomato and egg dishes

77
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,840
that you make every single day,

78
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,120
I'm sick of them.

79
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,560
We eat this stuff every day,

80
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,120
no wonder we're having problems.

81
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,800
Everyone.

82
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,930
Don't you all agree?

83
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,280
Yes.

84
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,360
Exactly.

85
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,720
It's eggs all day long,

86
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,000
no wonder I'm doing poorly on tests.

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,920
And there's hair,

88
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,760
so much hair.

89
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,560
I've eaten so much hair,

90
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,120
I'm full of it.

91
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,640
That's right.

92
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:20,839
Qianqian.

93
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,320
That's not hair.

94
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,800
It's black moss.

95
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,680
I said no eating, so no eating.

96
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,040
Why are you taking my chicken cutlet?

97
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:24,320
No eating.

98
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,760
Give it back to me.

99
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,160
You're stealing from me.

100
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,760
Come here.

101
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,680
I paid for it with my own money.

102
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,409
What's wrong with this person?

103
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,840
The cafeteria food tastes terrible and they won't let us buy our own,

104
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,640
what a waste!

105
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,380
We get scolded every time we bring outside food,

106
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,360
that's just too much!

107
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
Get down here!

108
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,080
Which class are you from?

109
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,120
Who's your homeroom teacher?

110
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,240
Call them over here.

111
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,300
And get your parents to come here too.

112
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,600
Don't want to eat cafeteria food?

113
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,280
I'll make sure

114
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,400
you can't live on campus

115
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,060
and never eat cafeteria food again in your life.

116
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,810
What are you looking at?

117
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:40,850
Get down.

118
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,420
Get down right now.

119
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,800
Hit them.

120
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:04,810
Stop!

121
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Smash it!

122
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,159
Xiaoshi!

123
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:40,159
Has he gone crazy?

124
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,600
Everyone back up,

125
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,360
step back.

126
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:45,120
Quiet!

127
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,360
Come down.

128
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,530
Get down.

129
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,130
Hurry up.

130
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,040
Get down.

131
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,640
Get down now.

132
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,280
The entire war kept escalating.

133
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,760
Until...

134
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:00,570
Get down.

135
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,940
What are you all doing?

136
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,880
Are you staging a rebellion?

137
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,780
Do you all want to be punished?

138
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,840
And then

139
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,600
The guy with glasses and the principal.

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,080
Next, regarding the disciplinary notice

141
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,600
for Shi Xiaoxin from Class 8, Grade 12.

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,920
In light of

143
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,159
Shi Xiaoxin from Class 8, Grade 12's

144
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,940
misconduct in the cafeteria yesterday,

145
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,650
which has created a very negative impact,

146
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,000
we hereby

147
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,040
issue a severe warning.

148
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,080
We hope all students will take this as a warning.

149
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,360
To ensure that Grade 12 students maintain a healthy mindset

150
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,720
as they prepare for the upcoming college entrance exam,

151
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,000
the school has decided that during lunch hours,

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,680
all Grade 12 students

153
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,480
may voluntarily choose whether to dine on campus.

154
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,680
Let's go out to eat.

155
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,520
Finally going out for a meal.

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,760
Without me?

157
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,320
No way.

158
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:29,960
Great!

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,720
Everyone sit down and stop arguing.

160
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,600
We want fried chicken.

161
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
What are those students doing over there?

162
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,659
Class has started.

163
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,240
Mom, I'm home!

164
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,080
You're back.

165
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,160
So much delicious food.

166
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,160
One, two, three, four.

167
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,740
Where's my dad?

168
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,080
Your dad's working overtime.

169
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,210
Where is he working?

170
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,480
He's a grown man,

171
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,800
how would I know where he's working?

172
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,080
It's not like he'll get lost.

173
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,120
But I wanted us to eat together.

174
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,720
Let's not talk about that now.

175
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,400
Um...

176
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:07,720
Look,

177
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,920
I think Mom can stir-fry some vegetables for you

178
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,000
and

179
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,120
cook some shrimp too.

180
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,250
How does that sound?

181
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,780
That should be enough, right?

182
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,570
Alright,

183
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,840
go wash your hands before dinner.

184
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,800
Can I watch some TV first?

185
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:20,640
No TV now.

186
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,840
Just for a little while,

187
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,840
I need to relax.

188
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,440
You...

189
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:26,960
This kid.

190
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,240
On a stormy night

191
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,200
a mysterious woman meets her end beneath a withered tree,

192
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,600
yet not a soul can be found within miles.

193
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,720
Behind this murder

194
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,280
what secrets

195
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,840
remain hidden from sight?

196
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,120
Intricate and complex,

197
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,480
truth and deception blur.

198
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,520
A hunt for a killer in a labyrinth,

199
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,520
or a journey through time and space?

200
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,090
Who's there?

201
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,760
Who is it?

202
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,800
Who's that?

203
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,480
Hello?

204
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Who could that be?

205
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,200
Surprise!

206
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,240
You're back!

207
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,720
I rushed home right after the meeting ended,

208
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,960
just wanted to spend more time with you.

209
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,880
That's wonderful!

210
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,240
Let's go eat.

211
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,050
Let's go.

212
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,440
Dad, please sit down.

213
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,970
It's been so long since we've eaten together.

214
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,160
Thank you, Mom.

215
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,640
Mom, you've worked hard.

216
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,800
Try this.

217
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,720
Such a thoughtful child.

218
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Have some of this.

219
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,320
Thank you.

220
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:49,880
Go ahead, eat.

221
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,640
Dad wants to ask you,

222
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,100
how did you do on your test?

223
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,000
If I did well,

224
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,560
will there be any reward?

225
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,600
You want a reward for a practice test?

226
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,000
What about the college entrance exam?

227
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,600
Can we get something practical?

228
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,400
Let's hear it.

229
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,640
iPhone 4S.

230
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,000
My current phone is too outdated

231
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,280
and it's really slow.

232
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,650
Alright.

233
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,240
As long as you get into a first-tier university,

234
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
Dad promises you.

235
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,280
That's enough.

236
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,810
Try this,

237
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,920
are the shrimp overcooked?

238
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,880
Thank you, Mom.

239
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,040
Try this,

240
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,080
and this dish too,

241
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,680
they're all your favorites.

242
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,380
Mom must have made these especially for you.

243
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,240
Even all these dishes can't keep your mouth shut.

244
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:27,640
Eat up.

245
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,980
I think this is delicious too.

246
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,120
This soup looks particularly tasty.

247
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,200
Why isn't he online yet?

248
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,090
Let me ask again.

249
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,200
Please interact.

250
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,240
Any experts here who understand time-space calls?

251
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,960
I came across a post about time-space calls this morning,

252
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,020
really got into it,

253
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,240
but when I just checked, it was already deleted,

254
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,840
so I'm starting a new thread,

255
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,640
anyone else interested in discussing this topic?

256
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:03,280
You should find some time

257
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,840
to visit Zhenzhen's school,

258
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,000
at least meet with her homeroom teacher.

259
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,800
Why do I need to meet the teacher?

260
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,040
Aren't you going to talk to her teacher

261
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,000
and show some concern about An Zhenzhen's studies?

262
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,120
Can't you just go?

263
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,690
Why does it have to be me?

264
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,760
An Jianhua!

265
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,760
Zhenzhen's education,

266
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,080
you really don't care at all!

267
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,580
Could you keep it down?

268
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,960
I really had a nightmare.

269
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,760
Nice!

270
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,920
Good morning, Dad.

271
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,180
You're not sleeping in today?

272
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,720
Dunk it!

273
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:57,880
Dad?

274
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,380
What are you watching?

275
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,660
NBA All-Star Game.

276
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,060
Let me tell you,

277
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,920
Kobe just broke his nose.

278
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,490
Awesome!

279
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,320
He is pretty handsome.

280
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,280
But I have a feeling

281
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,740
he's about to get injured.

282
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,280
What nonsense are you talking?

283
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,080
Don't you know

284
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,740
your dad is a huge Kobe fan?

285
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,680
In that last play,

286
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,580
Kobe's nose was broken in a collision with Wade.

287
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,200
Stop watching that

288
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,600
and get ready for school.

289
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,360
It's raining today,

290
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,320
so you take her to school.

291
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,640
Mom,

292
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,400
don't go.

293
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,360
Take me together.

294
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,880
I want both of you to take me, Mom.

295
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:35,440
Let's go, Dad.

296
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:35,900
Come on.

297
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,080
Stop watching that.

298
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,320
Let's go.

299
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
Take me together.

300
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:05,960
Have your breakfast

301
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,819
while it's hot,

302
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,800
just made.

303
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,220
All packed.

304
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,960
Wait a moment,

305
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,760
take this umbrella.

306
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,160
Okay.

307
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
The forecast says it's going to rain today.

308
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,359
I'm off then, Auntie.

309
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,520
Don't work too hard.

310
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,319
Take it slow.

311
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,120
Dad.

312
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,040
Just stop at that intersection ahead,

313
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,240
I can walk from there.

314
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,400
You're walking by yourself?

315
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,640
Don't buy any snacks.

316
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,000
I won't,

317
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,920
absolutely not.

318
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,520
I had a big breakfast.

319
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:09,960
Lao Jiang.

320
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,320
Is that you?

321
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,000
Are you still there?

322
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,720
Yes, it's me.

323
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,580
I'm still here.

324
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,520
About what I told you last time,

325
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,560
did it come true?

326
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,760
Yes, it did.

327
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,020
Everything came true.

328
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,440
So,

329
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,200
in your timeline,

330
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,730
these things happened too?

331
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,680
How do you remember it so clearly?

332
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,140
The principal getting hit

333
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,080
is something you remember for life.

334
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,890
An Zhenzhen,

335
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,690
listen to me.

336
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,180
I can't communicate with myself,

337
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,620
there's something

338
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,000
I need your help with.

339
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,360
I got scammed

340
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,970
publishing my book.

341
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm hiding everywhere,

342
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,840
I'm really desperate.

343
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,520
But we're

344
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,200
not even in the same timeline.

345
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,280
I can't help you.

346
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,490
I've thought of a solution.

347
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:51,900
What about you?

348
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,120
I want my 2012 self

349
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,540
to buy a lottery ticket

350
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,760
and deposit it in his own bank account.

351
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,560
With that money,

352
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,680
I can solve my urgent problem.

353
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,560
Don't worry,

354
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,160
from the lottery winnings,

355
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,720
I only need enough to pay my debts.

356
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,280
The rest is all yours.

357
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,960
I just need one chance to change my life.

358
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,280
Okay.

359
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,050
However,

360
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,160
there's something

361
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,880
I'd like you to help me with too.

362
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,340
Tell me,

363
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,680
if I can do it,

364
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,340
I definitely will.

365
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,920
Could you

366
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:22,960
check on

367
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,760
what my future self is doing?

368
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,720
Am I happy?

369
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,580
Do I have money?

370
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,520
Most importantly,

371
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,920
how are my parents doing?

372
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,600
I promise you.

373
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,660
Remember this number.

374
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,960
Wait a second.

375
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:40,960
Go ahead.

376
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:46,920
Got it?

377
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:47,960
Yes, I got it.

378
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,640
Tomorrow,

379
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,000
make sure Jiangling buys this lottery ticket.

380
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,480
Also,

381
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,960
I've noticed that on my end,

382
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,640
when there's thunder or rain,

383
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,800
that's the only time I can call you.

384
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,480
It's

385
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,920
thundering here too.

386
00:19:59,280 --> 00:19:59,880
So,

387
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,170
maybe we need thunder on both sides

388
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,000
to make these calls work.

389
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,160
Not necessarily.

390
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,160
I'm still

391
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,480
figuring out the details.

392
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,200
For now,

393
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,120
I only know

394
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,880
it's related to thunderstorms.

395
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,640
By the way,

396
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,280
about what you told me,

397
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,080
there's a major problem.

398
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,960
Jiangling is way too aloof these days.

399
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,840
Getting him to listen to me and buy a lottery ticket

400
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,300
seems almost impossible.

401
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,660
Listen carefully.

402
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,960
Back then, I

403
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,560
had one major weakness.

404
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,160
Students,

405
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,480
that's all for today's class,

406
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,160
class dismissed.

407
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:00,690
Stand up.

408
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,160
Goodbye, teacher.

409
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,880
Goodbye, teacher.

410
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,840
Actually,

411
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,440
I have a special hobby.

412
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,020
I love eating noodles.

413
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,240
There's a noodle shop on Hongzhuan Road,

414
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,000
about 2 kilometers from school.

415
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,730
After class, hurry there to get a bowl of noodles.

416
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,680
It's so crowded.

417
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,090
How long will I have to wait in line?

418
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,040
Our city

419
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,840
has noodle shops everywhere,

420
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,800
but only the one on Hongzhuan Road uses the most chili.

421
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,930
The noodles have the perfect texture.

422
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,120
Back then,

423
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,170
I used to eat there all the time.

424
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,840
Great!

425
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,570
It's my turn.

426
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,240
Excuse me,

427
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,800
can I get one order of noodles to go?

428
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,560
Sorry, student,

429
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,720
we're out of noodles.

430
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,360
Come back in the evening if you want some.

431
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,000
Sorry,

432
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,680
we're sold out.

433
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,720
This tastes awful,

434
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,530
no flavor at all. How come you couldn't get it?

435
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,650
Couldn't get it?

436
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,720
How could I not get it?

437
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,000
How is that even possible?

438
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,480
I clearly waited in line,

439
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,340
why was it gone when it was my turn?

440
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,280
Where have you been?

441
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,000
You're not even eating.

442
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:20,720
Yeah.

443
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,160
Excuse me.

444
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,360
Coming through.

445
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,600
Sorry.

446
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,080
Make way, please.

447
00:22:59,080 --> 00:22:59,940
Let me through.

448
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,240
Great!

449
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,520
Why doesn't he ever talk?

450
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,280
Right?

451
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,840
He's so aloof.

452
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,640
Jiang.

453
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:18,640
Good evening.

454
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,320
Let me treat you to some noodles.

455
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,440
Well, you see,

456
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,000
I've been reading the stars,

457
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,720
and I think you'd

458
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,050
really enjoy the noodles from this place.

459
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,440
Not that hungry, huh?

460
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,380
No worries.

461
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,080
I'll just leave these noodles here.

462
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,410
Eat when you're hungry.

463
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,300
What are you doing?

464
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,340
I'll eat it.

465
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,160
I'm eating it.

466
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,720
Why?

467
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,920
Did I buy the wrong one?

468
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,280
Keep your voice down while eating noodles.

469
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,640
That doesn't make sense.

470
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,000
I got it.

471
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,480
Why is this place so crowded too?

472
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,960
Jiang,

473
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,160
this time I bought

474
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,960
your favorite brand for sure.

475
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,500
How did you get one?

476
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,400
I've been waiting in line forever,

477
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,060
and I didn't even see you here.

478
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,240
Did you?

479
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,280
Why are you eating noodles again?

480
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,460
Won't you get heartburn from eating so much?

481
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,660
Jiangling,

482
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,770
you eat noodles from this shop too?

483
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,680
Did you two go buy them together?

484
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:37,720
Class monitor,

485
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,160
you've been studying hard,

486
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,720
I bought these noodles for you.

487
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,320
Keep it up!

488
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,040
Monitor, she's trying to study,

489
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,120
don't you think

490
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,320
this is distracting?

491
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,640
I should study too.

492
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,300
Go ahead and study.

493
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,440
I've never seen

494
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,560
such a difficult man to please.

495
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,240
Have you heard about

496
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,760
the Mayan doomsday prophecy recently?

497
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,640
I know,

498
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,160
if only it happened before the college entrance exam.

499
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,720
I really don't want to take that exam.

500
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,920
Me neither.

501
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,520
Let me tell you something,

502
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,120
about this Mayan prophecy,

503
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,720
I have a new understanding.

504
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,080
Something happened to me recently,

505
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,810
something really terrifying.

506
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,970
Let me tell you guys.

507
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,160
Quick, look!

508
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,820
That person

509
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,920
just announced their relationship.

510
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,320
Who's that woman next to him?

511
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,000
That's absolutely impossible.

512
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,080
Just accept reality,

513
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,960
this must be photoshopped.

514
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,280
The photos are already out there.

515
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,080
This is photoshopped.

516
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,610
The faces don't even match.

517
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,220
Could this be the end of the world?

518
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:30,840
Lao Jiang.

519
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,280
I'm not trying to criticize you,

520
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,080
but do you really know yourself?

521
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,320
These past few days,

522
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,650
I've done everything exactly as you said.

523
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,080
You haven't shown me the slightest bit of kindness.

524
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,760
No wonder he loves noodles so much,

525
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,890
his face has become as flat as a noodle.

526
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,360
Well,

527
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
if it really doesn't work...

528
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,360
There's another way.

529
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,320
What way?

530
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,040
There's a bookstore on Wanhong Road,

531
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,370
go there and find a book.

532
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,560
This chapter is about

533
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,120
Zhuge Liang capturing Meng Huo seven times.

534
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,000
Why do you look so familiar?

535
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,530
Have I captured you before?

536
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,360
I just have a common face.

537
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:48,640
A common face.

538
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,850
Where are you going so late?

539
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,930
Moon-watching.

540
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,880
So you're lifting your head to gaze at the moon.

541
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
And lowering it to think of home.

542
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,960
Nice comeback.

543
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,810
Get back inside.

544
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,120
I'm going to find your dorm supervisor.

545
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,680
Working as a team, huh?

546
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,400
So you're using the Thirty-Six Stratagems against me,

547
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,800
making a feint to the east and attacking in the west?

548
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,440
I'm looking for your dorm supervisor.

549
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,300
She might get away, but you won't.

550
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,120
Boss.

551
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,120
Do you have a copy of Ulysses

552
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,760
by James

553
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,440
something edition

554
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,080
here?

555
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,640
I think there's some in the back,

556
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,840
go look for yourself.

557
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,440
Okay.

558
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,530
Thank you, boss.

559
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,360
I'll go check.

560
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,320
Hurry up!

561
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,380
We're closing now.

562
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,960
Foreign literature,

563
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,680
where are you?

564
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,360
Foreign literature.

565
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,400
None of these.

566
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,360
Not here either.

567
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,600
This isn't it.

568
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:06,720
Dust,

569
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,620
Resurrection,

570
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,240
Foreign Literature.

571
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,540
The Hunchback of Notre-Dame.

572
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,290
Wuthering Heights.

573
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,320
Where on earth is the boss?

574
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,720
I've looked everywhere.

575
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,920
Try looking in the back,

576
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,980
all the way inside.

577
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,760
The very back.

578
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,040
Even further inside.

579
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,640
Let me see.

580
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,480
Why are there so many books?

581
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
Ulysses.

582
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,850
You're not only difficult to understand,

583
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,720
you're also hard to find.

584
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,280
Ulysses.

585
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,720
Do you like it?

586
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,400
Jiang.

587
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,400
These two copies of Ulysses

588
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,800
are my prized possessions.

589
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,440
I dare say

590
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,240
in the entire city,

591
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,840
I'm the only one who has them.

592
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,260
They're yours.

593
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,530
How much?

594
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,880
I don't want money.

595
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,920
I view money as worthless trash.

596
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:54,920
Actually,

597
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,060
I just want to be friends with you.

598
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,560
Look,

599
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,480
I've been so nice

600
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,640
to you these past few days.

601
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,400
I brought you the noodles you like.

602
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,840
I gave you books you enjoy reading.

603
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,960
Can't you see

604
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,280
my sincere desire to be your friend?

605
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,330
I've calculated

606
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,460
and this amount is exactly right.

607
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,000
I really just want to be friends with you,

608
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,840
nothing more.

609
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,200
Take it.

610
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,170
Then we're friends.

611
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,290
Let me treat you to noodles.

612
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,440
No need.

613
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,680
Let's go, friend.

614
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,000
Let me treat you to noodles.

615
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,560
Let's go.

616
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,640
Come.

617
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,100
Xiao Jiang.

618
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,260
You brought a new friend for noodles.

619
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,000
Hey there.

620
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,330
You two know each other?

621
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,280
We've known each other for years.

622
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,340
Our Xiao Jiang here

623
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,120
is so helpful

624
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,180
and kind-hearted.

625
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,640
You should make more good friends like him.

626
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,560
Go back to work.

627
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,480
Take your time eating,

628
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,880
I need to get back to work.

629
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,560
Helpful and kind-hearted.

630
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,400
This uncle has quite a sense of humor.

631
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,760
When the security guard came to chase us away,

632
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,690
I helped him out.

633
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,120
You're different

634
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,840
from what I imagined.

635
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,440
I can't believe you like reading that type of novels.

636
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,680
Aren't all you guys supposed to

637
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,740
read things like Soul Land and stuff?

638
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,580
What I read is literature.

639
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,640
If you love literature so much,

640
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,640
why didn't you choose liberal arts?

641
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,720
If I could tell my younger self

642
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,050
to buy a lottery ticket,

643
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,720
I'd only need one chance to change my life.

644
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,120
Actually,

645
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,060
it's like this.

646
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,970
I need your help.

647
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,860
Do you remember

648
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,090
that phone call I received yesterday?

649
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,240
What I'm about to tell you

650
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,570
might completely change your worldview.

651
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,080
Brace yourself.

652
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,320
That call

653
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,800
I received yesterday

654
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,400
was from your future self.

655
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,760
You like to eat noodles

656
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,840
and read that type of novels,

657
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,040
he told me all of this.

658
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,080
See for yourself.

659
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,280
This is the phone call you made to me

660
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,400
the day before you transferred schools.

661
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,000
Back then,

662
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,060
I didn't even have your phone number.

663
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,400
So,

664
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,120
what are you trying to do?

665
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,050
Your future self

666
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,080
got scammed,

667
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,679
really badly.

668
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,960
He asked me to take you to buy lottery tickets,

669
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,880
otherwise your future self

670
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,540
won't even dare to leave home.

671
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,380
Is that your only purpose?

672
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,600
My purpose is to help you.

673
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:49,760
So,

674
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,139
come with me to the lottery store.

675
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,520
Just come along.

676
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,200
I'll go after I finish eating.

677
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:58,880
Fine, eat then.
