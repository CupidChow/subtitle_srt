1
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,160
Sky.

2
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:41,640
Zhenzhen.

3
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,039
Why are you awake?

4
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,360
Go back to bed.

5
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,039
Zhenzhen,

6
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,920
come down for breakfast.

7
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,520
Zhenzhen,

8
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,320
food's ready.

9
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,579
Dad will take you to school later.

10
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,240
Sweetie.

11
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,370
Breakfast is ready,

12
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,480
and Dad will take you to school afterward.

13
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,040
When I went to your house that day,

14
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,280
I only saw your mom

15
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,360
twice,

16
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,440
but never your dad.

17
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,520
What are you standing there for?

18
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,490
It's time to eat.

19
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,600
It's raining quite heavily.

20
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,800
Zhenzhen.

21
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,080
Have you decided where to apply?

22
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,560
Anywhere is fine,

23
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,740
as long as it's not at home.

24
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,640
Zhenzhen.

25
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,570
Don't you want to be with your parents?

26
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,080
How did you know it's raining here?

27
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,880
I didn't know.

28
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,480
But right now I really

29
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,810
want to know something.

30
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,410
Go ahead.

31
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:11,500
Have you met Qi Shuo's sister, Qi Yan?

32
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,320
Is she

33
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,400
married?

34
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,399
Qi Shuo's sister,

35
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:17,839
Qi Yan, right?

36
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,690
Didn't I tell you last time?

37
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,360
I followed Qi Shuo for a while,

38
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,690
went to a kindergarten,

39
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,000
and picked up a

40
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:26,880
child.

41
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,680
That child

42
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,040
called him uncle.

43
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,120
I see.

44
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,000
They're married.

45
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,760
And they have a child.

46
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,580
Who's married?

47
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,720
Whose child?

48
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,700
How is Zhenzhen doing?

49
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,680
How would I know?

50
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,120
She's your daughter

51
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,450
and you don't even care.

52
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,780
Why don't we

53
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,720
just tell her?

54
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,840
You tell her.

55
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,480
I'm tired of pretending.

56
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,380
Let's keep it secret a little longer.

57
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,100
A little more time won't hurt.

58
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,320
Aren't you going to answer that?

59
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,700
Jiangling,

60
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,160
can you come out for a moment?

61
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,220
I need to talk to you about something.

62
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,680
Those shoes weren't from my dad,

63
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,140
they were from that woman.

64
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,040
The necklace was for her too.

65
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,100
The woman who's with my dad

66
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,159
is Qi Yan.

67
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,200
Qi Shuo's sister.

68
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,100
She's my dad's colleague.

69
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,720
I suspect

70
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,850
they've been having an affair for a while.

71
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,800
Do you have any evidence?

72
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,880
Evidence?

73
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,900
Jiang Ling.

74
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,460
Could you help me with something?

75
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,940
I want to confirm something with my own eyes.

76
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,800
You know what?

77
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,330
This restaurant

78
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,530
is our family's favorite place to eat.

79
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,480
Have a nice weekend.

80
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,240
Don't get it on your clothes.

81
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,880
Thank you.

82
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,880
I'm so jealous that you can handle spicy food.

83
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,120
I improved my physics score by 10 points again.

84
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:48,920
Applause!

85
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,340
My dad can't handle spicy food at all.

86
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,000
But since

87
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,410
my mom and I love spicy food,

88
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,000
so

89
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,180
our family of three comes here often.

90
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,800
There was a period

91
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,860
when we would come here several times

92
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,500
just for one particular dish.

93
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,250
Sitting in this exact spot.

94
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,180
Just like this.

95
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,210
Are you okay?

96
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:45,840
Why?

97
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,120
Why?

98
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,050
It wasn't supposed to be like this!

99
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,640
Why

100
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,700
is this happening?

101
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,120
Why is nothing like I imagined?

102
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,640
Why has

103
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,400
everything changed?

104
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,680
I only have myself,

105
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,280
I have no one else anymore.

106
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,660
It's getting late,

107
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,200
let's go home.

108
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,480
Feng C·31A24.

109
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:37,840
Get in.

110
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,320
Come on.

111
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,650
Where have you two been?

112
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,480
Jiang Ling, An Zhenzhen.

113
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,240
You don't need to attend evening study today,

114
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
come to my office.

115
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,280
Do you know why I called you here?

116
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,600
No idea.

117
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,200
I've recently heard

118
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,960
some things about you and An Zhenzhen,

119
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,000
and I had to call

120
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,330
both of you in for a talk.

121
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,900
That's enough.

122
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,240
Go back and write a self-criticism,

123
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,690
and send An Zhenzhen in.

124
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,650
Go ahead.

125
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,180
Are you two in a premature relationship?

126
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,440
No.

127
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,480
Whether you are or not,

128
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,280
do you realize how much impact

129
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,210
this kind of thing has on the class?

130
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,880
What will the students who study hard

131
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,280
think when they see this?

132
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,360
Don't think that just because graduation is near,

133
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,200
you should 'seize the last moments of youth'

134
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:55,720
or follow some trend

135
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,250
by having a campus romance.

136
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,200
Do you know what time it is now?

137
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,360
Can't you understand what's important?

138
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,120
An Zhenzhen,

139
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
how many times have you been

140
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,120
called to my office recently?

141
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,120
Have you counted?

142
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,960
Is talking to you now

143
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,160
completely useless?

144
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,020
Do I have to call your parents?

145
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,400
Teacher.

146
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,240
I really didn't do anything.

147
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,640
All right.

148
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,940
Don't let me hear about this kind of thing again.

149
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,290
Focus all your attention on your studies.

150
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,540
Did you hear me?

151
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:29,720
An Zhenzhen,

152
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,600
can you hear me?

153
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,440
Go back and review your lessons.

154
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,560
No, just you.

155
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,000
What does this have to do with me?

156
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,460
Because you have big eyes.

157
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:19,920
That's right.

158
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:21,760
Yes.

159
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,760
Next time we have tomato and egg stir-fry,

160
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,600
I won't even tell you.

161
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,080
Come out

162
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,410
I need to talk to you.

163
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,560
What's wrong?

164
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,300
What's the matter?

165
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,080
Zhenzhen,

166
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,260
what's wrong with you?

167
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,000
Qi Shuo.

168
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,120
Are we friends?

169
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,560
Of course.

170
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,200
Then let me ask you something,

171
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,060
and I want you to tell me the truth.

172
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,610
Go ahead and ask.

173
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,040
Does your sister

174
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,040
have a boyfriend?

175
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,360
My sister

176
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,290
mentioned something about it.

177
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,080
Have you met that guy?

178
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,000
No.

179
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,720
Okay.

180
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,200
Well, let me tell you,

181
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,280
that man is my father.

182
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,450
That's impossible!

183
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,420
Zhenzhen, don't joke about this.

184
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,400
Joke?

185
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,360
I wish I was joking.

186
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,600
Was I not clear enough?

187
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,380
Your sister

188
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,580
is breaking up someone's family.

189
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,400
Your sister is the other woman,

190
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,119
a homewrecker.

191
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,740
Do you understand?

192
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,980
This is so intense.

193
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,859
So Qi Shuo's sister is a mistress.

194
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,890
What are you looking at?

195
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,010
An Zhenzhen,

196
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,599
what proof do you have to slander my sister?

197
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,680
My sister isn't that kind of person.

198
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,800
Slander your sister?

199
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,480
I saw with my own eyes

200
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,200
your sister

201
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,930
and my father

202
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,360
sitting in our family's

203
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,420
favorite restaurant having dinner,

204
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,640
chatting and laughing,

205
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,880
having a great time.

206
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,400
Do you know how that made me feel?

207
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,120
You have no idea.

208
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:43,840
Qi Shuo.

209
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,280
You're my best friend,

210
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,000
you're my best friend!

211
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,440
Go back and

212
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,600
tell your sister

213
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,960
to stay away from my dad,

214
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,640
stay away from our family.

215
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,520
Zhenzhen.

216
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,160
What's wrong?

217
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,090
Where's Qi Shuo?

218
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,360
Where did he run off to again?

219
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,960
Zhuge Liang.

220
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,080
Seven captures.

221
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,880
That's Guan Yu crossing five passes and slaying six generals.

222
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,600
Get back here!

223
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,000
Which class are you from?

224
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,320
Say something.

225
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,240
Who said that?

226
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,120
No, don't worry about it.

227
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,520
Who told you?

228
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,000
Tell me if it's true.

229
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,360
I'm a colleague of An Zhenzhen's father.

230
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,080
Not the kind of relationship you're suggesting.

231
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,810
Colleagues?

232
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,930
Then who's your boyfriend now?

233
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,320
I already told you.

234
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:57,880
I told you.

235
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,800
After the college entrance exam is over,

236
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,920
I'll let you meet him.

237
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,380
I'll definitely arrange for you to meet him.

238
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,000
Now is not the right time.

239
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
Who exactly told you that?

240
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,250
An Zhenzhen.

241
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,280
Qi Shuo.

242
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,200
Look at me.

243
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,560
Look at me.

244
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
Trust me.

245
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,290
I'm absolutely not a homewrecker.

246
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,360
Please believe me, okay?

247
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,080
After your college entrance exam is over,

248
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,880
I'll arrange for you two to meet,

249
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,600
and then you'll understand everything,

250
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,080
okay?

251
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,920
I'm sorry.

252
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,040
It's my fault,

253
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,200
I've been too busy with work.

254
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,620
I've been neglecting you.

255
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,840
I'm sorry.

256
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,320
I...

257
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,280
That's not what I meant.

258
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,720
I definitely

259
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,600
know that

260
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,370
you're the best person to me in this world.

261
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,570
I'll definitely work hard.

262
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,240
I'll

263
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,080
definitely work hard.

264
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,560
I won't be a burden to you.

265
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,970
I'll never let anyone bully you again.

266
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,280
Who said you're a burden?

267
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,320
Just trust me,

268
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,420
that's all.

269
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,240
I was too impulsive just now,

270
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,490
I made things worse.

271
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,920
The holiday is coming soon,

272
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,200
there's a music festival nearby.

273
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,760
Really?

274
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,770
Let's go together then.

275
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Jiang is back.

276
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,500
Have you eaten?

277
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:54,760
Yes.

278
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,640
Wait.

279
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,880
Your dad sent money.

280
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,640
Did he say

281
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,420
when he's coming back?

282
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,680
He'll definitely come back

283
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:10,880
for Chinese New Year.

284
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,080
Not even for the college entrance exam?

285
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,940
You should ask him yourself then.

286
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:25,420
Brother Qi,

287
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,620
aren't you at work?

288
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,320
I just got off my shift.

289
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,560
What brings you here today?

290
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,480
Well...

291
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,000
How's your story coming along?

292
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,640
I'm still waiting for my character.

293
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,880
I'm stuck right now,

294
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,040
so I came to see you

295
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,640
to chat

296
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,290
and find some inspiration.

297
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,560
Have a seat.

298
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,490
Please sit down.

299
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,560
About our dream,

300
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,760
I'll definitely tell you everything I know,

301
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,720
whatever you ask,

302
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,450
I'll answer.

303
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,400
So do you know

304
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,840
An Zhenzhen's

305
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,760
father?

306
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:07,650
What for?

307
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:08,440
Sit down.

308
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,440
Come back and sit.

309
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,120
What's the matter?

310
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:11,720
I just need

311
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,360
to learn about the female lead's

312
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,490
family background.

313
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,260
How else can I write the story?

314
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,400
Just

315
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,000
Just write him

316
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,530
as a jerk and you'll be fine.

317
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,080
A jerk,

318
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,610
you know?

319
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,770
There's a story?

320
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,330
What's there to talk about?

321
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,420
Because of him,

322
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,120
my sister was

323
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,050
the subject of gossip everywhere.

324
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,080
You mean?

325
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,690
They were together.

326
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,160
Let me tell you,

327
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,600
during those years,

328
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,880
my sister never had a single good day.

329
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,480
I don't know what my sister was thinking.

330
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,680
I'm just speechless.

331
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,340
It is pretty frustrating.

332
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,970
I have an announcement.

333
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,400
During tomorrow's morning study session,

334
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,120
those who ordered milk

335
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,380
need to bring 260 yuan.

336
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,480
But I...

337
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,120
Didn't we just pay

338
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,240
20,000 yuan last month?

339
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,360
How did it run out so quickly?

340
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,250
Okay, I understand.

341
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,920
I'll find a way to pay it as soon as possible.

342
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:14,920
Fifteen.

343
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,320
Fifteen.

344
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
Fifteen-twenty.

345
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,480
Fifteen-twenty.

346
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,000
No,

347
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,120
fifteen-twenty.

348
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:21,680
Fifteen-twenty.

349
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:21,920
Twenty.

350
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,520
Fifteen,

351
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,720
I lost.

352
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,880
Come on.

353
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,400
We've barely started the first round,

354
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:31,800
what?

355
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:33,800
Whatever.

356
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,960
Fifteen-twenty.

357
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,200
Fifteen-twenty,

358
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,840
fifteen.

359
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,480
Fifteen-twenty,

360
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,040
twenty.
