1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,240
Time: 8:30-11:00

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,160
Day

3
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,640
Zhenzhen

4
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,480
Wake up!

5
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,040
The exam is about to start.

6
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,400
What a strange dream.

7
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,840
Day

8
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,680
An Zhenzhen,

9
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,800
can you hear me?

10
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,480
15 minutes left for the exam.

11
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,560
The exam is almost over.

12
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,120
Remember to check your answer sheets

13
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,180
and don't forget to write your names.

14
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,060
You're Jiangling, right?

15
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,760
Yes,

16
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,210
hello, teacher.

17
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,850
I'm Jiangling's guardian.

18
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,680
My name is Liu.

19
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,840
I'm their English teacher

20
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,100
and homeroom teacher.

21
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,800
He can start school tomorrow.

22
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,890
Alright,

23
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,530
thank you, Teacher Liu.

24
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:03,600
This child

25
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,920
doesn't talk much,

26
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,800
so please

27
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,000
take good care of him.

28
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,160
Don't worry,

29
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,120
he's now

30
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,400
officially a student in our Senior Class 3.

31
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,000
Thank you.

32
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,400
Zhenzhen.

33
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:33,880
Qiuqiu.

34
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,320
I need to tell you about

35
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,040
something really terrifying.

36
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,440
Just now in the exam room,

37
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,300
I think I had a hallucination.

38
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,480
When I looked up,

39
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,640
I found the classroom

40
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,700
completely empty.

41
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,180
Then I looked up again,

42
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,920
and Liu Yaru was at the podium

43
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,290
staring at me like this.

44
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,610
That's terrifying.

45
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,760
It really

46
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,040
is a bit scary.

47
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,760
But I think

48
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,720
that you

49
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,680
might have gotten confused while answering questions.

50
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,210
Why are you acting so weird?

51
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,560
Hey guys,

52
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,840
what time are we leaving?

53
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,520
Bro,

54
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,360
you're already repeating the year,

55
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,960
why bother with all this effort?

56
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,600
What's wrong with me?

57
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,660
Qianqian, what are you trying to say?

58
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,200
I wish you were mute.

59
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,410
What do you mean?

60
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,360
I don't think you'll have any luck next year either.

61
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,240
Stop.

62
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,200
I think

63
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,240
there's no time like the present.

64
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,240
Let's leave right now,

65
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,100
what do you say?

66
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,240
Let's go.

67
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,840
Come on.

68
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,940
Class monitor.

69
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
We're going to the wishing tree,

70
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,140
want to join us?

71
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,240
Instead of wasting your time

72
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,200
like this,

73
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,810
you should be doing more practice papers.

74
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,480
Yes, class monitor.

75
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,810
See you, class monitor.

76
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,040
Let's go.

77
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,570
Let's go.

78
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,520
Qi Shuo, you're here again.

79
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,400
That's enough.

80
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,000
Don't run.

81
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,920
We're here.

82
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,370
It's beautiful.

83
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,690
Let's begin.

84
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,370
Let's start.

85
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,040
I've made my wish.

86
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,880
What about you guys?

87
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:14,740
I've made mine.

88
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,480
Let's each share

89
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,320
our wishes.

90
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:18,920
Sure.

91
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,240
If you tell your wish,

92
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,300
it won't come true.

93
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
What's so shameful about your wish?

94
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,380
I bet yours is the truly shameful one.

95
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,680
How about this.

96
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,480
I'll go first.

97
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,160
My wish is.

98
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,040
I hope

99
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,640
the Mayan prophecy fails,

100
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,400
that 2012

101
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,840
won't be the end of the world,

102
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,840
and that all living beings

103
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,570
can continue

104
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,760
to thrive.

105
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,600
World peace.

106
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,360
Zhenzhen,

107
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,800
after what you said,

108
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,200
what's left for Qianqian and me to wish for?

109
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,159
I'm not going for that abstract stuff.

110
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:45,920
I hope

111
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,780
I can marry into a good family,

112
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,520
someone rich,

113
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,159
who treats me well,

114
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:49,880
and handsome.

115
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,940
With long legs too.

116
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,409
Someone like Lee Min-ho would be perfect.

117
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,050
I must get into film school.

118
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,360
I want to be a great actor,

119
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,960
a big star.

120
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,640
The big star Qi Shuo.

121
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,520
Wait a second.

122
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,450
I just realized.

123
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,080
None of us seems to have wished

124
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,320
anything about the college entrance exam.

125
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,560
I'll add another wish.

126
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,080
I hope

127
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,240
we all get through the college entrance exam smoothly.

128
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,120
Good luck on the exam.

129
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,920
Good luck on the exam.

130
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,080
Good luck on the exam.

131
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,280
Good luck on the exam.

132
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,560
Do you think we'll

133
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,640
always be together in the future?

134
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,560
Of course,

135
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
we'll see each other every day.

136
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,640
Definitely.

137
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,840
No, that's not right.

138
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,500
The future.

139
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,900
I think you're all doing pretty well.

140
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,800
At least you know

141
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,200
what you want to do with your future.

142
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,760
I believe

143
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,810
I have considerable talent

144
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,000
in literature.

145
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,290
You want to be a poet?

146
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,570
What did you notice?

147
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,500
Do you know him?

148
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,400
He's handsome.

149
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,800
Is he coming toward me?

150
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,640
Thank you.

151
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,240
How did you

152
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,120
know my classmate?

153
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,050
Could you leave your phone number?

154
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,200
His name is also An Zhenzhen?

155
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:54,800
What do you think?

156
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,240
Do you think his name is really An Zhenzhen?

157
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,840
Why would he find my name tag?

158
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,080
Strange.

159
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,650
I remember I had some money.

160
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,440
Where is it?

161
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,960
It's not here.

162
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,200
This phone.

163
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,760
It's been three days, Lao Jiang.

164
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,650
You've been in debt for three days now.

165
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,600
Come out!

166
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:08,280
Don't hide in there silently.

167
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,040
I know you're home.

168
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,240
Let me tell you,

169
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,130
even if you hide at the ends of the earth...

170
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,480
I'll still

171
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,610
drag you out.

172
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
Editor,

173
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,120
you'll pay me next month, right?

174
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,880
Thank you, Editor.

175
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,260
That's exactly what I needed to hear.

176
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,040
Bye!

177
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,880
I knew you were home

178
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,480
hiding in there quietly.

179
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,480
Brother Xing,

180
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,400
they'll pay me next month,

181
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,400
did you hear that?

182
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,840
Is that so?

183
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:46,960
Guys,

184
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,580
hold up.

185
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
Boss Jiang says

186
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,250
he'll pay us next month.

187
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:52,330
Let's go.

188
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,160
You think I'm just some bit player?

189
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,160
You think this is my first time collecting debts?

190
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,200
Brother Xing,

191
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,320
I really finished the call.

192
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,440
Try making another call.

193
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,040
Ask again.

194
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,120
Make the call.

195
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,160
I'll call right away.

196
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,240
Found it.

197
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,300
My phone is too old.

198
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,500
Editor-in-chief.

199
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,120
Thank you so much.

200
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,000
I...

201
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,960
That voice.

202
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,600
Listen,

203
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,060
don't worry about who I am,

204
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,080
I've got your friend.

205
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,520
If you want him safe,

206
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,440
transfer the money to me.

207
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,400
Zhenzhen,

208
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,800
you owe money.

209
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,960
Do you think that's possible?

210
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,690
How could I possibly owe money?

211
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,520
Let me tell you,

212
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,640
he can't escape,

213
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,760
if you don't transfer the money,

214
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,160
you can't escape either.

215
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,680
Phone scam.

216
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,080
Let me.

217
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,080
I'll give it a try.

218
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,520
Hello.

219
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,800
Brother

220
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,320
we meet again.

221
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,200
I love you.

222
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,720
What is this?

223
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,120
Which country is it from?

224
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,760
It might be his.

225
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,520
What?

226
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,240
My wife and daughter took it.

227
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,440
Let me do it.

228
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Hello.

229
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,560
Hello.

230
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,000
Sir.

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,120
Hurry up.

232
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,480
Come on.

233
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,360
Goodbye then.

234
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,600
Absolutely.

235
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,400
Thank you.

236
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,970
They hung up.

237
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,560
What did they say?

238
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,820
That's so strange.

239
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,780
Looks like it's going to rain.

240
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:06,650
Let's go.

241
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,330
Let's go.

242
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,520
I haven't brought in my clothes yet.

243
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,000
Let me tell you something,

244
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,240
I don't care if you're Korean

245
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,640
or wherever you're from,

246
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,520
if by next week

247
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,360
I don't see this money

248
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
and your family, you're in trouble.

249
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,370
That's impossible.

250
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,400
I saw this

251
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,720
incredibly handsome guy today.

252
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,320
He was

253
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,120
seriously drop-dead gorgeous.

254
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,850
Where was he?

255
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,040
At a place outside campus.

256
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,800
No way!

257
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,760
How handsome was he exactly?

258
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,720
Super handsome.

259
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,200
Qiuqiu,

260
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,320
don't you think

261
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,160
everything that happened today is really strange?

262
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,360
Like we're in a movie.

263
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,120
Strange?

264
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,560
Don't you think that guy

265
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,220
looks just like a Korean idol?

266
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,280
My soulmate has finally appeared.

267
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,000
My wish has finally come true.

268
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,480
What soulmate?

269
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,160
Focus on today's exam instead.

270
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,400
He's really handsome.

271
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,160
Mainly because

272
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,720
his proportions are absolutely perfect.

273
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,850
You're still thinking about that guy?

274
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,640
Forget it.

275
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,600
I feel like I completely bombed the exam today.

276
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,360
I think I did too.

277
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,320
The math today was incredibly difficult.

278
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,360
The multiple choice was okay,

279
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,080
but the long-form questions were insane.

280
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,360
The college entrance exam is coming soon.

281
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,960
Have you guys decided where you want to apply?

282
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,960
No, I haven't decided which school to apply to either.

283
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,880
Who are you anyway?

284
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,760
I've already told you,

285
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,120
I don't owe any money,

286
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,240
so stop calling me.

287
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,450
An Zhenzhen.

288
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,240
Room 410,

289
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,320
roll call!

290
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,960
Hurry up!

291
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,840
Song Jun.

292
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,600
Han Jin

293
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,890
Qiu Qian.

294
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,570
An Zhenzhen.

295
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:37,880
Clean up

296
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,080
and get ready for bed.

297
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,250
You haven't hung up.

298
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,760
Are you really An Zhenzhen?

299
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,200
No.

300
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,880
Before you call someone,

301
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,080
don't you even know who you're calling?

302
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,080
Just now,

303
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,250
who was calling you?

304
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,640
The dorm supervisor.

305
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
Are you a student?

306
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,560
Are you crazy?

307
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,280
I'm hanging up.

308
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,140
I'm Jiang Ling.

309
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,010
Don't you remember?

310
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:06,859
Jiang Ling?

311
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,079
What Jiang Ling?

312
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,240
I don't know you. Wrong number.

313
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,240
We were in high...

314
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,690
This is ridiculous.

315
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,800
Everyone,

316
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,130
I have an announcement,

317
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,240
we have a new transfer student joining our class today.

318
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:36,080
Starting today,

319
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,680
they'll officially become part of our family.

320
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,960
I hope you all

321
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,490
will look after each other.

322
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:43,440
Come in.

323
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,520
Please introduce yourself.

324
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,090
Look, look who's there.

325
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,220
I'm Jiang Ling.

326
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,300
I'm Jiang Ling.

327
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,250
Don't you remember?

328
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,240
Jiang Ling?

329
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,360
Who's Jiang Ling?

330
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,890
I don't know you. You've got the wrong number.

331
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,160
Everyone, please welcome our new classmate, Jiang Ling.

332
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,380
Jiang Ling.

333
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,100
Please take a seat at the back row over there.

334
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,960
We have four options.

335
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,160
This is an object clause introduced by 'if'.

336
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,520
What's that noise?

337
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,250
Who's there?

338
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,320
An Zhenzhen!

339
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,440
Are you playing with your phone again?

340
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,200
Bring your phone to me right now.

341
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,860
Didn't I put it on silent mode?

342
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,200
An Zhenzhen, can you hear me?

343
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,280
No,

344
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,290
Teacher Liu,

345
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,200
it's because...

346
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:35,800
Let me see,

347
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:36,960
not because

348
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,680
Still denying it,

349
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,240
someone gave me...

350
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,040
because what?

351
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,450
caught you again, didn't I?

352
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,530
I'm sorry, Teacher Liu.

353
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,010
Alright.

354
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,000
Let's continue with the problem.

355
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,800
If...

356
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,320
If the first sentence is in simple past tense,

357
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,440
then you can use any tense after it.

358
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,500
So if it's in the simple past tense...

359
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,200
Excuse me.

360
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,440
Seems like we have no connection.

361
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,800
How do I look today?

362
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,820
Beautiful.

363
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,160
Seems like we...

364
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,880
How's my makeup?

365
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,080
Qiu, let me talk to him first.

366
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:09,640
Do you know what you just did?

367
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:10,560
I think my lipstick seems

368
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
the shade doesn't quite match.

369
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,040
What do you think?

370
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
I think the color looks great.

371
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,100
Really beautiful.

372
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,170
Help me find my lipstick first.

373
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,200
Forget it.

374
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,930
Let's get the phone back first.

375
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,600
The phone.

376
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,160
You want your phone back, right?

377
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,680
Ms. Liu,

378
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,400
please give me one more chance.

379
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:42,860
I swear,

380
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,000
I promise

381
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,370
it absolutely won't happen again.

382
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,960
Do you think this matter

383
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,420
can be resolved so easily?

384
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,200
If I give it back to you today,

385
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,760
don't you think

386
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,320
you can just get it back the same way next time?

387
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,720
No, no.

388
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,440
I absolutely never thought that way,

389
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,720
there's a real reason this time.

390
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,880
It's all because of that damn...

391
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,240
What?

392
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:03,960
Nothing.

393
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:05,930
An Zhenzhen,

394
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,720
you've really disappointed me.

395
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,400
If you want your phone back, have your parents come get it.

396
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,800
This is non-negotiable.

397
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,930
Now go back to class.

398
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:24,960
I repent.

399
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,120
I repent.

400
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,920
Sports news,

401
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,320
Beijing time, February 24,

402
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,560
2012, early morning.

403
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,360
Why isn't that new student

404
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,720
coming for lunch?

405
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,880
Zhenzhen,

406
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,280
do you know where he went?

407
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,060
Of course I don't know.

408
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,720
If I knew, I would've caught him already.

409
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,960
You want to catch him?

410
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,480
Qiuqiu.

411
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,640
Do you know?

412
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,400
If it weren't for him.

413
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,130
Look at this.

414
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,640
Tomatoes with boiled eggs.

415
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,520
How funny.

416
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,020
The cafeteria food

417
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,880
is to ensure everyone gets proper nutrition.

418
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,600
Not allowing you to eat outside

419
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,840
is also for safety reasons.

420
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,770
Hurry up and eat,

421
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,260
then go back to study hall.

422
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,480
Yes, class monitor.

423
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,450
Is this even cooked?

424
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,160
It looks so unappetizing.

425
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,890
Look at that guy.

426
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,330
Here we go again.

427
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,240
The cafeteria food is so awful.

428
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,120
I really want some fried chicken cutlets from outside.

429
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,520
If only someone would buy me some right now.

430
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,400
Qianqian,

431
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,860
you're such a voice manipulator.

432
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,410
So annoying.

433
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,960
Can't even chase him away.

434
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,400
Our glasses guy here

435
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,740
really does whatever Qianqian says.

436
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:49,760
Qiuqiu.

437
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,680
Can I ask you guys something?

438
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,880
Could you all

439
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,560
help me get my phone back?

440
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,290
I wouldn't dare.

441
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,000
I don't think it'll work.

442
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,880
Last time with my phone,

443
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,010
they only gave it back when my dad came.

444
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:06,920
Besides.

445
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
I mean, your phone

446
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,680
is with the teacher.

447
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,320
How nice

448
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,520
and safe.

449
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,780
Is there really no room for negotiation?

450
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,840
None.

451
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,400
Fine.

452
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,120
But

453
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,280
when Liu Yaru confiscated my phone,

454
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,240
my screen was displaying

455
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,160
our chat from yesterday

456
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,480
where the three of us were on QQ

457
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,160
gossiping about her.

458
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,200
What?

459
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,600
Did you watch the NBA yesterday?

460
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,800
Kobe played amazingly.

461
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,480
Yes, I did.

462
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,520
The Twin Towers really dominated,

463
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,840
they completely crushed the Mavericks.

464
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,520
Nowitzki scored

465
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,450
25 points and grabbed 12 rebounds.

466
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,320
Why hasn't Liu Yaru come out to use the bathroom yet?

467
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,680
How would I know?

468
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,160
Here she comes!

469
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,520
She's coming out.

470
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:42,920
Yes.

471
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,640
Let's go.

472
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,420
What are you doing?

473
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,200
Just hurry up and go.

474
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,200
Zhenzhen.

475
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,480
Liu Yaru took your phone,

476
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,360
aren't you worried?

477
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,600
Of course I'm worried,

478
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,240
I'm nearly going crazy about it.

479
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,080
But there's nothing I can do,

480
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,120
she won't give it back to me.

481
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,000
Why is Teacher Liu so annoying?

482
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:26,920
Qiuqiu,

483
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,520
how can you say that?

484
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,360
Teacher Liu is a responsible and good teacher.

485
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,420
I was wrong about the phone incident.

486
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,320
So you feel the same way.

487
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,000
Actually, I didn't dare to say it,

488
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,400
I just went along with them complaining about the teacher.

489
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,360
They don't understand Teacher Liu at all.

490
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,840
Exactly.

491
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,920
She watches over us from morning study

492
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,840
to evening study without a break.

493
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,660
Did you know

494
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,080
she has a three-year-old son at home?

495
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,160
She can't even take care of him

496
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,880
and has to leave him with his grandmother.

497
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,920
Oh my goodness!

498
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,960
Teacher Liu is so dedicated

499
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,680
and wonderful.

500
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,370
Can we do something for her?

501
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,880
Let's buy her some flowers.

502
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,640
Carnations.

503
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,680
Roses.

504
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:07,890
Teacher Liu!

505
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,560
What are you two talking about?

506
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,440
We weren't saying anything.

507
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,300
Nothing at all.

508
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,960
No gossiping about teachers behind their backs,

509
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,690
understand?

510
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,840
Yes, we understand.

511
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,840
And class is about to start,

512
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,080
what are you two still hanging around here for?

513
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,810
Get back to your classroom now.

514
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,680
I actually think our plan

515
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,960
is definitely perfect,

516
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,480
Shuo will definitely get the phone,

517
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,560
but I'm just worried

518
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,960
if Liu Yaru discovers

519
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,240
the phone isn't in the drawer

520
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,040
and questions me,

521
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
what should I say?

522
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,080
Why do you have it?

523
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:57,980
Who are you?

524
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,040
Guess what,

525
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,120
do I have

526
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,730
the phone or not?

527
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,780
You definitely didn't get it.

528
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,820
Because Jiangling already gave the phone to me.

529
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,800
Probably feeling guilty about something.

530
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,330
Whose phone is this?

531
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:30,800
Brave.

532
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,320
Don't go!

533
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,760
Caught you red-handed!

534
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,900
And you still deny calling me.

535
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,080
How did you get my number?

536
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,610
I just want to ask you

537
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,360
why you're messing with me on the phone.

538
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,020
You're such a strange person,

539
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,290
one way on the phone,

540
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,800
completely different in person.

541
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,200
Split personality, huh?

542
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,160
You're crazy.

543
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,220
You're the one who's sick!

544
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Stop right there!

545
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,440
I just want you to explain why,

546
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,840
and after you explain,

547
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:49,840
I'll forgive you.

548
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,560
After all, we were classmates,

549
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,890
and I don't want to embarrass you too much.

550
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,610
An Zhenzhen.

551
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,370
An Zhenzhen.

552
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,920
Is that you?

553
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,410
An Zhenzhen.

554
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,080
An Zhenzhen,

555
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,940
can you hear me?

556
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,560
Listen.

557
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,840
Why is it your voice here?

558
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,040
Can't you hear me?

559
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,650
An Zhenzhen.

560
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,050
An Zhenzhen,

561
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,330
are you still there?

562
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,960
Don't hang up.

563
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,640
Zhenzhen.

564
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,220
How come you two are together?

565
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,400
An Zhenzhen,

566
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,980
I'm talking to you,

567
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,160
what's wrong?

568
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:26,920
Qiuqiu,

569
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,820
I'll tell you when we get back.

570
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,800
An Zhenzhen,

571
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,700
why can't I remember anything about you?

572
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:44,890
I only remember.

573
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
Solar storm.

574
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,000
Electromagnetic storm.

575
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,400
Communication across parallel timelines.

576
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,800
That's ridiculous.

577
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,720
Solar

578
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,020
and electromagnetic storms.

579
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,080
An Zhenzhen has been acting really strange lately.

580
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,540
She ignores me whenever Jiangling shows up.

581
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,560
Do you think she's choosing romance over friendship?

582
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,690
Is that strange?

583
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,680
Don't you do the same?

584
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,040
Are you asking for a beating?

585
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,170
There's definitely something going on between her and Jiangling.

586
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,290
Teacher.

587
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,000
I have an important question

588
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,920
I'd like to ask you.

589
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,780
Which problem?

590
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,320
Could you tell me about

591
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,640
parallel universe communication

592
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,880
and the butterfly effect?

593
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,680
What on earth?

594
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,040
I looked it up online.

595
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,520
The butterfly effect refers to

596
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,520
how in dynamic systems,

597
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,240
tiny changes in initial conditions

598
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,800
can affect the entire system,

599
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,320
leading to significant

600
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,320
long-term consequences.

601
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,850
It's a chaotic phenomenon.

602
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,360
In our reality,

603
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,000
could communication between parallel universes

604
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,530
create a butterfly effect?

605
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,760
So far, such examples

606
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,960
I've only seen in

607
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,640
mathematics.

608
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,720
Cotangent sequences.

609
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,520
But if we apply it

610
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,040
to the physical realm,

611
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,880
how would this butterfly effect manifest?

612
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,480
How does the butterfly effect actually appear?

613
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,400
Most importantly,

614
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,280
if we accidentally

615
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,680
alter its predetermined trajectory,

616
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,760
would it affect our reality?

617
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,490
An Zhenzhen.

618
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:58,680
As your teacher,

619
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,010
I'm glad you're so interested in physics.

620
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,920
But

621
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,130
I'm a high school physics teacher,

622
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,440
if I could understand this,

623
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,500
I wouldn't be here.

624
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,760
It looks like it's going to rain.

625
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,199
I wish I could live next door to you,

626
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,940
standing foolishly outside your house.

627
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,739
I'm Jiangling.

628
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,280
Jiangling from 2024.

629
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,199
Are you saying

630
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:52,320
that I'm

631
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:55,560
talking on the phone with Jiangling from 2024?

632
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,020
A call across time.

633
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,080
If you really are

634
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,200
An Zhenzhen from 2012.

635
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,730
Didn't humanity

636
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,580
get destroyed in 2012?

637
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,160
I think I understand what's happening now.

638
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,640
The person who appeared to you

639
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,040
is Jiangling from 2012.

640
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,440
He and I

641
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,530
are the same person.

642
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,040
But

643
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,400
I'm Jiangling from 2024.

644
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,280
Am I dreaming?

645
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:31,370
It's not a dream.

646
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,210
I can tell you everything that will happen in the future.

647
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,850
On September 30,

648
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,160
2012,

649
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:42,520
The Voice of China will broadcast its final competition,

650
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,380
and Liang Bo will be the champion.

651
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,360
In November.

652
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,420
What do you mean by The Voice of China?

653
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,640
Or is this

654
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,600
some kind of

655
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,120
reality show

656
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,480
prank program, right?

657
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:53,970
I forgot.

658
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,080
Over there

659
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,440
it's now the end of February.

660
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,240
Wait a moment,

661
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,460
let me check again.

662
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,760
The NBA All-Star Game

663
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,120
is about to start, right?

664
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,640
Kobe

665
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,320
will have his nose broken

666
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,260
by Wade during an offensive play.

667
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,520
I don't care about

668
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,320
any of this stuff

669
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,380
you're telling me.

670
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,320
If this isn't a dream,

671
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,840
then you're just a liar.

672
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,240
I just remembered something.

673
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,000
Over there,

674
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:17,880
that incident

675
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,090
should be happening very soon.

676
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:20,980
What incident?

677
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,160
This can't be possible.
