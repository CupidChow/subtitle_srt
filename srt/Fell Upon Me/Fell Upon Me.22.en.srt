1
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,140
Sky.

2
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,009
Come.

3
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,610
Easy now.

4
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,140
Hello, driver.

5
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,440
Please show me your driver's license and vehicle registration.

6
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,500
What are you doing?

7
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,960
I asked you to show your license and registration.

8
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,020
Driver's license.

9
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,450
Such a beautiful yet cruel story of youth.

10
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,760
It's truly moving.

11
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,920
This novel

12
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,960
is written in third person,

13
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,720
but I always feel like the author

14
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,250
is writing their own story.

15
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,760
Every word feels genuine and authentic.

16
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,290
It's beautifully written.

17
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,079
It's just that the ending

18
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,450
why does it have to be like this?

19
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,920
On the night of the full moon,

20
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,160
the apocalypse,

21
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,760
the clock turning backward,

22
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,360
white feathers not of birds.

23
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,000
Great writer!

24
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,320
Come in,

25
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,740
please have a seat.

26
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,420
I've been waiting for you.

27
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,920
You see,

28
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,200
I haven't dared to rush you lately, right?

29
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,280
Afraid of disturbing you.

30
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,840
So,

31
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,760
how's the writing going?

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,860
Is it finished?

33
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,810
No inspiration.

34
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,240
Those popular web novel tropes you mentioned,

35
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,420
I can't write them.

36
00:03:59,320 --> 00:03:59,840
I really want to

37
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,000
send someone

38
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,400
to watch over you 24 hours a day.

39
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,140
If the publishing house needs books,

40
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,600
why not accept this one?

41
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
Well, about that.

42
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,840
I've read this book.

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,529
The perspective is unique,

44
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,600
analyzing the psychology of high school senior girls

45
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,290
with remarkable accuracy.

46
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,760
This is

47
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,200
a very special novel.

48
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,240
It's her own personal story,

49
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,460
an autobiography,

50
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,840
of course it's profound.

51
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,320
But the problem is

52
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,280
today's readers

53
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,760
don't like these dark novels at all.

54
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:33,880
Big data,

55
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,840
big data,

56
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,490
you know what I mean.

57
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,960
These are all her own personal experiences.

58
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,490
Exactly.

59
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,290
Parents divorcing,

60
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,280
friends betraying her,

61
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,680
classmates manipulating her mentally.

62
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,720
Her later life

63
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,720
has been all about healing from her student days.

64
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,560
Why doesn't she add

65
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,960
a bit of

66
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,159
revenge

67
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,960
for that satisfying element?

68
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,960
She could write

69
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,800
a female revenge fantasy.

70
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,720
But she refuses.

71
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,560
Her ending

72
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,920
is about falling from a building...

73
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,800
How depressing is that?

74
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,840
Readers are already under so much pressure these days,

75
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,970
who would like this?

76
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,480
Perhaps writing

77
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,280
is a way for her to redeem her life.

78
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,400
If it gets rejected for reasons like these,

79
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,200
I think

80
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,940
it would be a shame.

81
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,520
After all, in our lives,

82
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,480
each of us will have

83
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,250
our own apocalypse.

84
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,409
Now that you mention it, I remember

85
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,600
she always said she was

86
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,480
mentally unstable.

87
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:37,800
Do you think she might

88
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,800
be alone at home and do something desperate

89
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,520
and...

90
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,409
She walked out of this building

91
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,820
and got hit by a car.

92
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,200
This novel

93
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,600
is good, but

94
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:51,520
the ending is too dark,

95
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,280
too much like a prophecy.

96
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,840
These fruits you brought

97
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,720
she probably can't eat them.

98
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,180
I've heard that

99
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,300
giving peaches

100
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,200
helps patients recover faster.

101
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,920
It might be superstitious,

102
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,780
but the meaning

103
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,090
is positive.

104
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,900
Are you her immediate family?

105
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,840
Not exactly.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,460
Doctor,

107
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,320
could you tell me

108
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,760
about her specific condition?

109
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,640
She suffered a severe impact

110
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,360
and may never wake up again.

111
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,520
Unless

112
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,120
she has a strong will to live.

113
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,880
Do you know if she has

114
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,720
any

115
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
medical history

116
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,170
from her daily life?

117
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,400
She's had

118
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,690
a difficult life since childhood.

119
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,880
Recently,

120
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,580
she's been taking antidepressants.

121
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,010
She's been in a coma for so long.

122
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,440
If her will to live is weak,

123
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,840
and she has no family visiting her

124
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
to give her some external strength,

125
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,500
She's hanging by a thread.

126
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,880
If she wakes up again,

127
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,850
it would truly be a miracle.

128
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,400
What if

129
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,159
I rewrite a better ending for her?

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What do you mean?

131
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,560
Didn't you just say

132
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,760
she needs some external stimuli

133
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,880
to wake up?

134
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,560
In theory, yes.

135
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,040
Our hospital's neurology department

136
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,520
and a research lab in Germany

137
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,080
have been researching this,

138
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,920
but we've analyzed

139
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,050
many patient cases.

140
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,680
I know

141
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,370
what I should do now.

142
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,380
Hey, great author,

143
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,800
how's the new book coming along?

144
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,840
I just got inspired and you call to rush me.

145
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
Don't you know what we writers

146
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,640
hate the most?

147
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,370
Alright.

148
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,120
When I finish writing,

149
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,960
I'll show it to you.

150
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,280
That's it then,

151
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,210
hanging up. Bye.

152
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,680
No matter how far you run,

153
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,760
I will

154
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:21,840
drag you out.

155
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,440
An Zhenzhen walks alone on the street,

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,240
against the flow of people,

157
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,440
her expression numb,

158
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,800
as if her soul has been taken away.

159
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,400
All around her are scenes

160
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,460
filled with happiness and the warmth of everyday life.

161
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,440
A family of three

162
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,160
happily eating at a street food stall.

163
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,920
A couple

164
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,840
embracing each other lovingly.

165
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,160
She walks to the city's only clock tower

166
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,420
and stands there, watching time pass by.

167
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,720
She thinks of her once close friends

168
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,570
who have now become strangers.

169
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,920
Then she remembers

170
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,760
her family that was once inseparable,

171
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,880
now left with nothing but deception and lies.

172
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,480
Her heart was torn to pieces.

173
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,660
She raised her hand

174
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,840
toward the towering clock tower,

175
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,720
trying to twist the hands of time

176
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,370
to reverse the flow of time.

177
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,580
To make everything

178
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,250
return to how it was before.

179
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,320
Can you hear me?

180
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,400
Can you hear what I'm saying?

181
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,820
There must be another way.

182
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,360
The protagonist needs someone to help her.

183
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,170
On the wishing tree,

184
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,200
countless red ribbons flutter,

185
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,720
wind chimes tinkling.

186
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,050
Jiangling turns around

187
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,530
and walks toward the three people.

188
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,520
An Zhenzhen feels that all of this

189
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
is very unusual.

190
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,000
The next day,

191
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,600
An Zhenzhen watches Jiangling walk in to teach class,

192
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,160
feeling that everything is starting to seem a bit surreal.

193
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,440
How could someone transfer schools at this time

194
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,480
and coincidentally

195
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,010
be that boy from yesterday?

196
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,200
The people around the protagonist

197
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,800
start leaving her one by one,

198
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,740
betraying her.

199
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,890
Is there any way to change all this?

200
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,490
And if these characters lived in reality,

201
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,200
what would they be like?

202
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,360
Qi Shuo.

203
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:45,840
Lao Jiang.

204
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,520
Jiang Ling and An Zhenzhen

205
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,560
became friends.

206
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,480
They often

207
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,520
had heart-to-heart conversations.

208
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,180
Gradually,

209
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,880
Jiang Ling understood everything.

210
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,200
A true tragedy

211
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,600
perhaps has no villains.

212
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,960
Did he ever tell you

213
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:13,640
about the future?

214
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,720
I'm dead.

215
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,860
And it had to be from upstairs.

216
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,120
How unlucky is that?

217
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,280
She always said she was

218
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,120
mentally unstable.

219
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,440
Do you think she might

220
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,040
have been alone and done something desperate?

221
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,200
Jiangling and everyone else

222
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,860
gathered around An Zhenzhen,

223
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,370
trying to persuade her,

224
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,500
hoping she would change her mind.

225
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,640
An Zhenzhen

226
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,600
remembered how everyone had misunderstood her before,

227
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,360
and couldn't trust them anymore.

228
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,800
At the critical moment,

229
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,920
Gu Ming suddenly rushed to the rooftop

230
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,380
with the money in his hand.

231
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,120
The missing money

232
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,780
has been found.

233
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,760
An Zhenzhen was stunned.

234
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,200
Ling saw the opportunity to save her

235
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,800
and quickly rushed forward.

236
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,480
Can you hear me?

237
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,920
You know what?

238
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,680
People in a coma

239
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,400
are quite likely

240
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,800
to receive information from the outside world.

241
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,080
This is the consensus

242
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,480
we've reached in neurosurgery.

243
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,090
But such cases are extremely rare.

244
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,760
Most patients can't receive any information.

245
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,720
Dr. Liu,

246
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,760
are you giving up too?

247
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,320
Don't worry,

248
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,320
I never give up

249
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,520
on any of my patients.

250
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,930
I won't stop you either.

251
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,680
That's the only help

252
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,320
others can offer in this world.

253
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,720
It's about companionship and protection,

254
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,160
but in the end, the only one who can save you

255
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,320
is your own heart.

256
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,280
And the only way to save your heart

257
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,480
is to feel hope.

258
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,200
I will do everything I can

259
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,840
to save you.

260
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,040
It's a promise.

261
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,680
An Zhenzhen keeps

262
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,210
banging on the locked door.

263
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,040
She strains her voice

264
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,520
shouting to anyone outside.

265
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,450
Is anyone there?

266
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,200
If not...

267
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,800
Even a ghost would do,

268
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,480
You Lifeng,

269
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,040
Mr. You.

270
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,520
Help!

271
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,020
Someone's still here!

272
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,100
What are you two doing?

273
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,240
Which class are you from?

274
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,320
Do you like it?

275
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,120
Jiang.

276
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,480
I'm full.

277
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,360
See you in Dream Adventure City.

278
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,720
Jiang Ling.

279
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,800
An Zhenzhen

280
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,560
slowly approaches

281
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,760
Gu Ming,

282
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,210
trying to persuade him.

283
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,000
Gu Ming has now

284
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
backed up to the edge of the rooftop.

285
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,520
He has nowhere else to go.

286
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,040
He sits on the rooftop

287
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,130
angrily venting his emotions.

288
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,560
An Zhenzhen still tries to reason with him.

289
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,980
Gu Ming interrupts her

290
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,000
and says:

291
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,320
I'm tired.

292
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,330
Goodbye.

293
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,640
With a relaxed expression,

294
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,040
he jumps off the rooftop.

295
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,760
An Zhenzhen sees him fall

296
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,180
and immediately rushes forward.

297
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,060
She forcefully

298
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,880
grabs Gu Ming's body

299
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,560
and pulls him inward.

300
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,760
But due to momentum,

301
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,080
An Zhenzhen

302
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,460
falls instead.

303
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,040
Jiang Ling sees An Zhenzhen fall

304
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,600
and quickly

305
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,210
rushes to her position.

306
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,540
He reaches out his hand to her.

307
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,520
Can you hear me?

308
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,050
What a miraculous recovery

309
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,040
great writer.

310
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,820
Take a look.

311
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,890
The first copy of your new book.

312
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,460
I guarantee you

313
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,290
it's definitely

314
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,080
going to be a bestseller.

315
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,960
Can you hear me?

316
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,850
What happened to me?

317
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,180
You were in a serious car accident

318
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,300
and have been in a coma for over three months.

319
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,120
Car accident?

320
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,410
I was in an accident?

321
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,920
It's truly a miracle!

322
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,600
Our specialists

323
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,530
held a joint consultation for you.

324
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,700
Congratulations,

325
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,420
you can be discharged now.

326
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,320
Did I write

327
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,880
this book?

328
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,720
But I remember

329
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,530
I never wrote this book.

330
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,000
This was brought

331
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,840
by a friend who came to visit you.

332
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,120
We don't really know

333
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,400
the specific details.

334
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,520
You should get some rest now.

335
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,680
Ulysses.

336
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,440
Xiaojia.

337
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,850
Publishing houses aren't doing well these days.

338
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,600
We're only surviving by publishing

339
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,920
works from online writers.

340
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,080
As for your novel,

341
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,600
it's not a web serial

342
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,170
and the content is too dark.

343
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,280
It has no commercial value,

344
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,920
so we can't take that risk.

345
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,120
What era are we living in?

346
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,050
In this big data era,

347
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,280
your subject matter

348
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,970
has no data to back it up,

349
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,000
so you won't even make it past

350
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,660
our internal review meeting.

351
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,640
However, your writing style is quite good.

352
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,770
You should consider

353
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,210
writing web novels.

354
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,690
Wouldn't that be great?

355
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,200
So-called big data

356
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,700
is just a basic template for the industry

357
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,800
that can only analyze the past,

358
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,400
it can't predict the future.

359
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,160
Readers' preferences are diverse and rich.

360
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,240
Besides,

361
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,930
literature is literature,

362
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,000
the internet is merely a medium.

363
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,100
Web serialization

364
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,400
is just a false proposition.

365
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,080
I believe

366
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,850
that as long as it's written

367
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,520
with sincerity and quality,

368
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,360
readers will definitely find it.

369
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,760
It just needs one chance,

370
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:58,720
one opportunity

371
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,980
to be seen by everyone.

372
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,920
Young man,

373
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,720
you're still too naive.

374
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,560
Get more exposure to society,

375
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,570
stop working in isolation at home.

376
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,770
Go see what things have become now.

377
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,360
Let me tell you something privately,

378
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,520
when I was in college,

379
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,120
I was also an artistic youth.

380
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,840
I've worked here for 20 years

381
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,040
because of my dedication to literature.

382
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,720
But today.

383
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,160
Your problem is that first you need to

384
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,040
survive.

385
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,200
You need to eat,

386
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,800
don't you?

387
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,220
We'll discuss it further.

388
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,800
When he says 'discuss it further,'

389
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,330
it means there's no chance.

390
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,640
Xiao Li.

391
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:32,860
Editor,

392
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,640
I can actually revise it again.

393
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,600
Good, tell him to come up.

394
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,140
Second floor, come up.

395
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,160
Jiang Ling and An Zhenzhen

396
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,420
are walking side by side on their way back to school.

397
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,600
He looks at An Zhenzhen seriously and says.

398
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,240
I want to help you.

399
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,320
An Zhenzhen seems upset

400
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,120
by these words.

401
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,280
She says.

402
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,570
How could you possibly help me?

403
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,760
You can't help me.

404
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,360
No one

405
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,040
believes me now.

406
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,730
Jiang Ling looks at An Zhenzhen

407
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,720
and tells her earnestly.

408
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,170
Even if they don't believe you,

409
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:13,760
I

410
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:15,940
believe in you.

411
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,850
It seems that An Zhenzhen in this world

412
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,280
is very lucky.

413
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,160
But who is Jiang Ling?

414
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,760
Jiang Ling.

415
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,740
The school looks exactly the same as in my dream.

416
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,240
But did those people and events

417
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,520
like my novels,

418
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,200
ever truly exist?

419
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,240
Why have I had so many dreams,

420
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,340
yet they were just dreams,

421
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,080
why do they all seem so real?
