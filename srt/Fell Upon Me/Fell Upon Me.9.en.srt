1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,200
Time: 8:30-11:00

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,120
Day

3
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,729
Take it slow.

4
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,450
Careful.

5
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:52,810
Easy now.

6
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:53,690
Hold on to it.

7
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,690
Slowly, slowly.

8
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,039
Come on.

9
00:01:59,039 --> 00:01:59,970
Watch your step.

10
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,500
Put some strength into it.

11
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,620
Put it down.

12
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,620
Lean back for a moment.

13
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
You watch some TV first,

14
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,840
I'll go make you something to eat,

15
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,440
call me if you need anything.

16
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,560
Daughter.

17
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:22,520
Dad.

18
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,480
Look what Dad bought for you.

19
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
Thank you, Dad.

20
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,890
How's your foot?

21
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,650
Does it hurt?

22
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,880
About the shoes,

23
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,579
can you forgive me?

24
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,680
I had no idea things would turn out this way.

25
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,200
It's okay.

26
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,079
I found it,

27
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,840
is this a present for me?

28
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,000
Zhenzhen,

29
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,960
how could you go through my things?

30
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,880
Don't touch my belongings.

31
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,960
This is a gift for you, isn't it?

32
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,400
Yes.

33
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,460
Yes.

34
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,290
It's a gift for your mom,

35
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,920
I wanted to surprise her.

36
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,520
Look,

37
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,320
you've ruined it, haven't you?

38
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,120
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,840
I apologize.

40
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,040
Then give it to me now.

41
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,130
I shouldn't have

42
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,640
argued with you yesterday.

43
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,770
I owe you an apology.

44
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,560
Put it on Mom, Dad.

45
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,440
Yes.

46
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,040
Hurry.

47
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,120
How romantic.

48
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,600
Thank you.

49
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
But this necklace

50
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,010
clearly suits younger people,

51
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,840
not me.

52
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,500
That's right, Dad.

53
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,560
I think Mom

54
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,920
would suit something

55
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,000
more expensive,

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,200
more elegant, high-end jewelry.

57
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,380
Like that one called Car-something?

58
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,360
Cartier.

59
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,240
Yes.

60
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:08,970
It's French,

61
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,240
you know quite a lot.

62
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,480
Mom is so perfect,

63
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,880
so beautiful,

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,660
you should buy her more gifts.

65
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,560
Okay.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,930
For your mom's birthday next year,

67
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,320
I'll definitely get her one.

68
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
Just for birthdays?

69
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,760
I think every holiday

70
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
is a good occasion for gifts.

71
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,500
Right, you little rascal.

72
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,240
Mom,

73
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,880
will we always be together?

74
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,440
Will our family

75
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,680
always be happy together?

76
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,450
Yes, we will.

77
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,400
Then we must stay happy together.

78
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,960
We need to stay happy together.

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,320
Together forever.

80
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Never apart.

81
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,490
This isn't for me, is it?

82
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,890
Since you brought it, just keep it.

83
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,800
Take it back right now,

84
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,480
give it to whoever it's meant for,

85
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,880
it's not suitable for me.

86
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,820
Then I'll be going too.

87
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,210
Tomorrow you take Zhenzhen to school.

88
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,320
Got it.

89
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,800
Qianqian.

90
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,960
So this is where you live.

91
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,120
Not exactly a mansion, is it?

92
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,840
Don't go.

93
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,880
Don't worry,

94
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,240
it's just me.

95
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,280
This is our little secret.

96
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,240
Are you crazy?

97
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,640
Well, if that's your attitude,

98
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,520
then your secret might just...

99
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,850
What are you getting at?

100
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,720
It's simple.

101
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,640
Either

102
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,100
you become my girlfriend.

103
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,640
Or

104
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,040
you pay me 1,314 as hush money.

105
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,930
How about it?

106
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,200
Think it over carefully.

107
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,880
What do you mean?

108
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,840
Isn't this a bit excessive?

109
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,400
I just injured my foot,

110
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,560
I'm not disabled.

111
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,960
But you still can't walk, can you?

112
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,720
I can walk,

113
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,320
it's just not as convenient.

114
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:03,520
Come on.

115
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,560
Sit properly.

116
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,040
Where did you

117
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,500
get this wheelchair from?

118
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,000
My aunt had back pain years ago,

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,800
this was prepared for her.

120
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,080
Remember to remind my aunt to pay the electricity bill,

121
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,200
don't forget it.

122
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,480
The shoes,

123
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,040
who do you think

124
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,720
did it?

125
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,890
I don't know either,

126
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,520
apart from my parents,

127
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,800
no one else would touch them.

128
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,130
What about the equipment room?

129
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,200
The equipment room.

130
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,659
Gu Ming went there with me,

131
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,210
and I think he gave me the shoes too.

132
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,700
But it couldn't be Gu Ming.

133
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,320
Gu Ming has nothing to do

134
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,480
with the physical test,

135
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,040
doing this

136
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,640
wouldn't benefit him at all.

137
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,920
It's precisely because he seems

138
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,720
uninvolved,

139
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,300
yet he's connected

140
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,820
to every single incident,

141
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,720
that's the biggest problem.

142
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,160
I think it's not as simple as we thought.

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,530
Last time it was because...

144
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,800
anyway, I don't think it's Gu Ming.

145
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,660
We can't overlook any suspicion.

146
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,320
Right,

147
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,130
we can't let anything slip.

148
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,880
Let's go.

149
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,010
You two are late for morning study.

150
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,940
Sorry, class monitor.

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:33,560
Sit down.

152
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,210
What's next?

153
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,450
Class rules,

154
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,930
go stand at the back.

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,760
What class rules?

156
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,090
I don't know about that.

157
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,120
Jiang Ling and An Zhenzhen,

158
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,280
you're late for morning study,

159
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,410
go stand at the back.

160
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,280
I can't see from there,

161
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,080
my leg is injured,

162
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,880
I can't stand.

163
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,720
You're still making them stand at the back,

164
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,520
what kind of person are you?

165
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,050
You go stand at the back too.

166
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,760
What if I don't stand up, Gu Ming?

167
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:01,490
An Zhenzhen.

168
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,280
I'll go, I'll go right now.

169
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,320
Why should she stand up?

170
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,200
Her leg is injured and you're making her stand up.

171
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,440
Are you out of your mind?

172
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,400
Rules are rules.

173
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,840
I'm saying this for the last time.

174
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,640
I'm saying you're crazy,

175
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,040
and you're talking about class rules.

176
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,640
Go stand at the back.

177
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,320
You really are insane,

178
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,780
Gu Ming.

179
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,090
Stop it, Jiang Ling.

180
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,420
What if I don't listen?

181
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,410
Stand up.

182
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,600
Does she listen to you?

183
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,480
Stand up.

184
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
Such authority!

185
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,200
Think you're so great being class monitor?

186
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,760
An Zhenzhen, what kind of monitor is he?

187
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,480
He doesn't even care when a classmate is injured.

188
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,140
Jiangling,

189
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,320
go stand in the back.

190
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,180
What if I don't?

191
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,520
You think being class monitor makes you special?

192
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,800
With the teacher backing you up,

193
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,560
how did you become class monitor?

194
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,440
Don't you know yourself?

195
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,970
Monitor,

196
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,400
Jiangling didn't mean it that way.

197
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,120
What do you mean I didn't mean it?

198
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,320
You've reported all

199
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,200
our classmates to teachers,

200
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,330
everyone hates you.

201
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,320
Jiangling.

202
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,250
What are you two arguing about?

203
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,720
Have you no manners?

204
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,640
Come to my office.

205
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,460
Here comes her backup.

206
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,580
What should we do, Jiangling?

207
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,650
Just focus on your studies.

208
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:07,680
I.

209
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,440
I knew it,

210
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:19,600
they're definitely a real couple.

211
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,320
That's so dramatic.

212
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,080
Whatever,

213
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,840
I never really liked Jiang Ling anyway.

214
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,040
What's going on?

215
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:29,980
Jiang Ling.

216
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,570
Just tell me,

217
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,160
did you

218
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,420
provoke Gu Ming first?

219
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,600
How did I provoke him?

220
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,160
Just answer yes or no.

221
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,360
I have a basic understanding

222
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,090
of every student in this class.

223
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,160
I know what kind of person he is.

224
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,640
He has never had any conflicts

225
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,240
with his classmates before.

226
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,050
Just tell me.

227
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,730
Why did you provoke him?

228
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,120
Can't explain yourself?

229
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,100
If you can't say it, write it down.

230
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,520
An 800-word self-criticism,

231
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,850
due before school ends.

232
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,400
Ask Gu Ming to come in.

233
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,880
Grab a chair

234
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,480
and have a seat while we talk.

235
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,640
Gu Ming.

236
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,620
This is a critical time right now,

237
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,560
and I don't want you focusing

238
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,760
on things that don't matter,

239
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,560
understand?

240
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,600
I've heard

241
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,850
your mother's condition has worsened recently.

242
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,650
You must be going through a lot.

243
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,800
If you need any help,

244
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,660
please don't hesitate to tell me.

245
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,960
The school has

246
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,820
policies in place for situations like this.

247
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,170
Teacher Liu.

248
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,600
Thank you.

249
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,010
Don't worry,

250
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,940
I won't let your guidance go to waste.

251
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,760
About my family situation,

252
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,360
please don't worry about it.

253
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,060
It won't affect me.

254
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,050
Save those policies

255
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,240
for students who need them more.

256
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,360
Gu Ming,

257
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,200
you've always been so sensible.

258
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,700
This new student, Jiang Ling.

259
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:36,960
I really

260
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,280
don't understand him very well,

261
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,330
and often have no idea what he's thinking.

262
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,880
If you have time,

263
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,770
please look after him a bit,

264
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:46,960
okay?

265
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,330
I will, teacher.

266
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,690
Teacher Liu,

267
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,820
I've finished.

268
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:58,920
Teacher.

269
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
I'll be going now.

270
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,360
Let's talk sometime.

271
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,580
You pick the place.

272
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,080
How did he manage to write

273
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,080
so many characters?

274
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,280
And they're so well written.

275
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,720
Qi Shuo!

276
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,080
Here's your shoes back,

277
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,610
Xiaoxin.

278
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,440
How was it?

279
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,640
Thanks to these shoes,

280
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,700
our team won today.

281
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,400
Thanks, man.

282
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,120
No problem.

283
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:42,840
I'm off,

284
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,200
bye.

285
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:43,810
Alright.

286
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,360
Can I see your shoes?

287
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,760
Do you like them?

288
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,000
My sister bought them for me.

289
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,130
They're super fast.

290
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,520
My sister got them for me that same day.

291
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
Limited edition.

292
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,400
Hard to get.

293
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,040
Limited edition.

294
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,160
An Zhenzhen's shoes.

295
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,660
I didn't tamper with them.

296
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,330
It doesn't matter if you don't believe me,

297
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,090
I would never hurt An Zhenzhen.

298
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,960
Do you

299
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,410
have feelings for An Zhenzhen?

300
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,760
Zhenzhen and I

301
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,160
have known each other for a long time.

302
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,290
We grew up together,

303
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,720
but

304
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,880
after my father's business failed,

305
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,620
he completely fell apart.

306
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,520
And to make matters worse, my mother got sick.

307
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,320
All I could do

308
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,840
was to study hard

309
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,720
and try to improve life for my mother and me.

310
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,800
I'm sorry.

311
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,720
I understand.

312
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,920
But this thing with An Zhenzhen,

313
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,560
I find it strange too.

314
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,880
If it wasn't an accident,

315
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,580
who could have been behind it?

316
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
I wonder that too.

317
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,440
On the day of the exam,

318
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,640
she and I got locked

319
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,900
in the equipment room.

320
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,850
What were you two

321
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,280
doing in the equipment room?

322
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,320
An Zhenzhen said her exam permit

323
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,450
had fallen in there.

324
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,880
Look at the time,

325
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,540
you're about to miss the test.

326
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,690
I'll go find her.

327
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,360
Let me go,

328
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,440
it's easier for me

329
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,240
to access the girls' dormitory.

330
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,180
I remember now,

331
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,370
I did go with her to the equipment room.

332
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,840
But that morning,

333
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,960
I was waiting for you at the school gate the whole time.

334
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,760
When it was really time to leave,

335
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,600
we had

336
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,840
Qi Shuo's sister

337
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,720
go look for you two on campus.

338
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,240
Qi Shuo's sister?

339
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,599
She said it would be easier for her to enter the girls' dorm,

340
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:13,520
so we let her go.

341
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,280
Stir it slowly.

342
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,640
Stirring slowly makes it more even.

343
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,720
That's enough.

344
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,380
It'll be too salty otherwise.

345
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,880
When spider webs

346
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,480
mercilessly sealed off my stove,

347
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,880
when the dying smoke from the ashes

348
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,560
sighs with the sorrow of poverty,

349
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,120
I still stubbornly smooth out

350
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,240
the ashes of disappointment,

351
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,320
using beautiful snowflakes to write

352
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,200
belief in

353
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,920
the future.

354
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,320
Thank you for your hard work.

355
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:17,960
I know,

356
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,400
I understand.

357
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:36,800
Your cat.

358
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,400
Thanks.

359
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:49,840
Alright,

360
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,500
we're here.

361
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,640
Take it easy.

362
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,010
Bye-bye.

363
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,320
Bye-bye, Dad.

364
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:05,640
Zhenzhen.

365
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,490
Feeling better?

366
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:10,780
Qi Shuo.

367
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,360
Auntie.

368
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:11,920
Since you're here,

369
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,240
I won't take her inside.

370
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,360
You two go together.

371
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,820
Mom won't see you off then.

372
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,040
Be careful with your foot.

373
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,120
Thank you for your help, Qi Shuo.

374
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:18,560
No problem.

375
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,120
Qi Shuo.

376
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,650
Take care on your way back, sis.

377
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,480
Go now.

378
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,680
I'm heading to class.

379
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:45,920
Hurry!

380
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,480
Let me do it.

381
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,000
Get going.

382
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,080
Take it slow and look after her.

383
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,810
Walk slowly.

384
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,040
Go, go!

385
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,640
What are you thinking about?

386
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,880
What are you thinking about?

387
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,960
This question mainly tests

388
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,080
your understanding of the cellular respiration process

389
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,200
and its location.

390
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,200
Everyone needs to understand

391
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,400
aerobic respiration.

392
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,480
Why is it locked?

393
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,000
My sister brought me this

394
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,090
limited edition

395
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,300
that's hard to get.

396
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,880
Under different conditions.

397
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,560
Cellular respiration defense.

398
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,320
An Zhenzhen,

399
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,780
please answer this question.

400
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,240
An Zhenzhen,

401
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,680
please answer.

402
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,480
Okay.

403
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,010
An Zhenzhen,

404
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,600
you've got the wrong textbook.

405
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,330
An Zhenzhen,

406
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,280
do you know what class you're in?

407
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,260
Physics class.

408
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,440
I think you're not fully awake this morning.

409
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,370
Either stand up to clear your head,

410
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,360
or my biology class

411
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,960
won't tolerate you anymore.

412
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,410
I'm sorry, teacher.

413
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,780
Stand there and reflect on yourself.

414
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,120
Stop it.

415
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:45,880
So annoying.

416
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,520
Cut it out.

417
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,220
I told you already.

418
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:48,960
Excuse me,

419
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,770
are you in the wrong classroom?

420
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,730
What's going on?

421
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:56,640
I'm sorry.

422
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,960
Gu Ming told me that

423
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,520
Qi Shuo's sister

424
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,970
came looking for you that morning.

425
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,970
Don't stress yourself out.

426
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,340
Class monitor,

427
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,800
please excuse me from class.

428
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,890
Where are you going?

429
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,920
I have something to take care of.

430
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,280
Mom, I'm home.

431
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,440
Mom?

432
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,040
Mom, I'm back.

433
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,120
Mom?

434
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:17,920
Mom?

435
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,160
Zhenzhen.

436
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,360
Why are you back?

437
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,360
Mom.

438
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,930
Where have you been?

439
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,680
I've started working recently.

440
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,760
But what about you?

441
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,280
Didn't you say that once your foot healed,

442
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,740
you'd go back to your dorm?

443
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:40,960
Let me see.

444
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,620
I missed your cooking.

445
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,120
Where's Dad?

446
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,240
Your father is on a business trip.

447
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,040
He's not here,

448
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,920
I'll cook for you.

449
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,980
Where did he go for his business trip?

450
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,810
He went to Hangzhou,

451
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,720
he'll be back in a couple of days.

452
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,120
Let me see what I can make for you,

453
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,480
would you like some shrimp?

454
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,920
I remember there are some greens in the fridge.

455
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,160
Right, there are still some greens.

456
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,890
Let me check.

457
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,120
Make something else,

458
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,680
some other food to eat.

459
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,440
Come back right away.

460
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,600
Don't ask why.

461
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,460
The child might have discovered something.

462
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:30,810
Dinner's ready!

463
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,800
Time to eat, sweetheart.

464
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,170
Dinner time.

465
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,160
Try it.

466
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,680
Mom made

467
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,880
all your favorites.

468
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:56,720
Mom,

469
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,700
isn't Dad back yet?

470
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,280
Soon, I think.

471
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,280
He said today.

472
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,160
I think he'll be back

473
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,000
very soon.

474
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,160
Don't wait for him,

475
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,090
go ahead and eat.

476
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,200
Try it.

477
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,080
Zhenzhen is back.

478
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:25,840
What's up?

479
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,400
Is school out?

480
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,520
Dad, you went on a business trip.

481
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,680
Where did you go?

482
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,080
Shanghai.

483
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,120
What's wrong?

484
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,160
I forgot to buy you a gift.

485
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,200
This time

486
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,160
was too rushed.

487
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,720
I'm full.

488
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:28,840
Let me take this.

489
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:29,900
I'll carry it over.

490
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,700
Camera position is ready.

491
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,800
Alright, coming!

492
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,130
Okay.

493
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,160
Let's put it here for now.

494
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,570
Come on, make some room please.

495
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:45,970
Come, move this way.

496
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,200
Let's go through the script.

497
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,640
Good.

498
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,000
Which scene should we start with?

499
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,400
Let's start with the dinner date scene.

500
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,720
This scene is more slice-of-life.

501
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,120
Okay.

502
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,080
So when you walk over, I'll speak first.

503
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,520
About the emotional aspect.

504
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,160
Look here.

505
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,740
This is my line.

506
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:14,880
Zhenzhen.

507
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,240
Zhenzhen.

508
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,680
Why are you awake?

509
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:22,800
Go back to bed.
