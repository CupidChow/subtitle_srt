1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,360
Time: 8:30

2
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,160
Day

3
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,760
That's strange,

4
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,020
I've never seen these photos before.

5
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,400
Where did they come from?

6
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,120
Coming.

7
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,460
Thanks.

8
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,380
Please come in.

9
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,659
Have a seat.

10
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,040
And you are?

11
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,360
I'm

12
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,100
from class of 2012,

13
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,140
Jiang Ling.

14
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,130
I transferred here during the last semester.

15
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,340
I remember you.

16
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,820
After all these years,

17
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
you still remember me, Teacher Liu.

18
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,400
I remember

19
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,280
every single one of my students.

20
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,280
I was

21
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,159
passing by the school today

22
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,490
and thought I'd stop by.

23
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,640
Thank you.

24
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,720
I've taught so many students,

25
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,480
but very few come back to visit me

26
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:42,900
like you do.

27
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,520
Every time I finish with a class,

28
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,020
it feels like one chapter of life ends

29
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,000
and another begins.

30
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,880
Perhaps as teachers,

31
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,640
we don't expect

32
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,680
all our students to remember us,

33
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,040
we just hope they grow up happy.

34
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,360
I'm really happy for you,

35
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,520
I should now call you

36
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,820
Principal Liu.

37
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,650
We don't have as many students now,

38
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,160
so we don't need as many homeroom teachers.

39
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,720
I just thought

40
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,560
I could still contribute something,

41
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,690
so I took on some administrative work.

42
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,240
By the way,

43
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,180
what are you doing now?

44
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,400
I guess

45
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,600
I'm just experiencing life.

46
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,480
I always thought

47
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,800
you were quite a special kid.

48
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,560
I also wanted

49
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,600
to ask about

50
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,720
what happened back then.

51
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,720
What is it?

52
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,240
Do you remember

53
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,440
a female classmate in our class named

54
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,240
An Zhenzhen?

55
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
An Zhenzhen.

56
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,880
I remember her.

57
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,970
It's been twelve years.

58
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,960
Time really flies.

59
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,240
Yes.

60
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,200
Ms. Liu.

61
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,840
Her story

62
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,010
can't be explained in just a few words.

63
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,920
I understand.

64
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,880
Today I

65
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,760
just wanted to learn a bit more.

66
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,960
Leave me your number,

67
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,730
I'll contact you later.

68
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,920
Well, I'm

69
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,600
going to leave now,

70
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,800
I'll leave this here.

71
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:16,850
Goodbye.

72
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,200
This time we'll talk about

73
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,960
the stars falling

74
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,960
in the autumn wind

75
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,840
at Wuzhang Plains.

76
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,320
Auntie

77
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,760
is back.

78
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Zhenzhen is here,

79
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,120
Auntie.

80
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,800
You two go have a seat.

81
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,720
I've brought you all something to eat.

82
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,780
Thank you, auntie.

83
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm starving!

84
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,180
Just wait a bit.

85
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,360
Thank you, auntie.

86
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,420
Eat while it's hot.

87
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,680
Let me take this lid.

88
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,640
Thank you, auntie.

89
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,840
Be careful, it's hot.

90
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,370
Try some.

91
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,300
Then I won't hold back.

92
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,170
How is it?

93
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,760
This is incredibly delicious!

94
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,360
This is...

95
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,400
Do you know how much preparation

96
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,160
goes into making this dish?

97
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,400
What? You're an expert on this too?

98
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,530
You can cook as well?

99
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,410
I know a thing or two.

100
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,840
Keep eating,

101
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,970
I'll go find my aunt.

102
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,560
Just a thing or two...

103
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,200
Here it is.

104
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,080
Hot!

105
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,220
I'll get a bowl.

106
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,600
Try it.

107
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,520
Then I won't hold back.

108
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,290
How is it?

109
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,480
Not bad at all.

110
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,060
It's so delicious!

111
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,360
I didn't know you had this skill.

112
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,080
When did you learn it?

113
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,400
When the store gets busy,

114
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,320
I help my aunt with small tasks,

115
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,200
and after a while,

116
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,000
I picked it up.

117
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,000
Actually, cooking is like

118
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,930
writing novels -

119
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
they're similar.

120
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,640
You need to learn

121
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,690
to control the heat and timing,

122
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,180
and you need patience too.

123
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,120
That's so you -

124
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
even when cooking

125
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,440
you sound so literary.

126
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,280
But

127
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,120
it's really good though.

128
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,980
If you like it, have some more.

129
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,130
Don't worry,

130
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,200
I'll definitely finish it all,

131
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,200
won't let your hard work go to waste.

132
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,240
Have you been reading any interesting novels lately?

133
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,840
You could share them with me.

134
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,880
The novel

135
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,040
In Search of Lost Time.

136
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,050
What's it about?

137
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,850
What's it specifically about?

138
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,240
It can be summarized as

139
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,720
time,

140
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:08,800
memory,

141
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,040
and love.

142
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,520
That's as good as saying nothing at all.

143
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,040
Well, I haven't finished reading it yet,

144
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,570
I'll tell you when I'm done.

145
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,260
Is this writer famous?

146
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,640
Proust

147
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,330
was quite famous back then.

148
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,320
But by

149
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,760
today's standards,

150
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,480
he would be considered

151
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,320
a complete failure.

152
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,360
Why?

153
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,920
Throughout his life,

154
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,200
he devoted all

155
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,970
his time to writing novels.

156
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,440
Publishers frequently

157
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,600
rejected his work,

158
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,720
and he often had to self-publish.

159
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,920
This book

160
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,680
is considered

161
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,640
his masterpiece,

162
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,040
as well as his final work.

163
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,680
How sad.

164
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,220
Then you must never become such a person.

165
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,760
I'm still

166
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,040
many years away from being that kind of writer.

167
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Actually, I really want to become that kind of writer.

168
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,920
Don't worry,

169
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,280
you have me.

170
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,320
In the future,

171
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,720
I'll definitely

172
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,080
promote your masterpiece well

173
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,640
and make you

174
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,840
both famous and rich.

175
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,320
Really?

176
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,600
Don't underestimate me.

177
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,120
My dad is so successful in business,

178
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,720
which proves that I

179
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,640
must have inherited

180
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,900
some business talent.

181
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
I envy you

182
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,380
for having a father like that.

183
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:30,680
Unlike me,

184
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,330
I've barely seen my father.

185
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,840
What's there to envy?

186
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,690
You saw it last time,

187
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,890
he and my mom have been putting on an act for me.

188
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,680
You mean because...

189
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,960
let's not talk about this.

190
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,760
As for matters between parents,

191
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,080
we have no say in them.

192
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,400
The main issue

193
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,090
isn't really about you.

194
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:00,960
Actually,

195
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,600
my only wish

196
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,060
has always been

197
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,530
for them to stay together forever.

198
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,200
Just like before,

199
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,000
happy and content.

200
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,680
Do you have any other wishes?

201
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,520
If I tell you, will you make it come true?

202
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,120
Within my capabilities,

203
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,490
I'll try my best.

204
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,100
Then I'll make my wish now.

205
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,440
I wish

206
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,420
all my good friends

207
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,360
would come back to me.

208
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,600
I hope our Three Bouncy group

209
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,040
will never break up.

210
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,200
But

211
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,240
I said such nasty things to them,

212
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,980
they probably won't forgive me anymore.

213
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,880
Your friendship

214
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,320
has been developing

215
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,580
for several years now,

216
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,520
it's quite strong

217
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,580
and not so fragile.

218
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,360
Have something delicious

219
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,560
to cheer yourself up.

220
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,180
Then I'll eat more.

221
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,610
I'll finish all of this.

222
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,580
Delicious.

223
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,460
There's meat underneath?

224
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,800
Of course there is.

225
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
Did you stew this?

226
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,330
I stir-fried it.

227
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,240
It's quite tidy here today.

228
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,120
Remembrance of Things Past.

229
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,680
Recently,

230
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,359
I've been

231
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,930
thinking about something.

232
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,849
But I've made up my mind,

233
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,380
I'm going to stick with it.

234
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,280
I'm going to finish my novel.

235
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,480
It might

236
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,920
take a few years,

237
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,130
or even a decade or more.

238
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,440
A decade?

239
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,560
That's way too long.

240
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,460
How about this.

241
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:28,660
You could teach me,

242
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,200
and once I learn, we can write together.

243
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,260
It would be faster.

244
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,680
That book you're holding

245
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,940
took 17 years to write.

246
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,800
17 years?

247
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,560
Yes, that's too long indeed.

248
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,720
We will.

249
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,360
Because of a smile,

250
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
a glance,

251
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,520
or a bare shoulder,

252
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,080
we fall in love.

253
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,040
These subtle moments

254
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,160
are quite enough.

255
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,160
And then.

256
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,040
During my long periods of hope

257
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,280
or melancholy,

258
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,440
we begin to weave a person.

259
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,640
Imagining

260
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,000
a character.

261
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,940
That's beautifully written.

262
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,120
The time we have

263
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,560
each day.

264
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,080
It's like a

265
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,000
flexible band.

266
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,320
Stretched out, it seems endless.

267
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,000
And we

268
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,440
make this time

269
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:36,800
past.

270
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,920
suddenly contract.

271
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,440
years.

272
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,080
Ordinary habits

273
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,240
fill the remaining gaps.

274
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,760
We ultimately cannot

275
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,920
change things as we wish.

276
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,400
As time passes,

277
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,440
our desires

278
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,720
quietly change.

279
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,680
It seems

280
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,720
the time spent.

281
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,420
You can still tell from

282
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,040
the writing style.

283
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,970
This is literature,

284
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,440
it requires

285
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,400
long-term accumulation

286
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,410
and refinement.

287
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,360
Seeing how familiar you are

288
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,720
with all this,

289
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,200
you must have read these volumes

290
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,880
many, many times, right?

291
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,160
Not really,

292
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,560
most of the time

293
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,700
I have to study too.

294
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,000
I just can't

295
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,240
sit quietly and read properly.

296
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,080
Going to sleep,

297
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:55,740
good night.

298
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,240
What is cell apoptosis?

299
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,360
What does cell apoptosis mean?

300
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,520
Is it when the cell,

301
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,600
That's the concept.

302
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,960
like, dies or something?

303
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,400
I think it starts from the nucleus.

304
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,680
Most of the water in cells

305
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,400
exists in a free form

306
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,200
Free form.

307
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,320
and can flow freely.

308
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,560
It's called bound water

309
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,420
and cell fluid.

310
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,440
Bound water.

311
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,240
Right?

312
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:27,900
What water?

313
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,120
What?

314
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,530
Next one.

315
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,760
Most inorganic salts in cells.

316
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,820
I'm leaving first.

317
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,120
Go ahead.

318
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,080
If only he were mute.

319
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,370
What do you mean?

320
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,320
I bet you won't make it next year either.

321
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,160
Stop.

322
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,120
I think...

323
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,200
There's no time like the present,

324
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,200
let's leave right now.

325
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,930
How about it?

326
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,330
Let's go now.

327
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:09,960
Let's go.

328
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,650
Why don't we each share our wishes?

329
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,160
Sure.

330
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,480
Wishes don't come true if you tell them.

331
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,480
What kind of shameful wish do you have?

332
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,540
I bet yours is the truly shameful one.

333
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:20,920
How about this,

334
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,720
I'll go first.

335
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,440
My wish is...

336
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,320
I hope

337
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,770
the Maya prophecy fails

338
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,770
and 2012 isn't the end of the world.

339
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,040
All living creatures

340
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:29,720
can

341
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,080
thrive and multiply.

342
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,760
World peace.

343
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,560
Qianqian.

344
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:06,960
Qianqian.

345
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,930
Where are you going?

346
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,120
No entry.

347
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,800
Sister.

348
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,290
Where are you going?

349
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,000
I can't get through here.

350
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,000
Don't touch me.

351
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,290
Where are you going?

352
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,400
If I remember correctly,

353
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,120
don't we have some unfinished business?

354
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,720
Qianqian.

355
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,280
I'll pay you back.

356
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,730
I almost forgot about that.

357
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,450
But don't worry,

358
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,480
as long as you're with me,

359
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,680
money doesn't matter.

360
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:44,800
Let's go.

361
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:45,480
Let me go!

362
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:45,940
Move it!

363
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,160
Let me go!

364
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,800
Let me go!

365
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,520
What are you doing?

366
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,400
Let me go!

367
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,480
Let me go!

368
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,800
Let me go!

369
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,200
Let go!

370
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:56,930
Who's there?

371
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,000
Take it easy, please.

372
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,280
Get in the car.

373
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,240
Hurry up and get in.

374
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,360
It's good that you tried to help,

375
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,720
but if you go too far,

376
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,120
you could be breaking the law.

377
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,520
Alright,

378
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,120
young man,

379
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,560
next time just call the police if something happens,

380
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,290
understand?

381
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,000
Yes, I understand.

382
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,960
At your age,

383
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,880
you might not know your own limits,

384
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,680
and if you seriously hurt someone,

385
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,520
you could be committing a crime yourself.

386
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,000
If you encounter this kind of situation again,

387
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,120
please call the police first, okay?

388
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:03,840
Okay.

389
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,760
It's all over now.

390
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,600
It's all over.

391
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,000
It's fine.

392
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,360
Qiuqiu.

393
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,800
Hey.

394
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,180
Are you asleep?

395
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:34,680
Not yet.

396
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:39,800
Zhenzhen.

397
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,840
I'm sorry.

398
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,160
Thank you.

399
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,010
Thank you for helping me today.

400
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,370
What are you talking about?

401
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,960
Aren't you my princess?

402
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,760
As your knight,

403
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,120
I must protect you.

404
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,040
Right?

405
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,520
I'm really sorry too.

406
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,440
Qiuqiu,

407
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,480
about our fight before,

408
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,410
I said some terrible things to you.

409
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,880
I don't know

410
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,040
if you hate me now.

411
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,800
Of course not,

412
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,680
silly.

413
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,200
How could I ever hate you?

414
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,800
Actually,

415
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,200
I've been wanting to tell you

416
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,740
that we should make up.

417
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,320
I don't even like Jiang Ling.

418
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,400
It's just that when he appeared,

419
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,880
I was afraid of losing you,

420
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,320
losing my best friend.

421
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,080
You'll never lose me.

422
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,440
You forgot.

423
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,290
You forgot about me.

424
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,720
The three of us made a promise.

425
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,610
No matter which one of us

426
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,370
makes a big mistake,

427
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,690
as long as someone speaks up first,

428
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,490
we must forgive each other unconditionally.

429
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,050
Do you remember?

430
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,040
I remember.

431
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,200
So let's never fight again,

432
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:29,880
okay?

433
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,400
I won't

434
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,480
lose my temper with you anymore.

435
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,600
I used to

436
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,850
take out my bad mood on you all the time.

437
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,440
It's okay, Qiuqiu,

438
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,560
I understand you.

439
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,280
I know that's not what you really meant,

440
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,840
you were just scared.

441
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,440
Actually,

442
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,320
I can feel that

443
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,160
your emotions

444
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,400
are because you care.

445
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,440
Maybe I

446
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:01,840
didn't give you

447
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,160
enough security.

448
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,680
I've been

449
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,370
neglecting you lately,

450
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,440
so you got scared.

451
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,240
I understand you,

452
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,000
how could I be angry with you?

453
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,640
During this time,

454
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,840
when you weren't by my side,

455
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,600
I really

456
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,600
missed you.

457
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,360
Qiuqiu,

458
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,100
whether you believe it or not,

459
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
I want to tell you.

460
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,360
Lately I've

461
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,050
suddenly realized something.

462
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:42,720
Life actually

463
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,970
gives us more than just one chance.

464
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,040
Heaven

465
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,520
has given me a second chance.

466
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,850
I must seize this opportunity.

467
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,810
I will live my life well.

468
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,200
And cherish everyone around me.

469
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,580
We all need to live our lives well.

470
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,200
Qiuqiu.

471
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,600
Trust me.

472
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,130
I'm here for you.

473
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,120
Your future will definitely

474
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,440
be wonderful.

475
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,600
I believe it.

476
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,600
We all will.

477
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,860
Our future will be bright.

478
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,280
Yes.

479
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,880
Our future

480
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,240
will be absolutely wonderful.
