1
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,280
Time: 8:30

2
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,120
Day

3
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:24,760
Qianqian

4
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,200
How can you compare yourself to your brother?

5
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,320
He wins the Outstanding Student Award every year,

6
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,180
so of course we need to reward him.

7
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,360
Just look at your own grades,

8
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,320
and you still want us to buy you phones

9
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,600
and designer clothes.

10
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,120
Our family has limited resources,

11
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,450
and now we need to focus on investing in your brother.

12
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,610
If you're sensible,

13
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,160
you'll study hard to get into college

14
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,040
and prove yourself.

15
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,680
Mom, please stop talking.

16
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,840
Her brother did it.

17
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,640
That bastard!

18
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,680
I'm going to the school

19
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,050
to get him expelled.

20
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,400
It's just kids fooling around.

21
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,040
She didn't know about it at first,

22
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,520
and she's already apologized to me.

23
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,250
Apologized?

24
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,730
An Jianhua, are you even human?

25
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,440
You're still defending your little girlfriend

26
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,100
aren't you?

27
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,360
Have you no heart?

28
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,520
It's really just a misunderstanding,

29
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,840
it wasn't a big deal to begin with.

30
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,280
Zhenzhen said something to him,

31
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,400
he played a prank,

32
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,960
and somehow the money went missing.

33
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,079
None of that matters now,

34
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,120
expelling him won't help anything.

35
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,800
The urgent matter now

36
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,860
is to help our Zhenzhen's situation.

37
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,720
Then figure it out yourself.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,600
I'm completely out of ideas.

39
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,090
The child won't eat or drink anything.

40
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,320
I'll be back before dinner,

41
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,050
don't worry,

42
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,079
I know what to do.

43
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,840
Daughter.

44
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,360
Sweetie.

45
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,560
Just put this here.

46
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,060
You can go ahead with your things.

47
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,160
Darling.

48
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,600
You're on a business trip

49
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,800
with so much luggage?

50
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,160
Dad brought back

51
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,780
all his luggage this time.

52
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,040
There are some changes at my company this year,

53
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,840
so I won't need to travel for work anymore.

54
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,480
It's perfect timing.

55
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,360
I'm not busy lately,

56
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,320
so I can take a few days off

57
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,240
to spend time with my little girl.

58
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,370
How does that sound?

59
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:43,960
Let me see.

60
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,050
What's this?

61
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,600
Go wait a moment.

62
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,800
Dad will make you something delicious.

63
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,850
I'll cook something special for my daughter.

64
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,880
Don't eat too many snacks,

65
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,480
save some room,

66
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,010
Daddy will make something delicious for you.

67
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,120
Alright,

68
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,120
go on, get out.

69
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,080
Let me do it.

70
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,880
Could you put away these frozen items first

71
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,400
and clear this space?

72
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,820
We don't need this.

73
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,940
Where's the trash can?

74
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,940
Where's the trash can?

75
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:49,560
This kitchen doesn't even have a trash can.

76
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,010
Okay.

77
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,780
Put it here.

78
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,800
Octopus.

79
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,000
I was thinking that we could

80
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,320
maybe...

81
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,080
This, this...

82
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,720
What's this called?

83
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,200
Sashimi.

84
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,520
Let's make some octopus.

85
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,120
Don't you think this sashimi

86
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,600
might be unsanitary?

87
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,690
Fine, I'll do as you say.

88
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,160
You know,

89
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,600
you've been worrying about everything in this house

90
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,560
for so many years now,

91
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,820
you've worked so hard.

92
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,010
Alright.

93
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,160
I'll do it.

94
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,820
Let me handle this.

95
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,720
I'll cook,

96
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,280
you sit down for a while,

97
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,240
take a break,

98
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,620
you've been doing this for so many years.

99
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,200
Actually,

100
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,560
I wanted to make some for the kids to eat.

101
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,159
That fish,

102
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,080
defrost it in the microwave.

103
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,560
Let's just

104
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,040
defrost it in the microwave.

105
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,720
This will be faster

106
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,050
okay.

107
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,040
Don't rush,

108
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,840
take out the fish first.

109
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,600
Find a plate.

110
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,840
In this house,

111
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,360
you really,

112
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,520
do you even know where things are?

113
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,560
Isn't this it?

114
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,420
Not enough.

115
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,170
If that's not enough, take two.

116
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,200
Can't find anything.

117
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,080
I wish my daughter

118
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,160
happiness every day.

119
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:20,720
Be happy.

120
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,080
Eat up.

121
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,159
You've been making all these delicious meals

122
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:34,000
in different ways these past few days,

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,530
my face has gotten rounder.

124
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,240
Being plump means good fortune.

125
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,840
It's fine.

126
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,100
Just this one meal.

127
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:39,720
Go ahead and eat.

128
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,320
My daughter isn't fat at all,

129
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,760
right?

130
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:42,840
Right.

131
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,560
She's still growing.

132
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,760
Health is important.

133
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,200
Eat up.

134
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:45,960
Hurry.

135
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,240
Try it.

136
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,920
Are you really back from your business trip

137
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,020
for good this time?

138
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,170
Dinner's ready.

139
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,210
Come eat now.

140
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,240
Qianqian, you think you're so smart now

141
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,920
talking back to your parents?

142
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,840
If you don't behave, get out of here

143
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,300
find your own place to live

144
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,400
and stop disrupting your brother's studies.

145
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
I'll act like I never had a daughter.

146
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:38,450
Not busy lately?

147
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,900
Not really.

148
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,400
So you and Uncle An,

149
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,260
everything okay between you two?

150
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,490
Everything's fine.

151
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,290
That's good.

152
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,560
No,

153
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,160
I was just wondering about An Zhenzhen.

154
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,320
She hasn't been to class for a long time,

155
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,360
and I don't know what's going on.

156
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,620
Gu Ming won't tell me anything when I ask.

157
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,960
Just mind your own business.

158
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,240
Where has Zhenzhen gone?

159
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,320
I don't know either,

160
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,250
do you guys know?

161
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:17,600
You don't know?

162
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,280
She hasn't been here for a long time,

163
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,010
my goodness!

164
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,560
I think she hasn't been staying at the dorm these days,

165
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,840
all her stuff in her room,

166
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,040
I'm worried about it.

167
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,460
Maybe she had something to do and couldn't come.

168
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,320
But it was indeed a bit too much at that time.

169
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,370
Let's go. Is anyone else coming later?

170
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,520
Hey there, beautiful couple,

171
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,160
um,

172
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,280
do you have a reservation?

173
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:31,960
Have you booked?

174
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,200
Yes, we have.

175
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,360
Good.

176
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:32,960
That's great,

177
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,490
alright,

178
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,450
have a good time!

179
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,360
Where do you think

180
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,200
you're hiding, kid?

181
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,960
Bro, how did you

182
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,120
even find me here?

183
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
What do you think?

184
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:44,960
What is this place?

185
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,240
Qiu Qian's workplace.

186
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,200
How could I not find it?

187
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,930
This is such a dangerous place!

188
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,640
It's actually the safest place.

189
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,700
I know you too well.

190
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,440
Look,

191
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,480
I'm working right now.

192
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,520
If my manager comes,

193
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,600
I'll lose my job.

194
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,960
Since you're already here,

195
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,320
tell me about An Zhenzhen.

196
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,160
An Zhenzhen?

197
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,160
Stop going on about her all day.

198
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,360
I really don't know anything.

199
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,760
That was 12 years ago.

200
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,880
I have my own life to live.

201
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,760
I don't have time for this.

202
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,800
If you don't talk, I can't move on with my life either.

203
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,330
Hurry up.

204
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,360
Stop.

205
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,490
I really don't know.

206
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,320
Have you met her?

207
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,220
How did it come to this?

208
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
Couldn't see her.

209
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,400
I was at the door, she was inside.

210
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,880
Let me tell you something.

211
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,540
You see her?

212
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,400
Qiu Qian.

213
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,610
Senior year.

214
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,880
Last semester.

215
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,540
She stopped studying.

216
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,320
Hanging out with bad crowds all day.

217
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:41,980
Did you see?

218
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,520
All these guys around her,

219
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,580
one after another.

220
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,400
What kind of trash were they!

221
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,160
I couldn't stand any of them.

222
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,180
You're quite perceptive.

223
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,640
I guess so.

224
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,610
You've said so much.

225
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,240
Since you're so insightful,

226
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,440
why don't you be transparent

227
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,700
and tell me everything

228
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,180
about An Zhenzhen?

229
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,240
Will this ever end?

230
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,000
Brother,

231
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
what do you want me to say?

232
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,320
I really don't know.

233
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,680
I haven't figured it out myself.

234
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,120
Just tell me and I'll help you figure it out,

235
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,800
isn't that simple?

236
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,600
I know.

237
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:11,600
I know.

238
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,480
I'll definitely tell you,

239
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,280
but I'm working now, I'm at work.

240
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:58,920
Daughter.

241
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,360
Sweetie.

242
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,160
Guess what Daddy bought for you?

243
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,720
You don't need to buy me any more gifts,

244
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,850
you've already bought so many lately.

245
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,760
I think

246
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,560
you're going to love this one.

247
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,040
Look what this is.

248
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,080
A kitten!

249
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,280
Meet your little owner.

250
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,400
Why don't you give it a name?

251
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,860
Let's call it Jiang Jiang.

252
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,560
Jiang Jiang.

253
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,680
Welcome

254
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,840
Jiang Jiang.

255
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,080
Here are the recent materials

256
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,080
I've organized everything for you.

257
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,240
How have you

258
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,130
been lately?

259
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,280
When are you planning to return to school?

260
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,240
The third mock exam is coming up soon,

261
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,570
you need to buckle down.

262
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,000
Thank you

263
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:49,860
class monitor.

264
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,960
Actually,

265
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,530
I really want to go back too,

266
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,200
but I'm scared.

267
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,600
I'm afraid

268
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,970
after doing something so extreme,

269
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,920
my classmates

270
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,760
might

271
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,600
think

272
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,160
I'm dangerous.

273
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,040
I'm afraid they won't accept me.

274
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,900
Everyone's been asking me about you,

275
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,660
all your classmates miss you.

276
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,329
Take a good look.

277
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:20,930
I'm leaving now.

278
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,900
What about Jiangling?

279
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,600
He asked about it too.

280
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,920
Check your phone,

281
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,760
there are

282
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,320
messages from your classmates.

283
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,400
Youth has gone,

284
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,880
red balloons

285
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,360
drift away freely.

286
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,280
Time says goodbye,

287
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,920
all flames

288
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:22,320
in the world

289
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,300
freeze and lock away love.

290
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,500
Memories grow old,

291
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,880
still composing

292
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,920
novels that no one cares about.

293
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,320
The starry sky shows no attachment,

294
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,400
to all doomsdays

295
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,200
and arks.

296
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,480
You, student in the back.

297
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,640
The school strictly prohibits students from wearing makeup,

298
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,970
are you trying to rebel?

299
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,240
What are you staring at?

300
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,600
What kind of attitude is that?

301
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,120
Don't think that just because college entrance exams are coming up

302
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,840
the school won't discipline you.

303
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,300
Get out,

304
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,900
wash your face clean before coming back.

305
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,090
What are you looking at?

306
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,740
Focus on your studies.

307
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
Stop right there!

308
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,120
Don't you know how to address people properly?

309
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,010
What's with that attitude?

310
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,850
My mother's medical bills,

311
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
every penny comes from my hard work.

312
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,970
What the hell are you doing?

313
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,240
Any money you lose

314
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,440
at the gambling table

315
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,520
could save my mother's life.

316
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,280
I've never seen

317
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,610
such a terrible husband

318
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,200
Men.

319
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,050
and father like you.

320
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,800
What are you doing?

321
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,660
Come back here!

322
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:58,920
Sis,

323
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,770
why are you back so early today?

324
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,720
I'll take you home first,

325
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,480
I have something to do later.

326
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,240
What's wrong?

327
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:08,970
Nothing.

328
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,080
410.

329
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,640
Roll call now.

330
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,050
Song Jun.

331
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,760
Han Jin.

332
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,240
Qiu Qian.

333
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:22,650
Qiu Qian.

334
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
Where is Qiu Qian?

335
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,600
Where's Qiu Qian?

336
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,330
I don't know.

337
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
Which bed is hers?

338
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,860
What on earth are you wearing?

339
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,800
A student who doesn't

340
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,700
look like a student at all.

341
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,290
An Zhenzhen.

342
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,920
She called in sick.

343
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,160
Just like this,

344
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,280
make it into a little pocket,

345
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,210
then put the filling in the middle.

346
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,700
That's so much?

347
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,800
Use less filling,

348
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,680
otherwise it won't seal properly.

349
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
Then just twist it around to finish.

350
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,240
Alright.

351
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,170
Give it to Daddy.

352
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,640
I think I should

353
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,210
go back to school tomorrow?

354
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,200
The college entrance exam is coming up soon after all.

355
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,360
It's not good for me

356
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,400
to stay at home all the time.

357
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,200
Sure,

358
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,080
tomorrow

359
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,040
Mom and Dad

360
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,700
will take you there together.

361
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:33,640
I've already

362
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,370
talked to Teacher Liu about it.

363
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:35,960
And you know,

364
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,040
if you feel unhappy,

365
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,500
you can come back anytime.

366
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,040
Mom and Dad

367
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,240
will always be your strongest support.

368
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,240
Not so hard,

369
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,450
be a little gentler.

370
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,560
Is she not taking the college entrance exam?

371
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,520
I have no idea,

372
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,480
she never comes back to the dorm.

373
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,560
Qiu Qian is here,

374
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,520
she's like a completely different person,

375
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,400
getting me scolded by the dorm supervisor every day.

376
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,280
She doesn't return to the dorm,

377
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,880
doesn't even come to school,

378
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,560
how can she take the exam?

379
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,600
Why is she coming to school now?

380
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,360
No idea.

381
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,440
Students,

382
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:40,690
I have an important announcement to make.

383
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,500
Zhizhi,

384
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,240
come in,

385
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:54,980
please come in.

386
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,160
Let's welcome An Zhenzhen

387
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,240
back to our class family.

388
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,800
Due to the special incident

389
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,330
that happened in our class,

390
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,300
without a proper investigation,

391
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,320
An Zhenzhen was

392
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,200
treated unfairly,

393
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,120
and I want to apologize to her.

394
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,650
At the same time,

395
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,920
I hope this incident

396
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,460
will help our class family

397
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,760
in the days ahead

398
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:46,960
to trust each other

399
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,360
and support one another.

400
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,130
Let's work together

401
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,660
to bring our high school years

402
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,480
to a perfect conclusion.

403
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,200
Go back to your seats now.

404
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,880
Students,

405
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,250
hello everyone.

406
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,420
The college entrance exam is about to begin.

407
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,680
During this final sprint,

408
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,320
I know

409
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:12,380
you're all under tremendous psychological pressure.

410
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,160
Today,

411
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,000
we're going to talk about

412
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,640
pre-exam psychological adjustment,

413
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,840
to help ease your mental burden

414
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,480
and make you more confident

415
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,080
when entering the exam room.

416
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,440
First,

417
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,940
I'd like to understand

418
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,240
your recent psychological states.

419
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,280
Do you often feel

420
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,040
anxious,

421
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,040
nervous,

422
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,000
uneasy,

423
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,120
or even

424
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,080
occasionally lost?

425
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,040
But students,

426
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,880
all these troubles

427
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,440
come from

428
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,120
within yourselves.

429
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,660
Therefore,

430
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,000
we need to learn introspection,

431
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,480
to find the most vulnerable parts

432
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,760
of your mind,

433
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,960
and acknowledge them.

434
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,680
Heal it,

435
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,720
change it.

436
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,160
Make your inner self

437
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
stronger.

438
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
All difficulties

439
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,920
will become trivial.

440
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,400
I hope everyone

441
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,360
will face the college entrance exam

442
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,960
with your best mental state.

443
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:18,600
Zhenzhen.

444
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,730
Are you going to eat?

445
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,320
I'll go later.

446
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,240
I know a place that sells guokui,

447
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,320
want me to bring you some?

448
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,040
No need, no need.

449
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,480
Thank you.

450
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,680
Want some potato noodles?

451
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,560
Those potato noodles are really delicious.

452
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,020
I'll go check it out later.

453
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:31,620
I'm off now.

454
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,290
Bye-bye.

455
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,640
Zhenzhen.

456
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,820
Aren't you hungry?

457
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,960
I'm fine for now.

458
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,520
I have a couple more lines

459
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,250
to copy. I'll go after I finish.

460
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,770
Alright.

461
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,210
Don't forget to eat.

462
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,760
Hurry up! I've been waiting forever.

463
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
Let's go! We'll lose our seats soon.

464
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,720
The noodles are here.

465
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,160
Thank you, boss.

466
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,060
Here you go.

467
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,610
Thanks a lot.

468
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,400
Here's yours.

469
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,650
Thank you, boss.

470
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,520
Zhenzhen.

471
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,060
What would you like to eat?

472
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,360
Over here.

473
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,240
I'm full.

474
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,680
See you at Dream Adventure City.

475
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,050
You came.

476
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,560
You just gave me this?

477
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,420
How did you know

478
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,610
I would come?

479
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,160
The blue note, of course.

480
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,570
It's my lucky color,

481
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,200
that's why I wore blue today.

482
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,400
I knew you would come.

483
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,920
How are these the same?

484
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,400
They're not even the same color, okay?

485
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,240
Close enough.

486
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,680
You didn't even know why I asked you to come.

487
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,080
I was a little curious.

488
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,890
Is this a gift for me?

489
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,570
You're giving me money?

490
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,850
I can't accept that.

491
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,640
Game tokens?

492
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,520
I paid for them too.

493
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,140
I'll take them.

494
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,160
Ready?

495
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:13,730
Let's go.

496
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:14,680
I...

497
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,210
Let's go.

498
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,040
Look.

499
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,440
Listen to that sound,

500
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,520
there's quite a lot,

501
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,450
I bought plenty.

502
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,400
This place,

503
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,880
I checked it out tonight,

504
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,210
not many people around.

505
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,200
Let's go.

506
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,450
I've figured it all out.

507
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,210
Bumper cars.

508
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,480
That pirate ship.

509
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,680
How about another day?

510
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,840
Actually today...

511
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,080
They have claw machines inside too.

512
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,940
Claw machines?

513
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,120
Let's go.

514
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:43,480
You're impossible.
