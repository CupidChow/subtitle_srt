1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,200
Time: 8:30-11:00

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,160
Day

3
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,280
I think

4
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
you don't need to leave the company.

5
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,520
I've already made up my mind,

6
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,690
please let it go.

7
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,140
This situation between us

8
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,240
doesn't need to be resolved

9
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,010
this way.

10
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,360
Xincheng Company has been trying to recruit me for two years.

11
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,200
This time they offered

12
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,000
very generous terms,

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,260
that's why I accepted,

14
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,930
it's not because of you.

15
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,200
Whatever the reason,

16
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,760
the company will definitely compensate you.

17
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,090
I hope you won't refuse.

18
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,320
I resigned voluntarily,

19
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,260
so Director An doesn't need to spend money on me.

20
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,880
I never take things that don't belong to me.

21
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,280
I...

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,720
I'm sorry.

23
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,000
Ever since

24
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,820
that incident with Zhenzhen,

25
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,800
I just can't anymore...

26
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,410
I made the wrong choice,

27
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,420
making myself look

28
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,320
like

29
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,380
someone who destroys other people's families.

30
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,480
After I separated from Zhenzhen's mother,

31
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,220
I've been looking for a chance

32
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,770
to be honest with Zhenzhen.

33
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,160
But as you know,

34
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,280
she's in her final year of high school,

35
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,000
about to take the college entrance exam.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,240
I'm afraid telling her would affect her performance.

37
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,400
I never thought things

38
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,800
would turn out like this.

39
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,560
So,

40
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,740
I'm letting go,

41
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,480
for your sake.

42
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,320
Xiao Qi,

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,660
I was wrong.

44
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,600
It was my mistake,

45
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,400
I degraded myself.

46
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,000
No matter what I do,

47
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,780
no matter how I do it...

48
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,329
Zhenzhen will always be number one

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,200
in your heart, right?

50
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,880
During that time, I was like

51
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,280
I had a mental breakdown.

52
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,520
On the day of the physical test,

53
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,960
I locked her in the gym.

54
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,560
I tampered with her track shoes.

55
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,800
I went crazy,

56
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,180
I didn't even recognize myself anymore.

57
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,490
I can't continue with you anymore.

58
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,780
Let's end this.

59
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,500
Everything is just wrong.

60
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:10,600
Xiao Qi.

61
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,890
I'm the one who wronged you,

62
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,880
I caused all of this.

63
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,920
I will make it up to you.

64
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
You should go back

65
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,940
and make amends with your family.

66
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,400
But An Jianhua,

67
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,370
do you think this family

68
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,100
will accept you again?

69
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,540
Can you really go back to this family?

70
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
I won't say goodbye to you.

71
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,200
Hello.

72
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,480
I'd like to ask

73
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:50,159
if this class on the flyer is still open for registration?

74
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:50,920
Which class?

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,530
This one,

76
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,960
it's written right here.

77
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,680
It's full.

78
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,880
Full?

79
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,080
Could you add a few more spots?

80
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,720
I'm sorry,

81
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,280
we can't add more.

82
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,540
It's completely full.

83
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,580
Thanks anyway.

84
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
Hello.

85
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,120
Hello.

86
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,800
I'd like to inquire about enrollment for my child.

87
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,360
If you're looking for this year's college entrance exam prep class,

88
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,280
it might be too late,

89
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,610
as they're ending soon.

90
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,520
My child is a graduating student this year.

91
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,640
The exam is coming up soon,

92
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,920
but their grades just aren't improving.

93
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,960
Do you have anything that's not in your advertisements,

94
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,120
something more exclusive?

95
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,000
Money is not an issue,

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,720
we just want to boost their performance quickly.

97
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,200
Alright,

98
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,960
one moment please.

99
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,840
I'll have our

100
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,500
teacher in charge talk to you.

101
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,740
You two, right?

102
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:18,650
Come,

103
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,010
this way please,

104
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,680
follow me.

105
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,240
And over here.

106
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,600
This way.

107
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,370
Take a look here.

108
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,200
This

109
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,440
is our premium training class.

110
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,880
Good.

111
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,200
From now on,

112
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,610
you'll be taking classes here.

113
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,370
Come.

114
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,659
Let's talk inside.

115
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,800
Your child.

116
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,610
Come.

117
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,290
Parents,

118
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,040
let's go inside and talk.

119
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:51,620
Please.

120
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,300
Have a seat.

121
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,880
As you all just saw,

122
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,170
our educational training program

123
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
is quite good.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,800
I'd like to ask

125
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,080
both of you,

126
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,400
how did you learn about

127
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,660
our educational training institution?

128
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,040
I saw a flyer

129
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,690
outside the school,

130
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,080
and it said

131
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,800
second-tier colleges become first-tier,

132
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,200
first-tier becomes double first-class,

133
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
full refund if grades don't improve.

134
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:24,930
Is that true?

135
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,200
How is

136
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,360
this child's academic performance usually?

137
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,320
Just average.

138
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,200
What's his ranking in class?

139
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,169
Between 200 and 300.

140
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,000
Which school does he attend?

141
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,280
Hongyang Middle School.

142
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,160
Well, given this situation,

143
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,520
I'd say

144
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,840
even getting into a second-tier college would be challenging.

145
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,800
But we want him to get into a first-tier university.

146
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,440
His mother and I are both college graduates,

147
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,200
and we

148
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,420
really value our child's education.

149
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,440
But this child's

150
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,040
academic performance just won't improve.

151
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,520
Our relative's child

152
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,360
got into a first-tier university last year,

153
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,160
and we want our son to bring honor to the family too.

154
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,360
I understand.

155
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,460
But with your child's situation,

156
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,080
to be honest with you,

157
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,760
if you went to other training centers,

158
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,320
first,

159
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,980
they would reject you;

160
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,460
second,

161
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,360
they wouldn't provide

162
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,600
any guarantees for your training.

163
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,760
But coming to us is different,

164
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,120
here

165
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,160
we not only

166
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,740
provide your child

167
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,210
with one-on-one professional tutoring,

168
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,600
we'll also sign

169
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,610
a guarantee agreement.

170
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,880
A guarantee agreement?

171
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,680
That's right.

172
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,440
If exam scores don't improve,

173
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,480
full refund.

174
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,360
May I ask,

175
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,560
what's the quality of your teaching staff here,

176
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,640
to be able to make such promises?

177
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,680
That's our trade secret,

178
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:53,960
I'm afraid

179
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,120
I can't disclose that to you.

180
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,520
Sir,

181
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,600
if you've made up your mind,

182
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,360
I think

183
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,860
time is limited

184
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,000
and spots are limited too,

185
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,440
so act quickly,

186
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,240
seize this opportunity.

187
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,840
Sorry, teacher,

188
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,900
I'm still curious,

189
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,240
how can a child's grades improve so dramatically in such a short time?

190
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,570
Is there some high-tech method involved?

191
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Are you kidding me?

192
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,200
Here we have

193
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,530
teachers who predict exam questions,

194
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,410
it's all about experience.

195
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,260
Let me tell you privately,

196
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,680
our class

197
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,080
is actually

198
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,760
an exam prediction class,

199
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,760
our teachers' prediction accuracy

200
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,880
can reach 80%.

201
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,960
How much does it cost?

202
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,600
Based on

203
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,680
your requirements,

204
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,410
if we are to guarantee results,

205
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,360
we'll need to cover

206
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,400
training fees,

207
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,330
material costs,

208
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,000
plus expert instructor fees,

209
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,900
which altogether comes to...

210
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:03,920
30,000?

211
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,850
300,000.

212
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,120
You might

213
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,880
think it's expensive,

214
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,720
but

215
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,360
choosing to trust us

216
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,730
is definitely the right decision.

217
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What do you think?

218
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,680
We need to go back

219
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,120
and discuss this with my mother.

220
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,560
Okay?

221
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,400
Sure.

222
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,040
Remember,

223
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,960
we only accept

224
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,600
cash here.

225
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,880
Contact us when

226
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,960
you've made your decision.

227
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,490
Alright.

228
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,970
See you again, parents.

229
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,640
Take care.

230
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,000
Boss,

231
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,320
I really owe you one this time.

232
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,220
No problem,

233
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,860
I got to do some acting too.

234
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,260
But Jiangling,

235
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,800
what exactly are you up to?

236
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,130
This place feels weird.

237
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,320
I'm just curious.

238
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,680
Everyone says this place

239
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,640
offers great tutoring,

240
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,760
so I wanted to check it out.

241
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,240
You're not planning to go undercover, are you?

242
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,040
No way.

243
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:18,960
Nothing like that.

244
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,600
I'm just curious,

245
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,530
purely curious.

246
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,080
Come to my shop for books anytime.

247
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,640
Sure,

248
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,170
you go ahead with your work.

249
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,160
A rabbit without ears,

250
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,120
how strange.

251
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,000
Jiangling!

252
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,440
Qi Shuo,

253
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,770
what are you doing here?

254
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,610
What are you doing here?

255
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,000
I...

256
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,120
I'm studying,

257
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,520
what's wrong?

258
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,440
Can't a person work hard in secret anymore?

259
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,200
No wonder you did well on the third mock exam.

260
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,120
I thought my teaching materials were working,

261
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,200
but it turns out you've been

262
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,440
taking extra classes behind my back.

263
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,280
Both helped,

264
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,080
yours was useful,

265
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,080
and this was useful too.

266
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,880
They're really good at predicting exam questions.

267
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,320
Fine, since you've taken classes from these experts,

268
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,440
you should share what you've learned with us sometime,

269
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,500
I'd like to hear it.

270
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,640
I'm not good at teaching,

271
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,280
and they're just good at predicting questions,

272
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,940
when they predict correctly,

273
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,720
I do well on the tests.

274
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,780
They predict the third mock exam too?

275
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,560
Of course they can.

276
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,520
It happens every year.

277
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,600
How could they not predict the third mock exam?

278
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,000
Right.

279
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,160
Don't tell anyone I'm taking classes here,

280
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,240
don't tell anyone.

281
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,520
I care about my reputation,

282
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,320
you know that.

283
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:24,840
I didn't know that.

284
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,000
How could you not know?

285
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,600
Don't ruin

286
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,000
my reputation at school.

287
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,240
What reputation do you have?

288
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,560
My image

289
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,530
is pretty decent, isn't it?

290
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,220
What are you doing?

291
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,290
I'm leaving.

292
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,360
Go ahead.

293
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:41,440
Bye.

294
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,680
Let's have a self-study session

295
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,280
and work on your weak points.

296
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,050
I'll hand these out.

297
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,460
Jiang Ling.

298
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:57,880
Give it to me.

299
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,960
Shuo, what are you doing?

300
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,560
What's wrong?

301
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,970
What is this?

302
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,440
Shuo.

303
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,400
Shuo, what's wrong with you?

304
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:20,960
Qi Shuo.

305
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,060
What's wrong with you?

306
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,490
What is this?

307
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,460
It's just an earphone.

308
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,680
Earphone?

309
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,380
What exactly are you using it for?

310
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
I listen to music.

311
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,540
It's just an earphone.

312
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,220
You're using it to hear answers, aren't you?

313
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,920
Cheating?

314
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,780
Did the institution give this to you?

315
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,080
Tell me the truth.

316
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,440
Be honest.

317
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,540
Won't talk?

318
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,170
I'll hand this over to Liu Yaru.

319
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,540
Jiang Ling.

320
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,240
He's just good at predicting exam questions.

321
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,040
But actually,

322
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,240
he uses

323
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,370
wireless earphones

324
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,040
that we put in our ears

325
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,760
to avoid all detection.

326
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,080
Before the exam,

327
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,880
we put them in,

328
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,930
and then in the last 30 minutes,

329
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,800
they start

330
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,770
transmitting the answers.

331
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,080
Qi Shuo.

332
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,600
What are you doing?

333
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,000
Doing this kind of thing will get you in trouble sooner or later,

334
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,240
don't you understand?

335
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,400
I don't know either.

336
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,680
My sister signed me up

337
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,600
and won't let me get a refund.

338
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,840
Who else is participating?

339
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,640
How would I know?

340
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,040
He wouldn't tell me.

341
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,000
Who else is participating in total?

342
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,560
Wait.

343
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,240
I...

344
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,000
Let me think.

345
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,120
I heard

346
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,040
that his business

347
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:04,400
only

348
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,160
What is he?

349
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,240
serves

350
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,460
one or two schools,

351
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,520
but this year he wants

352
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:09,839
to

353
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:10,560
expand.

354
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,819
It seems they're expanding recruitment

355
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,520
to three test centers across the city.

356
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,560
The entire city?

357
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,380
Are you all insane?

358
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,560
Why did you bring him here today?

359
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,680
He asked us to come

360
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,220
to test the signal.

361
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:27,760
What signal?

362
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,820
That's enough, you can go.

363
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:30,400
Wait.

364
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,050
How could you let him leave?

365
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,640
I wasn't done asking questions.

366
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,000
He mentioned detecting signals,

367
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,730
which means.

368
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,540
there must be others at school

369
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
involved in this.

370
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,400
There must be others.

371
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,130
An Zhenzhen.

372
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,620
It's not our business.

373
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,360
Can we drop it?

374
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,560
No, but these things

375
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,120
are too much for you to handle alone.

376
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,160
He was cheating.

377
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,090
This isn't something we can solve.

378
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Do you want to call the police on him?

379
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,000
No.

380
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:00,880
But

381
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,720
there must be a way.

382
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,520
No buts.

383
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,930
The college entrance exam is coming soon.

384
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,840
Let's focus on studying.

385
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,490
Let's go.

386
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,300
Jiang Ling.

387
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,890
Gu Ming, can you hear me?

388
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,280
Can you hear what I'm saying?

389
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:49,840
Teacher,

390
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,580
I'd like to turn in my exam.

391
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,920
The person on the other end of Qi Shuo's earpiece is Gu Ming.

392
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,760
They must be testing at all nearby exam locations

393
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,000
to find

394
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,730
the position that covers the most exam rooms.

395
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,000
This way they can provide

396
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,960
answers to more people.

397
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,760
If Qi Shuo's earpiece

398
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,960
is the receiving end,

399
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,320
there must be

400
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,320
a transmitter somewhere in this area.

401
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,780
Gu Ming didn't come today,

402
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,580
which must be related to this.

403
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,120
This test failed,

404
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,240
but there will definitely be another attempt.

405
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,560
Who's there?

406
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,120
It's me,

407
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,360
Gu Ming.

408
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,960
I've been looking for you

409
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,000
for so long. Finally decided to show up.

410
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,960
Seems like

411
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,200
you've remembered everything.

412
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,240
June 6,

413
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,720
2012.

414
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,650
What happened that day?

415
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,920
Is An Zhenzhen still alive?

416
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,040
Lao Jiang,

417
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,080
have you really remembered or not?

418
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,120
Never mind that.

419
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,160
Just answer my question.

420
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,160
If you want to know the truth,

421
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,460
come to the rooftop of Revival Building.

422
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,040
Students.

423
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,640
Time flies so fast,

424
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,200
in just two days, you'll all be taking the college entrance exam.

425
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,040
I don't know

426
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,340
how you're all feeling right now.

427
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,760
Are you nervous,

428
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,360
relaxed,

429
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,120
or excited?

430
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,360
As for me,

431
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,490
I'm experiencing all three emotions.

432
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,380
I'm nervous for all of you.

433
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,000
But when I think about

434
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,260
all your hard work throughout this year,

435
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,800
I feel quite at ease.

436
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,560
Because I know each one of you

437
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,890
will do well on the exam.

438
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,640
And then I imagine

439
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,040
each and every one of you.

440
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,360
How you'll look when you get your college acceptance letter.

441
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,240
I'm truly happy for all of you.

442
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,170
Alright,

443
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,380
after saying all this,

444
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,930
I just want to tell everyone

445
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,580
to approach the college entrance exam with a calm mind.

446
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,080
Your teachers,

447
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,440
your parents,

448
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
will all be your strongest support.

449
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,680
For these final two days,

450
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,080
everyone

451
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,440
should study well at home,

452
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,320
adjust your mindset,

453
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,010
and face the exam with confidence.

454
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,580
Alright everyone,

455
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,620
see you on June 7th.

456
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,960
This class

457
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,560
is now over.

458
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,880
Class dismissed.

459
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,000
Stand up.

460
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,760
Goodbye, teacher.

461
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,450
Goodbye, everyone.

462
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:20,960
What's wrong?

463
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,400
Nothing,

464
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,180
I just really hate to say goodbye.

465
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:33,760
Yes,

466
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,860
exams are coming soon.

467
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,760
We really are

468
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,240
going our separate ways.

469
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,100
I'll miss this too.

470
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,200
Do you have something to tell me?

471
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,640
What?

472
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,620
I just wanted to say

473
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,020
good luck with your exams.

474
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,520
That's it?

475
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,680
Today might be

476
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,340
the last day we see each other.

477
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,100
And that's all you have to say?

478
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,040
Fine.

479
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:41,960
Not exactly.

480
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,360
I mainly wanted to

481
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,160
remind you.

482
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,560
Just study hard.

483
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,920
You need to get through

484
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,040
your exams safely.

485
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,120
Isn't the most important thing

486
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,850
to get through the college entrance exam safely?

487
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,650
Alright.

488
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,320
The college entrance exam

489
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,780
is indeed very important.

490
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,560
Yes.

491
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,460
The exam is important.

492
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,450
Your well-being is important too.

493
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,650
When the time comes,

494
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,840
you'll definitely get into

495
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,280
your dream university.

496
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,400
That way,

497
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,960
I can feel at ease.

498
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,560
I've never asked you

499
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,620
which university you want to attend?

500
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,600
Going to college has always been

501
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,000
my father's dream for me.

502
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,120
I just want to quietly

503
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,960
write articles that I enjoy.

504
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,840
If they can be published,

505
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,520
then great.

506
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,560
If readers appreciate them,

507
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,930
even better.

508
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,680
What if

509
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,320
you become one of my readers?

510
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,200
I'll use several pen names

511
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,080
and let you guess which one is me.

512
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:52,300
Jiangling.

513
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,520
Will we

514
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,680
ever see each other again in the future?

515
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,360
I mean

516
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,120
my future.

517
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,200
I think so.

518
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,400
Your future.

519
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,640
It's not like we'll never see each other again.

520
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,520
When it's done,

521
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,690
I'll definitely write about our experiences

522
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,120
in my novel.

523
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,360
This experience is very

524
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,370
important to me.

525
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,000
Once it's published,

526
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,360
I'll bring you a copy myself.

527
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,120
Tomorrow is the last day.

528
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,280
You should get some rest,

529
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,680
prepare yourself early.

530
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,120
Okay.

531
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:18,820
Good night.

532
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,680
It is now Beijing time

533
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,040
8:00 PM.

534
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,800
What time did it just say?

535
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,290
Weren't you listening?

536
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,690
I want you to tell me.

537
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,740
Eight o'clock.

538
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,490
How does it feel?

539
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,200
What could I possibly feel here?

540
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,320
Cold, obviously.

541
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,130
Do you remember this place?

542
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,560
Gu Ming.

543
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,600
I came here

544
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,400
to ask about An Zhenzhen.

545
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,280
An Zhenzhen.

546
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,520
You're asking me about An Zhenzhen?

547
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,440
An Zhenzhen?

548
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,490
Don't you know better than anyone?

549
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:22,560
No.

550
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,600
Are you crazy?

551
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,560
Jiangling,

552
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,920
have you forgotten

553
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:31,290
or you just don't want to remember?

554
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,660
Why are you acting so strange?

555
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,320
If you have something

556
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,240
to say, just say it, will you?

557
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:45,680
Fine,

558
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,000
then I'll help you

559
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,520
refresh your memory.
