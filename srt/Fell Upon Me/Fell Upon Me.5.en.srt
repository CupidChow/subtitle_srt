1
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,120
Sky.

2
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,560
Jiangling.

3
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,240
This is my sincere gift,

4
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,820
I hope you understand.

5
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:42,880
I'm sorry.

6
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,730
I didn't mean to.

7
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,800
Mr. Jiang just called me.

8
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,280
He said you didn't jump off the building.

9
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,440
That's wonderful!

10
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,300
Who jumped?

11
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,290
Nothing.

12
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:58,840
Well,

13
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,520
he just called and told me

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,760
he'll help me

15
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,320
and find out

16
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,780
the real cause of my death.

17
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,160
There's also another piece of news:

18
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,760
he said

19
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,400
I died at school.

20
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,440
Then you need to be careful

21
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,040
with so many people at school

22
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,100
don't eat or drink anything suspicious.

23
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,880
I can't just not eat or drink anything, can I?

24
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,680
Can't you just eat your own food?

25
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't get it.

26
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,160
I think my relationships

27
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,620
at school are pretty good,

28
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,760
who would want to harm me?

29
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,320
I'm going to sleep.

30
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,050
Who's there?

31
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,400
Don't go to sleep,

32
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,440
I'm really scared!

33
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,880
Look at this fan.

34
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,440
I remember

35
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,120
our school

36
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,160
hasn't been renovated for ages, right?

37
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,820
Do you think

38
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,440
this fan might suddenly fall down

39
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,240
and kill us?

40
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,360
Look how it's about to fall apart.

41
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,160
That's terrifying.

42
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,290
Let's get out of here

43
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,440
and not sleep in this room anymore.

44
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,200
It's too dangerous.

45
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,130
Let's go! Hurry!

46
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,120
Move it now!

47
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,460
If you don't let me sleep, I'll die first.

48
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,000
I live in Chaofeng Garden,

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,060
Building 9, Unit D.

50
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,080
Who are you?

51
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:14,840
Here.

52
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,650
Have some water.

53
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,800
Thank you.

54
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,040
I never thought

55
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,560
after all these years,

56
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,680
one of Zhenzhen's classmates would visit our home.

57
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,280
Thank you.

58
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,200
Please don't say that, auntie.

59
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,080
All of us

60
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,140
really miss Zhenzhen.

61
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,250
Is uncle home today?

62
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,760
Let me show you Zhenzhen's room.

63
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,170
It's been twelve years.

64
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:44,860
Auntie,

65
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,200
please don't see me out.

66
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,930
I'll come visit you again soon.

67
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,210
I need to ask you something.

68
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,800
Just tell me over the phone,

69
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,820
I'm quite busy.

70
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,240
Send me your address,

71
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,000
don't waste time,

72
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,930
I'll come to you.

73
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,800
Qi Shuo.

74
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,440
Jiang.

75
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,050
It really is you.

76
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,240
Over here.

77
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,160
It not only helps practice acting

78
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,960
but also entertains the public,

79
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,020
killing two birds with one stone.

80
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,280
You can act anywhere.

81
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
This doesn't mean

82
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,080
you've given up on your dream.

83
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,940
What about you?

84
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,200
I came here today

85
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,680
to ask you

86
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,160
about Qiu Qian.

87
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,400
Qiu Qian?

88
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,260
We haven't been in touch for ages.

89
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,170
Do you know where she is?

90
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,960
I do know.

91
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,280
But why are you looking for her?

92
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,540
She used to pursue you,

93
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,460
and you wouldn't even look at her.

94
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,320
Really?

95
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,650
Absolutely.

96
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
Then she probably

97
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,480
won't even look at me now.

98
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,080
I wouldn't be so sure.

99
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,880
Qiuqiu.

100
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,120
Qiuqiu.

101
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,280
Wait for me,

102
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,560
why are you ignoring me?

103
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:41,960
Are you upset?

104
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,780
Qiuqiu.

105
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,000
Princess.

106
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,080
What's wrong?

107
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,760
What is it this time?

108
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,800
You need to tell me so I'll know.

109
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,720
You need to tell me what's going on.

110
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,680
What are you guys talking about?

111
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,440
I was saying we're going for Northeastern cuisine later.

112
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,160
Sounds great!

113
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,890
Is that okay?

114
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,360
Let's order sweet and sour pork.

115
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,360
What's this about now?

116
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,200
And the three fresh vegetables dish.

117
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,920
Sure.

118
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,040
And stir-fried pork strips too.

119
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,720
Right.

120
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,000
And that frozen pear juice.

121
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,840
Perfect.

122
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,570
And there's one more thing.

123
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,720
I also want

124
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,720
sauerkraut stewed vermicelli,

125
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,780
it's super delicious.

126
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,120
What is this?

127
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:15,880
That's real.

128
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,560
What is this?

129
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,040
Did you guys see that?

130
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,420
This wasn't in my cup just now.

131
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,720
What is this?

132
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,690
Did someone come into our dorm?

133
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,240
I don't think so.

134
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,480
Did any of you touch my cup?

135
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,960
No way, we didn't.

136
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,130
Is someone trying to poison me?

137
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,120
Someone's trying to poison me.

138
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,480
What's all this noise about?

139
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,610
That's impossible.

140
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,960
Dorm supervisor,

141
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,920
An Zhenzhen claims someone put poison in her cup.

142
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,560
Poison?

143
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,960
How is that possible?

144
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,320
The dorm is so strictly monitored,

145
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,650
this is just limescale.

146
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,280
Stop arguing,

147
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,960
or I'll report this incident.

148
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,420
I'll deduct your credits.

149
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,210
Let's continue.

150
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,960
It's probably just limescale,

151
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,090
don't overthink it.

152
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,880
I just remembered there's also

153
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,680
sauerkraut with glass noodles.

154
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,440
Right.

155
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,300
And chicken stew with mushrooms.

156
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,560
I only remember that

157
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,480
the incident happened to you at school.

158
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,400
As for what exactly happened,

159
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,480
I'm not sure either.

160
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,640
I'm looking into it for you,

161
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,400
don't worry,

162
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,760
we'll find a way.

163
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,320
Qiuqiu.

164
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,080
Oh my God!

165
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,680
That's absolutely impossible.

166
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,200
Zhenzhen.

167
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,480
I didn't sleep at all last night.

168
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,680
I can tell.

169
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,760
Someone

170
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,820
tried to poison me in the dorm.

171
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,380
Someone really poisoned you?

172
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,280
Who?

173
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,480
I don't know who it is.

174
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,520
But yesterday, the way Qiu Qian looked at me

175
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,650
was really strange.

176
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,240
And her recent behavior

177
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,420
has been weird too.

178
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,140
Could it be because of you?

179
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,040
Me?

180
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:33,930
Because of what?

181
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:35,880
Who knows.

182
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,600
She's my best friend.

183
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
She would never try to get me killed.

184
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,160
But if it weren't for that phone call,

185
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,440
I might be dead by now.

186
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:46,760
No way.

187
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,320
I need to call Old Jiang again

188
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,520
to see if he has any useful information.

189
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,280
I forgot.

190
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,700
There's no thunder today.

191
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,610
Qiu Qian.

192
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,380
Do you remember me?

193
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,400
I don't.

194
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,130
I don't know you.

195
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,860
I'm Jiang Ling.

196
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,450
I transferred to your class

197
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,200
during the last semester before the college entrance exam,

198
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,600
at Hongyang High School.

199
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,450
It's okay if you don't remember me.

200
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,200
Do you remember An Zhenzhen?

201
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,040
Who is she?

202
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,810
I don't know her.

203
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:23,380
Really?

204
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,280
But I heard from An Zhenzhen

205
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,320
that back then,

206
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,400
you and that

207
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,060
Chicken Cutlet Guy

208
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,010
had a thing going on for a while.

209
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
That's bullshit!

210
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,400
When did she say that?

211
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,660
Hasn't she already...

212
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,600
Go on.

213
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,820
What about her?

214
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,770
It was over 10 years ago.

215
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,920
I've completely forgotten about it.

216
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,120
If you've forgotten,

217
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,610
you can try to remember.

218
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,720
Think about it more carefully.

219
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,320
Qianqian.

220
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,400
Qianqian, what are you doing here?

221
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,080
You're here.

222
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:55,800
Who are you?

223
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,080
Don't touch my girlfriend.

224
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:57,610
Let's go.

225
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,200
Come on.

226
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:58,880
I'm fine.

227
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,400
Kids.

228
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,400
Look here.

229
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,560
Over here.

230
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,700
I need your help

231
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,650
with something.

232
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,440
Saw the pretty girl, didn't you?

233
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,680
I did see her,

234
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,240
but she's changed so much

235
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,000
I barely recognized her.

236
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,160
These days she's always

237
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,200
hanging out with those sketchy people.

238
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,080
Smoking and drinking.

239
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,000
Bad habits.

240
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,000
And those boyfriends she's been with,

241
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,660
I don't approve of any of them.

242
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,650
I don't like seeing her either.

243
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,850
What about her parents?

244
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,720
No idea.

245
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,120
Oh, right.

246
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,920
Recently,

247
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,640
I'm writing a novel based on An Zhenzhen,

248
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,460
and I need your advice.

249
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,290
You write books?

250
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,050
You're a writer?

251
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,260
Can't you tell?

252
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,160
Want to be famous?

253
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,640
Why are you bothering me?

254
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,970
Don't disturb my sleep.

255
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,800
Please help me.

256
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,000
My intuition tells me

257
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,650
she definitely has first-hand information.

258
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,260
Then go find her again.

259
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,160
She ignores me,

260
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,090
we're not close.

261
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,440
You two aren't close,

262
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,520
are we close?

263
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,300
Qi Shuo.

264
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,360
Your great kindness

265
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,420
I'll never forget.

266
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,560
If the book becomes popular,

267
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,660
the royalties,

268
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,530
I'll split them with you fifty-fifty.

269
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:01,400
Okay.

270
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,580
You know me so well.

271
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,480
So,

272
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,250
Qiu Qian, right?

273
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,450
The key issue is that

274
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
Qiu Qian is guarding against me now,

275
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,480
she's become wary of me,

276
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,010
I need to find another reason to approach her.

277
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,240
Any ideas?

278
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,760
You should go talk to our former class monitor,

279
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,440
Gu Ming.

280
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,220
Gu Ming?

281
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,530
Why would I go to him?

282
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,480
How could he help?

283
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,920
Didn't our monitor always say

284
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,840
that anytime,

285
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,520
no matter what problem you have,

286
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,450
you can always go to him for advice.

287
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,760
Besides, our monitor

288
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,960
is the most successful one in our class,

289
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,360
high salary at a big company,

290
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
and even has a PhD,

291
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,410
my goodness!

292
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,120
Alright,

293
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,050
no need to mention the high salary.

294
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,970
Let me tell you guys,

295
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,900
in this school,

296
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:05,960
there's a pair of sister beauties.

297
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
Really gorgeous.

298
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,000
One is called

299
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,050
An Zhenzhen.

300
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,600
The other is Qiu Qian.

301
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,920
A few days ago,

302
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:12,920
a buddy of mine

303
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,250
tried to hit on them.

304
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,560
Got rejected right away.

305
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,200
He's no good.

306
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,130
No chance at all.

307
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:18,760
But you know,

308
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,000
who am I?

309
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,840
When it comes to picking up girls,

310
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,040
when have I ever lost?

311
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,760
That's right!

312
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,600
In a few days,

313
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,200
you'll all be calling those sister beauties

314
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,080
your sisters-in-law.

315
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,640
Kong.

316
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,040
How do I

317
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:29,760
pay?

318
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,880
Why is there

319
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,940
so much left today?

320
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:33,840
Can't you see?

321
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,880
There's something dirty.

322
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,880
Something dirty?

323
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,840
Where is anything dirty?

324
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,100
It's perfectly clean.

325
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,380
Who are you talking about?

326
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,600
Let's keep things friendly.

327
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,200
He's just a high school student.

328
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,200
What's it to you?

329
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,200
Don't get physical,

330
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,600
let's talk this through.

331
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,280
Stay right there.

332
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,340
Stay where you are.

333
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,740
High school student, huh?

334
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,580
I despise high school students the most.

335
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,680
Because you couldn't get in, right?

336
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,000
Such a dirty mouth.

337
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,240
Want me to wash it out for you?

338
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:09,700
Bring it on.

339
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,880
Boss!

340
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,240
Are you okay?

341
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,520
Get him!

342
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,080
Stop it!

343
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,000
I've already called the police,

344
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,530
they'll be here any minute.

345
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,370
You'll pay for this!

346
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,770
Are you alright?

347
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,500
If you ever need anything,

348
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
you can talk to me.

349
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,090
Old Kong,

350
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,800
bring me a bowl of noodles.

351
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:01,730
Coming right up!

352
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,360
You know,

353
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,560
Noodles are here!

354
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,820
as your class monitor,

355
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,810
I don't really know much about you.

356
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,200
What college are you planning to apply for?

357
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,400
I haven't decided yet,

358
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,260
what about you?

359
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,820
I want to go to Beijing.

360
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,840
Beijing,

361
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,770
great place,

362
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,740
just a bit far away.

363
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,360
I don't want to spend my life

364
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,120
mediocrely stuck in this place.

365
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,920
In the future,

366
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,320
I want to study quantum physics.

367
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,580
I think space-time

368
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,480
is a fascinating concept.

369
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,280
I want to understand it completely.

370
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:40,920
Good luck.

371
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,580
What about you?

372
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:45,930
I've noticed you

373
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,360
always reading extracurricular books in class.

374
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,090
Don't worry,

375
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,050
I haven't told the teacher.

376
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:53,900
When I was younger,

377
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,520
I also loved literature.

378
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,020
As I grew up, I realized

379
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,480
I probably don't have talent in that area.

380
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,340
Like that book Zhenzhen gave you,

381
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,120
Ulysses.

382
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,080
I read it several times and still couldn't understand it.

383
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,410
Actually, literature,

384
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,720
for me,

385
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,520
is something that helps me calm my mind.

386
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,960
It allows me to calm down

387
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,600
and think about

388
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,720
more meaningful things.

389
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,680
There's less than 100 days until the college entrance exam.

390
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,280
Recently,

391
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,080
I've noticed you and An Zhenzhen

392
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,770
have been getting quite close.

393
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,680
I hope you two can

394
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,900
learn from each other.

395
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,100
If you have any questions,

396
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,400
you can always ask me.

397
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,100
Let's eat the noodles.

398
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:54,760
Eat up,

399
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,400
it's on me.

400
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,460
You're not eating?

401
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,080
I don't like noodles.

402
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,800
My dad wants to buy me an apartment near school

403
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,330
so my mom can take care of me,

404
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,340
but I don't want to live with them.

405
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,280
They'd be controlling me every day.

406
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,340
Don't you think so?

407
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,880
She's been talking about moving out for three years now,

408
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,520
but I've never seen her actually move out.

409
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,380
She should get some new material.

410
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,600
She just loves being treated like royalty,

411
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,200
too used to being a princess.

412
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,920
I actually used to like her,

413
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,040
but she's getting more and more annoying lately.

414
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,560
I guess

415
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,920
An Zhenzhen is probably the only one

416
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,040
in our dorm who still wants to hang out with her.

417
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,500
But there are tons of guys chasing after her,

418
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,800
lined up from middle school to high school.

419
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,320
But I heard

420
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,320
that An Zhenzhen seems to be having a conflict with her lately.

421
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,780
Because of that newcomer.

422
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,440
Really?

423
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,000
Tell me what's going on

424
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,640
quickly.

425
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,040
My shoes are worn out,

426
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,370
can you buy me a new pair?

427
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,490
Didn't we just buy those last year?

428
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,200
You can make do with them a bit longer.

429
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,660
But why does my brother always get new shoes?

430
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,360
Your brother gets good grades,

431
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,520
that's his reward.

432
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,440
But I don't want to be laughed at by my classmates.

433
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,370
Don't be so vain.

434
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,040
College entrance exams are coming up soon,

435
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,640
focus on your studies.

436
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,140
I'm not being vain.

437
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:08,880
Enough,

438
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,880
we'll talk when you get home.

439
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,800
Qiu Qian!

440
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,000
One more!

441
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,240
Qiu Qian!

442
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,440
One more!

443
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,400
Nice shot!

444
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,440
One more!

445
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:57,480
Sorry.

446
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:58,920
It's okay.

447
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,970
Are you alright?

448
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:13,840
Nice shot!

449
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,520
Qiu Qian!

450
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,760
One more!

451
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,920
Qiu Qian!

452
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,000
One more!

453
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,080
I got it!

454
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,560
Come on!

455
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,480
Zhenzhen!

456
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,810
Are you okay, Zhenzhen?

457
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
How are you doing?

458
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:56,640
One, two!

459
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,320
Go!

460
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,360
An Zhenzhen!

461
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,020
Great shot!

462
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:02,970
An Zhenzhen!

463
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:03,720
Nice one!

464
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:05,400
Well done!

465
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,200
One more time!

466
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,080
Qiu Qian!

467
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,240
Another one!

468
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,000
Great job!

469
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:21,920
Keep going!

470
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,920
You can do it!

471
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,720
I'm learning from you all!

472
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,240
Great!

473
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,960
Let's talk tomorrow.

474
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,140
Is that you, Jiang?

475
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,000
What's up?

476
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,690
I need to ask you something.

477
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,570
Lately, Qiuqiu has been

478
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,290
acting really strange.

479
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,330
I've noticed

480
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,400
I understand her less and less.

481
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,160
My heart is

482
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,440
constantly in turmoil.

483
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:49,640
Every day

484
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,200
I live in fear.

485
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,000
If you're really worried about safety,

486
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,080
go learn some moves from Jiang Ling.

487
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,600
I knew some martial arts back in the day.

488
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,400
Besides this,

489
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,680
do you have any new leads

490
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,010
you could share with me?

491
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,840
Qiu Qian.

492
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:02,720
I just met her.

493
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,680
When I mentioned your name to her,

494
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,360
she had a strong reaction.

495
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,960
I feel like there's something

496
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,160
she's hiding from me.

497
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,560
What's she doing now?

498
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:13,890
Working at a nightclub,

499
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,180
dancing there.

500
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,730
Dancing at a nightclub?

501
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,040
How could Qiu Qiu possibly be dancing at a nightclub?

502
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,100
Are you kidding me?

503
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,120
I don't know what happened after,

504
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,640
but she's definitely at the nightclub.

505
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,280
Anyway,

506
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,040
be careful.

507
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,360
Okay.
