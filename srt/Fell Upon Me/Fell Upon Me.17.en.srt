1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,640
Time: 8:30-11:00

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,160
Day

3
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,680
About An Zhenzhen

4
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,600
Actually, this incident

5
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,890
was a huge shock to me back then too.

6
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,440
The director came running to tell me that something had happened to An Zhenzhen,

7
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,800
that she had already been taken to the hospital.

8
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,460
But when I got to the hospital,

9
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,660
An Zhenzhen...

10
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,570
The incident with the stolen milk money back then

11
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,919
I've always felt that

12
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,080
all of An Zhenzhen's misfortunes afterward

13
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,340
began from that point.

14
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,280
Back then, we were all concerned about college entrance exam pressure,

15
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,079
not wanting this incident to affect your studies.

16
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,820
I didn't firmly believe in her

17
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,620
or consider her feelings,

18
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,700
which ultimately led to the tragedy.

19
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,160
Teacher Liu

20
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,720
After all these years,

21
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,560
you shouldn't

22
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,570
blame yourself so much.

23
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,720
I have something here

24
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,800
that might help you.

25
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,480
These are

26
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,920
things I confiscated from An Zhenzhen in class back then,

27
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,380
messages that everyone wrote to each other.

28
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,960
I never thought

29
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,810
I was so naive back then.

30
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,040
This three-wheeler group

31
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,420
is now down to just a unicycle.

32
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,240
Lao Jiang,

33
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,620
what's your point in showing me this?

34
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,040
I just don't understand

35
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,760
why you artistic creators

36
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,480
are so obsessed with finding the truth.

37
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,880
Isn't it better to mix

38
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,960
fact with fiction?

39
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,560
Is knowing the absolute truth

40
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,240
really that important?

41
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,610
It's not about whether it's important

42
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,250
it's about you, Qi Shuo.

43
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,960
Do you really plan

44
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,840
to live your entire life

45
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
being only 30% genuine and 70% fake?

46
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,880
Are you going to keep hiding like this forever?

47
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,360
Qi Shuo.

48
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,720
If I were you,

49
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
I would have told the truth long ago.

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,800
You're still the same as before,

51
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,720
always running away.

52
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,800
Let me tell you,

53
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,420
yes, I did cause An Zhenzhen's death,

54
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,080
so what?

55
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,060
Are you satisfied now?

56
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,560
Happy now?

57
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,210
These past few days,

58
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,820
I found some things

59
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,960
that Zhenzhen probably left behind before she passed away.

60
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,420
She prepared them for you.

61
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,960
If you still care,

62
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,420
come meet me

63
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,090
at this place tomorrow.

64
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,280
I'm full,

65
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:11,930
gotta go.

66
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,640
What is this?

67
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,580
Take a look and you'll see.

68
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,080
This is what

69
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,780
you wrote to her back then.

70
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,250
If you still care about her,

71
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,920
meet at

72
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,090
the Wishing Tree tomorrow.

73
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,520
I hope

74
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,000
the Mayan prophecy fails,

75
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,080
and 2012 isn't the end of the world.

76
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,200
All living creatures

77
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,800
can

78
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,280
multiply and thrive,

79
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,240
and the world will be at peace.

80
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,560
When you say that,

81
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,880
what are Qianqian and I supposed to wish for?

82
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,360
I'm not into all that fancy talk.

83
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,200
I hope

84
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,000
I can marry into a good family,

85
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,640
someone rich,

86
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,320
who treats me well,

87
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,919
handsome,

88
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,820
with long legs,

89
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,059
like Lee Min-ho would be perfect.

90
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,240
I must get into the Film Academy.

91
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,520
I want to be a great actor,

92
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,120
a big star.

93
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,720
The big star Qi Shuo.

94
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,850
Do you remember this place?

95
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,760
The four of us

96
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,040
met right here.

97
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,960
Back then,

98
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,360
we made wishes at that wishing tree.

99
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,920
Looking back now,

100
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,920
it doesn't seem very effective.

101
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,650
Go ahead,

102
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,960
what is it?

103
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,560
This letter

104
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,480
was written by An Zhenzhen

105
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,410
to you back then.

106
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,690
It's been twelve years,

107
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,520
and finally

108
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,500
it's returned to its rightful owner.

109
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,080
She wrote this to me?

110
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
Dear Qiuqiu,

111
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,740
time flies so fast.

112
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,920
As I pick up my pen

113
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,240
to write these words,

114
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,520
my heart

115
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,680
is filled with reluctance to say goodbye.

116
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,560
I cherish

117
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,320
the sweat we shed

118
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,700
during every game.

119
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,640
It's okay.

120
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,240
Don't worry,

121
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:57,960
don't get discouraged,

122
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,620
keep going!

123
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,680
Nice shot!

124
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,200
Great shot!

125
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,160
Qiu Qian,

126
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,320
do it again!

127
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,080
One, two,

128
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,880
you can do it!

129
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,160
An Zhenzhen,

130
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,080
nice shot!

131
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,040
One more time!

132
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:22,960
Go for it!

133
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,760
I need to learn from you all,

134
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,240
you're amazing!

135
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,400
Every night

136
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,760
we spent together

137
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,440
sharing our little secrets.

138
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,080
Every time

139
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,560
when school breaks came,

140
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,120
you and I

141
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,360
hugged each other reluctantly.

142
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,800
All these moments make me feel

143
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,480
that time

144
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,370
really flies by so quickly.

145
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,920
But parting

146
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:50,140
is a necessary path in our growth.

147
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,800
I believe

148
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,080
that for the future,

149
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,600
you have unlimited potential

150
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,330
and courage.

151
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,880
My dear princess,

152
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,240
your knight

153
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,880
will always protect you.

154
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,440
No matter if the road ahead

155
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,240
is smooth

156
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,440
or rough,

157
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,640
I believe

158
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,180
you will walk it with determination.

159
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,000
You know,

160
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,940
I will always protect you.

161
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:12,920
Even

162
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,850
from places you cannot see.

163
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,960
Your best friend,

164
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,760
An Zhenzhen.

165
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,400
I never thought

166
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,330
I was so handsome back then.

167
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,840
In my prime.

168
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,800
Dear Shuo,

169
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,330
actually...

170
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,800
As I write this letter,

171
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,440
my heart is

172
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,360
filled with mixed emotions.

173
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,080
Thinking about these years,

174
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,880
while all of us

175
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,610
were buried in our studies,

176
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,560
you were completely absorbed in your film magazines.

177
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,120
But it's precisely because of this

178
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,480
that I firmly believe in you,

179
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,940
that you'll get into your dream film school.

180
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Although deep down

181
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,450
I've always thought you were amazing,

182
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,520
on the surface

183
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,690
I was always giving you a hard time.

184
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,460
Graduation

185
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,660
is a new beginning.

186
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,720
I believe you

187
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,520
will definitely achieve your dreams.

188
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,880
As a future star,

189
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,720
you'll certainly use your talent

190
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,920
to win over your fans.

191
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,920
Finally,

192
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,200
I've

193
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,210
always wanted to apologize to you.

194
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,640
About what happened before,

195
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,500
I didn't consider your feelings.

196
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Adults' problems

197
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,800
should be solved by themselves.

198
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,440
But I

199
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,970
was just wallowing in my own emotions.

200
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,800
I took all my negative feelings

201
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,560
out on my best friend.

202
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,120
I don't know

203
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,320
how to face it.

204
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,520
But I hope

205
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,800
that someday,

206
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,000
we can be like before again,

207
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,600
laughing together without any grudges.

208
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,080
To pick up that

209
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,240
most precious friendship

210
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,370
in our hearts again.

211
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,040
Your friend,

212
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,120
An Zhenzhen.

213
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,680
May 14,

214
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,320
2012.

215
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,000
Actually,

216
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,180
I'm the one who should apologize.

217
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,260
Jiangling,

218
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,920
I'm sorry.

219
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,850
It's because I was a coward,

220
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,560
I ran away.

221
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,360
So,

222
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,330
I chose to hide the truth all along.

223
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:48,800
I know

224
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,700
the mistakes I made in the past

225
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,160
don't deserve forgiveness.

226
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,240
I also know

227
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,760
past mistakes can never be covered up.

228
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,720
So,

229
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,180
these twelve years

230
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,500
have passed in the blink of an eye.

231
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,440
Even though

232
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,860
it's hard for me to speak about it.

233
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,850
But I should have come here long ago

234
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,280
to clear An Zhenzhen's name.

235
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,200
After all these years,

236
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,880
whenever

237
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,740
An Zhenzhen's name is mentioned,

238
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,120
I always feel

239
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,920
an overwhelming sense of guilt.

240
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,960
Like deep ravines

241
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
separating me

242
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,760
from my past memories,

243
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,090
making it impossible to let go.

244
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,960
That's also why after graduation,

245
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,320
Qi Shuo and I gradually lost touch.

246
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,120
We both seemed

247
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,330
to be running away from something,

248
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,240
hoping time would heal everything.

249
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,440
That's why

250
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,770
I've been avoiding you,

251
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,520
I couldn't face you.

252
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,530
Because I was afraid of stirring up old memories.

253
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,760
But now I understand

254
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,520
that running away solves nothing.

255
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,920
I need to face it bravely,

256
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,599
no matter how difficult

257
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,140
or painful it might be.

258
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,079
I can do this.

259
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,760
I need to give myself

260
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,880
and An Zhenzhen closure.

261
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,000
Back then,

262
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,680
I was the one who framed An Zhenzhen.

263
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,640
I took 200 yuan

264
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,040
and planted it in her bag.

265
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,660
I deliberately set her up.

266
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,960
Because she accused my sister.

267
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,620
Your sister

268
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,890
destroyed someone else's family.

269
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,640
Your sister is a homewrecker

270
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,840
who destroys other people's families.

271
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,060
Do you understand?

272
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,680
What are you staring at?

273
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,880
An Zhenzhen,

274
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
what evidence do you have

275
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,920
to falsely accuse my sister?

276
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,650
My sister is not a homewrecker.

277
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,040
At least I thought

278
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,880
she was falsely accusing my sister.

279
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,520
You know,

280
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,960
I don't have many relatives,

281
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,600
I only have my sister.

282
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,800
I wanted her to feel

283
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,860
what it's like to be falsely accused.

284
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,320
But I never expected

285
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,720
things would turn out this way.

286
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,280
All the money disappeared.

287
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,320
When I think about

288
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,120
how I might have pushed her to the edge,

289
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,400
I can't sleep night after night.

290
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,580
Every time I close my eyes,

291
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,690
I see Zhenzhen on that rooftop.

292
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,200
Qi Shuo and I

293
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,080
used to be An Zhenzhen's best friends.

294
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,320
But between us,

295
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,280
one framed her,

296
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,720
and the other never spoke up for her.

297
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,280
About the milk money,

298
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,320
I saw everything.

299
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,040
I saw Qi Shuo

300
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,280
secretly hiding the money

301
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,480
in Zhenzhen's pencil case.

302
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,210
But I was too afraid to speak up,

303
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,400
I was also out of my mind back then.

304
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,360
Because a thug

305
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,800
was extorting money from me,

306
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,480
so I also thought about stealing money.

307
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,040
Qi Shuo saw me,

308
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,160
and we covered for each other.

309
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,800
Later, the situation got worse and worse,

310
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
and An Zhenzhen became the suspect.

311
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,000
But we didn't dare say a word.

312
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,640
Do you

313
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,320
know how that money

314
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,560
disappeared?

315
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,690
I don't know either.

316
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,210
But knowing about the money doesn't matter anymore.

317
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,680
It's my fault.

318
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,920
An Zhenzhen was my best friend.

319
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,450
It was because of my cowardice,

320
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,400
because I was jealous of her.

321
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,380
The knot in your hearts

322
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,280
being untied at this tree

323
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,080
is perhaps heaven's

324
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,810
best arrangement for you both.

325
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,960
Then my mission

326
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,560
is also complete.

327
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,740
Since that's the case,

328
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,880
let's finish what we started.

329
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,810
You should write

330
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,520
everything you want to tell her

331
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,400
on it.

332
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,010
Whether she can hear you or not,

333
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:28,840
tell her.

334
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,160
You and An Zhenzhen are still at odds.

335
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,120
Should we still ask her to come to the wishing tree tomorrow?

336
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,650
Of course I want to call her,

337
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,800
but I'm afraid she won't forgive me.

338
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,880
I wrote this note.

339
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,220
What are you afraid of?

340
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,700
Are you a man or not?

341
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,320
An Zhenzhen is your good friend,

342
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,560
what's there to be scared about?

343
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,920
Qianqian, you're my good friend too,

344
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,120
can you give it to her for me?

345
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:26,980
Do it yourself.

346
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,840
Qianqian!

347
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,560
An Zhenzhen,

348
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,680
I hope you can come to my birthday party tomorrow.

349
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,520
It's at the Wishing Tree,

350
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,720
be there or be square.

351
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,320
Qian,

352
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,180
what do you want to eat?

353
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,280
Let's go.

354
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,040
Let's get some stir-fry.

355
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,160
Selected Plays by Brecht.

356
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,120
I'm just browsing.

357
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,720
Take another look.

358
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,850
I'll look again too.

359
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,920
I'll go check over there.

360
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,200
Zhenzhen.

361
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,240
Are you free this weekend,

362
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,700
want to hang out together?

363
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:53,960
Weekend.

364
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,660
I'm available both Saturday and Sunday.

365
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,200
Great.

366
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,120
Where should we go?

367
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,380
I haven't decided yet.

368
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,120
Let me think about it.

369
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,840
Let's go.

370
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,640
I've got an idea.

371
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,000
That food street we went to last time,

372
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,080
we didn't finish exploring it.

373
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
There's this crispy tofu place there

374
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,240
that I missed last time,

375
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,520
and I really want to try it now.

376
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,760
Then let's go together.

377
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,440
Sounds good.

378
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,240
I need to leave early today then.

379
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,960
I still have my math and physics notes

380
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,000
that I haven't written up yet.

381
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,080
I'll need to work faster when I get home

382
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,280
to finish all of them.

383
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,640
Go ahead.

384
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,420
Qiuqiu.

385
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,160
See you tomorrow.

386
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,690
Bye-bye.

387
00:25:59,360 --> 00:25:59,960
Qianqian.

388
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,520
Don't go.

389
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:02,810
You know,

390
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,880
we've been celebrating together all these years,

391
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,400
but this year she's not here,

392
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,320
and I feel

393
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,120
uncomfortable about it,

394
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,760
so

395
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,720
I was hoping you could

396
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,400
help me.

397
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,520
This matter

398
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,810
is something you need to handle yourself.

399
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,800
Zhenzhen.

400
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,760
Zhenzhen.

401
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,650
Why are you walking so fast?

402
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,440
I told you

403
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,080
I need to get home early today.

404
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,010
Are you really not going tomorrow?

405
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,090
I can't manage without you.

406
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
That idiot Qi Shuo

407
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,450
definitely won't be able to handle it.

408
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,560
I didn't notice that.

409
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,160
He seemed pretty happy to me.

410
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,860
Whether he's in a good mood or not,

411
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,200
don't you know by now?

412
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,520
Then you should comfort him

413
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,980
at his birthday party.

414
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,440
Zhenzhen.

415
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,360
If you don't go tomorrow,

416
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,640
Qi Shuo won't be happy

417
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,400
at his birthday party.

418
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,500
I'm going home.

419
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,040
Take that!

420
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,240
Take that!

421
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
Do you surrender?

422
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,840
Do you surrender?

423
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,320
I won't surrender,

424
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,280
absolutely not!

425
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,640
No surrender.

426
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,240
Hit Zhenzhen.

427
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Do you surrender?

428
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,820
I won't surrender.

429
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,120
Ouch! That hit you just gave me

430
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,850
really hurt.

431
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,800
Qianqian, you have to help me!

432
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,520
It's not fair for you two to gang up on me.

433
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,800
You're so big,

434
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,920
what's wrong with us teaming up against you?

435
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,080
Exactly.

436
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,960
I think we're good like this.

437
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,660
From now on,

438
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,440
no matter when,

439
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,000
if we three have an argument,

440
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,320
and someone offers a way out,

441
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,490
the other person

442
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,290
must take it.

443
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,380
We should be friends for life.

444
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,440
Absolutely.

445
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,160
You must apologize to me first.

446
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,740
Let me go first.

447
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:49,680
I will never

448
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,010
argue with my princess.

449
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,880
Because I want to be your most loyal knight.

450
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,240
But Shuo,

451
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,360
if you make me angry,

452
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,040
one day

453
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,330
is all we can stay mad at each other.

454
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,880
I'll definitely be fine.

455
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,240
If I'm given a way out,

456
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,800
I'll take it in a heartbeat.

457
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,170
It's mainly you two,

458
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,520
both with tempers

459
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:08,360
so hot.

460
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,400
Besides,

461
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,720
how am I hot-tempered?

462
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,580
Hot-tempered.

463
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,880
If that's not hot-tempered, what is?

464
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,440
Wait,

465
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:14,240
wait,

466
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,760
I'm going to make a wish.

467
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,960
Give me a big balloon.

468
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:17,720
I wish

469
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,180
that the three of us

470
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,160
will become more and more...

471
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Qi Shuo!

472
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,080
Cheating!

473
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,120
He's cheating!

474
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,250
Get him! Get him!

475
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,080
Let me tell you,

476
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,140
I'm all rested now.

477
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,960
Close the door.

478
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,600
I'm late.

479
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,500
Are you busy tomorrow?

480
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,000
I'm afraid so.

481
00:29:59,160 --> 00:29:59,560
No.

482
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,650
That's perfect.

483
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,440
I learned some

484
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,180
barbecue skills from my aunt.

485
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,400
Let's go have a barbecue

486
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,000
tomorrow,

487
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,540
the Wishing Tree spot is perfect.

488
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,810
Sounds good.

489
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,080
But will it be

490
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
just the two of us?

491
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,320
Yeah,

492
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
we can figure out

493
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,130
how to make it taste good first.

494
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,450
Okay.

495
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,170
Let's go.

496
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,740
Jiangling.

497
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,120
I'm already here.

498
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,320
Where are you?

499
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,840
I don't see you anywhere.

500
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
In your backpack,

501
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
all ready for you.

502
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,400
In my backpack?

503
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,620
What backpack?

504
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,960
This person isn't standing me up, is he?

505
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,160
My backpack...

506
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,960
What's in my backpack?

507
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,690
My backpack.

508
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,640
The birthday cake I bought you,

509
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,440
do you like it?

510
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,480
It looks nice.

511
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,890
Why are you so gloomy on your birthday?

512
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,520
I'm not.
