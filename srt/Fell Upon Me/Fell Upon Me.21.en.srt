1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,240
Time: 8:30-11:00

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,120
Day

3
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,080
Just say

4
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,380
what you want to say, will you?

5
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,200
Sure,

6
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
let me help you

7
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,960
remember.

8
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,079
You need to prepare yourself,

9
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,000
your mother doesn't have

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,880
much time left.

11
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,000
The patient's condition is complicated,

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,960
by the time it was discovered,

13
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,320
we had already missed the optimal treatment window.

14
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,720
Now it has essentially progressed to

15
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,120
a late-stage condition.

16
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,840
The survival rate for pancreatic cancer

17
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,560
globally speaking

18
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,400
is quite low.

19
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,240
Sometimes that's just how things are,

20
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,520
even if you've made every possible effort,

21
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,600
you may need to prepare yourself

22
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,880
for the worst outcome.

23
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,920
Since we started the treatment,

24
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,280
the numbers on the bills

25
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,160
have been growing

26
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,760
endlessly.

27
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,780
Where's my father?

28
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,930
He disappeared.

29
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,160
Didn't we just pay

30
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
20,000 last month?

31
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,480
How did it run out so quickly?

32
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,840
I'll find a way to pay it all as soon as possible.

33
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,520
The money my mom had hidden away,

34
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
the money borrowed from relatives,

35
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,720
it's all gone now.

36
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,880
Sometimes,

37
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,370
what's more frightening than the disease

38
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,370
is my own helplessness.

39
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,960
Everyone, please leave the milk money

40
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,720
on the table,

41
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,880
I'm coming down to collect it now.

42
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,079
I keep telling myself

43
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,560
there must be something I can do.

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,880
There must be something I can do.

45
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,640
Thank you, Teacher Liu.

46
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,160
Let's go.

47
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,560
Thank you, class monitor.

48
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:32,840
Take it easy.

49
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,160
The school student council

50
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,220
will inspect the classroom hygiene.

51
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,280
Zhenzhen, you should get some rest.

52
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,480
I'll head back first.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
If you really think I took the money,

54
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,940
then come at me.

55
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,200
Jiangling.

56
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,280
She ran away,

57
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,920
she feels guilty.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,920
Classmates,

59
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,040
An Zhenzhen has been

60
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,840
your classmate for three years.

61
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,960
I'm just a transfer student.

62
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,480
I don't know her as well as you do.

63
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,760
You should know her character better than I do,

64
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,450
and her family background.

65
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,820
Would she steal money?

66
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,880
Look! Someone's about to jump off the building!

67
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,840
Who is it?

68
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,360
Someone's jumping!

69
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,960
An Zhenzhen.

70
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,360
An Zhenzhen.

71
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,080
The money's been found.

72
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,480
So,

73
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,380
have you made up your mind?

74
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
Seems like you haven't decided yet.

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,260
I'll give you more time

76
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,730
to think it through.

77
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:10,880
Wait!

78
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,560
Loser pays.

79
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,320
Let's do it.

80
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:18,680
Come on.

81
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,080
Let's go.

82
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,160
Rock, paper, scissors.

83
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,920
You're paying.

84
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,600
Your treat.

85
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,280
Hurry up.

86
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,120
A bet's a bet.

87
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,760
Come on.

88
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:26,760
Fair is fair.

89
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,640
Then I can only buy one.

90
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,610
You can officially join us now.

91
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,280
Let's meet and talk.

92
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,050
As soon as possible.

93
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,000
I need cash.

94
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,640
No problem.

95
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,810
See you soon.

96
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,560
Doctor.

97
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,100
10,000 per injection.

98
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,440
Initially, you need to prepare 100,000,

99
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,320
and once the entire process is completed,

100
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,080
you'll need to prepare

101
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,040
at least 1 million yuan.

102
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,760
If you've got the guts, sell your father

103
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,490
and see if he's worth a million.

104
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,400
Look,

105
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,000
right now

106
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,840
from this spot

107
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,010
to this spot,

108
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,860
I think that should be enough.

109
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,440
What do you think?

110
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,980
If we expand the signal range,

111
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,440
could we make more money?

112
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,159
I've thought about this before.

113
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,920
The range is only this small.

114
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,560
Beyond this range,

115
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,850
it probably won't work.

116
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,680
I have a solution.

117
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,060
And our current equipment can handle it.

118
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,320
But,

119
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,090
I need 1 million.

120
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,820
Renaissance Building

121
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,340
is the location I've carefully calculated.

122
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,560
Only from here

123
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,490
can we broadcast

124
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,650
a signal covering all exam sites across the city.

125
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,250
Twelve years ago

126
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,500
I planned to be here

127
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,530
to give the college entrance exam answers

128
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,440
to all students who paid me.

129
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,170
I've got it open.

130
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,920
Is there a signal over there?

131
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,210
Let me adjust it.

132
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:36,840
Gu Ming,

133
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,880
what are you doing?

134
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,080
Mind your own business.

135
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,520
Put that down,

136
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,250
come with me.

137
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,940
I know you've been investigating me.

138
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,050
I'm begging you.

139
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,080
I'm trying to help you.

140
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
No one can help me.

141
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,280
We all know

142
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
your mother is seriously ill

143
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,520
and your family needs money.

144
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,080
Just tell us,

145
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,560
we're classmates,

146
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,620
we'll all help you.

147
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,840
Everyone knows I need money,

148
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,760
but this is money to save my mother's life.

149
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,360
Jiang Ling, I'm begging you.

150
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,400
Let's go.

151
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,080
Please, I'm begging you.

152
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,520
Come with me.

153
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,040
Step back.

154
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,700
Jiangling.

155
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,400
Gu Ming.

156
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,760
No,

157
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,340
what are you doing?

158
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,280
I'll handle this,

159
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,160
you need to go now.

160
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:16,520
Wait,

161
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,220
tell me what he's doing first.

162
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,040
He's the one from that organization

163
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,500
who passes on the answers.

164
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,380
He's holding a signal device.

165
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,130
Gu Ming, what are you doing?

166
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,880
What are you doing?

167
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,560
Are you crazy!

168
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,890
Stay back, An Zhenzhen!

169
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,680
I know you need help,

170
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,160
I can help you.

171
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,520
I can go to my parents,

172
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,000
they treat you like family,

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,080
they'll help you too.

174
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,000
Everything can be solved.

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,660
Everything can be worked out.

176
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,730
Your family can solve this?

177
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,560
Your dad

178
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,200
is rich,

179
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,680
he can easily cover up your mess.

180
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,250
But An Zhenzhen,

181
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,490
your family helping me,

182
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,770
isn't that ridiculous?

183
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,180
Also, An Zhenzhen,

184
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,720
I stole the milk money.

185
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,380
I apologize to you.

186
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,640
Stop talking,

187
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,120
Gu Ming!

188
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,050
Don't be foolish like me, okay?

189
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,280
These things aren't worth it at all.

190
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,160
Give me the signaling device.

191
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,490
Step back, An Zhenzhen.

192
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,680
I'll split the money with you

193
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,360
if you let me go.

194
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:28,800
Is that okay, Zhenzhen?

195
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,680
Are you crazy?

196
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,200
Gu Ming, this is stolen money.

197
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,520
You're committing a crime.

198
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,640
Your life will be ruined because of this.

199
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,200
My life is already ruined.

200
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,080
You don't have a gambling father

201
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,210
or a mother lying in a hospital bed.

202
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:46,890
An Zhenzhen.

203
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,530
I'm begging you,

204
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,490
please let me go.

205
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,840
Gu Ming, don't back up anymore,

206
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,970
it's too dangerous.

207
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,760
It's really dangerous.

208
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,520
Come over here first,

209
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,850
we can talk about whatever's on your mind.

210
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,810
An Zhenzhen.

211
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:14,960
I'm tired.

212
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:15,900
Goodbye

213
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,780
Gu Ming.

214
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,420
Gu Ming.

215
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,760
Go ahead.

216
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,080
An Zhenzhen,

217
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,080
she really...

218
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,080
That's right,

219
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,540
An Zhenzhen fell down,

220
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,700
are you satisfied now?

221
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,570
It happened right here.

222
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,460
Right here.

223
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,050
Do you see it?

224
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,020
This is where she fell.

225
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:51,960
Can you see it?

226
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,500
Are you satisfied now?

227
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,300
Weren't you the one who brought her here?

228
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,170
You don't remember.

229
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:02,960
She's dead.

230
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,490
You became a famous writer,

231
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,930
you don't remember.

232
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
That's impossible.

233
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,640
Smile.

234
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,400
Smile.

235
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,730
I'm not a famous writer,

236
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,400
I'm not a writer at all.

237
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,880
I've never published

238
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,540
a single article or novel.

239
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,920
Jiangling.

240
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,610
What are you talking about?

241
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,780
You're the most famous writer

242
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,880
in our city.

243
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,560
You just stepped

244
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,960
over your good friend's corpse to get here.

245
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,620
Are you satisfied now?

246
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:36,770
Impossible.

247
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,500
Jiangling.

248
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,020
Time to wake up.

249
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,020
Go do what you must.

250
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,579
Perhaps when you've done what you need to do,

251
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,079
she will appear.

252
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,839
Full moon night,

253
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,280
end of the world,

254
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,680
time reversal,

255
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,359
white feather not a bird.

256
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,000
Hello?

257
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,080
This is Jiang Ling.

258
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:49,680
Is that

259
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,850
An Zhenzhen?

260
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,200
You've got the wrong number.

261
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,730
I don't know any Jiang Ling.

262
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,000
This thing

263
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,280
never matches up properly.

264
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:43,880
There seems

265
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,140
to be a problem with it.

266
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,600
That's good enough.

267
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,440
You're the one who wanted this,

268
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:49,960
how can this be good enough?

269
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,720
Really.

270
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,480
Alright, let's finish this quickly

271
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,680
and then have dinner.

272
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:53,880
Zhenzhen,

273
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,680
you're awake.

274
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,480
She's coming down.

275
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,000
Wait a moment, come and eat.

276
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,400
Dad has some buns for you.

277
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,000
Come

278
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,080
dinner's ready.

279
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:04,680
Sit down,

280
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,440
what are you standing there for?

281
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,100
Have a seat.

282
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,330
Breakfast is ready.

283
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,490
How is it?

284
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,040
It's okay.

285
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,200
What's wrong?

286
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,720
Eat up,

287
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,040
try this.

288
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,440
Try the buns Dad made.

289
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,960
Have one too.

290
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,080
Why are you just sitting there?

291
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,720
Eat up.

292
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,860
Okay, just put it here.

293
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,180
Let me tell you,

294
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,960
when you use computers a lot,

295
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,520
you need to eat more vegetables

296
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,720
to get your vitamin C.

297
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,520
Okay,

298
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,400
I got it.

299
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,320
Eat up.

300
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,400
By the way,

301
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,240
I've been talking with your dad,

302
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,690
how about we go for an outing this weekend?

303
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,810
Wherever you want to go is fine with me.

304
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Anywhere is fine.

305
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,920
Didn't you say you wanted to go hiking last time?

306
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,120
Let's go hiking then.

307
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,930
Sounds good.

308
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,320
Go hiking.

309
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,460
Why don't you look it up later,

310
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,800
see where we should go,

311
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,160
okay?

312
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,280
I'll leave it up to you.

313
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,320
Prepare some eggs for her too,

314
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,920
she needs protein right now.

315
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,200
Then buy some snacks this afternoon,

316
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,330
and some drinks too.

317
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,320
What would you like to drink?

318
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:08,920
Tell Mom.

319
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,720
No more soda,

320
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,400
you have exams coming up soon.

321
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,440
Well,

322
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,720
no more soda for you,

323
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,810
I'll get you some milk instead.

324
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,320
We're here.

325
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,600
Did you bring everything?

326
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,200
Yes, I did.

327
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,560
Study hard.

328
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,200
Off you go now.

329
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,880
Bye-bye.

330
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,720
Hurry along now.

331
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,250
Bye-bye.

332
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,040
Bye-bye.

333
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:41,570
Bye-bye.

334
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,920
I think the mall should be open by now,

335
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,560
let's go there later and look around.

336
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,320
I'm on my day off,

337
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,920
so I can go shopping with you.

338
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:57,880
Good morning.

339
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:58,480
Good morning.

340
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,880
Good morning, Zhenzhen.

341
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,180
Why is it empty?

342
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,120
Zhenzhen,

343
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,360
what are you thinking about?

344
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:01,890
Let's go,

345
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,560
class is about to start.

346
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,690
Where's Jiangling?

347
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,920
Jiangling?

348
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,720
Who is Jiangling?

349
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,360
There's nobody here.

350
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,360
That's right.

351
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,960
Wasn't Jiangling sitting right here?

352
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,620
Jiangling?

353
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,180
Are you reciting Tang poetry?

354
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,240
You're acting so strange today,

355
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,800
talking nonsense all the time.

356
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,260
Who on earth is Jiangling?

357
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,690
Is that your new friend?

358
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,180
Or are you running a fever?

359
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,080
No.

360
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,420
I'm not.

361
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,160
I'm reciting Tang poetry,

362
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:37,320
"At dawn I bid farewell to White Emperor amidst colored clouds."

363
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,520
A thousand miles to Jiangling, returning in a single day.

364
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,240
Please, have a seat.

365
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,760
We'll have an English dictation later,

366
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,090
don't forget to review.

367
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,180
Could you walk faster?

368
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,160
Walk faster.

369
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,520
This is a question.

370
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,520
What's past

371
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,600
is prologue.

372
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,520
It's just a bit of hardship.

373
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
I am a bit jealous.

374
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,040
Noisy.

375
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,820
You should be more mature.

376
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,760
You're not.

377
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,960
To be

378
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,960
or not to be.

379
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:33,960
Oh my God!

380
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,560
It's getting late,

381
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,640
and

382
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,440
we're too tired.

383
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,200
How can we continue?

384
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,920
What are you reading?

385
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,200
Just a

386
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,940
somewhat interesting piece of literature.

387
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,480
I've been feeling restless lately.

388
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,040
Indeed.

389
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,840
Sometimes

390
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,360
I often wonder,

391
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,080
to be

392
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,120
or not to be?

393
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,600
Qi Shuo,

394
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,280
go on.

395
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,620
Just stand in the back.

396
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,500
Sometimes I often wonder.

397
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:23,680
Qi Shuo,

398
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,280
stand up

399
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,810
and move to the back.

400
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,040
I might

401
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,760
need to clear my head.

402
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,080
Survival.

403
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,600
Shut up.

404
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,960
See me after class.

405
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,200
Hello, teacher.

406
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
Hello, everyone.

407
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
Please be seated.

408
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,080
Turn to page 242

409
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,330
and look at this long sentence.

410
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,000
Qi Shuo,

411
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,330
please translate this.

412
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,650
Qi Shuo, what are you doing?

413
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,210
What are you looking at?

414
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,440
Show everyone what you have in your hand.

415
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,700
What are you doing during English class?

416
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,240
This book

417
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,500
might be a bit advanced

418
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,120
for everyone.

419
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,400
Qi Shuo,

420
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,320
let me tell you something.

421
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,960
If you don't pay attention in English class,

422
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,160
even if you get a perfect score in Chinese,

423
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,240
you still won't get into the literature department.

424
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,160
And do you know what?

425
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,360
The book you're holding,

426
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,160
you'll have to study its original English version in college.

427
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:42,890
Teacher Liu,

428
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,400
there's a question that has troubled me for years.

429
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,240
To be,

430
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:50,960
to be,

431
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,560
or not

432
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,320
to be.

433
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,480
Sit down.

434
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,600
Thank you.

435
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,440
To be or not to be.

436
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,520
Let's have another student.

437
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,680
Gu Ming,

438
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,800
you try.

439
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,610
Teacher,

440
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,450
I don't know how.

441
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,880
You don't?

442
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,800
If you don't know how to do it, please sit down.

443
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,400
Thank you.

444
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,100
Class monitor,

445
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,860
please answer this question.

446
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,480
Our eating is not just to satisfy hunger,

447
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,760
a healthy breakfast

448
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,040
can kickstart our metabolic cycle.

449
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,480
Very good!

450
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,560
I hope

451
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,840
all of you can learn from

452
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,680
our class monitor Qiu Qian.

453
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,240
This is the final stage,

454
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,600
everyone needs to make one last push.

455
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,320
You can still improve by a few more points

456
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,180
did you hear me?

457
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,000
Good, now let's look at the next question.

458
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,360
Class monitor Qiu Qian.

459
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,360
What's wrong?

460
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,940
Hurry up and study, Zhenzhen.

461
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,000
Am I still

462
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,280
dreaming?

463
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,600
This points out that some people eat

464
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,560
not always to satisfy hunger,

465
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,120
which leads to the following point

466
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
that some people use food to release

467
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,180
emotions through emotional eating,

468
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,640
which fits the context.

469
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
So the answer for this question is B.

470
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,880
Based on the structure of the article,

471
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,960
this blank is the subheading of this paragraph,

472
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,400
and reading through the paragraph,

473
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:45,000
we can see it provides dietary recommendations for the whole day.

474
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,800
Option A

475
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,840
comprehensively summarizes the main content of this paragraph,

476
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:53,640
fitting the context,

477
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,640
so the answer for this question is A.

478
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,120
Zhenzhen.

479
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,850
Zhenzhen, where are you going?

480
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,720
Nice shot!

481
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,480
Another good one!

482
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,960
Come on!

483
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,930
Come on, keep going.

484
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,080
We're having good luck today,

485
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,120
we've won twice.

486
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,930
That's pretty good.

487
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
Isn't that great?

488
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,280
Sure it is.

489
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,720
Getting what you want

490
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,250
is definitely a good thing.

491
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,520
It's just that I feel

492
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,520
something's off about everything.

493
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,450
What's going on?

494
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,480
Nothing,

495
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,660
nothing at all.

496
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,640
If you meet any cute guys,

497
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,460
remember to share with us.

498
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
Absolutely.

499
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,280
I'm guessing

500
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,320
you probably like tall, handsome guys

501
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,800
with nice smiles, right?

502
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,560
Don't you remember?

503
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
I told you before,

504
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,560
I like guys who are good at studying.

505
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,280
That's right.

506
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,930
You like guys with good grades,

507
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,010
how could I forget that?

508
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:06,410
Alright.

509
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,600
It's lunchtime,

510
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,409
that's it for this morning,

511
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,800
we'll continue this afternoon.

512
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,760
Okay, great.

513
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,520
Hey, Xiao Su and Xiao Mi,

514
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,920
Qianqian, let's go get lunch.

515
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,960
Sure.

516
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,199
Zhenzhen.

517
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,400
I'm not going to eat now,

518
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,239
I'm not hungry yet,

519
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,170
you all go ahead.

520
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,360
I'll just sit here a bit longer.

521
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:22,889
Alright.

522
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,130
Let me know if you get hungry later,

523
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,199
okay, let's go then.

524
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:26,960
Let's go.

525
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,490
Take it slow.

526
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:27,930
How is it?

527
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,840
Can you reach it?

528
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,040
No, I'm a bit short.

529
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,160
Knock and see if anyone's there.

530
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:32,840
I can't

531
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,080
reach it.

532
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,520
The window is too high.

533
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,040
Stand steady.

534
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,680
I'll come up and support you.

535
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,860
What are you two doing?

536
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,920
Which class are you from?

537
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:47,770
Come out.

538
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,440
Are you crazy?

539
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,090
Why would I climb this high?

540
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,740
What are you doing?

541
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,520
Stop right there!

542
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,040
I'll remember all of you.

543
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,880
Yulifeng.

544
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,200
Physical Education.

545
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,400
Test.

546
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,600
Am I really dreaming?

547
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,240
How could this be just a dream?

548
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,960
How could

549
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,050
this be just a dream?

550
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,690
How could it be only a dream?

551
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,280
Zhenzhen.

552
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,740
Did you take notes in class today?

553
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,970
I haven't written them yet.

554
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,640
I'll help you write them.

555
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,160
We have an English test tomorrow,

556
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,220
remember to review when you get home.

557
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,480
Review.

558
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:07,640
Zhenzhen,

559
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,840
notice anything different?

560
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,380
New hairstyle,

561
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,400
what do you think?

562
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,280
It looks really cool.

563
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,740
You've got good taste.

564
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,040
Zhenzhen,

565
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,160
is something bothering you?

566
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,160
All appearances

567
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,320
are illusions.

568
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,280
Are you crazy?

569
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,200
Oh my god!

570
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,680
Dad.

571
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,880
You don't need to reward me with new shoes,

572
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,340
I have my own pocket money,

573
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,000
I can reward myself.

574
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:10,840
Alright, Mom,

575
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,060
I'll be home this weekend,

576
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,900
don't miss me too much.

577
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,460
When you pick me up,

578
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,890
remember to bring me a big chicken cutlet.

579
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,370
Okay.

580
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:21,810
Bye-bye.

581
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,810
Bye-bye.

582
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,440
Zhenzhen.

583
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,090
My mom invites you to have dinner at our place.

584
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:31,880
Okay.

585
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,940
Then it's settled.

586
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:35,760
Qiuqiu.

587
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,760
Did I used to

588
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,170
eat at your place often before?

589
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,000
Of course.

590
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,680
Don't you love

591
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,160
my mom's dry pot shrimp?

592
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,440
Yes,

593
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,880
I love it.

594
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:51,840
Qiuqiu.

595
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,560
What's up?

596
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:55,840
Do you think

597
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,840
you're happy

598
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,180
with your life now?

599
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,650
I'm quite happy.

600
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,850
Nothing.

601
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,740
Good night.

602
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:05,820
Good night.

603
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,600
Are you having that dream again?

604
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,960
On the night of the full moon,

605
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,090
the end of the world,

606
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,680
time reverses,

607
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,200
white feathers are not birds.
