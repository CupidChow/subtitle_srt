1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,360
Time: 8:30

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,120
Day

3
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,240
Is something bothering you lately?

4
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,000
If something's wrong,

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,240
you need to

6
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,039
talk to Mom and Dad about it.

7
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,360
I don't.

8
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,120
I couldn't have stolen that money.

9
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,560
I'm not talking about the stolen money.

10
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,720
I'm just worried that something

11
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,050
is affecting your mood.

12
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,400
What's wrong with my mood?

13
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,130
I have no reason to steal money!

14
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,560
So about this 200 yuan...

15
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,920
I don't know why

16
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,120
this 200 yuan suddenly appeared

17
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,320
in my pencil case.

18
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,240
My legs were hurting too much during morning assembly,

19
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,770
so I went back to rest first.

20
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,840
When I got to the classroom,

21
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,640
I fell asleep.

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,960
When I woke up, the class monitor said the money was missing.

23
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,720
I have no idea

24
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,800
who put it in my pencil case.

25
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,060
Someone is obviously trying to frame me.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,530
Alright.

27
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,410
Let's just leave it at that.

28
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,880
Zhenzhen.

29
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,600
Dad will take you to eat

30
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,760
your favorite

31
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:38,560
buffet.

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,480
Um.

33
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,400
If there's anything you want to buy recently,

34
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,079
just tell Dad.

35
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,560
Dad will buy it for you.

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,240
I don't want to buy anything.

37
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,880
Do you really think I stole the money

38
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,880
to buy something?

39
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,200
I told you I didn't steal the money,

40
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,280
I didn't.

41
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,810
That's not what I meant.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,840
You didn't steal it.

43
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,840
It's not your fault.

44
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,920
You're just a student,

45
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,780
why would anyone try to frame you?

46
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,280
Did you offend someone at school recently?

47
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,240
The college entrance exam is coming soon.

48
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,770
Why would anyone frame her?

49
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,720
I understand.

50
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,240
Lao Jiang,

51
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:31,980
is that you?

52
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,410
You finally called.

53
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,240
I'm calling to ask you

54
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,000
if you know about that milk fee

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,600
theft case from 12 years ago?

56
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,570
I wanted to call you yesterday,

57
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,210
but I couldn't get through.

58
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,560
I remember it was quite

59
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,850
a big deal back then.

60
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,250
Do you know who stole the money?

61
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,280
Now

62
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,480
everyone at school suspects I took it.

63
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,810
I really can't remember

64
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,560
many details from back then.

65
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
But don't worry,

66
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,530
I'm looking into it.

67
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:58,800
And

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,330
I vaguely remember that

69
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,520
the money was eventually returned.

70
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,640
Returned?

71
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,000
No way.

72
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,440
Was it my dad?

73
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,640
Tell me more details,

74
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,490
so I can try to remember.

75
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,560
The money went missing during morning assembly.

76
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,290
At that time,

77
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:14,980
Qi Shuo,

78
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,920
Gu Ming, Qiu Qian,

79
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,850
the four of us were all questioned.

80
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:18,519
Then

81
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,399
they found Qiu Qian's

82
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,860
200 yuan in my pencil case.

83
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,360
So they insisted

84
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,640
that I took the money.

85
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,240
But I had no idea

86
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,280
when the money was put there.

87
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,280
I suspect

88
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,610
someone was trying to frame me.

89
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,760
I think

90
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,010
Qi Shuo is definitely suspicious.

91
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,560
I was drinking with him recently and tried to get him talking.

92
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,800
He said there was something

93
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,860
he was sorry about,

94
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,420
which might be related to this money.

95
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,440
Qi Shuo?

96
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,680
Why?

97
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,480
Could it be because of Qi Yan?

98
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,240
Lao Jiang,

99
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,159
could you try to remember more,

100
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,480
or ask around for me?

101
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,720
This matter is really important to me.

102
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,450
I really want to know the truth.

103
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,800
Zhenzhen,

104
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,160
are you okay?

105
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,640
Mom and Dad were wrong earlier.

106
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,120
We shouldn't have spoken to you like that.

107
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,800
Come out,

108
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,960
let's talk properly.

109
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
I want to rest now.

110
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,440
We can talk later.

111
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,820
What are we going to do?

112
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,760
You should go to school tomorrow and pay the money.

113
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,730
I'll take care of the money.

114
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:35,880
As for you,

115
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,580
try to talk some sense into Zhenzhen.

116
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,280
The exams are coming up soon,

117
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,480
and now this happens.

118
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,040
Logically speaking,

119
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,659
our Zhenzhen doesn't need this money at all.

120
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,420
She's just been nagging me to get her a new phone.

121
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,650
I'm heading back to the office.

122
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,000
Why are you calling me again?

123
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,920
Don't hang up,

124
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,400
I need to ask you something.

125
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,530
Do you remember that milk fee incident

126
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,440
in our class back then?

127
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,440
Yeah, I remember.

128
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,940
I have some recollection.

129
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,600
What's up?

130
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,520
I just

131
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,160
wanted to ask,

132
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,840
do you remember who

133
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,320
took it back then?

134
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,940
Did they ever find out?

135
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,240
Coming!

136
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,260
Qi Shuo,

137
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,880
finish what you were saying before you go,

138
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,400
this is important,

139
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,130
just finish and then you can go.

140
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,360
Damn it!

141
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,320
Qi Shuo, let me know as soon as you remember!

142
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,900
Could it really be her?

143
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,700
What she did is a crime.

144
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,810
I can't rule out that possibility.

145
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,840
But when I was collecting the money,

146
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,200
she was definitely painting her nails.

147
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,250
Could it have

148
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,440
just rubbed off on it?

149
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,760
Before we complete our investigation,

150
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,220
don't jump to conclusions

151
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,920
and wrongly accuse someone.

152
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,720
Let me look into it further.

153
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,520
It's my fault for being careless

154
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,730
and not keeping the money safe.

155
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,500
I've caused trouble for everyone

156
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,440
and got Zhenzhen involved in this mess.

157
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,700
Don't blame yourself.

158
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,440
This matter

159
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,520
still requires all of us to investigate thoroughly

160
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,850
so we can clear her name.

161
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,130
Let's go.

162
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,140
On behalf of Zhenzhen,

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,600
thank you.

164
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:00,770
Going to eat?

165
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,520
You guys go ahead,

166
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,650
I'll join you later.

167
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,440
I'm leaving now.

168
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:04,760
Bye.

169
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,440
Let's go.

170
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,760
Darling Qianqian,

171
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,220
have you made up your mind?

172
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,480
Don't be angry,

173
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,610
you don't look pretty when you're mad.

174
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,920
Is this about the money?

175
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,800
As long as you're with me,

176
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,060
money doesn't matter.

177
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,400
Don't go,

178
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,880
you'll tear the bag if you keep pulling.

179
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,160
What about our 1314 promise?

180
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,120
Here's your noodles.

181
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,740
That's 10 yuan.

182
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,120
I only have a 50.

183
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:52,980
Such a big bill,

184
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,410
okay, I'll give you change.

185
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,370
Alright.

186
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,160
Here's 40 yuan,

187
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,290
I'm putting it here.

188
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,210
Mr. Kong.

189
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:21,320
Ten yuan,

190
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,280
who gave it to you?

191
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,740
How would I remember that?

192
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,680
Students come here for noodles all the time,

193
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,640
they hand me money,

194
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,400
I don't look at it carefully.

195
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,360
Think about it,

196
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,290
try to remember.

197
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,200
I really can't remember.

198
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,760
Fine.

199
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,560
Keep an eye out for me,

200
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,920
if you see money with this kind of writing on it,

201
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,580
let me know.

202
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,080
Welcome.

203
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:50,960
Welcome.

204
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,880
What are you doing?

205
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:53,740
Still working?

206
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,280
Who are you?

207
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,880
Why did you hit me?

208
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,680
I'm sorry.

209
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,000
I just want to ask about your colleague,

210
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,040
where did Qi Shuo go?

211
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,600
Qi Shuo?

212
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,160
He told me not to tell anyone,

213
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,370
especially the guy on the motorcycle.

214
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,810
He went to work as a doorman at the Crown Hotel.

215
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,880
Crown Hotel.

216
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,800
Thanks.

217
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,280
Okay.

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,800
Jiangling.

219
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,840
Hey, why are you haunting me again?

220
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,770
Here we go again.

221
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,880
I'm haunting you?

222
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,680
Why don't you ask yourself

223
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,840
why you run away every time you see me?

224
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,560
Are you avoiding me?

225
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:54,720
No.

226
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,840
All day long, all you talk about

227
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,840
is An Zhenzhen.

228
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,130
I can't take it anymore.

229
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,280
Who else would I ask about if not her?

230
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,810
Am I asking about your life?

231
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,000
Isn't it obvious?

232
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,240
I'm very busy,

233
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,400
I'm working.

234
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm not.

235
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,480
Working?

236
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,680
I'm not avoiding you.

237
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,600
Also.

238
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,360
How do you know about that incident?

239
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,320
Such a big thing happened back then,

240
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,680
why wouldn't I know about it?

241
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,880
Of course I remember.

242
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,210
Tell me about it.

243
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,450
There's nothing to talk about.

244
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,690
Just a small matter.

245
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,320
Well.

246
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,340
It's like this.

247
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,720
Mr. Jiang.

248
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,840
If

249
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
you insist on disrupting my work,

250
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,740
you see my colleague here?

251
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,320
He'll kick you out,

252
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,520
throw you out of here.

253
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,680
I'm here to stay at this hotel,

254
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
what right do you have to kick me out?

255
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,780
You? Stay here?

256
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,200
You stay here?

257
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,100
Are you worthy?

258
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,080
If you don't tell me, I'm calling the police.

259
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,610
Go ahead.

260
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,400
Go on, call them,

261
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:45,800
do it.

262
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:46,600
Remember your attitude.

263
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,930
Go ahead, make the call.

264
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,610
I don't believe the police can't get answers.

265
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,610
You're really calling?

266
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:54,240
What?

267
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,080
Don't interfere.

268
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,120
Don't call, don't call.

269
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,720
I've spent a fortune and I'm definitely making this call.

270
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,240
Don't hit him.

271
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,760
I hate disturbing people the most.

272
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,960
It's just one person,

273
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,960
don't hit him.

274
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:08,880
Yi Nuo.

275
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,080
Qi Shuo.

276
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,840
Yi Nuo,

277
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
are you my fan too?

278
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,480
Come on, Yi Nuo,

279
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,760
you can do it!

280
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,200
Thank you.

281
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,560
Qi Shuo.

282
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,240
This kid.

283
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,040
Open it and take a look.

284
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,160
Wasn't your wish

285
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,320
to get an iPhone 4S?

286
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,330
Daddy bought it for you.

287
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,680
Now you have what your classmates have.

288
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,600
Zhenzhen.

289
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,560
Come sit here.

290
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,840
Dad knows

291
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,240
that I'm usually busy

292
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,040
and haven't been there for you.

293
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,700
From now on,

294
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,640
if you want anything, just tell me,

295
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,680
and I'll buy it for you.

296
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,940
As for your allowance,

297
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,560
I'll...

298
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,360
Don't tell her all that useless stuff.

299
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,320
I'm just asking you,

300
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,250
shouldn't people admit when they've made a mistake?

301
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,440
How can you not admit when you've done something wrong?

302
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,240
Wrong is wrong,

303
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,000
what's so hard about admitting it?

304
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,530
What am I supposed to admit?

305
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,720
I already told you...

306
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,120
I didn't steal anything.

307
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,200
You still think

308
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,800
I took the class money

309
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,330
for an iPhone 4S, don't you?

310
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,130
How could you think of me like that?

311
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,820
You can't think of me this way.

312
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,080
I can handle whatever my classmates say about me,

313
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,320
but not from you two.

314
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,600
Because you're my parents,

315
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,320
you have to believe me.

316
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,410
Is that how you talk to your mother?

317
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,840
You're getting more and more disrespectful.

318
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,970
I'm disrespectful?

319
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,640
I'm disrespectful?

320
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,080
Zhenzhen.

321
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,120
Mom knows you feel wronged,

322
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,880
but we need to communicate about these things.

323
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,740
Come out first,

324
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,840
let's talk this through,

325
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,560
okay?

326
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,920
Mom believes you didn't do this.

327
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:35,680
Don't

328
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,740
make things worse.

329
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,120
Mom believes you didn't do any of these things,

330
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:42,680
but

331
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,280
we need to investigate and clear this up first.

332
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:45,760
Okay?

333
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,210
Will you come out first?

334
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:49,640
Tomorrow

335
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,120
I'll go to school with you tomorrow,

336
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,800
we'll talk to the teacher

337
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,160
and ask them to investigate what really happened,

338
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:56,720
alright?

339
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,880
I'm coming in then.

340
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,839
It's okay now.

341
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,240
Mom knows you feel wronged,

342
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,560
I believe you didn't do those things,

343
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,040
but we need to get to the bottom of this.

344
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,000
Tomorrow I'll go to school with you,

345
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,200
we'll talk to the teacher

346
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,640
and make sure she investigates

347
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,970
what exactly happened,

348
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,800
okay?

349
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,780
Don't cry anymore.

350
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:31,920
Ms. Liu

351
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,570
you wanted to see me.

352
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:34,720
Qiu Qian,

353
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,120
I wanted to see you.

354
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,580
It's about the milk money.

355
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,960
I was thinking about it all night yesterday,

356
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,200
and I still find this situation very strange.

357
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,120
Even though the school administration is putting a lot of pressure on me,

358
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,720
I still believe in all of you.

359
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,320
If you know anything,

360
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,200
you can tell me.

361
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,480
You've always been close with An Zhenzhen,

362
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,140
but her behavior has been quite unusual lately.

363
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,010
Has something happened to her?

364
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,690
I really don't believe she would do these things.

365
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:02,920
Ms. Liu,

366
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,300
I really don't know anything.

367
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,880
This has nothing

368
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,640
to do with me.

369
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,700
Are you sure you don't know anything?

370
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:16,840
Ms. Liu.

371
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,820
Zhenzhen's mother, you're here.

372
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,480
You can go now,

373
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,040
okay.

374
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,640
Hello, ma'am.

375
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,200
Hello.

376
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,760
Ms. Liu,

377
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,720
I came today

378
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,760
because I wanted to

379
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,400
get more details about the situation.

380
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,460
Please have a seat.

381
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:38,880
Ms. Liu,

382
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,240
I think

383
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,920
you're aware of our family's financial situation,

384
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,000
aren't you?

385
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,520
Zhenzhen

386
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,520
wouldn't resort to stealing money.

387
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,120
So for this matter,

388
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,440
could you please investigate it more thoroughly?

389
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,170
We can't just

390
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,170
wrongfully accuse a child without proper evidence.

391
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,240
Last night,

392
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,880
we kept asking An Zhenzhen

393
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,760
what exactly happened.

394
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,720
But the child went over everything,

395
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,520
thinking it through carefully,

396
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,850
and she truly doesn't know what happened.

397
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,740
No matter how we discuss this,

398
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,060
she insists she has nothing to do with it.

399
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,080
So

400
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,000
I really need to trouble you

401
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,200
to look into this more carefully.

402
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,880
Please see

403
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,400
if you can find

404
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,730
any other information.

405
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,640
Don't worry,

406
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,240
I'll investigate this matter thoroughly.

407
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,440
With your assurance,

408
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,700
I feel much better now.

409
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,690
What's going on?

410
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,280
Do you think

411
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,880
An Zhenzhen stole the money?

412
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,490
How would I know?

413
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:11,760
Today I

414
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,240
saw An Zhenzhen's mom at school,

415
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,640
saying she wants to investigate further.

416
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,800
She didn't steal the money,

417
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,160
and the teacher agrees.

418
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,720
Keep your voice down.

419
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,560
What did you tell them

420
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,200
back then? You didn't slip up, did you?

421
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:27,960
I just said

422
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,660
I went to the bathroom,

423
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,820
and after that,

424
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,580
I went to the morning meeting.

425
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,840
There's nobody else here,

426
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,300
why are you overreacting?

427
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,760
Did you tell the teacher

428
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:50,960
that I was in the classroom for the morning meeting?

429
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,840
You're crazy.

430
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,480
But

431
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,450
the teacher might ask more questions.

432
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,920
Be careful

433
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,920
not to slip up when that happens.

434
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,140
What did you tell the teacher?

435
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,770
Mind your own business!

436
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,000
What?

437
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,040
Mr. An.

438
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,240
Alright, students,

439
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,880
I've handed out all the test papers.

440
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,140
Everyone should review their mistakes.

441
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,800
In this English essay assignment,

442
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
many of you had problems

443
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,930
with grammar usage.

444
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,560
However, there's one student

445
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,890
who did an excellent job with her writing.

446
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,600
Everyone

447
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,720
should take a look at

448
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,580
An Zhenzhen's essay after class.

449
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,840
Her vocabulary and grammar usage

450
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,300
are both very impressive.

451
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:45,090
I hope you all

452
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,760
will learn from her example.

453
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,000
Now let's look at

454
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,130
the first multiple-choice question.

455
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,960
Alright, I'll take care of the milk situation.

456
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,600
Okay.

457
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,560
That's fine,

458
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,160
thank you

459
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,400
for your help.

460
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,120
Sure.

461
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,040
Goodbye then.

462
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,010
Goodbye.

463
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,840
Everyone,

464
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,930
the milk is here.

465
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,800
Class sports rep,

466
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,720
come with me to get it

467
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,450
and distribute it to everyone.

468
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,280
We have milk again.

469
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,650
The milk is here.

470
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,200
I heard that An Zhenzhen's father

471
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,440
paid the money for us.

472
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,740
So was she really the one who stole it?

473
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,020
She's the one who stole it.

474
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,090
Come on, milk delivery is here.

475
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,760
Come get your milk.

476
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,360
Thank you.

477
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:28,980
Thanks.

478
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,360
Thank you.

479
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,290
Here,

480
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,300
take it.

481
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,690
Thanks a lot.

482
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:45,920
Thank you.

483
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,240
These ten dollars

484
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,020
I got from outside the school.

485
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,770
Someone stole money

486
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,050
and is trying to frame An Zhenzhen.

487
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:21,960
Wait.

488
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,320
I'll help you.

489
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,380
I've known An Zhenzhen

490
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,120
longer than anyone else,

491
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,400
and I understand her better.

492
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,060
Let's clear

493
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,570
Zhenzhen's name together.

494
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,050
Let's go.

495
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,250
Tell me what you've got.

496
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,680
Currently, the evidence

497
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,040
consists only of this 10-yuan bill

498
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,770
and that bottle of nail polish.

499
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,480
Although the nail polish is direct evidence,

500
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,340
if Qiu Qian were the perpetrator,

501
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,120
she wouldn't likely

502
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,920
spend money with her own name written on it.

503
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,660
So the real culprit

504
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,140
might be someone else.

505
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,320
The fact that she doesn't like noodles

506
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,850
also supports this theory.

507
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,280
Then let's

508
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,290
play some psychological warfare.

509
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,080
Noodles are here!

510
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,640
Eat while they're hot.

511
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,080
Boss,

512
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,000
I'd like to ask you a favor.

513
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,440
Could you please put this bill

514
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,880
up on display at your stall?

515
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,360
It's best if everyone who comes to eat noodles

516
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,040
can see

517
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,400
Qiu Qian's money.

518
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:44,960
Qiu Qian.

519
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,720
What's going on here?

520
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,680
This 10-yuan bill

521
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:57,800
must have been spent by the criminal

522
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,840
in a state of extreme panic.

523
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,560
Someone who would come up with this kind of

524
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,160
method to destroy evidence

525
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,780
doesn't have very strong nerves.

526
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,490
From a criminal psychology perspective,

527
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,000
when criminals discover they have already

528
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,640
or might be exposed,

529
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,720
they often panic and make mistakes.

530
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,640
We just need to seize

531
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,700
this small weakness of human nature,

532
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,080
create public opinion,

533
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:20,760
set a trap,

534
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,980
and wait for him to fall right into it.

535
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,640
I think

536
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,660
Qiu Qian will come.

537
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,490
Let's observe when the time comes.

538
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,250
Good reasoning.

539
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,530
I also enjoy detective novels.

540
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,420
Murder on the Orient Express, right?

541
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,090
So all these things,

542
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,570
are you planning to tell Zhenzhen?

543
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,620
All kinds of people exist.

544
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,120
So it's her,

545
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,920
she's been doing well all along.

546
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,800
What nerve.

547
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,930
Still hanging around here.

548
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,800
What exactly happened?

549
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,120
This can't possibly be Zhenzhen.

550
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:08,850
Teacher Liu,

551
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,600
about the milk money that was stolen from your class,

552
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,060
you need to get to the bottom of this quickly.

553
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,480
If no one talks, everyone will be expelled.

554
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,600
What's wrong with you?

555
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,160
Say something!

556
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,120
Don't scare Mom.

557
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:45,760
What's going on now?

558
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,360
Zhenzhen.

559
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,760
In the middle of the night,

560
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,520
making such a fuss about coming back.

561
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,780
I'm working overtime,

562
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,940
what's the matter?

563
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,520
What's wrong?

564
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,280
Why did you go to school and pay the milk fee?

565
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,040
Do you realize

566
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
that what you did

567
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,720
makes them think I'm a thief?

568
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,450
Then what should I do? Not pay the milk fee?

569
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,400
Let the school call the police?

570
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,520
What's wrong with calling the police?

571
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,640
How would that look to others?

572
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,680
They should have called the police to investigate,

573
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,740
instead of you rushing to condemn me.

574
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:19,680
Zhenzhen,

575
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,120
this is a critical time.

576
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,930
Dad knows you feel wronged,

577
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,760
but you need to focus on what's important.

578
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,690
Some things you just need to let go.

579
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,120
The classmates' gossip...

580
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,180
Just let them talk.

581
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,520
After a few days...

582
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,040
they'll get bored.

583
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,600
Will they still gossip then?

584
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,460
Meanwhile, you

585
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,680
should focus on

586
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,680
preparing for your college entrance exam.

587
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,760
So you think

588
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,480
classmates treating me like a thief,

589
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,200
looking at me strangely,

590
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,520
my feelings,

591
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,450
my thoughts don't matter anymore?

592
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,080
Do you even care about me anymore?

593
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,000
Do you still care about our family?

594
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,280
Zhenzhen, what are you saying?

595
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,210
What am I saying?

596
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,560
Today I'm going to speak

597
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,960
all my thoughts out loud.

598
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,960
I don't want to pretend anymore.

599
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,250
Do you still care about our family?

600
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,440
Look at me.

601
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:03,920
Dad.

602
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,440
If you care,

603
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,520
why are you never home?

604
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,840
If you care,

605
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:15,200
why aren't you there when we need you?

606
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,160
My friends all say

607
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,240
that my family

608
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,880
is happy and perfect.

609
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,880
But only I know

610
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,330
that's not true.

611
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,400
I don't know when everything changed.

612
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,560
I don't feel happy anymore.

613
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,600
Because you don't care about me,

614
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,860
you don't care about our family anymore.

615
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,080
Zhenzhen.

616
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,080
Zhenzhen.

617
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,680
I knew it,

618
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,440
she's definitely noticed.
