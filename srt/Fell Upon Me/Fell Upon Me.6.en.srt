1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,200
Time: 8:30-11:00

2
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,120
Day

3
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,890
Where are you going?

4
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:52,720
Home.

5
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,120
Old Jiang called again

6
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,580
and gave me some new leads.

7
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,640
I'm so scared.

8
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,540
Things are getting more and more dangerous now.

9
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,360
I heard

10
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,170
you know some martial arts.

11
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,540
Could you teach me?

12
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,160
It would make me feel safer.

13
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,420
I'm just so terrified.

14
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,290
Let's go.

15
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,920
Now let's

16
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,160
learn the first move.

17
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,680
Ready?

18
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,660
First, grab me.

19
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,760
No,

20
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,840
grab here.

21
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,280
Then

22
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
I use my right hand

23
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,970
to press it down.

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,680
Then use your left elbow

25
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,220
to strike down.

26
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,060
After that,

27
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,200
then

28
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,200
finally

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,660
choke the neck.

30
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,560
Got it?

31
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,240
So I choke their neck, right?

32
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,400
But I think this move

33
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,520
is a bit too elaborate,

34
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,320
don't you have

35
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,520
something simpler,

36
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,770
preferably something that can kill with one strike?

37
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,240
Yes,

38
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,040
still grab me first.

39
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,380
Use your right hand

40
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,210
to find their thumb.

41
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,890
Apply force.

42
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,680
Isn't this

43
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,720
just bending someone's finger?

44
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,320
Yes, it is.

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,960
Although this is lethal,

46
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,840
it's not very cool.

47
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,160
Is there anything that can

48
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,690
subdue someone instantly,

49
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,440
like throwing them to the ground?

50
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,600
Well, there is,

51
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,640
but it's quite difficult.

52
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
Can you handle it?

53
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,760
Of course I can.

54
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,760
You need to

55
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,460
catch me first.

56
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,680
This time it's the left hand.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,720
Go around,

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,040
knock

59
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,100
this hand away.

60
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,079
Grab his arm.

61
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,720
Then

62
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,760
use your foot.

63
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,450
Pull your foot back.

64
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,660
Push his shoulder with your hand.

65
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,220
Come on.

66
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,700
I'm coming.

67
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,640
I'll grab you.

68
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,640
Then I'll

69
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,770
use this hand

70
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,159
to block it.

71
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:42,820
Grab the arm

72
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,360
and step forward.

73
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,740
No, you need to cooperate with me.

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,460
Put some strength into it.

75
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:36,960
Um

76
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,580
I'm hungry,

77
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,540
I'm going to get something to eat.

78
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,050
How was your business trip?

79
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,040
Same as usual.

80
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,620
You should pay more attention to your daughter when you have time.

81
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,440
What's wrong?

82
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,040
Did something happen at school?

83
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,370
Her grades aren't good,

84
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,580
and she's struggling to improve.

85
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,490
I've looked into it,

86
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,000
if she can meet

87
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,800
the 800-meter qualifying time,

88
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,000
she could try for a sports scholarship.

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,560
But the child only knows volleyball,

90
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,880
she's never participated in

91
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,160
any long-distance races.

92
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
What do you know?

93
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,560
Athletic skills are transferable,

94
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,460
and we can work something out.

95
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,850
Now you know how to work the system,

96
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,320
where were you before?

97
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,370
An Zhenzhen,

98
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,880
you were late again for evening study yesterday.

99
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,720
The college entrance exam is coming soon,

100
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,580
what exactly are you trying to do?

101
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,490
Teacher Liu,

102
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,840
I was exercising

103
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,080
last night.

104
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,340
Health is the foundation for success, you know.

105
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,000
So you're just building up your foundation,

106
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,530
but what's the point if you don't put it to use?

107
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,360
Zhenzhen,

108
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,640
I know your grades are decent,

109
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,039
but I'm worried you might get

110
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,760
overconfident in these final weeks.

111
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,880
The third mock exam is coming up soon,

112
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,760
and before that, we'll have

113
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,960
a pop quiz every week.

114
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,180
I hope you can be more focused,

115
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:50,920
and it would be best

116
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,720
if you studied more with Gu Ming.

117
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,120
You might improve by a few points,

118
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,320
which could put you ahead of thousands of other students.

119
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,480
Ms. Liu.

120
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,850
I've been having this feeling lately.

121
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,200
What feeling?

122
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,720
I might not be able to take the college entrance exam.

123
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,520
What nonsense are you talking about?

124
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,080
The exam is just around the corner.

125
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,800
All your teachers want you to do well.

126
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,330
Stop overthinking things.

127
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,330
Now go back to class.

128
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:30,760
Okay.

129
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,360
Hurry up,

130
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,770
the bubble tea shop is waiting for you.

131
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,840
Zipin's Secret Recipe Oden.

132
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,760
Zi'ang's Secret Recipe Oden.

133
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:11,920
Zi'ang's Secret Recipe Oden.

134
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,320
Zipin's Secret Recipe Oden.

135
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,880
Drink up!

136
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,930
Actually, I'm not that thirsty right now.

137
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,240
Is this a new shop you found?

138
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,700
Qiuqiu.

139
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,500
We've never been here before,

140
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,080
I wonder if their bubble tea

141
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,920
tastes good?

142
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,960
Are you feeling a bit hungry?

143
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,640
I just saw a flatbread shop nearby,

144
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,560
I'll go buy some for you.

145
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,090
Sit down.

146
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,240
Qiuqiu.

147
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,000
Lately,

148
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,890
have you been angry with me?

149
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,180
What's the reason?

150
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,140
Can you tell me?

151
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,240
Tell me about you and Jiangling.

152
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,360
We've

153
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,440
gotten a bit closer recently,

154
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,400
it's because of

155
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,340
the essays.

156
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,200
Isn't he really good at writing essays?

157
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,960
Stop pretending!

158
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,440
I told you from the beginning.

159
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,800
I like Jiang Ling

160
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,380
and I want to be his friend.

161
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,020
But what about you?

162
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,680
You've been trying every possible way to get close to him,

163
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,000
embarrassing me over and over again,

164
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,040
making Jiang Ling dislike me more and more.

165
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,900
What exactly are you trying to do?

166
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:34,920
Qiuqiu.

167
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:35,800
No,

168
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,980
let me tell you,

169
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:37,920
this thing...

170
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,920
I'm really sorry.

171
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,680
I have been

172
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,000
getting too close to him lately.

173
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,660
However...

174
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:41,880
However...

175
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,610
Listen to me,

176
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,920
there's really a reason for all this.

177
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,160
There really is a reason.

178
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
I need his help.

179
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,880
It's just for this period of time.

180
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,810
What can he possibly help you with?

181
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,620
He's just a transfer student.

182
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,320
I thought you always listened to me?

183
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,000
So from now on,

184
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,800
I want you to stay away from him,

185
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,460
don't say a single word to him,

186
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,320
okay?

187
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,480
We can talk about anything else,

188
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,410
have a good conversation about it,

189
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,040
but I can't promise you this.

190
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,520
It's because I really have my reasons,

191
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,250
I just can't.

192
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,200
I don't know how to explain this to you,

193
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:22,640
but...

194
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:25,930
Three years,

195
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,840
I never thought you were this kind of person.

196
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,770
That's not true.

197
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,120
You think you're so important now,

198
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:32,920
so capable,

199
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,050
that you can push me around.

200
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,280
What are you hiding from me?

201
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,450
An Zhenzhen.

202
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,680
You're always calling Jiangling.

203
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,480
Don't think I haven't heard you.

204
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,420
And that time at the noodle stand,

205
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,920
your every glance,

206
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,600
every gesture,

207
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,480
every word.

208
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,400
Do you think I'm an idiot?

209
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,520
Do you think I can't see what's going on?

210
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,020
And also...

211
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,220
That day...

212
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,860
At the classroom door,

213
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,320
I saw everything,

214
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,880
the note you put on my milk.

215
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,120
Jiangling.

216
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,400
I'm sorry,

217
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,290
I didn't mean to.

218
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,720
How can you be so calculating?

219
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,480
How manipulative can you be?

220
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,770
You're still playing innocent in front of me.

221
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,880
You're the most disgusting

222
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,240
shameless person I've ever met.

223
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,280
First of all,

224
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,960
I know nothing about any note.

225
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,800
I've never seen it,

226
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,060
and I would never do something like that.

227
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,280
Secondly,

228
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,100
why would you think of me this way?

229
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,690
I never imagined

230
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,600
this is how you've been seeing me all this time.

231
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,600
Do you have any idea

232
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,040
how much I've been suffering too?

233
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,280
I've been keeping so many things to myself,

234
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,240
do you think I don't want to talk to you about them?

235
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,680
Every time I want to open up to you,

236
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,740
but what about you?

237
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,460
You never listen to what I have to say,

238
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,000
have you ever paid attention to me?

239
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,680
Because I don't want to deal with you,

240
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,000
can't you see that?

241
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,050
You don't want to talk to me?

242
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,970
Do you even consider me a friend, Qiu Qian?

243
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,500
Why do you always only think about yourself?

244
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,690
What if I told you

245
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,040
What if I told you

246
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,400
that I'm about to die?

247
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,360
What does that have to do with me?

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,360
Is that my problem?

249
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,760
Don't try to scare me with death.

250
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,120
That's right,

251
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,720
it has nothing to do with you.

252
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:41,970
Qiu Qian,

253
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,060
you're so selfish.

254
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,930
You're the most selfish person I've ever met.

255
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,650
You're calling me selfish?

256
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,400
Selfish?

257
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,440
Yes,

258
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,490
you are selfish.

259
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,720
You never consider how I feel,

260
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,320
you only care about yourself.

261
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,050
If that's not selfish, what is?

262
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,200
I'm selfish?

263
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,480
I thought

264
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,780
you would be the last person to say that to me.

265
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,610
I'm selfish.

266
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,220
Qiuqiu.

267
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,680
I'm selfish.

268
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,400
I'm selfish.

269
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,400
I'm sorry.

270
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:24,840
I'm selfish.

271
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,540
It's not like that.

272
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,240
This Monchichi doll,

273
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,810
I don't want it anymore.

274
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,480
An Zhenzhen.

275
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,860
disappear from my world forever,

276
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,520
forever.

277
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,920
Let me go.

278
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:47,930
Qiu Qian.

279
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,720
Qiu Qian.

280
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,920
Can we talk this through?

281
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,360
Is that

282
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,440
Jiangling?

283
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,340
Is that Jiangling?

284
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,160
How are you?

285
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,040
Qiuqiu.

286
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,640
You two.

287
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,000
We

288
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,080
won't be

289
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,340
together anymore.

290
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,900
But this isn't your fault.

291
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,000
It is my fault.

292
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
I've been

293
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,140
ignoring her feelings all this time,

294
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,200
and I said those terrible things to her.

295
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,520
It's all my fault.

296
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,040
Maybe

297
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,100
I shouldn't have answered that call.

298
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:47,920
Ms. Qiu,

299
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,980
why is that guy always staring at you?

300
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,640
Don't mention it.

301
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,570
He looks decent.

302
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,600
Don't even talk about it,

303
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,000
he's just a total weirdo.

304
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,880
Where?

305
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,280
It's nothing.

306
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,840
If anything happens around here in the future, just use my name.

307
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,760
And stop dancing,

308
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,080
dancing is too exhausting.

309
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
Be my girlfriend.

310
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:07,960
Jin,

311
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,600
you're joking again.

312
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,880
You have so many girlfriends,

313
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,680
you don't need me as another one.

314
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,520
Cheers to you.

315
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,200
Zhenzhen,

316
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,730
are you okay?

317
00:20:59,320 --> 00:20:59,850
I'm fine.

318
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,970
Zhenzhen, are you alright?

319
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,680
One day closer to liberation.

320
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,840
That's great.

321
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:19,680
Gu Ming.

322
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Come to my office.

323
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,400
That's easy.

324
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,050
What are you worried about?

325
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,640
Qi Shuo hasn't been taking his studies seriously lately,

326
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,300
I'm really worried about him.

327
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,360
He can't even copy problems correctly.

328
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,720
Zhenzhen,

329
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,690
did you have a fight with Qianqian?

330
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,720
It's nothing.

331
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,130
Thank you for saving me yesterday.

332
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:52,890
However,

333
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,450
I feel like I don't have much time left.

334
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,320
There's always a way.

335
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,920
What way is there?

336
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,840
You should stay away from me,

337
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,330
it's too dangerous.

338
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,000
What the phone says

339
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,680
isn't necessarily true.

340
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,010
But that was future you who said it!

341
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,180
But I'm right here in front of you.

342
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:53,970
Stand up.

343
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,680
Goodbye, teacher.

344
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,090
Goodbye, students.

345
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,400
I have something to announce.

346
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,440
The sports recruitment

347
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
is about to begin.

348
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,240
The teacher asked me to take a count

349
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,640
of those who want to participate,

350
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,100
come get the forms from me.

351
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,600
Zhenzhen.

352
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,760
You've signed up,

353
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,620
remember to bring a 1-inch photo.

354
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,170
I don't want to go at all.

355
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,560
I signed up.

356
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,680
I didn't sign up, class monitor,

357
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,000
are you sure you got it right?

358
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,240
Teacher Liu gave me the list,

359
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,500
it shouldn't be wrong.

360
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,480
Did someone

361
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,080
from your family sign you up?

362
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,680
Zhenzhen,

363
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,400
with the sports recruitment,

364
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,200
if you pass, your college admission is secured.

365
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:32,930
Do your best,

366
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,250
I'm rooting for you.

367
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,760
If it's so good, why didn't you sign up?

368
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,620
I think you're very talented too.

369
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:38,240
I can't do it.

370
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,900
Can I cancel my registration?

371
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:40,920
Your name

372
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,200
has already been submitted.

373
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,400
It must have been my dad's doing,

374
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,330
he didn't even consult me about it.

375
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,040
Gu Ming,

376
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,240
sign me up for one too.

377
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,020
I'll register you.

378
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,240
If you have any questions,

379
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,500
let me know right away.

380
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,400
Come on!

381
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,720
What should I do?

382
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,660
I don't want to run the 800 meters.

383
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,820
I don't want to run,

384
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,420
I don't want to run the 800 meters.

385
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,280
You've already signed up,

386
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,200
so just do it.

387
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,720
Easy for you to say.

388
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,480
I think...

389
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,410
I already know how I'm going to die.

390
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,120
It'll be right after finishing the 800 meters,

391
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,960
from complete physical collapse.

392
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,200
It's not that serious.

393
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,260
It is that serious!

394
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,720
Then I'll train with you.

395
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,480
Join me.

396
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,570
Although you have good skills,

397
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,320
but

398
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
that has nothing to do with running.

399
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,690
Are you sure you want to join me?

400
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,760
I can

401
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,170
spot your problems right away.

402
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,760
That works.

403
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,960
Let's take a couple days off then,

404
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,480
since

405
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,020
the exam is still far away.

406
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,360
Eyes forward.

407
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,960
I can't go on,

408
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,410
I can't run anymore.

409
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,120
I'm too tired,

410
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,650
I really can't run anymore.

411
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,530
Just hang in there a bit longer,

412
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,730
we're almost at the top.

413
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,400
Tell you what,

414
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,280
if you keep running,

415
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,680
I'll treat you to hot pot.

416
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,300
A whole week of hot pot.

417
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,040
Deal.

418
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,010
Let's go.

419
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:28,850
You can do it,

420
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,220
keep going!

421
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,600
I can do it,

422
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,240
I can do it!

423
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:39,570
Speed up!

424
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,810
Move those legs!

425
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,930
Why did you stop?

426
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:55,840
I can't go on,

427
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:56,960
I quit!

428
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,290
What kind of crazy plan is this?

429
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,960
Why are you on a bicycle?

430
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,040
I'm running.

431
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,080
Cycling isn't tiring.

432
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,000
I am tired.

433
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,810
I can't anymore,

434
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,600
I quit!

435
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,880
Whoever stops

436
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,250
gains three jin,

437
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,720
three kilograms!

438
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,740
Ten kilograms!

439
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,920
Like eating hot pot with mouth ulcers.

440
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,920
You're ruthless.

441
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,720
Coming!

442
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:24,840
Lately

443
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,120
you two always come here for noodles together?

444
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,180
You're quite nosy.

445
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,080
That's because your noodles are delicious, Kong.

446
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,210
I like hearing that.

447
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,810
Enjoy your meal.

448
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,720
I'm starving.

449
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,850
I've been running around all morning.

450
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,400
Qianqian.

451
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,440
Where are you going?

452
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,970
Why do you keep avoiding me?

453
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:56,920
What are you up to?

454
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,400
I've been rejecting you for a week now,

455
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,480
aren't you tired of it?

456
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,880
How would you know if you don't give it a try?

457
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,260
Why is this guy here again?

458
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,880
She's in a bad situation now.

459
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,120
Hanging out with some

460
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,500
shady characters.

461
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,440
Is all of this my fault?

462
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,640
Because of me,

463
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,000
Qiuqiu ends up miserable in the future.

464
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,820
You think you're special?

465
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,680
So many girls want to be with Brother Jin.

466
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,840
Be smart, Qiu Qian,

467
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,660
and don't let me see you again.

468
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,320
Qiu Qian.

469
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,820
So many years have passed.

470
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,660
I didn't expect

471
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,530
you'd be able to find me,

472
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,880
it's because of An Zhenzhen, right?

473
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,520
I won't go into

474
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,540
the specific details.

475
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
Even if I told you,

476
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,480
you wouldn't believe me.

477
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,680
About her situation,

478
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,520
I really don't know anything.

479
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,280
When senior year was ending,

480
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,160
everyone was busy studying,

481
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,720
and we

482
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,400
gradually drifted apart.

483
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,260
Until she got into trouble later,

484
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,400
I never saw it coming.

485
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,000
Then please try to remember,

486
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,770
before the college entrance exam,

487
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,320
did she have any

488
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,380
unusual behavior,

489
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,560
or was there

490
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,600
anyone she was

491
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,370
particularly close to?

492
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,040
The only person she was close to

493
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,770
was our class monitor, Gu Ming.

494
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,360
I need to go now.
