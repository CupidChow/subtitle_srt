00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,240
Time: 8:30-11:00

2
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,160
Day

3
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,480
Hello.

4
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,120
Who are you looking for?

5
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,920
Teacher Zhao.

6
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,480
Teacher Zhao has stepped out,

7
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,810
please wait over there.

8
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,480
Hello.

9
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,040
I have an appointment with Teacher Zhao.

10
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,160
Teacher Zhao is busy today,

11
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,220
would you mind waiting in the office?

12
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,960
The third mock exam is about to begin,

13
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,240
all students please

14
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,770
return to the examination room immediately.

15
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,600
Alright,

16
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,820
start working on your papers.

17
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,520
Everyone, please keep track of the time.

18
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,920
You have 30 minutes left.

19
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,570
Teacher,

20
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,410
I'd like to turn in my paper.

21
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,560
Are you sure?

22
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,640
According to the exam rules,

23
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,370
we can turn in our papers early.

24
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,769
Where were you earlier?

25
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,159
This third mock exam was way too difficult.

26
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,300
I don't think I performed well at all.

27
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,120
The college entrance exam definitely won't be this hard.

28
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,760
Really?

29
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,120
I hope so.

30
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,640
What about you?

31
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,970
How do you think you did?

32
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,320
Not bad.

33
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,800
So modest.

34
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,120
Did you notice?

35
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,960
The class monitor turned in his paper half an hour early.

36
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,600
Could he have finished everything?

37
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,320
I saw that.

38
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,880
But he's always been a good student.

39
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,640
But I really think he's been

40
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,970
acting strange lately.

41
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,770
He's barely attending evening study sessions anymore.

42
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,530
Don't worry about that.

43
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,680
We just need to focus on our own exams.

44
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,340
I'm hungry.

45
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,800
Let me treat you to a meal.

46
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,400
Really?

47
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,130
Look at this,

48
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,320
83rd place.

49
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,040
I improved by over 80 places.

50
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,100
I need to call my sister later.

51
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,520
That's a huge improvement!

52
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,400
It's alright.

53
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,880
You must be cheating.

54
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:46,880
No,

55
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,840
I guess I've been

56
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,360
putting in a bit more effort lately.

57
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,760
So you actually studied?

58
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,520
You better do well on the college entrance exam,

59
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,640
or I'll lose face.

60
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,480
My abilities speak for themselves.

61
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,240
Unlike some people,

62
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,080
who aren't very good

63
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,000
and should talk less

64
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,040
and practice more,

65
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,520
right?

66
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,600
Are you talking about me?

67
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,360
I don't know.

68
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,220
Say that again.

69
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,180
Say that again.

70
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,220
Say that again.

71
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,180
Stop fighting.

72
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,240
Congratulations,

73
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,770
you actually scored higher than me this time.

74
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,120
Just luck.

75
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,860
It really was luck.

76
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,680
I didn't perform well this time,

77
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,520
I'll definitely score higher than you on the college entrance exam.

78
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,650
Good luck with that.

79
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,060
Did you see?

80
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,360
Shuo has improved

81
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,409
by so many places this time.

82
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,880
But the class monitor

83
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,440
is only ranked 57th with 40 points.

84
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,640
He used to be in the top five of our grade,

85
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,130
and he turned in his exam half an hour early this time.

86
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,760
It's so strange.

87
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,800
Maybe it's

88
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,380
too much pressure.

89
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,120
Perhaps.

90
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,760
If I had known, I would have asked Old Jiang

91
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,240
to leak some questions,

92
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,980
tell me what's on the college entrance exam.

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,600
This time...

94
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,730
Who's daydreaming in broad daylight?

95
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,480
If I told you the questions, they'd just change them.

96
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:15,940
Well...

97
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,560
I could ask him for multiple sets

98
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,440
wouldn't that work?

99
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,170
Just in case.

100
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,800
If I could score almost

101
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,240
perfect on the exam...

102
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,200
Gu Ming,

103
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,160
your performance on

104
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,820
this test was unusually poor.

105
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,880
You should know that

106
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,409
the school is counting on you to win rankings.

107
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,120
During my recent proctoring,

108
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,980
I noticed you've been turning in your papers early.

109
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,800
Can you tell me

110
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,960
what's going on?

111
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,780
Teacher Liu...

112
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,440
Turning in early

113
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,280
is to put pressure on myself.

114
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:50,760
It also helps me

115
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,040
tackle more difficult questions.

116
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,159
But this third mock exam

117
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:57,090
is basically simulating the college entrance exam,

118
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,600
so why are you doing this?

119
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,210
This is my strategy.

120
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,140
Teacher, trust me,

121
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,420
I won't do anything reckless.

122
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,320
I hope so.

123
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,760
Zhizhi,

124
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,360
Zhenzhen, come quickly.

125
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,360
Gu Ming,

126
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,460
don't think your teacher is nagging.

127
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,840
You're the most outstanding

128
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,200
student in our class.

129
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,400
I really don't want

130
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,600
you to let me down at this critical time.

131
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,460
But with your current situation,

132
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,440
I'm really worried.

133
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,450
Gu Ming, can you hear me?

134
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,880
Can you hear what I'm saying?

135
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,370
Teacher Liu,

136
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,130
don't worry,

137
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,800
I'll definitely work hard for the college entrance exam.

138
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,680
On the highest clock tower in this city,

139
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,200
that night,

140
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,280
she left me forever.

141
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,960
White feathers flying past,

142
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,620
clocks turning backward,

143
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,000
the final scene in my memory.

144
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,080
But the future is no different from the past.

145
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,960
Perhaps tomorrow,

146
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,240
she will walk back from the light,

147
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,360
only to leave again.

148
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,920
I need to find that ancient key

149
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,130
to unlock the door of memories.

150
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,840
There are billions of clocks there,

151
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,560
functioning like perpetual machines,

152
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,420
turning backward endlessly.

153
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
I want to make all the clocks stop.

154
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,760
This way she

155
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,360
will never be taken away by time.

156
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,690
I'm not fully awake.

157
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,760
Writing has

158
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,560
really made me

159
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,360
confused.

160
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,760
This isn't my home, is it?

161
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,160
Is this my room?

162
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,760
This is completely wrong.

163
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,200
No.

164
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,410
Impossible.

165
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,520
It can't be.

166
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,320
Xing.

167
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:44,920
I'm sorry,

168
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,040
I just woke up

169
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,560
and overslept,

170
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:46,920
sorry.

171
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:47,560
I'll

172
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,200
come right over to deliver it.

173
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,200
Who are you?

174
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,000
It's me,

175
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,880
Jiang Ling.

176
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,520
Which Jiang Ling?

177
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,680
I don't know you.

178
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,760
This is a financial company.

179
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,300
Are you looking for a loan?

180
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,520
Need a loan? I can tell you about our services.

181
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,640
We offer

182
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,240
small loans, non-quota loans, medium-sized loans, and more...

183
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,940
Are you listening?

184
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,720
Did I write this book?

185
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:15,920
It's mine.

186
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:19,960
No.

187
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,450
Where have they brought me?

188
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,840
This isn't me.

189
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,880
Not me.

190
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,530
James Joyce.

191
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,320
Time has reversed.

192
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,810
You're still alive,

193
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,540
aren't you?

194
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,200
Otherwise you couldn't have written to me.

195
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,290
My phone.

196
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,000
Where's

197
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,560
my phone?

198
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,500
I remember now.

199
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,820
Zhenzhen, I remember now.

200
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,400
I remember.

201
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,760
We wrote this.

202
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,960
An Zhenzhen.

203
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,840
I remember you now.

204
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,120
Where are you?

205
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Where's my phone?

206
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Where's my phone?

207
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,200
So where's my phone?

208
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,800
I'll call myself.

209
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,040
Hello.

210
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,360
The number you have dialed is not in service,

211
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,890
please check and try again.

212
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,520
The number you have dialed is not in service,

213
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,120
please check the number.

214
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,040
Hello.

215
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,370
Who are you looking for?

216
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
Is the owner home?

217
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,600
The owner hasn't been home lately.

218
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,600
Where did they go?

219
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,320
I think they went abroad.

220
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,640
Abroad?

221
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,700
When will they be back?

222
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,760
I don't know.

223
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,840
Thank you.

224
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,040
Hello,

225
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
the number you've dialed.

226
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:58,600
The number you're trying to reach is currently unavailable,

227
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,930
please try again later.

228
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,599
Hello.

229
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,400
I'd like to ask

230
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,640
if you've seen Qiu Qian?

231
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,240
Qiu Qian?

232
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,180
Don't know her.

233
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:12,770
Would you like something to drink?

234
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,160
What?

235
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,800
I just wanted to ask

236
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,800
how your novel manuscript

237
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,760
is coming along?

238
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,080
I'm stuck,

239
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,450
no inspiration,

240
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,900
can't write anything.

241
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,760
Wonder what's up with our class monitor lately,

242
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,480
always missing evening study sessions,

243
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,560
it's really strange.

244
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,160
Maybe

245
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,000
our discussion today

246
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,600
could give you some fresh inspiration.

247
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,090
How would that help?

248
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,820
I remember I gave the class monitor a book

249
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,890
that might have it written inside.

250
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,280
I'm sorry,

251
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,280
excuse me.

252
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,570
He's finished filling this out

253
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,300
but it's been crossed out.

254
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,380
Registration.

255
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:51,640
Hello.

256
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:58,680
Thank you.

257
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,530
You're here.

258
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,850
Teacher Liu.

259
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:10,800
Yes.

260
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,040
Come in.

261
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,900
A friend brought me a box of mate tea from Argentina.

262
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,490
Try some.

263
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,240
I came here

264
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:37,920
in such a hurry because...

265
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,850
I knew you would come back to see me,

266
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,770
but I didn't expect it to be so soon.

267
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,240
It is a bit sudden, I...

268
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,380
Mainly because...

269
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,570
You haven't been sleeping well lately, have you?

270
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,160
I haven't been sleeping well

271
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,000
lately,

272
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,920
I keep having dreams.

273
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Are you dreaming about An Zhenzhen?

274
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,240
Yes,

275
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,840
how did you know?

276
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,570
Have some tea first.

277
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,100
Professor Liu,

278
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,780
I don't know what's

279
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,610
happening to me lately.

280
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,370
When I think about An Zhenzhen,

281
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,680
I feel completely

282
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,440
confused.

283
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,880
I know she's dead,

284
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,800
but

285
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,400
I feel like

286
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,840
all my memories of her

287
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,960
have suddenly been awakened,

288
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,620
yet they don't exist anymore.

289
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
I've tried asking

290
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,360
people who knew she existed,

291
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,680
people who knew her,

292
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,940
I've tried to find them

293
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,040
but they're nowhere to be found.

294
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,800
There have been

295
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,200
too many strange things happening lately.

296
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,560
And

297
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,120
I feel like An Zhenzhen

298
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,960
isn't dead,

299
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,610
that she's still alive.

300
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,250
Your feelings are correct.

301
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,810
But she's already dead.

302
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,360
Have you ever considered

303
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,220
that all of this is related to you?

304
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,440
I don't know.

305
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,560
I'm not just talking about An Zhenzhen,

306
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,370
but everything around her.

307
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,840
And of course,

308
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,360
her life and death in your world.

309
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,400
If you put it that way,

310
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm

311
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,050
even more confused.

312
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,410
The tea is getting cold.

313
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,080
Are you sure you don't want a sip?

314
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,160
Professor Liu,

315
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,240
I just want you to tell me

316
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,680
everything

317
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,960
you know.

318
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,380
Perhaps when you've done what you need to do,

319
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,330
she will appear.

320
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,120
What should I do?

321
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,840
What you promised.

322
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,680
Why is

323
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,290
the protagonist always alone?

324
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,680
You could give her

325
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,020
a complete family.

326
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,330
The framework of this novel

327
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,890
has already been

328
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,020
established by me.

329
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,200
So for each character's

330
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,000
family background and personality,

331
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,460
everything is built around this framework.

332
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,400
Can't you write a comedy instead?

333
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,660
Comedies are good too.

334
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,960
In literature.

335
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,720
Most comedies

336
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,880
are a mixture of laughter and tears.

337
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,360
Indeed,

338
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,760
in this world,

339
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,780
how could everything be perfect?

340
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,240
I've grown up.

341
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
I always thought

342
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,340
everything in this world was wonderful.

343
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,560
My life,

344
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,200
I thought it was perfect.

345
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
Now I realize

346
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,860
it's far from perfect.

347
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,060
All beings suffer,

348
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,050
only we can save ourselves.

349
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,610
What does that mean?

350
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,280
For us,

351
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,160
perhaps our entire life

352
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,890
is meant to experience hardships.

353
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,180
Only after experiencing pain

354
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,770
can we truly understand

355
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,720
what real happiness is.

356
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,120
Happiness

357
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,600
exists relative to suffering,

358
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,160
not from external influences.

359
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,720
Only your own heart

360
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,140
can affect your judgment.

361
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,600
Alright.

362
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,170
I need to head back early today.

363
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,160
My aunt's store just got new inventory,

364
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,290
I need to go help out,

365
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,890
I'll head out first.

366
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,540
Jiangling!

367
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,720
Thank you.

368
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,720
Daughter.

369
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,760
At home,

370
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,560
your mom doesn't let you drink this,

371
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,960
but dad will buy it for you.

372
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,040
Thank you, Dad.

373
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,280
Cheers.

374
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,280
Taro milk tea.

375
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,720
It's delicious.

376
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,520
Really tasty.

377
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,320
I have more good news for you.

378
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,770
Didn't you want to visit the aquarium?

379
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,400
Dad already bought the tickets.

380
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,200
We'll go together this weekend.

381
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,640
But

382
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,960
if it's on the weekend,

383
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,490
doesn't Mom have a meeting?

384
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:35,640
Well.

385
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,200
I'll talk to her about it.

386
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,360
She can take time off.

387
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,960
She should be able to make it.

388
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,490
This is really good.

389
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,760
You and Mom

390
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,770
are actually divorced, right?

391
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,360
So you know.

392
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,000
I was planning

393
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,600
to tell you after your exams.

394
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,040
Aren't you tired of pretending?

395
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,200
You could have told me, you know.

396
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,080
I'm grown up now.

397
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,160
I can handle it.

398
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:26,280
I think...

399
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,480
Is this too harsh for you?

400
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
During this time,

401
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,900
I've really learned a lot.

402
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,770
I'm starting to understand

403
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,000
that the world

404
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,240
isn't

405
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,720
as perfect as I imagined.

406
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:43,960
So wonderful.

407
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,680
It's cruel

408
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,060
and realistic,

409
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,820
but I accept it.

410
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,480
After all,

411
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,940
all beings suffer.

412
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,260
One must save oneself, right?

413
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,040
Is what you're saying

414
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,560
from a book?

415
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,800
During this time,

416
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,560
I've been

417
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,970
trying to reconcile with your mom.

418
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,500
I want to give you back a complete family.

419
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,610
Mom won't agree to that.

420
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,400
My wish has always been

421
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,880
for our family

422
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,600
to stay together forever.

423
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,120
To live happily

424
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,840
ever after.

425
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,320
But

426
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,960
now my wish is

427
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,520
that I hope

428
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,600
you and Mom

429
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,940
can both find your own happiness.

430
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,440
That would make me happy too.

431
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,730
Just give me a little more time.

432
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,200
After all,

433
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,560
Dad has made

434
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:58,960
a lot of mistakes lately.

435
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,040
I need to make amends.

436
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,600
I've realized

437
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,480
you don't understand Mom at all.

438
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,640
She

439
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,060
has never been content

440
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,720
with just being a housewife.

441
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,720
She has her own dreams

442
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,060
and her own career.

443
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,560
She looks incredibly

444
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,200
cool when she's working.

445
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:18,840
So

446
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,760
she won't agree.

447
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,000
Well, I still have to try.

448
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,040
Good luck then.

449
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:28,920
Let's go home.

450
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,160
How about pork ribs for dinner tonight?

451
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,930
Sounds good.

452
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,600
Auntie.

453
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,840
What's wrong?

454
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,280
Come on, let me help you rest for a while.

455
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:47,600
Let's go.

456
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,360
I'm fine.

457
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,520
By the way,

458
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,920
how did you do on your third mock exam?

459
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,520
You haven't told me about it.

460
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:54,720
It's over.

461
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:56,720
Not bad.

462
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,160
I improved by over 20 points.

463
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:58,840
What?

464
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,330
Take it easy.

465
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,440
Over 20 points?

466
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,440
Why didn't you tell me?

467
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,520
I bet

468
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,240
half the credit for your score

469
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,960
belongs to An Zhenzhen.

470
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,920
At least she didn't hold me back,

471
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,050
that's good enough.

472
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,720
I've noticed

473
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,120
she's been coming over to tutor you quite often.

474
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,450
I really like that girl.

475
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,800
She's so lively and cheerful,

476
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,460
unlike you.

477
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,920
I'm the one tutoring her, actually.

478
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,480
That's enough,

479
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,440
stop working now.

480
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,680
I'll take you to the hospital tomorrow

481
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,800
to get some medicine.

482
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,330
Careful.

483
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,280
I told you not to do heavy work

484
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,320
but you insisted.

485
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,560
Come on, take it slow.

486
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,880
Make yourself comfortable, Auntie.

487
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,680
I'll leave this here,

488
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,410
I'm going to pay the bill first,

489
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,180
wait for me.

490
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,080
Hello, I'm here to make a payment.

491
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,840
How much is it?

492
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,770
18,000 in total.

493
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,639
Please take this.
