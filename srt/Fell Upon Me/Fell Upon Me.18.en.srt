1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,200
Time: 8:30-11:00

2
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,120
Day

3
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,479
What's in my backpack?

4
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,140
My backpack

5
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,320
I bought you a birthday cake

6
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,120
Do you like it?

7
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,080
It looks nice.

8
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,560
Why are you so gloomy on your birthday?

9
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,280
I'm not.

10
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,520
It's okay.

11
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,579
Say something.

12
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,440
Zhenzhen.

13
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,680
Qi Shuo.

14
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,490
Happy birthday.

15
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:58,920
I knew

16
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,770
you would definitely come.

17
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,680
What do you know?

18
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,400
You know

19
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,220
you didn't even invite me.

20
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,520
If it weren't for Jiangling,

21
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,120
I really wouldn't have come.

22
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,730
I was afraid to tell you,

23
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,720
I left you a note,

24
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,450
but you probably didn't see it.

25
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,200
Alright.

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,880
Let's just say I'm

27
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,340
crashing the party, okay?

28
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:29,720
No, no,

29
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,320
that's not it.

30
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,360
I

31
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,640
I bought lots of snacks.

32
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,200
Come on.

33
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,920
Come on.

34
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:34,800
There are

35
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,160
all

36
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,600
kinds of

37
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,320
things you love,

38
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,800
look.

39
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,840
Alright.

40
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,040
Do you know how fattening these are?

41
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,730
And you bought these for me.

42
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,120
Did you buy these for me

43
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,360
or for yourself?

44
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,560
You two just enjoy yourselves.

45
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,320
Happy birthday to you.

46
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,880
Happy birthday to you.

47
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,050
Happy birthday.

48
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
Happy birthday.

49
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,730
Happy birthday.

50
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,520
Your hat fell off.

51
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,920
You've prepared so many snacks,

52
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,970
but I still think

53
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,480
this one tastes the best.

54
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,680
Go ahead, eat.

55
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,040
Try it.

56
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,320
This is super delicious.

57
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:18,779
Really?

58
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,899
Cheers with chips!

59
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,760
Cheers!

60
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,040
I think

61
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,640
tomorrow morning.

62
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,320
How about

63
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,480
we visit the wishing tree again,

64
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,480
what do you think?

65
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,400
They say

66
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,960
making wishes at sunrise

67
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,120
is more effective.

68
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Sounds good to me.

69
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
What do you think?

70
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:42,920
Okay.

71
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,560
Sure.

72
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,560
It's alright.

73
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,000
Believe in yourself.

74
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,040
I'll go get some fresh air

75
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,480
and leave you two to talk.

76
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,800
Zhenzhen.

77
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,260
I want to talk to you about something.

78
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:06,880
Go ahead.

79
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,860
About our fight last time,

80
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,520
when we argued,

81
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,720
I went home

82
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,320
and thought about it calmly.

83
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,240
Well,

84
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,640
I know you're definitely not

85
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,300
the type of person who speaks without thinking.

86
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,160
I know that.

87
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,810
I was impulsive.

88
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,880
And afterward,

89
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,720
as soon as I got home,

90
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
I immediately

91
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,560
talked to my sister

92
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,820
and asked her about it.

93
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,480
She said that

94
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,720
there might be other factors involved.

95
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,240
She

96
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:34,640
didn't

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,560
tell me anything,

98
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,320
didn't explain.

99
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,200
But anyway,

100
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,330
regardless of the circumstances.

101
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:39,920
At that time,

102
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,400
as your friend,

103
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,360
I shouldn't have treated you that way,

104
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,920
you know?

105
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,080
I'm formally

106
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,400
I'm

107
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,530
apologizing to you.

108
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,360
Actually,

109
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,490
I should be the one apologizing to you.

110
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,240
No.

111
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,300
Let me speak first.

112
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,600
Ever since

113
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,659
I found out about my parents' situation.

114
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,170
My emotions have been terrible every day.

115
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,780
I should have understood.

116
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,240
The adults' issues

117
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,640
have nothing to do

118
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,600
with you and me.

119
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,820
It's just that I was

120
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,920
too weak.

121
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,400
So

122
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,960
I took my emotions out

123
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,200
on the person closest to me.

124
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,920
No, it was my fault.

125
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:17,760
That day,

126
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,050
the things I said

127
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,120
to you.

128
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,240
I don't even know what

129
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,240
was wrong with me.

130
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,120
How could I

131
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,840
say such hateful things.

132
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,160
I understand.

133
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,400
Me too.

134
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,280
You're truly my best friend,

135
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,880
Qi Shuo.

136
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:32,560
I understand.

137
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,890
I don't want this issue to come between us.

138
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,400
I don't know what

139
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,860
was wrong with me that day.

140
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,520
I just

141
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,080
got upset over nothing.

142
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,200
How did I end up

143
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,570
shouting like that.

144
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
And then there was

145
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,840
that thing about the milk money.

146
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,040
You remember, right?

147
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:50,690
I'm back.

148
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,720
How's your conversation going?

149
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,680
Pretty good.

150
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
I gave Qi Shuo a serious talking-to.

151
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,400
We agreed

152
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,360
to have a cold war for a day,

153
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,200
day after day,

154
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,600
I've been waiting for him to apologize,

155
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,760
but he never did.

156
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,120
Yeah, what's going on?

157
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,320
I'm sorry, Zhenzhen.

158
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
I'm really sorry.

159
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,040
It's my fault.

160
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:12,800
I...

161
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,120
I admit it,

162
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:14,820
really.

163
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,680
Really.

164
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:16,890
I'm serious.

165
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,140
Stop apologizing.

166
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,770
Alright,

167
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,900
let's get started.

168
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:46,960
Begin.

169
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,330
Let's go.

170
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:21,920
Then let's go with

171
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:22,450
that one.

172
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,160
So soon?

173
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,920
Wait a moment.

174
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,200
Don't open the pouch yet,

175
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,730
better to open it only when you really need to.

176
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll do as you say.

177
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,680
Qi Shuo,

178
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,000
did you hear me?

179
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't open the pouch.

180
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,450
Let's go.

181
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:39,720
Okay.

182
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,250
Let's go.

183
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,620
Wait for me.

184
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,040
Mr. Jiang.

185
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,840
About the milk money.

186
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,760
I wanted to tell you.

187
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,760
Actually,

188
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,080
I forgot to mention that

189
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,320
the issue with the milk money

190
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,380
has been resolved.

191
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,050
The money

192
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,920
was found.

193
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,320
Where did you find it?

194
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,640
It suddenly appeared in the classroom.

195
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,180
Just appeared out of nowhere.

196
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,520
It seems

197
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,960
that timeline of yours

198
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,220
is starting to change.

199
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,120
Jiang.

200
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,730
I've been thinking,

201
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,880
and I feel

202
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,960
this matter is already in the past.

203
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,160
It's not worth spending more time and energy

204
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,220
trying to solve it.

205
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,240
I don't even want to know the truth anymore.

206
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,240
For me,

207
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,740
this matter...

208
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,380
It's just too heartbreaking.

209
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,240
Let's move on.

210
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,840
Something happened to me recently.

211
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,240
I was falsely accused

212
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,570
of stealing milk money.

213
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:23,640
My parents

214
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,620
didn't believe me either.

215
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,010
And my good friends,

216
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,880
for various reasons,

217
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,020
have all drifted away from me.

218
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,460
I had thoughts of despair.

219
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,770
I went up to the rooftop.

220
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,440
If it weren't for Xiao Jiang,

221
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,040
I probably

222
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,340
wouldn't be answering your call now.

223
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,520
I'm sorry, Jiang.

224
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,040
I almost

225
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,920
let history repeat itself,

226
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
making all your efforts worthless.

227
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,320
It's over now,

228
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
let it go.

229
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,520
So,

230
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,920
he did it.

231
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,080
Yes.

232
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,320
If

233
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,080
in the original timeline,

234
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,880
my fate

235
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,120
was to jump off that rooftop,

236
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,900
then I've already been through that now.

237
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,010
The moment I stood on that rooftop.

238
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,080
I suddenly

239
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,120
felt connected to another version of myself in a different timeline.

240
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,640
She

241
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,000
must have been so desperate.

242
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,400
In such a short time,

243
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,610
one blow after another.

244
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,160
She's all alone

245
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,180
with no one by her side.

246
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,880
Since everything is in the past now,

247
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,280
you need to live well

248
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,450
and stop thinking about

249
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,040
all those bad things.

250
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,960
I've always wanted

251
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,220
to tell you something.

252
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,420
And that is,

253
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:55,680
thank you.

254
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,240
Thank you

255
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,340
for letting me meet 18-year-old Jiangling,

256
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,200
who is truly a wonderful person.

257
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,000
Although he seems

258
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,320
cold on the outside,

259
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,640
he has

260
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,320
a passionate

261
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,880
and gentle heart.

262
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,860
Thank you for this call

263
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,770
that brought you all

264
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,240
into my world

265
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,080
and saved me.

266
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,620
Because of you,

267
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,960
all of you,

268
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,120
I found the courage to face everything.

269
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,400
Thank you.

270
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,320
Thank you,

271
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,600
Jiangling of 2024.

272
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:36,960
Hello,

273
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,720
the number you've dialed is temporarily unavailable.

274
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,880
The number you've dialed is temporarily unavailable.

275
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,600
I've already said goodbye to Lao Jiang,

276
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,040
we won't be talking anymore.

277
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,440
In that case,

278
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,360
I'll change my phone number too.

279
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,880
You don't have to change it.

280
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,610
I'll change your contact name.

281
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,240
I'll call you

282
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,560
the kind

283
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,120
and caring

284
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,440
Classmate Jiang.

285
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,560
Saved,

286
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,000
kind and caring.

287
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,060
From now on, it's just you.

288
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,410
That's good.

289
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,400
Do you have any other flavors?

290
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,040
No,

291
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,600
they only had original flavor when I bought it.

292
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,730
The original flavor

293
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,250
doesn't taste good.

294
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,180
I have more.

295
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,520
It's gone.

296
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,400
Take two,

297
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,850
I still have plenty.

298
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,760
Your phone is quite old,

299
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,280
an antique.

300
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,080
But it's functioning properly,

301
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,740
take a look.

302
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,940
Let me try calling you.

303
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,120
It works fine.

304
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
This phone

305
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,920
seems to be working,

306
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,400
but I can never get through when I make calls.

307
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,000
Especially this one number,

308
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,860
this specific number,

309
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,240
I've tried over 10 times

310
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,840
and can't get through at all.

311
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,690
Let me try it.

312
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,240
Hello,

313
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,480
the number you have dialed is not in service,

314
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,010
please check and try again.

315
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,640
This probably isn't

316
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,040
something that can be fixed by repairing your phone.

317
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,100
You can put it down.

318
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,600
Okay, thanks.

319
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,090
You're welcome.

320
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,119
Students,

321
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,000
we don't have much time left to prepare for the exam.

322
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,760
We're about to have our third

323
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,880
and final

324
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,280
mock exam.

325
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,000
Everything will be just like the college entrance exam,

326
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,120
so I hope everyone

327
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,520
will approach this test

328
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,050
with the same seriousness.

329
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,120
Class monitor,

330
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,360
can you look at question 7,

331
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,440
this multiple choice question?

332
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,360
I chose C,

333
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,720
is the tense correct?

334
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,380
Class monitor.

335
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,020
Class monitor.

336
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,580
Class monitor.

337
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,520
You're actually

338
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,520
spacing out.

339
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,520
It's rare to see you spacing out.

340
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,200
Usually you're either studying

341
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,920
or asking teachers questions.

342
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,250
So you can daydream too,

343
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,440
amazing.

344
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,920
Don't make fun of me.

345
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,720
What's wrong?

346
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,210
This question here,

347
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:09,680
look,

348
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,380
it's been changed to this.

349
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,250
If I choose this one, is it correct?

350
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's right here.

351
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,400
It looks delicious.

352
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,920
It's extremely

353
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,040
incredibly delicious,

354
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,760
absolutely amazing.

355
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,620
Let me try some.

356
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,520
We're here,

357
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,360
hello!

358
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,340
Please have a seat.

359
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,080
I'll get some bowls for you.

360
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,680
Thanks.

361
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,240
I've finished cutting the Chinese yam.

362
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,120
We'll put it in the pot later.

363
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,400
I'm going to serve the others now.

364
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:39,920
Coming!

365
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,680
What delicious dishes do we have today?

366
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,720
Coming!

367
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,080
Beef.

368
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,880
Smells amazing!

369
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,010
This is incredible!

370
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,610
Not all the dishes are here yet.

371
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,440
Thank you.

372
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:57,720
No.

373
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,040
There are only three of us,

374
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,400
right,

375
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,460
why so many dishes?

376
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,400
Kung Pao Chicken and tomato egg stir-fry.

377
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,080
Auntie's treat.

378
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,940
Take your time.

379
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,880
Thank you, Auntie.

380
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,940
You're welcome, enjoy your meal.

381
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,980
This is delicious.

382
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,760
This tomato and egg stir-fry

383
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,920
is incredibly good.

384
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,280
How did you make this?

385
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,600
Try this quickly.

386
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,360
Wait, wait.

387
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,860
I'm overwhelmed here.

388
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,560
Really.

389
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,320
I have something for you.

390
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,290
Guess what it is?

391
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,640
I know.

392
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,400
Give it to me.

393
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,860
I've finished writing it.

394
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,160
You wrote so much.

395
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
Let me take a look.

396
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:46,960
How is it?

397
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,680
You wrote so well, Qiuqiu.

398
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,760
Qianqian.

399
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,800
Could you be a little more fair?

400
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,120
When I compare yours to mine,

401
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,380
mine looks like ancient hieroglyphics.

402
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,680
Could you watch what you say?

403
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,900
Be a little nicer to me.

404
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,280
It's already generous of me to write anything for you.

405
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,800
Thank me now.

406
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,400
You're seniors in high school, right?

407
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,000
Yeah.

408
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,600
What's up?

409
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,080
Then you definitely need this.

410
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,480
Call this number if you're interested.

411
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:18,850
Give them a call.

412
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,720
If your college entrance exam scores don't improve,

413
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,960
full refund,

414
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,600
and another chance for your child,

415
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,200
second-tier college becomes first-tier,

416
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,520
first-tier becomes top university,

417
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,600
we guarantee your child's future.

418
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,400
What kind of organization is this?

419
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,130
So arrogant.

420
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,220
Class monitor.

421
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,490
Here's your test paper.

422
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,400
Class monitor.

423
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,560
You're not attending evening study again?

424
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,400
I asked Teacher Liu for leave.

425
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,200
Got something to deal with at home.

426
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,330
I'm heading out now.

427
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,040
Don't you think

428
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,440
the class monitor has been acting really strange lately?

429
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,880
I just caught a glimpse

430
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,440
in his bag

431
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,560
of some tutoring flyer.

432
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,880
He's the top student in our grade.

433
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,320
Why would he need tutoring?

434
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,400
Is it possible

435
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,200
that he was distributing those flyers and hadn't finished yet?

436
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,260
You're saying he skips evening study

437
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,380
to hand out flyers?

438
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,090
Everyone has difficult times.

439
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,250
Won't that affect his studies?

440
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:28,080
Just stop asking him about it.

441
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,600
Since he hasn't told us anything,

442
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,660
it means he doesn't want us involved.

443
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,730
That's true.

444
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:37,760
Dr. Liu,

445
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,400
wasn't my mother's surgery successful?

446
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,200
Why is she still coughing blood?

447
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,160
Given the patient's current condition,

448
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:44,840
the surgery was only meant to

449
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,640
maintain her basic vital signs.

450
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,800
If you want her to improve,

451
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,860
there's still a very long road ahead.

452
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:50,840
No.

453
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,100
Is there any solution?

454
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,080
Unless...

455
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,520
Unless what?

456
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,840
There's a special medication available internationally

457
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,520
with promising clinical results,

458
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,250
but it's extremely expensive.

459
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,600
I think for you,

460
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,930
it might be an enormous financial burden.

461
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:06,920
How much?

462
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,040
10,000 per dose,

463
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,680
you'll need 100,000 for the initial treatment.

464
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,560
For the complete treatment process,

465
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,400
you'll need to prepare

466
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,600
at least 1 million yuan.

467
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,700
I need to go now.

468
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,840
I'll figure something out, doctor.

469
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,800
I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

470
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,160
Hello.

471
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,770
About mom's illness...

472
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,970
Do you have any money right now?

473
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:53,880
You little—

474
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,720
every time you call, you ask for money—

475
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,240
What,

476
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,800
do I owe you something?

477
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,400
No.

478
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,320
Mom's surgery costs 1 million yuan, I really...

479
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:00,760
I really...

480
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,480
If you've got the guts, sell your father

481
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,540
and see if you can get 1 million for me.

482
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,120
Clear logic

483
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,880
and elegant wording.

484
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,320
You wrote quite well.

485
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,520
Not bad,

486
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,200
you've made great progress,

487
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,770
you can even analyze it now.

488
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,560
My literary skills

489
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,220
have indeed improved lately.

490
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,120
Actually...

491
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,920
That manuscript everyone in class was talking about,

492
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,320
you wrote it, didn't you?

493
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,760
Last time when I was at your place

494
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,800
reading that essay

495
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,800
I could feel it.

496
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,000
When I was

497
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,320
writing at that time

498
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,960
I didn't know

499
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,240
what to name the protagonist in my novel

500
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,640
You were always around me

501
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,760
so I just borrowed your name.

502
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,200
Actually

503
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,200
I've read that manuscript

504
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:17,880
and I think

505
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,320
it's really well written.

506
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,720
Why did you stop writing?

507
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,080
Actually, novels

508
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,180
are just like life.

509
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,960
The unknown

510
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,240
is always full of anticipation.

511
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,520
In stories without endings,

512
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,680
readers

513
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,460
will keep asking for more.

514
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,200
That's why

515
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,600
I never write endings.

516
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,720
They won't think my skills

517
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,060
are just mediocre.

518
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,000
I think

519
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,080
words have power.

520
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,200
Novels

521
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,440
and stories - whether they're sincere or not,

522
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,040
readers

523
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,100
can tell from the very first line.

524
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,200
Well,

525
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,290
I've read your manuscript,

526
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,460
so I guess I'm one of your readers now.

527
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,320
I'd like

528
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,160
to follow your story

529
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,360
all the way to the end.

530
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,080
Even if somewhere along the way

531
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,880
you might run low on inspiration

532
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,640
and the story might stall,

533
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,320
but

534
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,460
I'm still looking forward to seeing how it ends.

535
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:14,920
Thank you.

536
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,330
Can I see the complete version?

537
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,160
It's not finished yet,

538
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,090
and I left everything else at home.

539
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,320
Let me think about it.

540
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,240
But a first draft would be even better,

541
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,000
I could give you some feedback

542
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,660
from a reader's perspective.

543
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,520
Don't you think about it?

544
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,000
I'm ready.

545
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,250
This first draft of mine

546
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:46,880
I know.

547
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,200
is mostly incomplete.

548
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:50,800
You

549
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,400
I understand.

550
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,280
haven't even polished it,

551
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,160
it's just a draft.

552
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,040
Why are you so talkative today?

553
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,370
It's not like you at all.

554
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,120
I think it's still...

555
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,320
I need to read it

556
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,420
with full concentration.

557
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,480
There might be many logical inconsistencies,

558
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,160
you need to point them out,

559
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,520
including the plot,

560
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,040
character development.

561
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,880
Is it any good?

562
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,040
I think there are quite a few issues.

563
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,960
I think

564
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,640
it's really good.

565
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,490
Let's leave the rest

566
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,240
for other readers to judge.

567
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,530
What do you mean?

568
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:32,960
I have

569
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,120
a great idea.

570
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,930
You could publish what you've written

571
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,080
as a serial online.

572
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,080
And then?

573
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,400
You'll be able to see

574
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,760
readers' feedback anytime, anywhere.

575
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,760
That way you'll know

576
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,160
how good your writing is.

577
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,720
I don't think that's a good idea,

578
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,920
after all, this is just a draft,

579
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,760
you haven't even...

580
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,440
Trust me,

581
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,300
it'll be absolutely fine.

582
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,250
We just need to polish it a bit more.

583
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,010
I think this part

584
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,280
is written really well.

585
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,320
Years later,

586
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,680
the two meet at a grand ball

587
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,640
by chance.

588
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,360
They dance together

589
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,920
a captivating tango.

590
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,330
I've watched tango performances.

591
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,080
I just thought

592
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,520
describing it this way

593
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,580
would be romantic.

594
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,520
I think the tango part is excellent.

595
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,400
Very stylish.

596
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,880
Then why did you write about them?

597
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,360
Because

598
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,520
of the boy's dream,

599
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:29,920
and then

600
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,360
they were separated,

601
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,800
only to meet again years later.

602
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,840
I don't think they need to be separated.

603
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,040
Separation is so sad.

604
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,220
I think they should

605
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
just stay together,

606
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,800
remain in the same city,

607
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,800
and be together

608
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,000
all the time. That would be nice.

609
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,120
Then they could be together

610
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,840
and continue to fulfill their original dreams,

611
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,170
supporting each other.

612
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,680
Look at this line,

613
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,080
this one is well written.

614
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,520
True literature

615
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,280
should be born of night

616
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,440
and silence,

617
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,680
not of daylight

618
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,720
and idle chatter.

619
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,240
Time flies,

620
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,800
everything changes.

621
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,140
The wonderful midsummer has passed,

622
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,360
the world molders in its joy.

623
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,730
Youth is forced to leave its cradle

624
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,840
to grow up in the cruelty of poetry.

625
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,080
They met in their youth

626
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,120
yet passed by each other

627
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,700
in countless moments.

628
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,320
At school,

629
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,290
the boy was quiet and reserved,

630
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,680
always alone,

631
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,650
constantly watching the girl.

632
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,200
The girl seemed to notice him too,

633
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,800
but never had

634
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,480
the courage to approach him.

635
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,600
The two of them

636
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,140
barely crossed paths.

637
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,280
In the graduation photo,

638
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,720
they stood far apart from each other,

639
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,650
never capturing

640
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,000
a single picture together.

641
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,480
The boy noticed the girl's

642
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,760
downcast mood,

643
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,260
but lacked the courage

644
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,520
to offer comfort.

645
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,360
The night before graduation.

646
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,600
Tragedy struck

647
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,800
as the boy, holding his finished novel,

648
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,480
chased after the girl's silhouette.

649
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,000
But he failed to stop her

650
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,040
from heading to the rooftop.

651
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,440
On the highest clock tower in the city.

652
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,320
That night,

653
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,920
she left me forever.

654
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,640
White feathers drifting by.

655
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,360
The clock turning backward.

656
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,160
The final scene

657
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,880
in my memory.

658
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,100
But the future is no different from the past.

659
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,640
Perhaps tomorrow,

660
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,400
she will return from the light.
