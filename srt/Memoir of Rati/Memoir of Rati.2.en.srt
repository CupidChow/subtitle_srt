2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,000
Khun Dech wins!

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,280
-Give me back my locket.
-Locket?

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,000
What are you doing?

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,480
That locket is my mother.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,800
Let Rati have his wish

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,920
and I will also do anything.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,640
Friends are supposed to be able
to trust each other.

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,160
We are friends now?

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,920
I need your help with Rati.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,920
THE FRENCH LEGATION

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,800
What's the issue now?

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,080
-It was disrespectful of you!
-That was the order we got.

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,880
-You brought me the wrong document.
-We barely had any time to prepare!

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,560
-It's unacceptable!
-What do you want?

16
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,760
-We can't understand you at all!
-Excuse me.

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:40,880
Can I help you?

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,960
Since the crisis
between our two countries,

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,880
it seems the Siamese authorities
harbor many prejudices against France.

20
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,400
If this is the case,

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,840
diplomatic operations will be difficult.

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,360
We have a problem,
but we can't communicate.

23
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,600
This is the document.

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,160
Listen.

25
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,440
You should educate our people
to be more respectful to the Siamese.

26
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,320
These people have brought it to me,
and it is incomplete.

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,480
Hello, sirs.

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
My name is Rati.

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,040
I am the interpreter here at the legation.

30
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,920
How can I help you?

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,960
Thanks, young man.

32
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,000
Although he grew up in Europe,
he fits in well with the Siamese.

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,800
Rati has something we Europeans lack.

34
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,600
That's exactly why Paris chose him
as their interpreter this time.

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,040
It's a great decision.

36
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,800
Thanks. Thank you very much.

37
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,840
All done, sirs.

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,120
Thanks, young man.

39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,800
I had an audience
with His Majesty today, Mother.

40
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,040
I have never been so nervous.

41
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,560
I am still a little shaken even now.

42
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,280
You taught me Thai, French, and English.

43
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,920
Never had I imagined
I'd get to use them all in one day.

44
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,000
You truly foresaw the future, Mother.

45
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,240
More importantly,

46
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,720
His Majesty was impressed with me.

47
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,760
His Majesty sent his compliments
to the interpreter.

48
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,520
For a young man born in Siam
but raised abroad

49
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:55,800
to be knowledgeable in the languages
and cultures of both countries

50
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,360
is rare.

51
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,160
His Majesty expresses
his appreciation to the interpreter.

52
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,560
A young man born in Siam
but educated abroad

53
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:11,200
who understands the language
and culture so well is very rare.

54
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,560
That His Majesty granted
your diplomatic mission an audience

55
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,079
and even compliment your interpreter

56
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,920
does not mean that Siam is leaning
towards France's side

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,680
instead of remaining neutral.

58
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,120
We hope you understand.

59
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,840
Do not worry.

60
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,760
We believe in everything
that is factual and in writing.

61
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,760
And we hope what is in writing

62
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,920
will be full of liberty, equality,
and fraternity,

63
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,520
just like the French believe in.

64
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,560
What worries me
is the attitude of the Siamese,

65
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,960
especially the high-ranking officials.

66
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,400
They seem unfriendly with the French.

67
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,760
If there was anything I could do
to bridge the gap

68
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,400
between the Siamese and the French,

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,920
I would gladly do it.

70
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,480
I want to make you proud, Mother.

71
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,080
I HOPE TO SEE YOU.
-THEERATHON

72
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,680
Grandmother.

73
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,000
Why is there a rumor that
you are an invert, Thee?

74
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,400
It doesn't matter who started that rumor.

75
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,160
What matters is that it is
all over town now.

76
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,360
The longer we let this go on, the more
damage it does to the Wisut family.

77
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,880
How will you quell this rumor?

78
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,000
Maybe it is time you got married, Thee.

79
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,880
Grandmother.

80
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,320
Nothing is certain in times of war.

81
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,760
I'm afraid this is not the right time
for a wedding.

82
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,000
War is still far away from Siam,

83
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,720
but the Wisut family's reputation
is very much in danger.

84
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,640
Am I right, Ram?

85
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,160
Of course, Mother.

86
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,760
Sit down.

87
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,240
Do you agree with me that it is time
that Thee got married?

88
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,600
I do, Mother.

89
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,160
Well then, you are to come
straight home after work.

90
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,640
I want to introduce you to someone.

91
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,240
Butterfly pea flower tea, sir.

92
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,160
Jam.

93
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,400
There's no need to call me "sir."

94
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,600
It makes me feel strange.

95
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,520
You will get used to it, sir.

96
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:27,960
Jam.

97
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,560
-You despise the French, don't you?
-Pardon?

98
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,880
Well…

99
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,560
I've noticed that many Siamese
don't like the French much

100
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,720
because of that past incident.

101
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,320
If we're referring to that incident,
then I don't like them, sir.

102
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,960
But regarding you, Mr. Rati, what reason
is there for me to despise you, sir?

103
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,880
You are so good to me, after all.

104
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,400
I'm capable of distinguishing, sir.

105
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,520
Did someone show hostility
towards you, Mr. Rati?

106
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,440
Shall I beat some sense into them?

107
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,560
Of course not!

108
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,560
Put your foot down.

109
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,920
Apologies, sir.

110
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,680
Jam, what ministry
does that building belong to?

111
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,400
That place is Suangsuralai House.
It belongs to the Wisut family.

112
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,600
It is best to stay away from them, sir.

113
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,440
I heard at the market

114
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,799
that the Young Master there
is "that way" inclined.

115
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,920
"That way"?

116
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
When a woman and another woman…

117
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,120
we call it "a game of flats."

118
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,040
When a man and another man…

119
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,840
They are "that way."

120
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,040
You should memorize his name, sir.

121
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,720
Count Suratheetamtanapich.

122
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,440
"Count Suratheetamtanapich"?

123
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,920
No, sir.

124
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,320
My name is Kui.

125
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,520
I know I have the aura of a duke,

126
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,120
but I am simply a commoner, sir.

127
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,360
Mr. Rati wasn't talking about you.

128
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,840
Come here.

129
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,120
This is Kui, sir.

130
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,360
He's the new gardener.

131
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,720
Mr. Ambassador asked him
to help me take care of you.

132
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,920
I'll be in your care, Kui.

133
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,320
Of course, sir.

134
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,120
Don't you know your place at all?

135
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,720
My head isn't a drum, you know!

136
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,480
What did you want, barging in like that?

137
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,800
Someone asked me to pass this to you, sir.

138
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,360
Know your place and bow!

139
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,040
How shall I get in?

140
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,720
You people sure cough a lot around here.

141
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,320
What business do you have here?

142
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,000
-Why is he smiling?
-I wonder.

143
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,840
Of course he reads by the river.

144
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,920
These foreigners are "morantic,"
aren't they?

145
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,680
It's "romantic."

146
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,320
Mr. Rati, sir.

147
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,480
What would you like for lunch?

148
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,560
Would you like something French?

149
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,600
Or would you like something Siamese?

150
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,600
I can't choose.

151
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,320
-Please do.
-Please do.

152
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,000
Well, why don't you bring me both,
Jam, Kui?

153
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,960
I'll choose later.

154
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,320
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

155
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Me first!

156
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:35,240
-Hey! Wait for me!
-Let go of me.

157
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,800
Mr. Rati.

158
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,160
-Hey!
-What?!

159
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,360
-Stay behind me!
-You stay behind me!

160
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,280
It's always ladies first,
don't you know that?

161
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,040
-No!
-Hey! Kui!

162
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,040
-Your lunch, sir.
-Your lunch, sir.

163
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,920
-Sir.
-Sir.

164
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,000
Why did you suddenly ask to see me today?

165
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,440
I need to tell you something…

166
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,520
about me.

167
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,280
What is it?

168
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,040
Hey.

169
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,040
Sir.

170
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,880
Sir?

171
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,640
Your mind was wandering, wasn't it?

172
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,320
To whom did it wander, I wonder?

173
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,560
No one.

174
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,640
It's nothing.

175
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,280
Here, here.

176
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,920
Place your bets!

177
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,760
Place your bets and win some money!

178
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,560
Are the fighters ready?

179
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,800
Come over to the middle.

180
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,840
Let's hear it for Mr. Dam here!

181
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,800
What about Khun Dech?

182
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,000
Khun Dech!

183
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,120
You ready?

184
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,840
Fight!

185
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,400
You can still place your bets.

186
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:18,720
-He's unbeatable!
-Go, Dam!

187
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,120
Place your bets!

188
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,120
Step back.

189
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,680
-Get up!
-Get up! Dam!

190
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,080
Dam is down!

191
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,200
Khun Dech wins!

192
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,400
Khun Dech! Khun Dech!

193
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,080
-Khun Dech!
-Khun Dech!

194
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,000
Khun Dech! Khun Dech!

195
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,480
My name is Khun Dech of Trok Rong Wua.

196
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,880
If you dare take me on, come on up!

197
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,320
Yeah!

198
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,360
Get on up!

199
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,560
-I will!
-Anyone?

200
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,400
I'm Ped of Rong Si.

201
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,120
Ped of Rong Si!

202
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,560
Khun Dech! Khun Dech!

203
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,120
Place your bets!

204
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,720
-For Ped?
-Did the guy in the front lose?

205
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,880
Khun Dech! Khun Dech!
Trust me, Khun Dech will win.

206
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,760
Khun Dech! Khun Dech!

207
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,800
A bet on Khun Dech?

208
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,280
Khun Dech! Khun Dech!

209
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,600
-For Ped? Hey--
-Khun Dech!

210
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,480
Who has lost the most money?

211
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,600
All right. Place your bets!

212
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,480
Khun Dech! Khun Dech!

213
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
-Hey! It's Khun Dech, for sure!
-Khun Dech!

214
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,280
If you're ready, come over to the middle.

215
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,080
You ready? Everyone ready?

216
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,080
Yes!

217
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,360
-Khun Dech!
-Fight!

218
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,240
Go on!

219
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,320
Place your bets!

220
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
Hit him, Khun Dech!

221
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,760
Khun Dech!

222
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,560
-You can do it, Khun Dech.
-Is it about time? Want more?

223
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,480
-To your corners!
-Khun Dech got it first.

224
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,440
Khun Dech, you all right?

225
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,880
I'm fine!

226
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,040
Khun Dech can go on!

227
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,080
Come on over.

228
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,640
Khun Dech! Khun Dech!

229
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,000
You ready? Ready?

230
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,440
Fight!

231
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,000
Go on! Quickly!

232
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,480
What's that smell? It stinks!

233
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,560
Shut your mouth, you annoying prick.

234
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,320
Hold.

235
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,040
One. Two. Three.

236
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,520
Khun Dech is defeated.

237
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,160
We have a new winner!

238
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,560
Khun Dech!

239
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,800
-Yay!
-What the hell?!

240
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,240
Thanks for the money.

241
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,480
Anyone want to have a go?

242
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,280
-Come on up.
-Mr. Kom!

243
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,040
Mr. Kom!

244
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,000
Who else?

245
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,960
Me, Mr. Petch.

246
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,080
Mr. Petch, come on up!

247
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,320
Petch of Ban Klang!

248
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,760
The next match is between
Mr. Kom and Mr. Petch!

249
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,080
Place your bets!

250
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:01,360
Who was it?

251
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,240
Hey.

252
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,319
Who are you? How did you win?

253
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,119
What?

254
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,160
I know you were cheating.

255
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,000
Me? Cheating?

256
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,640
You were chewing on something.

257
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,240
Was it a stimulant?

258
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,119
Hey!

259
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
You don't smell anymore!

260
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,480
What smell?

261
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,000
I wasn't even in the ring!

262
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,360
Who was?

263
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,800
Some other guy, I'd bet.

264
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,720
Who dares defeat me?

265
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,280
Hey.

266
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,320
To Ratchawong Street.

267
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,440
Yes, sir.

268
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,720
Go quickly.

269
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,400
Damnation!

270
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,600
Hey, hold on.

271
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,240
To Burapa Palace.

272
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,880
Hurry up.

273
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,040
Did you have fun on the boat?

274
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,600
I did. I enjoyed it.

275
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,800
It's good to be back in Siam.

276
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,800
What's wrong?

277
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,800
Nothing.

278
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,800
Tell me.

279
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,720
I'm well aware that the Siamese
don't like the French much.

280
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,560
I can't help but wonder whether those two
would have smiled at me like that

281
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,040
if they'd known I was a Frenchman.

282
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,320
You're overthinking things.

283
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,880
The Siamese are just like the French.

284
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,000
Some can distinguish between the good
and the bad. Some can't.

285
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,240
What about you, Thee?
Which kind are you?

286
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,720
I picked up a Frenchman in my own boat.

287
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,600
I'm also very cordial with him.

288
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,080
I don't think I need
to answer that question.

289
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,720
If one day Siam and France
get into conflict again,

290
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,720
will there be a rift between us too?

291
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,360
As for me, I can guarantee there won't be.

292
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,680
The nation's problems
belong to the nation.

293
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,680
Our problems belong to us.

294
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,160
Do you mean it?
What if I'm not who you think I am?

295
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,680
You won't hold it against me?

296
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,360
It depends on…

297
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
Lotuses!

298
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,480
Are those lotuses?

299
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,440
The lotuses here are the most beautiful.

300
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,120
What's the matter?

301
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,320
They don't look like the lotus stems
my mother used to make soup with.

302
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,120
Those are different.

303
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,560
Do you like lotus stem soup?

304
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,400
I'll make it for you sometime.

305
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,400
I did it, Mother.

306
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,080
She would be so happy.

307
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,400
So am I. I got to bring my mother back to
her homeland to pay respects at a temple.

308
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,560
She told me she would bring me back here
to visit a temple one day

309
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,800
if I ever became an interpreter.

310
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,080
Thank you, Mr. Thee.

311
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,720
I'm happy too.

312
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,280
Thank you.

313
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,720
Did you watch my match just now?

314
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,040
No, sir.

315
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,240
I'm dying to know who that man was.

316
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,800
I doubt it was some workman.

317
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,080
He clearly knows muay.

318
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,480
You do sound familiar.

319
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,360
Was it actually you?

320
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,600
Hey. This jerk…

321
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,200
Did you not hear me?

322
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,720
It wasn't me, sir.
I spend all my time pulling this rickshaw.

323
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,400
I can't possibly have the energy.

324
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,800
What's that smell?
You smell just like him.

325
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,440
Hey! What was that you just spat out?

326
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,800
I didn't spit out anything, sir!

327
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,080
Wow.

328
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,480
Is this your house, sir?

329
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,000
The prize money I won today.

330
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,720
Are you giving me all of it?

331
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,280
Why do you fight in matches, then, sir?

332
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,080
None of your business. Take it.

333
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,760
Mr. Rati!

334
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,040
You're back!

335
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,800
You had me concerned for a moment, sir.

336
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,960
Did you want something, Kui?

337
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,840
Well, Mr. Ambassador…

338
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,760
Rati.

339
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
You should rest.

340
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,360
You're coming with me
to pay our respects to your Grandpa.

341
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:42,800
At Mother Rung's?

342
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,160
We never went back there
after leaving last time.

343
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,880
We're in Siam now.

344
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,720
If we don't go to Suriyakorn Palace,
it would be very impolite.

345
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,800
All right. Goodnight.

346
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,520
Ooh! Lotus stem soup!

347
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,560
Here.

348
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:35,760
Do you like it?

349
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,760
It's the best.

350
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,880
You are not a fatherless child
hiding in the corner of a kitchen anymore.

351
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,400
You are the son of the French ambassador,

352
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,920
and your mother is
Mom Rajawongse Siriburapa Praphai,

353
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,400
the eldest daughter of this palace.

354
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,680
Yes, Father.

355
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,720
Welcome, sirs.

356
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,520
"I am deeply sorry

357
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,800
that I was unable
to bring Lady Rung back with me."

358
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,720
"I apologize that I wasn't able
to take good care of her

359
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,960
like I had promised you, Father."

360
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,800
What a shame. Rung died too young.

361
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,320
But alas, nobody wants
something like this to happen.

362
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:43,040
This palace has witnessed many deaths.

363
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,720
You're Lutine's interpreter, aren't you?

364
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,360
You dare show your face here?

365
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,680
When you couldn't even protect my sister?

366
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,360
And you did not even bring
my niece, Belle.

367
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,080
Is she even alive, I wonder?

368
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,800
You heartless monster.

369
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,320
Ruj, where are your manners?

370
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,280
Right now,
Belle is studying in high school.

371
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,960
Rati and I are here
on official business for France,

372
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,840
not for personal matters.

373
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,720
That's why Belle couldn't come
to Siam this time.

374
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,320
"Belle is currently in high school."

375
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,560
"Rati and I are here on state business."

376
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,080
"Since we are not here
for personal matters,

377
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,960
we could not possibly
bring Belle with us."

378
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,520
Hey.

379
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,280
Do you think you can say anything
just because you're French?

380
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,120
I don't believe you.

381
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,960
The Siamese aren't as stupid as you think.

382
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,560
You must be Uncle Lutine Dier,
my Aunt Rung's husband.

383
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,600
Hello.

384
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,840
My name is Dech, Lord Ruj's son.

385
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,680
I've heard a lot about you, Uncle.

386
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,560
You don't understand, do you?

387
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,640
No, I don't.

388
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,600
Yes. Good. Yes.

389
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,680
And you are…?

390
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,080
Rati Dier. I'm an interpreter for
the French diplomatic mission.

391
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,200
I am also the adopted son of
Father Lutine and Mother Rung.

392
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,160
That makes us cousins.

393
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,800
-Hello--
-Don't you even dare!

394
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,840
He's nothing but a fatherless lowlife.

395
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,560
A leeching kitchen maid's son.

396
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,200
Belle is my only relative.

397
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,800
Ruj.

398
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,560
If you have nothing better to say, leave.

399
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,160
Father?

400
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,040
Will you let me stay, Grandfather?

401
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,640
Hello, Rati.

402
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,200
Goodbye, sirs.

403
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,000
Your mother Rung was
well-loved by everyone here.

404
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,880
Although you're the eldest,

405
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,320
you should try to understand the feelings
of a younger brother

406
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,080
who lost his only big sister
like Lord Ruj did.

407
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,160
Yes, Father.

408
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,960
Father, please give me a moment.

409
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,560
Joi, come have lunch.

410
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,520
Careful, dear.

411
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,760
We'll never be done with this bath
at this rate!

412
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,960
Stop playing.

413
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,480
Mother Buaphan?

414
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,600
Do you remember me?

415
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,080
I'm your little Joi.

416
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,840
I've missed you.

417
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,760
Please. Please get out of here, sir.

418
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,760
This is no place for a gentleman like you.

419
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,480
Get out of here immediately, sir!

420
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,160
And please don't come to see
this lowly servant again.

421
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,600
I beg you, sir.

422
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,480
-Please, get out of here!
-Mom?

423
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,600
Why would you say that?

424
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,280
I've missed you these past 20 years.

425
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,440
I've missed you every day.

426
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:32,080
I counted down the days
till I'd see you again.

427
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:39,520
I'm just a kitchen maid.

428
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,880
I don't dare imagine myself as the mother
of a gentleman like you, sir.

429
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,920
You are Mr. Rati,
the son of Lord Lutine and Lady Rung.

430
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,160
Please, get out of here, sir.

431
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,240
Mom!

432
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,520
Ever since coming back
from Suriyakorn Palace,

433
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,360
Mr. Rati has locked himself in his room.

434
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,560
He won't eat at all.

435
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,760
He won't touch Siamese food.

436
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,120
He won't touch French food either.

437
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,000
Not even snacks!

438
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,040
Too soon!

439
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,000
I haven't even tried asking.

440
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,880
Would you like some pomelo salad,
Mr. Rati?

441
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,960
Did you hear me, sir?

442
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,120
Is it still too soon to sigh?

443
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,160
Go for it.

444
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,360
Well, mind if I eat this?

445
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,000
Eat that old dish.

446
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,920
If you insist.

447
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,200
Give me one of those.

448
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,560
We have to do something.

449
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,840
If he keeps refusing to eat,

450
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,400
he's going to get sick soon.

451
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,840
I agree.

452
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,640
And we're going to gain some weight.

453
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,960
Kui, you disgusting pig.

454
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,880
It smells.

455
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,360
Kui!

456
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,400
Jam!

457
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,120
Who's that?

458
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,600
It's me!

459
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,200
-Who?
-Who?

460
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,520
It's Mhay!

461
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,560
Oh, Mhay!

462
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,160
What are you doing here
so late in the night?

463
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,760
Save your questions and come over here!

464
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,720
-You go.
-You go.

465
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,960
Mr. Rati's attendants told me
to bring these back.

466
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,960
They said Mr. Rati
has been refusing to eat.

467
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,199
-The food would have gone bad if left.
-Rati has been starving himself?

468
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,960
Yes, sir.

469
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,800
There you are, Thee.

470
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:31,920
I have invited Lady Pa,
the minister's daughter, for dinner

471
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,520
on Floating Lantern Day.

472
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,159
You can float the lanterns
with her that day.

473
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,320
All right?

474
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,960
Promise me.

475
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,560
Grandmother, I…

476
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:47,199
Unless it's a matter of life or death,
you must promise me.

477
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,880
Mr. Rati.

478
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,160
Mr. Thee.

479
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,120
I am lucky to have come
when you were by the river.

480
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,480
Come with me.

481
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,760
Rati is such a beautiful name.

482
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,560
It suits an elegant
and graceful gentleman like you.

483
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,160
You praise me too much, Miss Ruedi.

484
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,160
I no longer wonder why
Mr. Thee admires you so.

485
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,440
It is also no wonder you're the
first person he's invited for lunch here.

486
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,560
Mr. Thee has never brought
his friends here before.

487
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,800
You're the first.

488
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,520
Really?

489
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,200
Of course.

490
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,880
Are you talking about me?

491
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,760
Rati, this is Tiwa, my brother.

492
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,760
Bonjour, Rati. Nice to meet you.

493
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,880
Nice to meet you too.

494
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,800
Your French is excellent.

495
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,680
You only know
just that one sentence, don't you?

496
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,600
Yes.

497
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,240
I'll teach you.

498
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:15,200
I thank you in advance.

499
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,960
Shall we have lunch?

500
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,360
Lotus stem soup!

501
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:31,040
Mr. Thee asked me to make this dish
because you love it.

502
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,760
Have your fill. That will make
our cook here very happy.

503
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,960
It will make the person who asked
the cook to make it happy too.

504
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,960
All right.

505
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,600
People who eat together
are happy together.

506
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,560
Come.

507
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:47,680
Here.

508
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,560
One bite is joy.

509
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,480
Two bites…

510
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,320
Twice the joy.

511
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,600
For you too, Miss Ruedi.

512
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,280
-Thank you.
-Yes.

513
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,960
I hope this is a good enough substitute
for your mother's cooking.

514
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,960
That's three you gave him.

515
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,080
Do you love Rati more than me, Thee?

516
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,560
Let's eat.

517
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,560
You too.

518
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,720
Ooh! Lotus stem soup!

519
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,560
Here. Dig in.

520
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,520
It's the best.

521
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,760
Eat some more, dear.

522
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,360
Mr. Rati?

523
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,600
Please.

524
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,360
It is nothing to worry about.

525
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,440
It's just that Miss Ruedi, Mr. Tiwa,
and this lotus stem soup

526
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,600
reminded me of my real mother.

527
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:13,520
Actually, my real mother is
a kitchen maid at Suriyakorn Palace.

528
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,080
I'm just a commoner's son.

529
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,480
I'm no gentleman.

530
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,760
I was just lucky Mother Rung adopted me.

531
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,600
I didn't see my real mother for 20 years.

532
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,240
But when I got to meet her,

533
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,120
she pushed me away.

534
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,440
She said…

535
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,200
I was not her son anymore.

536
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,720
I'm talking nonsense.

537
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,200
Please get back to lunch.

538
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:04,400
The lotus stem soup is delicious.
I'll be sure to finish all of it.

539
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,480
Please do.

540
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,440
I'm glad to see you ate well today.

541
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,000
It's me who has to thank you.

542
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,000
Thank you for inviting me to lunch.

543
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:50,200
It was great to get to know
Miss Ruedi and Mr. Tiwa.

544
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,960
They are both very nice.

545
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,440
That was the best meal I have had
since returning to Siam.

546
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,280
If that is the case,

547
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,560
I'll have you over more often.

548
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,360
Thank you.

549
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,760
Mr. Rati.

550
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,120
Did you…

551
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,160
see the big house
next to that small house?

552
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,520
Yes.

553
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,960
I remember it.

554
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,520
The big house across from the legation,

555
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,920
I think, belongs to a Count…

556
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,920
Surathee-something.

557
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,600
Count Suratheetamtanapich.

558
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,800
Yes.

559
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,280
That's the one.

560
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,680
I heard the Count is "that…"

561
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,480
Never mind.

562
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,680
It has nothing to do with me, after all.

563
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:01,720
That's my house.

564
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,440
I live there.

565
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,960
Sir.

566
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,960
I guessed as much.

567
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,240
Pardon?

568
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,000
I already guessed
that you work there, Mr. Thee.

569
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,120
Speaking of which,
your master must be generous

570
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:26,600
to have given his servant
and his family a house.

571
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,720
Thank you again for today.

572
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,000
Goodbye.

573
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,080
Mr. Rati.

574
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:49,720
Get home safe.

575
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,200
THEE

576
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,760
What's the emergency?

577
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,760
There's a letter from the palace.

578
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,280
I don't know whether it's good or bad.

579
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,520
They're here, sir.

580
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,280
Let's go.

581
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,320
Mr. Thee?

582
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,560
Good morning, Monsieur Ambassador.

583
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,760
Good morning, Lord Steward.

584
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,320
We meet again.

585
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,200
It is nice to meet you again,
Lord Steward.

586
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,640
Bonjour, monsieur.

587
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,560
This is my son, Count Suratheetamtanapich.

588
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:53,880
He's the Deputy Minister
at the Ministry of Education,

589
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:56,920
and a Professor of Literature
at the Civil Servants School.

590
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,560
Count Suratheetamtanapich.

591
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:16,880
From now on,
you and I are no longer friends.

592
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,720
Please speak to me like usual.

593
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,000
Call me Thee.

594
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:23,360
Please don't act like we have
never been friends like this.

595
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,880
I know you're that muay fighter.

596
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:28,240
-It wasn't me, sir--
-Chew on that.

597
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,800
Why do you treat
a commoner's son like me so well?

598
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,800
I don't get to choose when and with whom
I will have good feelings.

599
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,560
I just did. With you.
