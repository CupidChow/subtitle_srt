1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,240
Your ears aren't working properly.
Can you hear me?

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,600
-Can you hear me at all?
-I can hear you just fine!

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,120
PREVIOUSLY

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,280
Why did you kiss me?

5
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,200
I'm kissing my friend,
the way people kiss their pets.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,640
<i>I had a lot of fun flying a kite today.</i>

7
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,640
<i>Prince Mai sure takes good care of you.</i>

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,120
I guess I am now useless.

9
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,920
<i>Would you be up for a bet?</i>

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,920
<i>-What are we betting, Your Highness?</i>
<i>-The professor, perhaps.</i>

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,200
CIVIL SERVANTS SCHOOL

12
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,120
Good morning.

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,520
My name is Dech,

14
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,000
and this is my friend, Chai.

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,560
Nice to meet you.

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,840
My name is Sak.

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,320
Nice to meet you too.

18
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,720
Well done, sirs.

19
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,840
In two months' time,
when our lessons are over,

20
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,360
I won't be able to tell you Siamese
apart from the French.

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,920
Are you leaving for France… in two months?

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,360
What are your plans
after these two months?

23
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,160
Plans?

24
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,640
Any plans to stay at the Legation in Siam?

25
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:02,400
I will continue working for the Legation,

26
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,600
but I don't get to decide
where I'll be sent.

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,200
You are, by blood,
a grandson of the Suriyakorn family.

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm sure His Highness would be pleased
if you were to be stationed here in Siam.

29
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,320
You know that's not what I want, Thee.

30
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,760
I want to return to France

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,920
to spend time with my father
and take care of my sister.

32
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,480
I am not…

33
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,840
a part of your plans, then?

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,360
What about you?

35
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,520
Do you have plans to move
to France with me?

36
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,440
France…

37
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,640
It's not right, is it?

38
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,760
We each have our own homes.

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,240
Our own responsibilities.

40
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,720
We each have endless duties to attend to.

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,400
We chose to be together now

42
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,160
because we wanted to have
no regrets, didn't we?

43
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,680
I think that in these next two months,

44
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,520
it would be best
if we didn't bring this up again.

45
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,160
I don't want either of us
to shed any more tears.

46
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,320
I'm here to pick you up.

47
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,560
Allow me a moment
to finish reading my father's letter.

48
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,880
What does it say?

49
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,400
"This is a navaratna ring."

50
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,399
"It belonged to your Mother Rung."

51
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,800
"She wanted it to be
your 25th birthday present."

52
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,360
"Wear it for good luck."

53
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,440
"I would be more than happy if you were
to give it to someone you love, son."

54
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,480
Someone you love?

55
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,000
Who would be so lucky?

56
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,880
THE KING RECEIVED TWO PIECES
OF GOOD NEWS…

57
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,200
You translated it really well, Mr. Tiwa.

58
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,080
You did a better job at it than I would.

59
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,960
You praise me too much, Rati.

60
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,360
One is a superb teacher.

61
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,320
The other is an amazing student.

62
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,680
Before I return to France,

63
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:04,560
you will have mastered the language
and be able to work on official documents.

64
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,720
That would be very good indeed.

65
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,160
I want to work.

66
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,920
I want to help my father out
with his work.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,360
And you will.

68
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,040
You'll leave in two months,
won't you, Mr. Rati?

69
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:20,360
I will miss you dearly.

70
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll write often.

71
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,760
We still have two months.

72
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,280
No need to speak
as if he's leaving in two days.

73
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,560
That's a beautiful ring.

74
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,640
Who gave it to you?

75
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,200
My mother.

76
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,040
It's an early birthday gift.

77
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,560
And she said you should give it
to someone you love.

78
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,440
Who are you going to give it to, Mr. Rati?

79
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,520
It must be Thee.

80
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,960
If it were me, I'd give it to Thee.

81
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,800
Because you are the best.

82
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,520
I guess we'll let the professor decide
whether or not I am the best to him.

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,160
Are your hands feeling stiff?

84
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,560
Am I not the person you love?

85
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,880
I'm not answering that.

86
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,920
Rati.

87
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,160
You're teasing me.

88
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,880
Thee.

89
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,760
Yes?

90
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,320
Can you do me a favor?

91
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,960
These news articles were translated
by Professor Rati's students?

92
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,920
Yes.

93
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,760
I believe they need some more time
to master the language.

94
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,960
Thee, my child.

95
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,200
What brings you all the way to my office?

96
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,000
Someone is here to see you, Father.

97
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,640
Leave us for now.

98
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,120
I wanted to be the one to give you
this translation, my lord.

99
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
This is, by far, the best translation

100
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,320
out of all of your students,
Professor Rati.

101
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,320
Did you translate this?

102
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,400
It wasn't me.

103
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,600
It was translated by Mr. Tiwa.

104
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,200
Tiwa has always been interested
in languages.

105
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,800
Professor Rati was kind enough
to give him lessons at home.

106
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,160
I believe Tiwa is now more fluent
than he ever was before.

107
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,920
I am certain that once
I am no longer here,

108
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,600
Mr. Tiwa will be able to assist you
in this regard, my lord.

109
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,000
If you would like to see for yourself,

110
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,159
tomorrow at noon,

111
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,600
Ms. Ruedi and Mr. Tiwa are hosting
a party for my birthday.

112
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,560
I extend an invitation to you, sir.

113
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
Here it is.

114
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,520
Thank you.

115
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,480
-Here, sir.
-Good.

116
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,560
I'll leave the place to you for a bit.

117
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,240
Of course.

118
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,560
Mek. Mek!

119
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
Monsieur Mek.

120
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,160
Mek!

121
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,440
Ugh! Why are you yelling?

122
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,960
I can hear you just fine.

123
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,920
The Ministry of the Royal Household
is looking for ten French translators.

124
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,920
Really?

125
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,200
The exam is one month from now.

126
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,800
You need to apply, do you hear me?

127
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,520
There is no need to hesitate.

128
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,080
I will go with you.

129
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,560
But my hearing…

130
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,240
Your hearing will get better.

131
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,160
If it doesn't, you still have me.

132
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,560
I'll be there to help you.

133
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,160
How lucky I am to have you with me.

134
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,120
Thanks, Dech.

135
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,800
Anything you need my help with? We can
get it done quickly so we can study.

136
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,760
Here.

137
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,240
Clean this place.

138
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,680
Start over there.

139
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,800
Thanks, Dech.

140
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,720
Hey.

141
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,440
What are you standing there for? Go on.

142
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,400
This guy sure doesn't hold back.

143
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,000
What was that?

144
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,440
Isn't your hearing bad?

145
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,600
What are you staring at?

146
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,720
I'm just watching you work. Go on.

147
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,200
Here.

148
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,280
Open wide.

149
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,400
SRISAMAI PHOTOGRAPHY

150
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,680
What else do you want to do?

151
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,000
Waterfall. I want to go to a waterfall.

152
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,920
Waterfall…
You want to visit a waterfall?

153
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,640
Yes.

154
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:55,640
I believe we'll need to stay overnight
if we go to a waterfall.

155
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,480
Am I asking for too much?

156
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,000
Not at all.

157
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,000
I'd love to go anywhere with you.

158
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,280
I'll be sure to take you.

159
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,960
I'll take that as a promise, Thee.

160
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,520
Tell me all your wishes.

161
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,280
During your last two months in Siam,

162
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,920
I'll make you the happiest
you've ever been in your life.

163
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,240
I will make sure to savor
these happy moments.

164
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,880
Let's go.

165
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,600
You're making it yourself?

166
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,600
Of course.

167
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,040
It's your birthday.
I have to do something special.

168
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,280
I didn't know you cooked.

169
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,480
I asked Buaphan for the recipe.

170
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,760
I guarantee it will be
just as good as hers.

171
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,400
Bring coconut milk to a boil,
but make sure not to reduce it.

172
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,200
Add shallot, mackerel, and lotus stem.

173
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,800
Then simply season the soup.

174
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,000
That's simply the hard part, I think.

175
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,120
Why don't you go and stand over there?

176
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,400
Why?

177
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,800
I'm afraid

178
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,840
I'll over-sweeten the soup if you're here.

179
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,200
Make it overly sweet, then.

180
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,880
By all means.

181
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,200
…RECEIVED TWO PIECES OF GOOD NEWS…

182
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,280
It's done.

183
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,120
Rati has tried it, and approved.

184
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,680
I'm so relieved.

185
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,280
Thank you for lending me your kitchen.

186
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,960
Is something wrong?

187
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,520
This matter between you and Mr. Rati…

188
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,600
Are you certain about it?

189
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,040
Well… what do you think, Ms. Ruedi?

190
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,640
I am happy to see you happy, of course.

191
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,720
I can't help but worry for you though.

192
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,600
In the future, you and Mr. Rati will face
so many obstacles and difficulties.

193
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,720
Maybe even worse than
the ones I faced, sir.

194
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,400
To go against the grain of society
is indeed a struggle.

195
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,800
But when I consider it,

196
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,200
to go against my own heart

197
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,880
would be a far worse torment.

198
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,600
I will not spend the next
20 or 30 years of my life in fear.

199
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,720
I don't want to regret
not fighting for what I want.

200
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,040
I will do everything possible
to ensure that Rati and I can be together.

201
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,880
You are much braver
than I thought, Mr. Thee.

202
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,320
I thank you for your concern.

203
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
-Let me help.
-Thank you.

204
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:14,960
Thee.

205
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,120
Ms. Ruedi.

206
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,800
Mr. Tiwa is ready for lunch.

207
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,160
Let's go.

208
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,280
Can you hear that?

209
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,160
Yes, sir.

210
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,120
Can you hear that?

211
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,000
Yes, sir.

212
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,160
Can you hear that?

213
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,600
Can you hear it?

214
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,040
Can you hear it?

215
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,240
Can you?

216
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,319
Your hearing is better than it was
last time you were here.

217
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,200
It is better, isn't it?

218
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,400
Yes.

219
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,800
He will be better soon.

220
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,440
Say yes if you can hear me.

221
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,120
Say anything else if you can't.

222
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,960
If I can't hear you,
why can't I just say no?

223
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,400
If I ask if you can hear me
and you reply, "No, I can't,"

224
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,000
I'll think you actually can hear me.

225
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,440
I see.

226
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,400
I can just say anything, then?

227
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,360
-Can you hear me?
-Yes.

228
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,720
Can you hear me?

229
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,920
-Dech.
-I'm asking if you can hear me.

230
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,240
Dech.

231
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,800
Why are you calling my name?

232
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,960
Can you hear me?

233
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,760
You told me to say anything else
if I couldn't hear you.

234
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,160
So I am.

235
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,440
Dech!

236
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,960
So this is the limit of
your hearing range.

237
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,600
Am I right?

238
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,520
Dech.

239
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,600
You can't hear me from here, either?

240
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,720
Can you hear me?

241
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,120
Why are you so kind to me?

242
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,680
Thanks, my friend.

243
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,320
Mek!

244
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,400
What do you think of me?

245
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,160
Could we still be friends

246
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,480
if I were to tell you…

247
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
I fancy you?

248
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,000
Dech.

249
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,520
What were you saying?

250
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,720
Say it again.

251
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,200
It was nothing.

252
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,200
I know what you said.

253
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,240
You do?

254
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,640
Dech.

255
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,160
How do you say "lotus"?

256
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:51,960
"Lotus."

257
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,800
Lo… Lo…

258
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,160
Lo… lotus?

259
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,720
What about "bridge"?

260
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,920
<i>Pont.</i>

261
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,920
<i>-Pont.</i>
<i>-Pont.</i>

262
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,120
<i>Pont.</i>

263
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,520
What about this?

264
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,440
MOM LUANG DECHAPATRAPEE
FRENCH

265
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,040
<i>Carnet de notes.</i>

266
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,200
What?

267
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,400
<i>Carnet de notes.</i>

268
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,280
<i>Carnet de notes.</i>

269
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,000
<i>Car-net de notes.</i>

270
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,040
<i>Car-net de notes.</i>

271
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,000
<i>Carnet de notes.</i>

272
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,440
<i>Carnet de notes.</i>

273
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,360
-A notebook.
-Correct.

274
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,840
<i>Carnet de notes.</i>

275
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,120
<i>Carnet de notes.</i>

276
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,720
MONSIEUR MEK WILL BE A MODEL STUDENT
TO YOUNG MASTER DECH.

277
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,120
Happy birthday!

278
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,200
I…

279
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,480
I wrote you a poem.

280
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,360
<i>May this year be full of happiness</i>

281
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,080
<i>Like a fearless flower garden</i>

282
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,200
<i>Together, you shall be with your beloved</i>

283
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,040
<i>And your love, a song so ardent</i>

284
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,720
<i>Happy birthday, my beautiful buddy</i>

285
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,960
<i>Let your joy overflow like a fountain</i>

286
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:59,360
<i>May you always find happiness</i>
<i>In the virtues you possess</i>

287
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,320
<i>And may your love go on without end</i>

288
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,480
Well done, Mr. Tiwa.

289
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,600
Did you write it all by yourself?

290
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,880
Father.

291
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,760
Well done, my son.

292
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,080
You have such elegant handwriting.

293
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,080
Well done, my son.

294
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,000
You raised him really well.

295
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,800
Thank you, Your Highness.

296
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,800
Did you sneak off to cry alone?

297
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,640
I simply wanted Ms. Ruedi and Tiwa
to savor this time with my father.

298
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
It is all right to cry.

299
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,960
I cry too.

300
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,680
Thank you for what you did for Tiwa.

301
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,080
There are no parents
who don't love their children,

302
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,280
especially an adorable child like Tiwa.

303
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,320
I have something for you.

304
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,120
What is it?

305
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,400
Our photograph.

306
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,760
I chose two.

307
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,360
I'd like to keep one,
and for you to keep one.

308
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,840
Which one would you like?

309
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,560
I…

310
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,160
I'll go with this one.

311
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,160
As for this one where I'm smiling widely,

312
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,280
I'll let you keep it.

313
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,720
I have something for you too.

314
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:02,120
Not that.

315
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,360
Here.

316
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,960
I had it made specifically

317
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,800
so my photo fits in it.

318
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,720
You can carry it
on your person at all times

319
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,440
and feel like I am always there with you.

320
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,080
Thank you.

321
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,920
But honestly…

322
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,320
I'd rather have the real you with me.

323
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,360
Smile. It's your birthday.

324
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,640
Are you seriously not going to
give me the ring?

325
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,360
The flowers are beautiful, Your Highness.

326
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,280
Anything I tend is certain to flourish.

327
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,480
Pikul.

328
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,080
Come over here.

329
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,840
Yes, Your Highness?

330
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,520
Where are you taking all these things?

331
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,240
To the little house, ma'am.

332
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,800
What's going on at the little house?

333
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,600
POETRY

334
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,000
You even wrote on the back cover?

335
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,520
I'd used up the pages, but was afraid
I'd forget if I didn't write it down.

336
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,600
I'll get you more notebooks.

337
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,720
Would a dozen suffice?

338
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,240
It would, Father.

339
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,200
Try this.

340
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,040
Eat your fill, love.

341
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,720
Ram.

342
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,360
Thee.

343
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,800
Mother.

344
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,880
Who said you could have a party
for an outsider inside my house?

345
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,360
I invited Rati.

346
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,920
Go back to the palace.

347
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,600
Mother.

348
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,640
Father.

349
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,040
Mother, please.

350
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,640
I told you that I would only let that
Ruedi girl and her son stay here

351
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,440
if you never set foot in there.

352
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,800
I was simply--

353
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,520
Tell them to move out of
my house tomorrow.

354
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,240
Mother.

355
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,720
How long have you known
about your son and Rati?

356
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,640
What about Thee and Professor Rati?

357
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,200
So all you care about is yourself.

358
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,440
Don't you see how close they are?

359
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,520
If this is about me, please ask me
directly. I promise to be honest.

360
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:41,920
How arrogant.

361
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,360
I refuse to acknowledge
the shameful things you have done.

362
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,640
I'm afraid you can't avoid it forever,
seeing as Rati and I--

363
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
Ram.

364
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,080
I want your son to marry Lady Pa
as soon as possible.

365
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,640
Tomorrow even, if we can.

366
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,840
-Grandmother!
-Can you make it happen?

367
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,800
If you can't, tell your mistress
to move out of my house today.

368
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,400
Yes.

369
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,800
Do whatever you want, Grandmother.

370
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,680
But please know…

371
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,800
I am no flower.

372
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,720
A hundred sacks of tea leaves, sir.

373
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,120
A hundred sacks of tea leaves?

374
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,440
CUSTOMS

375
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,960
Where is Baronet Dech?

376
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,040
I don't know, sir.

377
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,360
He did not come to work today.

378
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,440
If he's gone during working hours,

379
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,800
where is he?

380
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,200
Sir, please!

381
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,520
My son didn't go to work.

382
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,640
Do any of you know something
that you've kept from me?

383
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,760
-We don't know anything, my lord!
-We really don't, sir.

384
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,520
MONSIEUR MEK WILL BE A MODEL STUDENT
TO YOUNG MASTER DECH.

385
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,120
To Talad Noi, please.

386
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,880
Of course. Please.

387
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,640
Good to go?

388
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,120
Hold on.

389
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,000
Come on, girls.

390
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,400
You don't mind, do you?

391
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,360
-Let me help.
-Dech?

392
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,840
All right.

393
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,000
Shall we?

394
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,120
Of course.

395
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,320
Ready?

396
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,520
One, two… three!

397
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,880
Let's go, Dech.

398
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,400
Here.

399
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,680
-Thank you.
-Oh?

400
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,600
You…

401
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,440
You look just like the son
of that nobleman.

402
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,280
What's his name, again?

403
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,160
Hey, what nobleman pulls
a rickshaw, ladies?

404
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,840
I think you got the wrong man.

405
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,680
Maybe it's not him. Let's go.

406
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,280
You girls lose control
whenever you see a handsome gentleman.

407
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,480
Let's just go.

408
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,400
Come on.

409
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,840
No one needs a rickshaw right now.
Come and study with me.

410
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,640
Don't you have to go to work?

411
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,640
I took the day off.

412
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,040
Dech.

413
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,600
You've taken too many days off.

414
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,400
Go to work.

415
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,520
We can study later.

416
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,000
And you don't have to help me
with my work anymore.

417
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,760
Are you accusing me of interfering?

418
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,520
If you get recognized again,
what will you say?

419
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,200
I don't want you to be
in trouble with your father.

420
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,360
So you really want me to go?

421
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,920
To Phraya Krai Temple.

422
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,680
I want to be a news translator too.

423
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,280
I don't often want
to do something for myself.

424
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,880
You can't stop me.

425
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,840
Dech.

426
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,920
You're as stubborn as a mule.

427
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,920
-Dech.
-Mek.

428
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,320
Are you going to keep talking?
I'm in a hurry!

429
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,680
Please, sir.

430
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,880
I'll help.

431
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,040
Where to, sir?

432
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,240
Phraya Krai Temple.

433
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,760
Of course.

434
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,000
Good to go, sir?

435
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,520
Hey, anyone not busy?

436
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,560
Come help me get these things on the cart.

437
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,400
I got it.

438
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,000
Oh, Mek. Good.

439
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,800
I'll help.

440
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,960
You were born a nobleman,

441
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,480
but want to be a working commoner?

442
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,600
Father.

443
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,600
What have you done to my son?

444
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,920
He has nothing to do with this.

445
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,080
The Young Master didn't do anything.
It was all my fault, sir.

446
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,000
He was injured and lost his hearing.
I'm only taking care of him.

447
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,800
What are you to him?
Why must you "take care" of him?

448
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,480
-What have you done to my son?
-Father!

449
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,880
Leave it!

450
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,080
Come here!

451
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,920
You two, beat him!

452
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,320
Stop it!

453
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,560
Mek!

454
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,520
Mek.

455
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,000
You lowlife! Stay away from my son!

456
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,760
-Mek!
-Don't get in his way, Dech!

457
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,920
Father, stop!

458
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,440
Father, stop!

459
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,520
-Dech, no.
-Father!

460
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,679
Father, please stop.

461
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,679
Dech.

462
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,040
THEE

463
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,720
Rati.

464
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,680
Thee.

465
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,760
What did Her Highness say?

466
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:24,360
It's barely past your birthday.
Don't spend it worrying about nonsense.

467
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,120
Please tell me.

468
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,400
So we can work things out together.

469
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,480
Grandmother is, as expected, disgruntled.

470
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,320
She has ordered my father to set
the earliest date possible for my wedding.

471
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,520
I'm not going to marry someone
I'm not in love with.

472
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,600
But if Her Highness doesn't approve,

473
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,280
even if it is someone you are in love
with, this will prove to be difficult.

474
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,920
And… a man, no less.

475
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,520
I don't see how we can make this work.

476
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,480
Don't waste your time worrying.

477
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,760
I'll talk to Grandmother tomorrow.

478
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,520
I'm coming with you.

479
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,720
No.

480
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,800
I must.

481
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,920
If you are going to talk to her about us,
then we have to do it together.

482
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,360
We must show her our sincerity.

483
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,120
I have no choice but to yield
when you get serious like this.

484
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,400
You're right.

485
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,600
We'll talk to her tomorrow
after class then.

486
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,400
I agree.

487
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,520
Mek!

488
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,480
They fired me, sir.

489
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,160
I don't work here anymore.

490
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,840
Please go home, Young Master.

491
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,760
I am only resting.

492
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,000
I will go home soon.

493
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,080
Speak to me like you always do.

494
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,000
Mek!

495
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,360
Are you in pain?

496
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,560
I'm sorry.

497
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,520
Your father's men are still around, sir.

498
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,400
I'll talk to him.

499
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,600
I'll make him understand.

500
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,520
I told you.

501
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,240
Once I accept you as my friend,

502
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,720
you are mine for the rest of our lives.

503
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,240
You were born a nobleman,

504
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,080
but want to be a working commoner?

505
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,000
You lowlife! Stay away from my son!

506
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,000
You're finally here.

507
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,600
CIVIL SERVANTS SCHOOL

508
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:41,000
Do you know why the palace wants
Siamese officials to learn French?

509
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,920
To be able to communicate,
which would benefit both nations.

510
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,080
Am I right, Your Highness?

511
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,960
"Both nations."

512
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:55,160
Then how come only the Siamese
are learning French?

513
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,560
I hope you don't mind
my speaking so bluntly.

514
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,560
I am just an old lady in a small country

515
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,680
who doesn't know much about
the outside world.

516
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:12,320
You see, I had been living peacefully
the way I was used to…

517
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,480
but then one day,

518
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,640
a so-called ally came along

519
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,440
only to bring us the kind of war
that did incalculable damage.

520
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:29,160
Once that ally got what they wanted,

521
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:34,800
they departed, without caring about
the harm they left behind,

522
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:42,320
leaving those who remained
to struggle alone to survive.

523
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,440
I understand you come from a free world.

524
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:55,800
But freedom does not mean you can freely
cause anybody harm, am I right?

525
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,520
I may be French by nationality,

526
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,840
but I know and feel in my heart
that I am Siamese.

527
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,840
That is good then.

528
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,160
If you're Siamese,

529
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,920
you probably understand what I'm saying.

530
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,280
I won't allow my grandson
and the Wisut family

531
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,200
to be ruined by you.

532
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,200
Never.

533
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,440
Why didn't you tell me that
Grandmother visited you at school?

534
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,280
What did she say?

535
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,680
Her Highness spoke nothing but the truth.

536
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,160
Rati.

537
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,560
She doesn't want me to ruin your life.

538
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,200
But you are not ruining my life.

539
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,760
No one knows about us right now.

540
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:12,840
But once they do,

541
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,080
your reputation will be ruined,
and so will your family's.

542
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,160
By which time,
I will be safely back in France.

543
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,960
Her Highness spoke nothing but the truth.

544
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,080
Even so, I am not afraid.

545
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,720
I don't see how we can be happy together.

546
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,560
I won't allow you to break off
contact with me

547
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,280
simply because my grandmother forbids it.

548
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:39,280
Do you understand?

549
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,680
Who says I'm going to do that?

550
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,400
Well…

551
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,400
Grandmother…

552
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,160
She told you
to leave me alone, didn't she?

553
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:59,000
She certainly has a right to forbid,

554
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,080
but I have a right
to make my own decision.

555
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,960
I don't know why,

556
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,800
but I believe what you said.

557
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,440
I believe that this thing between us
is possible.

558
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,200
Do you mean it?

559
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:25,720
Mother Buaphan told us
to take good care of each other.

560
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,320
So not only do I refuse to submit,

561
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:32,120
but I am asking you to be my betrothed.

562
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,200
And I ask you to be mine.

563
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,360
<i>I have consulted with the minister</i>
<i>about the date of your wedding.</i>

564
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,800
<i>We have agreed on</i>
<i>the beginning of next month.</i>

565
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,560
Do not worry about
what hasn't yet happened.

566
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,600
<i>The best we can do is</i>
<i>make the most of today.</i>

567
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,120
I know my father better than anyone.

568
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,680
-We must run.
-Run?

569
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,880
You die today.

570
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,040
NEXT EPISODE

571
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,200
Let me dry your hair.

572
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,560
<i>I can do it myself.</i>

573
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:16,800
Grandmother.
