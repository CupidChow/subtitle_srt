1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,240
<i>From now on,</i>

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,240
you and I are no longer friends.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,080
<i>Please speak to me like usual.</i>

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,360
<i>Call me Thee.</i>

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,720
Please don't act like we have
never been friends like this.

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,240
I know you're that muay fighter.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,600
- It wasn't me, sir--
- Chew on that.

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,160
<i>Why do you treat</i>
<i>a commoner's son like me so well?</i>

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,160
I don't get to choose when and with whom
I will have good feelings.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,920
I just did. With you.

11
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,280
<i>Father.</i>

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:34,240
<i>Teaching French to Siamese officials isn't</i>
<i>as difficult as I expected it would be.</i>

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,240
<i>I teach them simply,</i>
<i>the way Mother Rung taught me.</i>

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,840
<i>The hardest part is the people.</i>

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,840
<i>Because of the previous conflict</i>
<i>between France and Siam,</i>

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,680
<i>many Siamese are still very angry with</i>
<i>and prejudiced against France.</i>

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:01,520
<i>I hope that staying here this time</i>
<i>to teach the language</i>

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,560
<i>will show the Siamese people</i>
<i>the sincerity of France.</i>

19
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,480
<i>Don't worry. I'm fine,</i>
<i>and I'll do my best.</i>

20
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,240
<i>How is Belle? Please give her my regards.</i>

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,280
<i>When it's been a year,</i>

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,960
<i>her big brother will return to France</i>
<i>to play with her again.</i>

23
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,640
<i>With all my love, Rati.</i>

24
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,440
Please don't tell anyone, Mother,

25
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,600
what I am actually going through.

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,840
I can do it.

27
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,120
As your son, I can do it.

28
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,720
Please get in the car.

29
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,760
I'll give you a ride.

30
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,560
- Kui. Jam.
- Yes, sir?

31
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,479
I'm here, sir.

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,920
What business do you have
with Mr. Rati, my lord?

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,280
Mr. Rati has to go to work.

34
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,680
You should go back for now, sir.

35
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,920
Kui. Jam.

36
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,880
I don't need a ride.

37
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,640
The school is nearby.

38
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,400
I am perfectly capable of walking.

39
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,880
You haven't forgiven me then.

40
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,720
I know you're unhappy with me,

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,360
but I must ask that you separate
personal feelings from duty.

42
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,640
I'm responsible for making your stay here
in Siam as comfortable as possible.

43
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,520
I represent Siam,

44
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,440
and you, France.

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,160
When Siam holds out
a friendly hand to France,

46
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,480
is it appropriate to refuse it?

47
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,720
Watch out!

48
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,680
Was that a prank?

49
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,240
No.

50
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,720
I simply wanted you to be careful.

51
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,360
Thanks.

52
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,440
Would you like breakfast?

53
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,800
Thanks…

54
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,720
For not intruding.

55
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,520
Are you smiling?

56
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,240
Hurry up before we're late.

57
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,720
You were smiling, weren't you?

58
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,160
You're no longer mad at me.

59
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,920
You're only teasing me, aren't you?

60
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,960
Whatever you say, sir.

61
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,440
Please, hold on.

62
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,840
I will walk in alone.

63
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,840
I don't want people to say

64
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,240
that the Deputy Minister of
the Ministry of Education is favoring me.

65
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,720
Mr. Rati.

66
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,960
That's "Professor" to you.

67
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,560
Within these school grounds,
I am your teacher, sir.

68
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,200
We're only one step inside.

69
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,200
Even so,

70
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,240
one step has changed our status.

71
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Well then,

72
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,960
am I allowed to call you Mr. Rati now?

73
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,560
There, you are no longer my student,

74
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,720
which means I can ignore you, sir.

75
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,200
Oh?

76
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,440
Wasn't that the servant boy?

77
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,480
Was it Rati?

78
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,200
Did he come here with you, sir?

79
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,920
Yes.

80
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,520
I picked him up from his residence.

81
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,320
Why would…?

82
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,520
Oh, I see.

83
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,400
It is your responsibility. I understand.

84
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:15,360
But it seems you take particularly
good care of our nation's guest, sir.

85
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,880
Hello, Professor.

86
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,480
Oh. Hello, sir.

87
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,080
Hello.

88
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,080
Where is your father?

89
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,000
You're in trouble, Mek.

90
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,760
- He's the son of a nobleman.
- Father is outside.

91
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,280
He will be along shortly, I believe.

92
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,480
- Watch it!
- Mhay?

93
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,840
You scared me, Mek!

94
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,240
I'm sorry. I have to go!

95
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,960
- Hang on.
- What?

96
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
Where are you off to?

97
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,000
I wanted to ask
if you saw my master arrive.

98
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,360
I don't have time for that right now.

99
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,680
- Hold on. Hold on.
- What now?

100
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,480
Answer my question first.

101
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,800
I can't!

102
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,640
If anyone asks for me,
tell them you never saw me!

103
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Never…?

104
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,880
What?

105
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,320
What's his problem?

106
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,200
Who were you talking to?

107
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,480
No one, sir. I wasn't talking to anyone.

108
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,559
Do you know a commoner by the name Mek?

109
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,480
He works here.

110
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,520
Mek?

111
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,640
Do you know him?

112
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,280
Of course I do, sir.

113
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,480
I recommended him for the job.

114
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,320
He told me to say no
if anyone asked if I had seen him.

115
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,280
So you really were talking to him.

116
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,880
Oh. Well…

117
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,520
I was, sir.

118
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,440
Mek.

119
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,600
What?

120
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,880
Where are you going?

121
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,760
Sir.

122
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,560
Don't "sir" me.

123
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,000
I want to talk to you,

124
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,000
muay fighter.

125
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,040
Muay fighter?

126
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,640
Muay fighter who? I don't know
who you're talking about, sir.

127
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,040
Don't pretend.

128
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,520
What are you talking about, sir?

129
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,760
I have to get back to work.

130
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,480
That smell…

131
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,800
Muay fighters often chew on cloves
to relieve pain.

132
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,880
You are no exception, are you?

133
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,480
A tight-lipped culprit too.

134
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,120
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else, sir.

135
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,760
Excuse me.

136
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,080
I want a rematch.

137
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,520
Dech.

138
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,360
Hey, servant.

139
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,080
What are you doing?

140
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,040
Nothing, my lord.

141
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,240
Liar.

142
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,240
I'm telling the truth.

143
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,360
The Baronet must have misunderstood--

144
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,960
It was nothing, Father.

145
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,280
I mistook him for someone else.

146
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,680
Get back to work.

147
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,480
Go!

148
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,240
Yes, sir.

149
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,960
The lesson will begin soon.

150
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,080
Shall we go?

151
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,120
Yes.

152
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:04,960
Come on.

153
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,880
Hello, Professor.

154
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,440
Hello, Professor.

155
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,360
How can I help?

156
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,000
Thanks…

157
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,040
For not intruding.

158
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,800
Have a good class, sir.

159
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,680
I'll make sure to pay attention.

160
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,360
<i>Je suis professeur de français.</i>

161
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,760
"I am a French professor."

162
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,280
<i>Tu es professeur de français.</i>

163
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,720
"You are a French professor."

164
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,400
<i>Il est professeur de français.</i>

165
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,280
"He is a French professor."

166
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,120
Take the word for your occupation
and add it to this sentence.

167
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,200
Does anyone have any questions
regarding occupations?

168
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,920
How do you say "student"?

169
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,520
<i>Étudiant.</i>

170
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,640
<i>Je suis étudiant.</i>

171
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,120
How do you say "customs officer"?

172
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,280
<i>Douanier.</i>

173
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,760
Now how do you introduce yourself?

174
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,000
<i>Je su… is…</i>

175
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,240
<i>"Douanini."</i>

176
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,040
What about "slaves"?

177
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,000
How do you say it?

178
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,880
"I'm a slave."

179
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,560
How do you say that in French, Professor?

180
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,840
<i>Esclave.</i>

181
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,840
<i>Je suis esclave.</i>

182
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,280
What about…

183
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,640
"My mother is a slave."

184
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,120
"My whole family is."

185
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,640
How would you say that
in French, Professor?

186
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,840
My lord.

187
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,440
I don't see how this is relevant.

188
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,720
How is it not?

189
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,760
I use this word quite often.
I need to memorize it.

190
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,320
Keep in mind
who you sit in this room with.

191
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,200
The professor has given permission for us
to ask any questions we wish to.

192
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,320
Am I right, my lord?

193
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,200
Am I right, Your Highness?

194
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,560
<i>Ma mère est esclave.</i>

195
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,480
<i>Je suis issu d'une famille d'esclaves.</i>

196
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,240
Repeat after me.

197
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,080
My lord.

198
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,760
Me?

199
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,280
Repeat after me.

200
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,920
<i>"Ma mère est esclave."</i>

201
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,200
<i>"Je suis issu d'une famille d'esclaves."</i>

202
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,760
Incorrect.

203
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,360
<i>Ma mère est esclave.</i>

204
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,600
<i>Je suis issu d'une famille d'esclaves.</i>

205
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,680
<i>"Ma mère est esclave."</i>

206
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,080
<i>"Je suis duidui desclaves."</i>

207
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,320
Incorrect, sir.

208
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,840
Say it once more.

209
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,680
Enough!

210
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,040
But you said you use this word
quite often, my lord.

211
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,560
You must memorize it and say it correctly.

212
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,440
Am I right, Your Highness?

213
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,760
I agree.

214
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,800
Say it again.

215
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,000
You need to have it memorized.

216
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,440
<i>"Ma mère… est esclave."</i>

217
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:26,160
<i>"Je suis… du famille desclaves?"</i>

218
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,400
That's not right, sir.

219
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,400
<i>Ma mère est esclave.</i>

220
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,200
<i>"Ma mère est esclave."</i>

221
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,360
<i>Je suis issu…</i>

222
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,280
<i>"Je suis suissu…"</i>

223
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,120
<i>…d'une famille d'esclaves.</i>

224
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,160
<i>"…dune desclaves."</i>

225
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,760
That is incorrect.

226
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,560
<i>"Ma-Ma mère est une esclave."</i>

227
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,280
Say it again.

228
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,560
<i>"Ma mère esclave."</i>

229
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,520
<i>"Je suis issu… d'une esclave."</i>

230
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,440
You must be exhausted.

231
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,680
Your Highness.

232
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,440
Your Royal Highness.

233
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,400
My compliments.

234
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,080
You dealt with the situation
quite cleverly.

235
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,000
You are a young man,

236
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,720
yet you are so mature.

237
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,920
His Majesty was right to praise you
and ask you to teach the language here.

238
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,600
You flattered me…

239
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,520
I mean, you praise me too much,
Your Highness.

240
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,920
Is it difficult?

241
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,200
It is indeed.

242
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,040
Speak simply.

243
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,800
You are a foreigner. I'll allow it.

244
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:19,240
If you use the wrong words,
I might find it harder to understand.

245
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,920
I thought I'd had enough practice.

246
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,560
Think of me as a friend.

247
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,440
Speak to me the way you'd speak
to a friend, Professor.

248
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,280
I fear it wouldn't be proper.

249
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,000
How so?

250
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,920
Try it.

251
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,000
Take it as my request.
Will that be all right, Professor?

252
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,960
Of course,

253
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,280
dear Mai.

254
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
See?

255
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,320
I told you it wouldn't be proper.

256
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,280
No one has ever called me that before.

257
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,640
"Dear Mai" it is.

258
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,160
I'll let you call me that.

259
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,400
Are you…

260
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,520
on your way back home, Professor?

261
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,720
I will walk with you.

262
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,960
I have questions about the lesson too.

263
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,800
What are they talking about?

264
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,320
This is where you stay, Rati?

265
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,280
The Deputy Minister arranged it for me.

266
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,600
The place is not
completely sorted, however.

267
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,280
It's still quite messy inside.

268
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,120
Do you need my help?

269
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,920
I couldn't possibly.

270
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,120
I enjoy arranging furniture,
and I still have belongings to deal with.

271
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,240
My lord?

272
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,960
I'm getting curious about you, sir.
You're here day and night.

273
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,440
You're here at any hour of the day, sir.

274
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,760
I did not mean to follow you,
Your Highness.

275
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,360
But it is my duty to oversee
the French professor's stay here.

276
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,080
I did not want to invade your privacy,
so I trailed behind from afar.

277
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,040
You've taken this task upon yourself?

278
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:44,040
I understand you have a number
of employees under your supervision.

279
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,800
It is no imposition.

280
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,840
Thanks for the clarification
on the lesson.

281
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,200
I will surely revise it.

282
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,160
As for the classes,

283
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,800
do not fret, Rati.

284
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,000
Just as you have to adjust
to your students,

285
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,360
we students must adjust to you.

286
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,280
Everything will be fine.

287
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,400
Thanks, dear Mai.

288
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,680
Did I mishear?

289
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,720
Are you and the prince close enough
to be on a first-name basis?

290
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:38,760
Ask Kui to brew you some ginger tea
to relieve your hard day's work, sir.

291
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,920
I only followed you
so I could tell you that.

292
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,040
Don't forget it, Mr. Rati!

293
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,760
Are you talking to yourself, sir?

294
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,080
I'm not your friend.

295
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,280
How was your day, sir?

296
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,160
I'm so tired, Kui.

297
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,240
Good thing there is no class tomorrow.

298
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,640
I'll make sure to sleep in.

299
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,880
Don't take a nap now, sir.

300
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,240
I'll fetch you some cold water.

301
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,920
Kui.

302
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,400
Yes, sir?

303
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,360
Nothing.

304
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,760
I'll come back with a cold drink.

305
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,560
Kui.

306
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,480
Yes?

307
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,760
Nothing.

308
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,920
You called me and said "nothing" twice.

309
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,360
Do let me know what you want, sir.
It will be my pleasure to do it.

310
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,720
It will?

311
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,720
Yes.

312
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,200
Well, if you insist, Kui.

313
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,240
So, what do you want, sir?

314
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,680
Ginger tea.

315
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,160
Ginger tea.

316
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,720
Someone said that
ginger tea helps relieve stress.

317
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Of course, sir.

318
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,680
A certain lord said ginger tea
helps relieve stress.

319
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,320
Kui!

320
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,800
Yes?

321
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,000
Mek is here, big bro.

322
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,120
Sir?

323
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,360
I told you I wanted a rematch.

324
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,360
Let's not, sir.

325
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,280
Scared?

326
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,800
If you can beat me,

327
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,240
you take it.

328
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,960
That is 50 baht.

329
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,800
- Whoa! 50 baht!
- Whoa! 50 baht!

330
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,320
That's a lot of money, Mek.

331
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,280
Take it!

332
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,800
If that's your wish, sir.

333
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,760
Fight!

334
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,240
- Go for it, Mek!
- You got it!

335
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,680
- Go for it!
- You can do it, Mek!

336
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,720
- Do your best!
- Get him, Mek!

337
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,880
- Beat him!
- Do it, Mek!

338
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,440
Go for it, Mek!

339
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,920
Hit him!

340
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,920
Mek!

341
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,480
You got it, Mek.

342
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,840
If you don't stop holding back,

343
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,680
I'll have my father
get you fired from work.

344
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,600
Sir.

345
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,640
Get serious or lose your job.

346
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,560
Take your pick.

347
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,960
Mek, just get serious and beat him!

348
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,160
- Go for it!
- You got it, Mek!

349
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,600
- Go for it, Mek!
- Beat him!

350
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,480
Bring it!

351
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,480
Mek wins!

352
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,320
- Mek is the winner!
- Sir?

353
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,600
Are you all right, sir?

354
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,640
Stars…

355
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,520
I see stars.

356
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,800
Now this is serious.

357
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,720
Ow!

358
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Does it hurt?

359
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,240
Ko.

360
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,480
Go grab my pouch of cloves.

361
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,440
Yes.

362
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,600
Here, sir.

363
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,080
Cloves.

364
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,960
They work.

365
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,480
Take them and chew on them.

366
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,280
One baht, sir.

367
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,400
You make a lot of money fighting.

368
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,000
What do you need all this money for?

369
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,160
It is better
to have a lot of it on hand, sir.

370
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,080
I'm not paying.

371
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,080
Hold on.

372
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,240
For you, sir.

373
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,280
Cloves?

374
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,760
It won't help.

375
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,640
I have a feeling that punch
might have broken my jaw.

376
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,800
It feels like that at first.

377
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:54,080
You will get used to it after a while.

378
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,240
Why do you fight?

379
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,480
Why not find some work
where you don't have to get hurt?

380
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,160
I could ask you the same thing, sir.

381
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,360
You have a title and money.

382
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,440
Why do you fight?

383
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,640
Because I have everything,

384
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,160
so I want what I don't have.

385
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,880
It is completely different from me, sir.

386
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,360
I don't have anything,

387
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,880
so I must work for everything.

388
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,520
Whatever pays,

389
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,200
I'll do it.

390
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:39,360
Poverty doesn't care
whether I like something or not.

391
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,280
There is only necessity.

392
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,400
A poor man like me doesn't get to choose.

393
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,600
But you get a chance to choose

394
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,520
what to study

395
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,320
and how to live,

396
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,560
so you should choose well, sir.

397
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,880
<i>A poor man like me doesn't get to choose.</i>

398
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,120
You can choose what to do,

399
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,880
what to study,

400
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,560
and how to live.

401
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,320
You should choose well, sir.

402
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,720
What business do you have, sir?

403
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,720
My master has brought some food.

404
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,680
Is your master home?

405
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,400
Mr. Rati is upstairs.

406
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,640
Kui!

407
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,000
This is the nobleman
who is allegedly "that way" inclined.

408
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,720
Do you think we should
let him see Mr. Rati?

409
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,160
Please, sir.

410
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,880
No, sir!

411
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,160
Mr. Rati insisted that nobody
should disturb him today.

412
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,200
Who did he mean by "nobody"?

413
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,320
Did he specifically name my master?

414
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,640
If not, then who did he mean?

415
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,320
Yeah.

416
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,160
Who?

417
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:14,880
Kui.

418
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,200
We are not letting him in!

419
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,400
Kui. Jam. Look.

420
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,800
My master was kind enough to bring
all this food for your master.

421
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,800
Of course,
there is enough for you two as well.

422
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,280
Wouldn't you like to have a taste?

423
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,600
Don't you want your master
to enjoy this delicacy?

424
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,480
Let me see.

425
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,440
By all means.

426
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,960
- Wow!
- Scream.

427
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,400
Scream with joy.

428
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,560
- Let me help.
- No.

429
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,120
- No, sir!
- Please!

430
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,040
THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE-DAME

431
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,960
Unrequited love is quite a tragedy,
don't you think?

432
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,920
Between Quasimodo and Esmeralda…

433
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,400
Whose fate do you think is more tragic?

434
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,320
You probably think…

435
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,960
it's Quasimodo's.

436
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,800
Esmeralda's, actually.

437
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,160
Why?

438
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,680
Because Esmeralda
doesn't do anything wrong.

439
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,960
She only refuses to bow down to injustice

440
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,880
and fights to the death for what is right.

441
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,720
Her density has always been
in someone else's hands.

442
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,000
I, however, sympathize with Quasimodo.

443
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,280
Don't you?

444
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,440
A man crushed
under the weight of deformity

445
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,760
who could only hide
in the shadow of the cathedral.

446
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,120
I doubt someone like you understands
how Quasimodo feels, sir.

447
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,920
You were born into a noble family.

448
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,760
You are wealthy and well-educated.

449
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,320
How could someone like you

450
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,520
understand a hunchback
hiding in the corner of a cathedral?

451
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,200
Maybe I have hidden something.

452
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,520
Something the world

453
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,280
doesn't accept.

454
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,960
If you want to help me tidy up the place,
I won't stop you.

455
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,600
But please don't distract me from my task.

456
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,040
Where are you going, sir?

457
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,520
I'm going to clean the bedroom.

458
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,920
- No.
- But--

459
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,120
It's my bedroom.

460
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,520
I'll clean it myself.

461
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,000
And I haven't forgiven you, sir.

462
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,640
I'll clean another room.

463
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,800
When you finally forgive me,
I'll clean your bedroom.

464
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,840
Let me help.

465
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
No need.

466
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,760
Allow me.

467
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,200
Stay still.

468
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,360
I'll get it.

469
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,760
Does it feel better?

470
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,440
Won't you thank me at all?

471
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,200
Is cordiality such a rare quality
among the French?

472
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,320
Thank you!

473
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,080
It's really good, Mhay!

474
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,160
- Told you!
- Right?

475
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,600
You should have brought more.

476
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,760
Kui!

477
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,360
You disgusting pig. Take the whole thing!

478
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,920
I'm so full, but the food is too good!

479
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,720
Just stop eating. I'll take it.

480
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,000
Careful, you two!

481
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,360
Kui! Jam!

482
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,520
Mr. Rati.

483
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,360
Ow!

484
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,960
You said your master had left!

485
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,000
I thought he had!

486
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,560
Master, you're still here?

487
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,880
Is the dessert good?

488
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,159
Very much so, sir.

489
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,440
Shut your mouth.

490
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,679
You enticed my attendants with dessert?

491
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,480
You fox.

492
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,080
Enticed them?

493
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,320
I was merely being generous.

494
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,639
I brought some for you as well.

495
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,880
You like desserts.
I hope you will enjoy this.

496
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,719
Jam.

497
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
What's that sound?

498
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,520
A bicycle, sir.

499
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:00,840
It's a small vehicle
with two wheels and pedals.

500
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,040
We don't have one, do we?

501
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,240
No, sir.

502
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,920
It might be nice to have one,
don't you think?

503
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,080
Definitely, sir!

504
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,400
- Ding!
- Hey.

505
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,640
Bicycles?

506
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,960
Bicycles.

507
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,120
I bet it would be fun to ride one.

508
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
A bicycle?

509
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,640
How lucky I am!

510
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,000
Where did you get it?

511
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,480
They're not difficult to find.
Would you like to ride it?

512
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,680
- Yes!
- Yes!

513
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,400
What do you say, Mr. Rati?

514
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,360
No.

515
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,360
Are you sure?

516
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,560
Well,

517
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,560
I'm off then.

518
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,480
Mr. Rati.

519
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,880
He's back, sir!

520
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,800
I'll ask you once more.

521
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,040
Would you like to ride it?

522
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,200
- Yes!
- Yes!

523
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,840
What does it matter what I would like?

524
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,720
It's not as if you're going
to give it to me, sir.

525
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,280
I was going to.

526
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,680
So he was!

527
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,520
Did you think
I'd forgive you if you did this?

528
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,280
I am a happy man just talking to you.

529
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,240
Forgive him for what?

530
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,160
How would I know?

531
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,200
I'm giving it to you
for a practical reason.

532
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,200
If you want a riding buddy,

533
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,320
I'll wait for you at the lotus pond
behind the temple this evening.

534
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,520
Bicycle!

535
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,400
How does this work?

536
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,280
To what do I owe the pleasure, my lord?

537
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,720
I am here about Mr. Rati.

538
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,520
Is the servant boy so important that you
must travel all this way to discuss him?

539
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:22,000
Mr. Rati is a Frenchman
and the guest of our nation.

540
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,800
By the Ministry of Education's order,

541
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,320
I have been tasked with the job
of taking care of him.

542
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,600
In our previous lessons,

543
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,200
your behavior has been nothing short
of disrespectful to our guest.

544
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,520
Will you, from now on, respect Mr. Rati,

545
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,800
as any gentleman should?

546
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,120
You see,

547
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,480
before you ask me that question,

548
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,840
why don't you go take a look
at where he came from?

549
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,440
I don't see how his past is relevant.

550
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,200
You are asking me,

551
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,960
Mom Rajawong Rujrapeepat Suriyakorn,

552
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,160
to bow down to a servant boy.

553
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,520
Isn't that even less acceptable?

554
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,720
If you refuse to comply,

555
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,520
I will have no choice
but to report this to the ministry

556
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,640
and have you withdrawn
from the student list.

557
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,120
You think I want to be in that class?

558
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,000
So you wish to withdraw?

559
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,200
If it wasn't an official order,

560
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,600
I would never have shown my face there.

561
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,000
You don't want to study,

562
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,640
but you must for your job.

563
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,480
If that is the case,

564
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,280
I do hope you will cease
hindering Mr. Rati from doing his job

565
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,360
as you have been doing.

566
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,760
Do you understand, sir?

567
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,640
I don't hear a "no,"

568
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,600
so I will take it that you do.

569
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,920
That was all I'm here for.

570
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,880
Good day.

571
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,000
What on earth
are you standing there for? Huh?

572
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,480
Were you spying on me
so you could spread the word?

573
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,400
You're satisfied, aren't you,
that I have to be tutored by a servant?

574
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,840
Are you satisfied now?

575
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,720
No! No, sir.

576
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,200
How dare you?!

577
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:10,920
Hey.

578
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,680
Hey, you missed a spot.

579
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,840
I am getting to it!
Would you rather you do it yourself?

580
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,920
You're too slow!

581
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,160
Do it yourself, why don't you?

582
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,400
No. You do it.

583
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,800
- Why should I?
- Kui. Jam.

584
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,640
I'm going to the market.

585
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,320
You are?

586
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,840
You should take the bicycle, sir.

587
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,400
No.

588
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,680
I'd rather walk.

589
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,440
Mr. Rati.

590
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,680
Mr. Rati, sir!

591
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,200
- Mr. Rati.
- Mhay?

592
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,720
How dare you just barge in here?

593
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,080
I can have an officer
arrest you for trespassing.

594
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,840
There's an emergency, sir.

595
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,280
What's the matter?

596
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,040
- My master was hit on the head.
- What?

597
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,640
Who would dare?

598
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,960
It was Lord Ruj.

599
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,560
Mr. Thee.

600
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,520
Mr. Thee.

601
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:17,480
Mr. Thee.

602
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,800
Mr. Thee.

603
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Mr. Thee.

604
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,720
It's you?

605
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,840
Mr. Thee.

606
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,960
Mr. Thee, why aren't you at the hospital?

607
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,240
I'm quite fine.

608
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:43,280
That's not for you to decide.

609
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,720
You should see a doctor.

610
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,120
Come with me this instant.

611
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,200
Are you worried about me?

612
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,400
Mr. Thee.

613
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,840
You rode the bicycle and stopped
calling me "sir" at every turn.

614
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,960
You forgave me, didn't you?

615
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,920
I never meant to hide anything from you.

616
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,720
But I will admit that

617
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,720
I did not tell you the truth
when it was called for.

618
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,480
It was my cowardice.

619
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,800
I was afraid that you,
upon knowing who I am,

620
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,080
would put a distance between us
and think you should humble yourself,

621
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:53,680
the way you do with everyone.

622
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:57,520
I simply want you to be my friend.

623
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,720
Someone who stays by my side.

624
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,480
You don't believe me?

625
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,760
Go to the hospital.

626
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:18,520
No.

627
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,120
Go to the hospital first,

628
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,760
and then I'll give you a second chance.

629
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,280
Do you mean it?

630
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,600
Go to the hospital!

631
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,800
Will you be my friend again right away?

632
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,400
We can go to the hospital together.

633
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,480
Mr. Thee.

634
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,960
Please.

635
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:37,840
If we postpone going to the hospital any
longer, my wound could get infected.

636
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,840
Just go, Mr. Thee.

637
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,600
Can you stop calling me "mister"?

638
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:46,080
What friends address each other
with such cold indifference?

639
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,400
You call Prince Mai by his name.

640
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,120
He asked me to.

641
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,720
And here I am, asking.

642
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,120
You're pushing your luck.

643
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,240
Please.

644
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,160
Dear Thee.

645
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,120
What now?

646
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:13,960
That doesn't sound right.

647
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,680
I can't possibly try
to measure up to His Highness.

648
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,520
What do you want me to call you then?

649
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,000
Call me…

650
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,280
by my name.

651
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,120
Thee.

652
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,440
Please.

653
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,840
Simply Thee.

654
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,040
Thee.

655
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,560
Pardon?

656
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,480
Thee.

657
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,760
Thee!

658
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,320
I heard you.

659
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,000
If I died of infection right now,

660
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,000
I'd die a happy man.

661
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,600
Rati.

662
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,600
Thee!

663
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,200
<i>If you want me to teach you French, you</i>
<i>must teach me muay, Monsieur Mek.</i>

664
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:35,120
I will make sure my lessons
match your kindness.

665
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,480
NEXT EPISODE

666
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,800
<i>I suddenly felt like I was burning inside</i>
<i>despite being in the water.</i>

667
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,440
<i>Like if I did not hold on to something,</i>

668
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,280
I might have floated away.

669
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,160
<i>People might think I was</i>
<i>trying to seduce you.</i>

670
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,960
<i>Would you still say you were not</i>
<i>disgusted by me?</i>
