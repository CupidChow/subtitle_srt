1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,840
<i>If you want me to teach you French, you</i>
<i>must teach me muay, Monsieur Mek.</i>

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,040
I will make sure my lessons
match your kindness.

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,000
PREVIOUSLY

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,080
<i>Let me show you how the French do it.</i>

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:13,320
Rati!

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,200
<i>I suddenly felt like I was burning inside</i>
<i>despite being in the water.</i>

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,040
He is engaged.

8
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:23,920
<i>Would you still say that</i>
<i>you were not disgusted by me?</i>

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,400
Is that you, my lord?

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,760
THEE

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,000
Smells lovely.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,280
Do you like it?

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,760
I must be dreaming.

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,000
It's nice.

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,480
Is it?

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,840
I'll stop by every morning.

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,120
Would you like that?

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,480
Thee?

19
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,760
I brought you this bunga rumpai.

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,120
The scent of rose petals and cloves
helps you feel relaxed.

21
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,120
Put it next to your pillow

22
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,000
to remind you of the person
who gave it to you.

23
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,800
Thank you.

24
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,160
How did you get into my room?

25
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,600
It's time to get up.
You have a lesson to teach today.

26
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,200
Or would you like me to…?

27
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,640
I'm up!

28
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,000
Coffee, sir.

29
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,160
Thanks, Jam.

30
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,280
Of course.

31
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,840
Thee.

32
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,240
Don't look at me like that.

33
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,960
Like what?

34
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,440
Like…

35
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,800
Like you're really happy.

36
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,519
-Unlike the way you look at me, my lord.
-Jam. Don't you have work to do?

37
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,200
I do. But I want to be here.

38
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,200
Get to work.

39
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
Yes, sir.

40
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,360
-Jam.
-Yes?

41
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,520
Work.

42
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,280
Yes.

43
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,760
I'll leave your food here.

44
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,840
I didn't mean to make you feel
uncomfortable by staring,

45
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,680
but I couldn't help myself.

46
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,000
You have to.

47
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,280
How could I when we…?

48
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,520
Thee!

49
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,760
You are so unbending.

50
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,960
Each day, they seem
more and more than just friends.

51
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,960
Soon enough, people will talk.

52
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,920
Those two?

53
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,080
Surely you're overthinking it.

54
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,440
It's you who needs to think a little!

55
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,120
Don't you see the way
the count looks at Mr. Rati like…?

56
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,480
Stop it! You're giving me goosebumps.

57
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,760
As I was saying, it's not typical!

58
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,080
The count is indeed very good to us,
but Mr. Rati is our master.

59
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,880
I love my master.

60
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,840
What should I do, Kui?

61
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,840
You can do whatever you want.

62
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,520
Just not what you just did to me.

63
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,560
I was just demonstrating.
I would never smile at you like that.

64
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,200
Get back to work!

65
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,840
CIVIL SERVANTS SCHOOL

66
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,000
<i>Bonjour. Mon nom est Theerathon.</i>

67
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,360
<i>Enchanté. Comment allez-vous?</i>

68
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,200
<i>Bonjour. Je vais bien, et vous?</i>

69
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,840
<i>Je vais bien. Merci.</i>

70
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,200
Very good.

71
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,760
How do you pronounce this word,
and what does it mean?

72
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,200
Does anyone know?

73
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,880
<i>Maison.</i>

74
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,120
It means "house."

75
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,440
Very good.

76
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,200
Thank you.

77
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,760
Good luck on your examination.

78
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,240
You can now begin.

79
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,200
CIVIL SERVANTS SCHOOL

80
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,800
TEST

81
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,720
Goodbye.

82
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,840
Thank you, Professor.

83
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,480
No need to hurry. There's still time, sir.

84
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,720
CIVIL SERVANTS SCHOOL

85
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,360
Professor!

86
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:40,280
If I wanted to, how would I say,
"Where would you like to go?"

87
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,919
<i>Où veux-tu aller?</i>

88
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,680
<i>"Où veux-tu aller?"</i>

89
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,760
Correct.

90
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,360
<i>Où veux-tu aller?</i>

91
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,720
<i>Où veux-tu aller?</i>

92
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
"Where would you like to go?"

93
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,440
<i>Là.</i>

94
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,120
<i>Où veux-tu aller?</i>

95
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,000
<i>Je veux aller là-bas.</i>

96
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Excellent.

97
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,920
I'll be able to speak
to French passengers now.

98
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,440
Thank you, sir.

99
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,720
What's the matter, sir?

100
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,280
Did I say something wrong?

101
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,560
You speak as if we are not friends.

102
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,320
You don't think I'm your friend?

103
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,440
We're at school.

104
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,040
I think it will be improper
if anyone hears us.

105
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,360
Mek.

106
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,040
Dech.

107
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,080
Now that's more like it, Mek.

108
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,360
Dech.

109
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,560
If anyone actually heard us,

110
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,800
how would you even explain to them?

111
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,200
Try me.

112
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,640
Who the hell do you think you are?

113
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,080
How dare you speak so casually
with my son?

114
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,760
Didn't you hear me?

115
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,840
-Mek is my--
-Nothing but a simple commoner, sir.

116
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,280
I don't dare imagine myself
on par with the baronet.

117
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,560
The baronet was so courteous to me,
speaking with such civility.

118
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,760
I was only telling him to speak casually
to make it appropriate, my lord.

119
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,960
He's right.

120
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,360
You misheard, Father.
I was talking just now.

121
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,320
Is that so?

122
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Yes.

123
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,840
A servant who knows his place
is a servant I like.

124
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,680
If you ever need work,

125
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,640
come to my place.

126
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,600
Let's go.

127
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,880
I think they've all gone to bed, my lord.

128
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,320
Should I try calling them?

129
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,680
No need.

130
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,200
That's all I came for.
We're going home.

131
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,280
Yes, sir.

132
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,480
Did you come all the way here
just to take a look at his rooftop?

133
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,560
-Is there a problem?
-Of course not, sir.

134
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,160
We can stay all night if you want.

135
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,680
Let's go, then.

136
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,720
Please, sir.

137
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,720
Thee.

138
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,200
Are you going to leave
without even saying hello?

139
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,160
You should have gone straight home
after getting off work so late.

140
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,000
I wanted to come here.

141
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,960
But?

142
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,760
I'd have been satisfied
just seeing your bedroom window.

143
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,360
That's my kind of rest.

144
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,720
Thee.

145
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,200
It's late.

146
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,240
It would be inappropriate
if anyone saw us.

147
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,120
We're not doing anything inappropriate,
are we?

148
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,480
Would you prefer it if we were?

149
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,120
Thee.

150
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,760
You were waiting for me, weren't you?

151
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,400
Otherwise, you would have gone to bed.

152
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,440
No, I wasn't.

153
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,720
You really are unbending.

154
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,240
The Floating Lantern Festival
is approaching.

155
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,440
This coming full moon,

156
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,960
will you go to
the Floating Lantern Festival with me?

157
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,880
What is a floating lantern?

158
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,840
I won't tell you just yet.

159
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,080
I'll tell you that the event is
fun and lively, though.

160
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,280
It is?

161
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:33,760
Give me an answer first.

162
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,200
You promise to take me with you?

163
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,760
Aren't you always enthusiastic
when it comes to having fun?

164
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,800
Go to bed.

165
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,200
It's late.

166
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,280
You too.

167
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,600
Goodnight.

168
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,480
Go home.

169
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,960
Go to bed.

170
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,040
The Floating Lantern Festival
takes place during the 12th month

171
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,320
when the moon is at its fullest
and brightest

172
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,880
and the tides touch the shores.

173
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,680
We make krathong to float them
in the river, don't we?

174
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,320
Yes.

175
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,160
You're very good at
cleaning banana leaves.

176
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,560
You praise me too much, Thee.

177
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,680
It's not an impossible task, you know.

178
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,000
I can't even praise you now?

179
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,280
I wonder whose car that is.

180
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,640
Mr. Rati.

181
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,880
Mr. Rati, sir.

182
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,280
You have a visitor, sir.

183
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,920
Who is it, Kui?

184
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,360
Hello, Rati.

185
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,400
Florion!

186
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,920
How did you get here?

187
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,640
By boat. I bring news from
the French embassy and from your father.

188
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,040
I still have trouble getting used to
the boat trip to Siam.

189
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,920
I always end up
throwing up from seasickness.

190
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,599
Mhay. Is your master all right?

191
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,920
It's the hot weather getting to him.

192
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,319
-Don't worry about him.
-Sounds like they're having fun.

193
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,160
I have news from your father, Lutine.

194
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,359
He asked me to bring you news from France.

195
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,359
This is your father's message.

196
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,360
What are they talking about?

197
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,520
It's only been a while
since they last met.

198
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,480
Hardly long enough
to have missed each other.

199
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,920
He even brought a letter?

200
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,120
What's gotten into your master?

201
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,480
Look. He's talking to himself,

202
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,400
and he's tearing
those banana leaves to shreds.

203
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,960
Whose master do you think is to blame?

204
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,800
Do you know something I also suspect?

205
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,320
I don't.

206
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,680
I don't know how many lanterns
we will make with this.

207
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,480
-What are you all talking about?
-Oh, it's…

208
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,200
-This is difficult to cut, sir.
-It is, my lord.

209
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,520
We're helping each other out.

210
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,720
This letter contains
your return date to France.

211
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:47,920
Good luck.

212
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,440
Good luck to you too.

213
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,600
Wow.

214
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,800
It's beautiful.

215
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,040
You cannot go to the festival
with anyone but me tonight.

216
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,040
As your guardian by duty,

217
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,760
it is my sole responsibility
to take you to the festival.

218
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,480
You are abusing your power.

219
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,400
But I accept.

220
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,760
I knew you'd be here.

221
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,760
I was going to give you
this book yesterday,

222
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,440
but Father got in the way.

223
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,280
Why didn't you tell my father yesterday
that we are friends?

224
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,360
If I did, would your father
have accepted it?

225
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,400
You would at least be telling the truth.

226
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,080
I didn't want to cause you any trouble.

227
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,160
Were you afraid my father
would have you whipped?

228
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm not afraid of getting hurt.

229
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,720
I appreciate the fact that
you want to tell him we are friends.

230
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,880
Your feelings… aren't hurt?

231
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,680
Are you worried about me?

232
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,840
Hey, I'm being genuine.

233
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,680
We are friends,

234
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,600
and I want to be a good one.

235
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,280
Thanks, Dech.

236
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,120
I heard the Floating Lantern Festival
tonight is going to be grand.

237
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,240
I take it you'll be in the ring fighting
to win some money?

238
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,480
I don't know.

239
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,320
I do want to float a lantern
like everyone else though.

240
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,720
Can you come?

241
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,600
My father insisted I must bring some lady
whose name I don't even remember

242
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,560
to the festival tonight.

243
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,800
He forbids me to say no.

244
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,440
That's good.

245
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,480
A festival is the perfect opportunity
to go with a lover.

246
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,600
But I want to go with you.

247
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,000
I never listen to anyone anyway.

248
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,600
I'd rather go and have fun with a friend.

249
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,880
But…

250
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,400
See you.

251
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,640
Mr. Rati.

252
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,640
I'm here to pick up my guardian.

253
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,600
I feel like a student
just finishing school.

254
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:41,040
I was afraid my guardian might think twice
about taking me to the festival.

255
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
Thee.

256
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,120
Hello.

257
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,120
This is Mom Rajawong Tikumporn Borrirak,
the daughter of Duke Udomsawaddamrong,

258
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,800
the Minister of Education
at the ministry where I work.

259
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,560
Your grandmother asked me
to accompany you back home for dinner

260
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,360
before we go to the festival together.

261
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,680
Shall we?

262
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,640
I'm afraid not.

263
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,600
I am…

264
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,480
Mr. Rati.

265
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,760
You have to go with the ministry's guest?

266
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,120
It is entirely all right.

267
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,560
I will go with Jam and Kui.
You should go, sir.

268
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,200
Mr. Rati.

269
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,440
I will go with you tonight, as promised.

270
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,160
You don't have to.

271
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,040
Wait for me.

272
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,720
I will have Mhay tell you where to meet.

273
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,240
At seven o'clock,
I will hurry and join you there.

274
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,920
You said your daughter
speaks English well.

275
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:42,160
Beautiful and talented, you'd be an asset
to the work that Thee does.

276
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
Don't you think, Thee?

277
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,600
I would never dare burden Lady Pa
with my work like that.

278
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,160
"Lady Pa," Thee?

279
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,480
Don't be so distant.

280
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,040
The Wisut and Borrirak families
are long-time friends.

281
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,640
You can speak casually with her.

282
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,440
I hope there is no problem
with the betrothal we have spoken of.

283
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,480
I am, for one, in total support
if my daughter has feelings for Mr. Thee.

284
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,840
Well, you troublesome grandson?

285
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,320
I already have gifts prepared

286
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,360
to welcome my future granddaughter-in-law
into the Wisut family.

287
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,680
-Mine is so much prettier than yours.
-Only because you're better at making it.

288
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,920
-Of course I am.
-Hello, Jam.

289
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,080
Hello.

290
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,040
Hey. Look at that.

291
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,360
Appetizing!

292
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,480
My mouth is watering.

293
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,680
Mine too! Oh!

294
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,720
Look! Grilled chicken.

295
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,840
It's hot off the grill.

296
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,120
-Feel free to stop by.
-Kui. Jam.

297
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,880
It's almost nine o'clock.

298
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,360
Let's go and wait for Thee
at the gazebo by the river.

299
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,840
I don't want him to wait.

300
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,000
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

301
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,560
-I'll come back for the chicken.
-And I'll come back for the cotton candy.

302
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
I don't care.

303
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,080
Just make sure you share it with me.

304
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,200
Corn! Fresh corn!

305
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,120
Dech.

306
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,000
Dech, I want this.

307
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,120
Fresh corn!

308
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,320
Is that all right?

309
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,960
Of course.

310
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,160
I want two of these.

311
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,240
And two of these, please.

312
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,160
Oh, grilled chicken!

313
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,960
Dech, look how good this is.

314
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,800
Is it all right if I buy this?

315
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,080
Of course.

316
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,760
It is always better
to eat them cooked rather than raw.

317
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,000
Thank you, Dech.

318
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,680
Hey, make it well done, like he said.

319
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,440
I want two of these.
And two of these.

320
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,920
-Take care of her.
-Yes, sir.

321
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
It smells divine!

322
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,800
Give me this one too.

323
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,200
And also this one.

324
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,160
Hold on, Dech--

325
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,400
-Where has he gone?
-I don't know, ma'am.

326
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,800
Hey!

327
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,120
-Hey!
-Sweet treats!

328
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,360
Hey!

329
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,240
Hey!

330
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,600
We have all kinds of sweet treats.

331
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,760
-Hey!
-Treats!

332
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,400
Sweet treats!

333
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,320
Hey! Hey!

334
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,040
I want that. Oh!

335
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,640
You want some sweet treats?
Of course, dear.

336
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
Thank you.

337
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,480
No…

338
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,040
My krathong!

339
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,560
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

340
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,320
You should have held it more firmly.

341
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,480
You couldn't even
take care of a simple krathong.

342
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,840
How can you take care of me?

343
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,640
My dear.

344
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,120
My dear, wait for me!

345
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,960
You!

346
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,800
Mek.

347
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
Run, sir.

348
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,600
You all right?

349
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,840
I will have my son, Ram, look up
the perfect date for the engagement.

350
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,840
Yes, ma'am.

351
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
Do it as soon as next week.

352
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,040
Yes.

353
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,960
Marriage is not on my mind right now.

354
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,320
All I want to focus on
is serving my country.

355
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,360
You can still do that as a married man.

356
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,400
Am I right, Ram?

357
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,520
Yes, Mother.

358
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,880
Lady Pa is still young.

359
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,920
She is perfect in every way.

360
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,040
I'd hate to see her suffer
when I don't have time to care for her.

361
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,080
If I were to agree
to this auspicious occasion,

362
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,680
I'm afraid it would do the lady
more harm than good.

363
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,720
What a trivial concern.

364
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,880
I think it would be better to do it soon
so people don't talk badly about you both.

365
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,880
Lady Pa is ready for marriage.

366
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,280
Am I right, dear?

367
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,560
But I am not.

368
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,280
If you're preoccupied
with the matter with Monsieur Rati,

369
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,200
I can transfer this duty to someone else.

370
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,440
Taking care of Professor Rati
is my responsibility.

371
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,520
You promised Monsieur Lutine,
the ambassador.

372
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,560
That was mainly why he let his only son
stay behind for this job.

373
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,320
To transfer this duty to someone else

374
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,680
would be disrespectful to the ambassador.

375
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,120
I feel it would be inappropriate.

376
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,200
He's just a professor.

377
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,600
Professor Rati is staying for only a year.

378
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,760
I don't think anyone would object

379
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,800
if this marriage were delayed
for some months.

380
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,720
Come here.

381
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,920
Here.

382
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,280
Careful.

383
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,280
How did you get yourself in trouble
while taking a stroll with a lady?

384
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,680
I didn't mean to get into it.

385
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,000
I was going to pay him for it.
You got in the way.

386
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,760
Are you blaming me?

387
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,440
I literally just saved you.

388
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,800
You were too hasty.

389
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,240
Yes. I was indeed hasty.

390
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,480
But I was only hasty
because I was worried about you.

391
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,640
Hey!

392
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,520
Let's go.

393
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,320
We lost them.

394
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,280
Come on.

395
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,200
I'm glad you're talking to me
like an actual friend.

396
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,120
You should go back to your lady.

397
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,600
She must be waiting for you.

398
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,920
I told you.

399
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,000
I wanted to come here with you.

400
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,160
I don't want to stand by while she shops.

401
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,280
It's not fun.

402
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,440
I'd rather be getting chased with you.

403
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,320
I feel sorry for the lady now.

404
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,000
Don't you feel sorry for me?

405
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,680
I didn't want to come here with her.

406
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,240
My father made me.

407
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,840
He makes me do everything.

408
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,200
He wants me to work at
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

409
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:08,000
But since I'm not bright,
he makes me study languages

410
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,400
and introduces me to his powerful friends,

411
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
hoping to secure me a shortcut.

412
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,560
But it's obvious
his friends' promises are empty.

413
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,040
No one wants to hire a slowpoke.

414
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,760
That's why I secretly practice muay.

415
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,640
At least it's what I choose for myself.

416
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,560
Muay is fun.

417
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,320
It makes me feel like myself.

418
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,600
I like doing muay.

419
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,680
I've never told anyone any of that

420
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
except you.

421
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,160
I was deadly sick as a kid.

422
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,520
My mother worked hard to get me better.

423
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,920
She mortgaged the land
that gave our family our livelihood,

424
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,760
but we got cheated.

425
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,600
The interest was more than
my mother could pay.

426
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,400
And so she…

427
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,720
She died of heartbreak.

428
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,320
That's when I started fighting.

429
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:39,040
I'm doing everything I can
to buy the land back.

430
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,760
I've also never told anyone that.

431
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,520
This is what it is to be friends.

432
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,480
Dech, my friend.

433
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:11,560
Let's go.

434
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,920
I have to get in the ring
before everyone else takes my money.

435
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,040
I'll come with you.

436
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,520
You'll have to catch up to me, then.

437
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,400
Mek!

438
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,199
-Ouch!
-What?

439
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,280
Kui, did you kick me?

440
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,480
What?

441
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,360
You fell down.

442
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,520
I was just nodding off.

443
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,000
Mr. Rati, sir.

444
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,600
The festival is going to end soon.

445
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,800
I believe it's nearly 11 o'clock.

446
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,120
Shall we float the lanterns together?

447
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,520
She's right, sir.

448
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:04,440
I don't think he's coming.
It's more likely he went with his fiancée.

449
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
-Kui!
-Ow!

450
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,600
What do you think you're saying?

451
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,000
Hmph!

452
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,760
Thee promised.

453
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,960
He is coming.

454
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,960
Jam. Kui. You two should go ahead
and float your lanterns.

455
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,680
-Let's go.
-Are you out of your mind?

456
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,160
Let's go.

457
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,040
It's late, sir.

458
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,680
I don't want the deities going to bed
before we pay our respects.

459
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
Hurry up.

460
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,360
Thee made this krathong from scratch.

461
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,720
How could he not come?

462
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,560
Right?

463
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,520
Would you like some krathong?

464
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,160
We also have water lilies.

465
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,640
Hello there.

466
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,160
Come on here for sweet treats.

467
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,560
-Let's float some lanterns.
-One baht each.

468
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,000
Krathong over here.

469
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,840
Buy your krathong here.

470
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,240
I'm aware talking about marriage
makes you uncomfortable,

471
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,640
but how can we disobey our parents?

472
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,080
Sooner or later, it ought to happen.

473
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,840
This marriage is still a long way off.

474
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,600
I see no need to pay heed to it yet.

475
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,000
And you don't have to do that for me.

476
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,800
Take this krathong
and float it as you should.

477
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,120
You're not floating it with me?

478
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,760
I'll wait right here.

479
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:37,760
My father and your grandmother meant
for us to float this krathong together.

480
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,640
Do you plan to float another krathong
with someone else?

481
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,920
What would people say
if they saw me float it by myself?

482
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,680
I will wait here.

483
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,680
All right.

484
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,320
If this is your refusal of me,

485
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,280
I hope you are prepared
for the consequences.

486
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,560
I am ready to face the consequences
of the choices I made today.

487
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,600
Please go.

488
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,000
That person must be waiting.

489
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,720
I will close my eyes and count to three.

490
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:31,720
When you are out of my sight, I'll take it
that we lost each other in the crowd.

491
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,760
Please float your lantern.

492
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,600
I'll wait here and walk you back
to the car before I go.

493
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,320
I want you to hurry up and leave.

494
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:49,640
Don't stand here and make my humiliation
of floating a lantern alone any worse.

495
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,440
One.

496
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,040
Two.

497
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,680
Three.

498
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,120
Rati.

499
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,920
Thee.

500
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,560
I'm sorry.

501
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,760
Were you waiting long?

502
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,960
It's all right.

503
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,480
Let's go.

504
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,680
I want to try lighting fireworks.

505
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,320
This is the last one.

506
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,120
Would you like to share
some snacks with me afterwards?

507
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,640
We haven't floated our lantern.

508
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,440
We can do that later.

509
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,880
Is there something on your mind?

510
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,120
Will you talk to me?

511
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,440
Is it something you can't tell me?

512
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,360
You really didn't float a lantern
with anyone else?

513
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,120
I didn't.

514
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,560
What about that lady?

515
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,320
I don't want anything to do with Lady Pa,

516
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,320
or any other ladies, for that matter.

517
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,120
The only person
I want to do anything with is you, Rati.

518
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:48,320
But…

519
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,400
What still bothers you? Just let me know.

520
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,520
You deserve to be happy
with the right woman.

521
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,000
One with whom you can have
a traditional marriage.

522
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,360
If "happy" is what you want me to be,

523
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,280
then I'm happy right now.

524
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,280
What else is on your mind?

525
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,920
Florion visited this morning

526
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:26,800
to tell me when I'm going back to Paris.

527
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:28,760
I know.

528
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,320
I knew from the beginning that
you would go back to France one day.

529
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,240
But you're still the only person
I want to float this lantern with, Rati.

530
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,200
Do you want to do that with me?

531
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,120
And your heart…

532
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,080
How does it truly feel?

533
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,160
Forget all rationality,
and leave just your heart.

534
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,280
Answer my question only with your heart.

535
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,200
Do you have feelings for me…

536
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,120
the way I have feelings for you?

537
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:49,160
I solemnly swear to the Goddess Ganga
and all the deities here tonight

538
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,280
that my body and my soul

539
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,920
long only for Rati.

540
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,560
I solemnly swear to the Goddess Ganga

541
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:26,720
and all the deities here tonight

542
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,520
that, from now on, my body and my soul

543
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,600
will long for Thee,

544
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,000
and only for Thee.

545
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:34,480
"Viscount Rati Jarupich"?

546
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,560
Your title has been officially published
in the Royal Gazette.

547
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,560
NEXT EPISODE

548
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:42,120
From now on, I believe things
will only continue looking up for us.

549
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,240
-Are you going to deliberately lose?
-I…

550
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,240
-Mek!
-Hey! Stop it!

551
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,680
I need to talk to you about the wedding
between you and Lady Pa.
