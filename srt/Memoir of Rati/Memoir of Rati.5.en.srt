1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,800
"My mother is a slave."

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,160
"My whole family is."

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,920
How would you say that
in French, Professor?

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,280
If you don't stop holding back, I'll have
my father get you fired from work.

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,720
PREVIOUSLY

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,000
<i>Let me help.</i>

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,240
I will have no choice
but to report this to the ministry

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,160
and have you withdrawn
from the student list.

9
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,240
No, sir!

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,920
If I died of infection right now,
I'd die a happy man.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,320
THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE-DAME

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,160
<i>I've missed you.</i>

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,240
Please. Please get out of here, sir.

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,200
This is no place for a gentleman like you.

15
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm just a kitchen maid.

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,520
I don't dare imagine myself as the mother
of a gentleman like you, sir.

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,600
Mom!

18
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,080
How do I do this, Jam?

19
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,360
I've never given alms before.

20
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,800
Let me show you.

21
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,000
Mr. Thee.

22
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,760
Just Thee.

23
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,920
Thee.

24
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,680
What are you doing here?

25
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,680
I've bought breakfast.

26
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,760
I saw that Jam was busy preparing alms,
so I offered to bring them to you.

27
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,320
I want to give alms too.

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,720
While waiting for monks to arrive,

29
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,280
clear your mind.

30
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:06,920
You must put down whatever
is weighing on your heart.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,360
This is no time for problem-solving.

32
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,440
All right.

33
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,040
The monk is coming.

34
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
Say your prayer.

35
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,720
Repeat after me.

36
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,520
White as lotus is precious rice.

37
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,600
White as lotus is precious rice.

38
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,120
Raise them upon your head up high.

39
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,440
Raise them upon your head up high.

40
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,040
Send your prayer with focus.

41
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,560
Send your prayer with focus.

42
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,040
There's a palace dessert
I want you to try.

43
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,320
But I think you might want to try
making it yourself.

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,040
What is it?

45
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,360
Som chun.

46
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,800
A peculiar name,

47
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,720
but the taste is so delightful,
it makes you forget all your worries.

48
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,920
-Really?
-Yes, sir!

49
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,320
Boil jasmine-infused water with sugar.

50
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,720
Add pandan and bitter orange juice
for fragrance.

51
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,760
Boil to make syrup.

52
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,200
Let it simmer.

53
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,480
Pick any fruits you like.

54
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,160
Add the syrup.

55
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,400
Now, freeze overnight.

56
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,520
Thee.

57
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:11,880
Here.

58
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,840
Spoon, sir.

59
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,480
How is it, sir?

60
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,800
Scrumptious.

61
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,600
It's so refreshing and delightful.

62
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,560
If my heart were a person,

63
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,160
it would be dancing unstoppably.

64
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,400
How so, sir?

65
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,240
Like this.

66
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,240
Jam. Kui. Mhay.

67
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,720
Try it.

68
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,360
I want to see if it makes you dance
like your master says.

69
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,520
Gladly, sir!

70
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,000
Are you sure, my lord?

71
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,120
Kui, grab that.

72
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,200
You should try it too.

73
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,960
Let him try another bite, Mr. Rati.

74
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,520
Jam.

75
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,640
Make it a big bite, sir.

76
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,600
I wonder how fast your heart
is dancing now, my lord.

77
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,960
Aren't you chatty today, Jam?

78
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,600
It puts my mind at ease to see you smile.

79
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,320
Last night,

80
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,640
I dreamed of my mother, Buaphan.

81
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,560
Even in my dreams,

82
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,880
she doesn't accept me as her son.

83
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,800
I don't understand

84
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,000
why she disowned me.

85
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,880
It hurt you so much that
it haunted your dreams.

86
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,440
Imagine how your mother feels.

87
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,840
I believe she said what she did
out of love, not indifference.

88
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,920
Love?

89
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,000
Put yourself in Buaphan's shoes.

90
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,880
She is a kitchen maid
in Lord Ruj's Suriyakorn Palace.

91
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,440
If she were to openly love you as her son,

92
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,680
how would that make Lord Ruj feel?

93
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,880
He would probably grow
even more tempestuous

94
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,360
and take it out on my mother.

95
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,600
And on you, Rati.

96
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,400
She did what she did to protect me?

97
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,080
The bond between a mother and a son
is not so easy to sever.

98
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,520
I believe time will bring relief
to you and your mother someday.

99
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,720
And I will make sure
that day comes very soon.

100
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,600
You really are good to me, Thee.

101
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,960
When I go back to France,
I will miss you dearly.

102
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,960
Will you miss me at all?

103
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,120
I don't have to wait to find out.

104
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,120
I miss you
as soon as you're out of my sight.

105
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,120
I am out of your sight now.

106
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,400
Do you miss me?

107
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,200
What's the matter?

108
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,720
It's nothing.

109
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,760
I swear I took a shower.

110
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,040
It's not that.

111
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,680
Why did you sniff me, then?

112
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,080
I caught a whiff
of something nice from you.

113
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,400
It smells sweet and tender,

114
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,480
and sort of cool.

115
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,520
I see.

116
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,400
That would be bunga rumpai,
a flower sachet used to perfume clothes.

117
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,600
Do you like it?

118
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,640
I do. The scent makes me happy.

119
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,560
Well, then…

120
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,320
Does it smell stronger up close?

121
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,560
"Bonjour."

122
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,400
"Bonsoir."

123
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,320
<i>"Bonne nuit."</i>

124
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,320
Bonjour.

125
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,080
Bonjour.

126
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,440
Bonsoir.

127
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,600
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

128
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,240
Aren't you fluent,

129
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,680
Monsieur Mek?

130
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,320
Would you like to borrow it?

131
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,520
But first, you have to tell me

132
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:25,000
why you want to learn the language.

133
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,600
I never got to go to school.

134
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,760
Listening in on classes is all I can do.

135
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,280
As for why I want to learn it…

136
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,600
Even I don't know that.

137
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,040
I just want to be smarter.

138
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,000
I think knowing
is better than not knowing.

139
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,800
Maybe one day I can be a translator
and work for the government.

140
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,440
What?

141
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,520
You don't believe someone like me
deserves a good job?

142
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,960
I haven't said a thing.

143
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,320
I will lend it to you.

144
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,920
But…

145
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,960
You're a gentleman.

146
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,080
Why do you want to learn muay?

147
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:18,680
Not unlike you, Monsieur Mek,

148
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,000
I also think knowing
is better than not knowing.

149
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,240
Who knows when this might come in handy?

150
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,000
Better yet,

151
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,360
at the upcoming Lent Day festival,

152
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,040
I might even defeat you, Monsieur Mek.

153
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,520
I'm ready.

154
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,800
If you want me to teach you French,

155
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,360
you must teach me muay, Monsieur Mek.

156
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,480
Of course, sir.

157
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,720
I will make sure my lessons
match your kindness.

158
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,160
Lesson one.

159
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,120
The pomelo stalk step.

160
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Ow!

161
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,520
Ow!

162
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,600
Lesson two.

163
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,440
Banana tree steel legs.

164
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,760
-Do it, sir.
-Do it, sir.

165
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
All right!

166
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,520
Next lesson.

167
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,240
Log pulling for strength building.

168
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
-Hurry up!
-Faster!

169
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,520
Faster, faster, faster!

170
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,680
-Hurry up!
-Faster!

171
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,880
Faster! Faster!

172
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,320
-Faster!
-Ugh!

173
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,600
I won't put up with this!

174
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Hey.

175
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,280
That was barely training.

176
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,160
Don't be a baby, sir.

177
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,080
Did you just call me a "baby"?

178
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,560
Hold on.

179
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,600
Lie down.

180
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,640
Lie flat on your back, sir.

181
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,960
Breathe out.

182
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
Careful!

183
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,480
Breathe slowly, sir.

184
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,680
I'll stretch your leg.

185
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,360
Now the other leg.

186
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,480
Breathe out.

187
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,720
This is going to hurt.

188
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
Mek!

189
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,200
It will feel better soon, sir.

190
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,120
You must work on your core strength, sir.

191
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,480
When your midriff is strong,

192
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,600
you won't get hurt so easily.

193
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,480
Does it feel better now?

194
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,359
Yeah. It does.

195
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,000
Careful.

196
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,280
That was clearly a prank on me.

197
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,720
What good would that do me, sir?

198
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,160
You were kind enough not to get me
in trouble for hitting you,

199
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,040
and now you're going to teach me French.

200
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,280
You are a literal angel to me, sir.

201
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,760
You're trying to flatter me
with that praise!

202
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,240
You love to be praised, don't you?

203
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,240
Mek, watch it!

204
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,080
I see you feel better!

205
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,360
Let's get back to training.

206
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,240
Ko. Dang. Help me out!

207
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,880
-Let's go.
-Let's do it.

208
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,680
-Get up, sir.
-Let's go.

209
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,560
Hang on! I don't want to!

210
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,520
No!

211
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,520
No!

212
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,600
I'm all bruised just on my first day.

213
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,400
How does he do it every day?

214
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,600
Breathe out.

215
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,000
This is going to hurt.

216
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,960
It will feel better soon, sir.

217
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,120
I think knowing
is better than not knowing.

218
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,920
Maybe one day I can be a translator
and work for the government.

219
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,800
…now you're going to teach me French.

220
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,600
You are a literal angel to me, sir.

221
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,920
A literal angel…

222
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,240
Why do you want to
take a bath in the river?

223
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,840
I've never done it before,
and it looks like fun.

224
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,520
It seems you only want to play.

225
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,400
Would you like to take a bath too?

226
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,920
I've already taken a shower at home.
Have fun.

227
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,560
Be careful.

228
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,400
Kui.

229
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,600
Take care of your master!

230
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,280
-Hey!
-Let's go!

231
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,800
Kui!

232
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,560
Ugh! Kui!

233
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,760
How can you go ahead before your master?

234
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,120
I'm only making sure
Mr. Rati will be safe!

235
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,640
Get in the water, Mr. Rati!

236
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,480
Please, don't jump in. It's dangerous.

237
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,000
You're not used to the water.

238
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,600
All right.

239
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,680
-Do you need my help with that?
-No. I got it.

240
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,760
It's not too late
to change your mind, Thee.

241
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,000
I will wait for you here.

242
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,760
Go on, Mhay.

243
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,680
Take care of him.

244
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,120
Are you sure, my lord?

245
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,760
Get in!

246
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,680
Oh, Mhay.

247
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,120
I'm going in, Kui.

248
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,600
Watch me, Mr. Rati.

249
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Get out of my way, Kui!

250
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,760
Careful, sir.

251
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,280
Hold on to these, Mr. Rati.

252
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,080
Would you like to try jumping in, sir?

253
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,160
From here?

254
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,400
No, sir.

255
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,440
From up there.

256
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,920
Thee would never allow it.

257
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,120
I believe he will understand, sir.

258
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,560
He will!

259
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,680
Trust me, sir. You should try asking him.

260
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,880
All right. Let's go!

261
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,960
You can do it, sir.

262
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,520
-Go for it!
-Kui, hold these.

263
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,920
-Go for it, sir.
-Go for it.

264
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,880
-You can do it, sir.
-Go, go, go!

265
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,680
Mhay, go and wait for him.

266
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,040
Take care of him, you two!

267
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,080
Thee.

268
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,560
I want to try jumping into the river.

269
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,960
You shouldn't.

270
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,600
You don't know how to jump. It will hurt.

271
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,000
But if you don't let me,

272
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,520
how will I learn how the locals live?

273
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,160
I just want to try it once or twice.

274
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,160
I won't bring it up ever again.

275
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,280
I promise.

276
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:27,960
All right.

277
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,560
If you believe you can do it,
I'll agree to it.

278
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,000
Guys, Thee agreed!

279
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,360
Jump right in, sir!

280
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,480
Kui. Mhay. Move aside!

281
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,080
Let me show you how the French do it.

282
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,880
Let's go, Kui! Come on.

283
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,160
One.

284
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,000
Two.

285
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,200
Ah--

286
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,720
Rati!

287
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,160
Bonjour!

288
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,760
Oh, Mr. Rati!

289
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,720
Don't get out of the water just yet, sir.

290
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,160
I'll fetch you your loincloth.

291
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,280
Thanks, Jam.

292
00:23:58,600 --> 00:23:59,560
Stay still.

293
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,600
Well?

294
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,680
See what happens
when you don't listen to me?

295
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,280
I don't want to hear your lecture.
I'm going inside.

296
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,240
You saw Kui and Mhay.

297
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,440
Did you not notice they hiked up
their loincloths to their thighs?

298
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:18,760
Doing that prevents this from happening.

299
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,240
I'm afraid I can't face anyone now.

300
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,000
You can face me.

301
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,200
I guess you've had enough
of playing in the river?

302
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,880
Are you trying to embarrass me, Thee?

303
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,320
I don't care what you say.

304
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,680
I live just an arm's length away.

305
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,200
I can play again whenever I like.

306
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,800
Are you still being stubborn?

307
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,920
Do not come here alone.

308
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,600
Do not come here with anyone.

309
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,160
If I don't tell you, you'll never know.

310
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,800
You would ignore my good intentions
after seeing how much I worry about you?

311
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,560
Next time,

312
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,800
do not be so careless.

313
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:35,720
Do you realize

314
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,440
how much I care for you?

315
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,440
Mhay.

316
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,120
Can we trust your master?

317
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,880
What are you suggesting?

318
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,000
Is it true that your master
is "that way" inclined?

319
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,640
Jam, don't you dare accuse my lord!

320
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,520
I am only repeating what I heard.

321
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,320
Mr. Rati is naïve and kind.

322
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,320
He doesn't deserve to have
his name smeared.

323
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,400
I agree.

324
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,640
You love your master.

325
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,400
We love ours.

326
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,560
The rumor came from the ladies
my master has turned down.

327
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,160
He is engaged, and to the daughter
of a minister, no less.

328
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,120
Keep that in mind.

329
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,320
-Really?
-Really?

330
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,640
The daughter of a minister?

331
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,040
Just wait until Lent Day and you'll see.

332
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,160
Do you realize

333
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,840
how much I care for you?

334
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,680
Mr. Rati?

335
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,400
Goodness.

336
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,880
You scared me for a second.

337
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,520
What are you doing alone here in the dark?

338
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,120
I came here to think.

339
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,800
Don't worry about me, Jam.
Just go to bed.

340
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,840
Is something troubling you, sir?

341
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,760
It's not exactly troubling me.

342
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,520
I don't quite understand myself
what it is.

343
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,880
Do you want me to help you, sir?

344
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,320
I've been through a lot.

345
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,360
I am more experienced than I look, sir.

346
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,200
I feel strange around Thee.

347
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,560
When he got close to me today,

348
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,520
my heart…

349
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,760
wasn't exactly nervous or startled.

350
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,960
But it felt strange.

351
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
How so, sir?

352
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:27,560
I suddenly felt like I was burning inside
despite being in the water.

353
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:32,920
I felt hollow despite not being dizzy.

354
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,400
I felt…

355
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,720
like if I did not hold on to something,

356
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,720
I might have floated away.

357
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,680
I don't quite know what it means.

358
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,080
Do you, Jam?

359
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,000
Do you know what it is?

360
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,080
I doubt it means anything at all, sir.

361
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,520
You must be overthinking.
Take a good night's rest.

362
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,400
Don't let your mind dwell on it.

363
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,360
Anyway, he is engaged.

364
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,400
He is engaged?

365
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,680
I… am going to bed, sir.

366
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,480
Look, Dech.

367
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,120
This is Duke Kadissorn,
the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

368
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,360
This is Dech,

369
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,560
Mom Luang Dechapatrapee.

370
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,680
My only son.

371
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,160
He's highly interested in Foreign Affairs,

372
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,240
though he had the strange idea of wanting
to start at the Customs Department.

373
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,320
He claimed it would greatly help him
get familiar with foreigners,

374
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,680
which would be helpful for him with his
work in Foreign Affairs in the future.

375
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,240
I do hope to gain your patronage, my lord.

376
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,120
Dech, isn't it?

377
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,440
Why do you want to work
in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?

378
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,560
Ow! My stomach hurts.

379
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,680
-What's wrong?
-Take it, Father.

380
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,560
Excuse me, my lord.

381
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,120
Hey.

382
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:42,840
Baronet?

383
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,360
Baronet!

384
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,560
Dech!

385
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,760
Dech.

386
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,840
Hey! Get out of my way!

387
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,520
Apologies, sir.

388
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,400
Dech.

389
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,600
That good-for-nothing son of mine.

390
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,320
To think I'd see a baronet like you
hiding like a thief.

391
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:34,880
Did my father leave?

392
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,440
He did, sir.

393
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,200
Go.

394
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,920
Go find food, Little Mek.

395
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,240
Where are you going?

396
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,640
Lotus buds are beautiful as they are.

397
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,120
Why must we fold their petals?

398
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,040
We need lotuses that are in full bloom
for offerings.

399
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,800
It symbolizes the determination
to be in full bloom,

400
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,080
which means to be aware and enlightened.

401
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,160
You're not busy today, Thee?

402
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,600
No. It's Lent Day.

403
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,360
Any good Buddhist
must visit a temple today.

404
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,800
I will go to work afterwards.

405
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,800
Don't you have to go with your…

406
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,120
Your fiancée?

407
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,920
It is such an important day.

408
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,240
I believe you should spend it
with your fiancée.

409
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,800
I don't know where you heard that,
or even what you heard.

410
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,360
-But the truth is--
-Master.

411
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,840
Master.

412
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,640
Master.

413
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:47,240
Her Highness, your grandma,
wants to see you, sir.

414
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,640
She insists you must
return home immediately.

415
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,200
I'm afraid I have to go.

416
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,800
Meanwhile,

417
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,160
I ask that you don't jump
to any conclusions.

418
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,960
We will offer water lilies
together tonight.

419
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,120
I will explain everything then.

420
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,840
Wait for me.

421
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,640
Why did he invite me?

422
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,040
I wonder, sir.

423
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,240
Only couples go there.

424
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,640
How can you go with him, sir?

425
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,520
You are not going to go offer water lilies
with him, are you, Mr. Rati?

426
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,080
You're taking your time, sir.

427
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,520
I am here to pick Rati up.

428
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,360
He is not here.

429
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
Where is he?

430
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,560
Jam.

431
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,320
Did you not hear me?

432
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,520
-I did, sir.
-Why didn't you answer me?

433
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,440
My lord,

434
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,920
I respect you

435
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,080
and I love Mr. Rati.

436
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:29,000
Are you sure about this offering?

437
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,760
I don't want you and Mr. Rati
to be in a difficult situation.

438
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,080
Please reconsider, sir.

439
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,960
Jam.

440
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,560
If I were to tell you
I have thoroughly considered it,

441
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,160
what would you say?

442
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:04,520
Will you tell me now where Rati is?

443
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,480
Pardon me, Monsieur Rati.

444
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,640
Thee?

445
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,360
Rati.

446
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,560
Can you please tell him that
I am your guardian,

447
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,640
not a trespasser.

448
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,800
What were you thinking,
barging into a legation after dark?

449
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,080
I wasn't.

450
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,320
I was only thinking of you.

451
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,800
It completely slipped my mind
that this place was a legation.

452
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,040
To think a noble would be mistaken
for a simple thief.

453
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,920
Are you working?

454
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,840
Yes.

455
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,720
I still have a lot of documents
to translate.

456
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,320
Then… I'll wait.

457
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,080
Please, don't.

458
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,640
I want you to come with me
to offer some water lilies.

459
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,760
Just focus on your work.

460
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,960
Don't worry about me. I can wait.

461
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,280
I love waiting.

462
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,360
You must stay where I can see you.

463
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,120
Are you worried about me?

464
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,920
I fear the guards might come
and arrest you again.

465
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,560
Oh, Rati…

466
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,880
I will resume my work now.

467
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,080
Thee.

468
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,520
What time is it, I wonder?

469
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,560
What are you doing walking around?

470
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,320
You saw?

471
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,920
You paced the entire room.
It would be a wonder if I didn't.

472
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,320
It was nothing.

473
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,320
I've just

474
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,200
never seen you when you're working.

475
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,600
When you're working,

476
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,520
you look so serious.

477
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,400
You seem so mature.

478
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,840
I can say the same thing about you.

479
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,880
When you're not working,

480
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,200
you're so fidgety, like a child.

481
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,040
I'm getting back to work.

482
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,200
Thee!

483
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,440
Don't distract someone who is working,

484
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,520
Little Theerathon.

485
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,440
I am not a child.

486
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,600
Sir. Madam.
Would you like some water lilies?

487
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,200
Two flowers for a quarter.

488
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,920
Here, ma'am.

489
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,120
Thank you.

490
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,560
I can't sell this because it's broken.

491
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,720
I'll give it to you, sir.

492
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,440
Stingy.

493
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,720
That will be half a quarter.

494
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,040
Not funny.

495
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,040
I was only joking, sir.

496
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,680
We're friends. Stop calling me "sir."

497
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,040
Are you sure?

498
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,720
Can I call you
"Young Master Dech" instead?

499
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,360
I heard your attendants call you that.

500
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,440
"Young Master" is such an adorable title.

501
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,560
It suits you, sir.

502
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,240
Young Master Dech.

503
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,920
It doesn't sound like
we are friends at all.

504
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,680
Friends don't care for titles.

505
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,120
Would you prefer just your name?

506
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,560
Yes.

507
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,200
Call me simply by my name,
just as I call you by yours.

508
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,400
Dech.

509
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,720
Mek.

510
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,000
If you insist,

511
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,680
Dech.

512
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,120
Let's go, Dech.

513
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,600
Hold on.

514
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,800
Where are we going?

515
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,040
We're going to offer the water lilies
to the Mai Maan Shrine.

516
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,640
It's all right that you're here
without a significant other.

517
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,680
Just think you're praying that you
and your father finally get along.

518
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,280
Or would you rather pray for romance?

519
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:43,320
There are only lotuses,
and no water lilies.

520
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,640
I believe they've all been picked.

521
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,800
We'll try over there.

522
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:53,360
You shouldn't have waited for me.

523
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,680
Your fiancée must be fuming
with impatience right now.

524
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,960
I am not engaged.

525
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,640
But there is a lady my grandmother
wants me to get to know.

526
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:06,560
If it were up to me,

527
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,840
I would rather not be pursuing
a relationship with anyone.

528
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,920
Why not?

529
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,360
I am waiting for someone.

530
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,800
Jam told me only couples
offer water lilies to the Mai Maan Shrine.

531
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,200
So why…?

532
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,040
Yes.

533
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,760
Why indeed?

534
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,160
Water lilies.

535
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,120
Those really are water lilies.
And there are two of them.

536
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,680
I have been blessed.

537
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,200
People are mostly gone.

538
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,840
What's the matter?

539
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,600
Thee.

540
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,920
I think this is where you should
bring your fiancée,

541
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,920
not me.

542
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,800
Why not you?

543
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,400
Because I am…

544
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,680
A man?

545
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:09,760
I've never wanted to give alms
with anyone but you, Rati.

546
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,840
If anyone were to see us…

547
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,080
If anyone were to see us,

548
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,480
they might think
I was trying to seduce you.

549
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,320
Are you afraid of being lumped together
with someone "that way" inclined like me?

550
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,760
Thee.

551
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:36,320
I would never think that.

552
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,200
I'm sorry.

553
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,120
Are you disgusted by me?

554
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,320
I would never be.

555
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,080
I know you're not the kind of person
they say you are.

556
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,720
They're just talking nonsense.

557
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,800
I know you don't care about what they say.

558
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,360
And if I really am what they say I am?

559
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,400
If the only reason I don't care

560
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,840
is because it is all true…

561
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,400
will the rumor still mean nothing to you?

562
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,760
I do not desire women.

563
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,360
I do not care for men.

564
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,200
I never had such notions in my head.

565
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:26,200
But if one day

566
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,000
I were to meet someone
whom my heart desired,

567
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,920
and that person happened to be a man,

568
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,040
not a woman…

569
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,160
would you still say…

570
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,920
you were not disgusted by me?

571
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:36,320
Whoever it is you desire,

572
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,920
I promise to like them.

573
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,280
The person who can captivate your heart

574
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,280
must be someone special, man or woman.

575
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,960
If people still talk badly about you,

576
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:51,520
I promise to defend your honor.

577
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:34,800
My lord?

578
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,520
Is that you, my lord?

579
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,600
-Lord Ruj?
-Go!

580
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:45,800
Leave me be! Go and check them out!

581
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,760
-Yes, sir!
-Hurry!

582
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:56,120
Where is he?

583
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,080
Where has he gone?

584
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,960
You are all useless!

585
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,920
-Father?
-How could you miss them?

586
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,440
Over there!

587
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,560
Who's there?

588
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,520
After them! Go!

589
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,560
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

590
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,320
I guess it is no mere rumor what they say
about your sexuality, is it, my lord?

591
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,680
Dech?

592
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:34,760
Father.

593
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,320
What?

594
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,360
Who are you?

595
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,440
Uh…

596
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,880
The baronet hired me
as his rickshaw-puller.

597
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,360
His lover is very beautiful, sir.

598
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,320
They are perfect for each other.

599
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,440
Sir, do you want to go home now?

600
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:59,640
If not, I must charge you
extra for overtime.

601
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,720
I will go home, then.

602
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,000
I'll see you back at the palace, Father.

603
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,560
What?

604
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,760
What's with him?

605
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:25,520
Where's the count?

606
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:32,520
I believe they're gone.

607
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,680
What was Lord Ruj doing here?

608
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,760
Do you think he saw you?

609
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:40,440
It's all right.

610
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,600
I don't want your reputation ruined.

611
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,920
You're worried about me?

612
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,520
Of course.

613
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:50,040
How much do you worry about me?

614
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:01,920
"The person who can captivate your heart
must be someone special, man or woman."

615
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,080
"Whoever it is you desire,

616
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,640
I promise to like them."

617
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:09,760
Is that so?

618
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,840
You cannot go to the festival
with anyone but me tonight.

619
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,440
It is my sole responsibility
to take you to the festival.

620
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,760
I do want to float a lantern
like everyone else.

621
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,680
<i>Can you come?</i>

622
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,880
My father insisted I must bring some lady
to the festival tonight.

623
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:06,000
Thee.

624
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,440
This is Mom Rajawong Tikumporn Borrirak,
the daughter of Duke Udomsawaddamrong.

625
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:12,960
Thee made this krathong from scratch.
How could he not come?

626
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,040
<i>Right?</i>

627
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,600
