1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,880
<i>I'm well aware that the Siamese</i>
<i>don't like the French much.</i>

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,600
<i>The Siamese are just like the French.</i>

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,840
<i>Some can distinguish between the good</i>
<i>and the bad. Some can't.</i>

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,960
What about you, Thee?
Which kind are you?

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,200
He's nothing but a fatherless lowlife.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,280
A leeching kitchen maid's son.

7
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,160
PREVIOUSLY

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,360
Hey, hold on.

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,920
This is my son, Count Suratheetamtanapich.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,920
Count Suratheetamtanapich.

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,040
THE FRENCH LEGATION

12
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:44,920
Rati?

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:55,360
He is Count Suratheetamtanapich,
the son of Monsieur Steward.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,200
He's the Deputy Minister
of the Ministry of Education

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,880
and a Professor of Literature
at the Civil Servants School.

16
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
Delighted to meet you.

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,040
Likewise, monsieur.

18
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,120
It is a pleasure that Monsieur Rati
and my son are friends.

19
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,320
This is convenient for what I am here
to tell you, Monsieur Lutine.

20
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,960
Rati.

21
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,600
Translate.

22
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,120
A letter from the royal palace
to Ambassador Lutine.

23
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,000
The Siamese government
would like our officials

24
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,960
to learn the language and culture
of our great friends from France.

25
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,120
We have recognized
the expertise of your interpreter

26
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,120
and learned that he was born a Siamese.

27
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,000
Therefore, the Siamese government…

28
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,440
Well?

29
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,840
I would, therefore,
like to suggest that this interpreter

30
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,320
help train and teach Siamese officials
to better master the language

31
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,560
and hope to encourage closer relations

32
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,920
instead of falling behind,
as is the case today.

33
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,160
But why does it have to be Rati, my son?

34
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,560
Why Rati, my own son?

35
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,120
Because Rati is both Siamese and French,

36
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,200
a rare quality to find.

37
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,920
But Rati…

38
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,760
Rati is just an assistant
helping my diplomatic mission.

39
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,840
Once it is completed in Siam,
he will go to another country,

40
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,800
and the departure is fixed in 20 days.

41
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,240
Asking for Rati
is like asking me to leave my son.

42
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,560
Is he to be here to teach the language

43
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,040
or… as a guarantee for Siam?

44
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,000
You married a Siamese.

45
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,400
You are practically our family.

46
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,320
Please do not make such
a malicious assumption.

47
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,840
You are here as allies.

48
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,360
We insist on returning the same sentiment.

49
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,880
We are not forcing your hand
into giving us an answer right away.

50
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,000
There's time before your ship departs.

51
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,440
We hope you do appreciate the value
of the friendship between our two nations.

52
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,560
Theerathon.

53
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,840
Count Suratheetamtanapich.

54
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,080
The diplomatic mission,
as well as the interpreter,

55
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,280
is to remain here
for no more than a month.

56
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,160
To ask for what we did

57
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,640
is not unlike asking them to leave
one of their own men behind.

58
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,880
It hardly seems appropriate.

59
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,720
We simply ask for help.
We're not forcing them into it.

60
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,680
If we had to join their war effort,
as the Entente intends,

61
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,200
this would be advantageous
for both nations.

62
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,840
For how long?

63
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,560
Twelve months starting now.

64
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,480
This is a mission you must complete.

65
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,320
The interpreter
will be under your supervision.

66
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,120
So this is it.

67
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,880
This is what you needed my help with.

68
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,240
I trust you'll do well.

69
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,520
Father.

70
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:55,360
Here is the revised convention brochure.

71
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,280
Wait, Rati.

72
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What do you think about the fact that Siam

73
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,280
wants you to stay here
to teach them the language?

74
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,760
I came here to help you with your work,

75
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,880
and you have the final say
in any decision-making.

76
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,160
Whatever you decide, I will understand.

77
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,400
You can, of course, make the decision.

78
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,960
I don't want to force you.

79
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,560
If you were in my place,
what would you do?

80
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,040
As a diplomat,

81
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,800
I always take my duty and the interests
of the country into account.

82
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:52,160
Personally, I think I see more
advantages than disadvantages

83
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,240
in your staying here
to teach the language.

84
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,160
You don't have to decide now.

85
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,800
Come back and give me an answer within
three weeks, before the ship departs.

86
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,720
You still have time.

87
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,080
<i>I really wasn't expecting</i>
<i>what happened today.</i>

88
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,440
<i>The Mr. Thee that I trusted</i>

89
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,800
<i>turned out to be a man wearing</i>
<i>a mask to befriend me.</i>

90
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,160
<i>Mother Buaphan severed her bond with me.</i>

91
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,080
<i>She did not even embrace me once.</i>

92
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,880
<i>It seems Siam is not a place for me.</i>

93
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,680
<i>Yet, Siam wants me to stay</i>
<i>and teach for a whole year.</i>

94
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,920
<i>I don't know what decision to make.</i>

95
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,760
<i>I wish you'd tell me what to do, Mother.</i>

96
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,520
You told me, didn't you, Mother?

97
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,800
You said there is a solution
to every problem.

98
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,040
Mr. Rati, sir?

99
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,680
Come in, Jam.

100
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,920
Your dinner, sir.

101
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,160
Here. Kui said a guard asked him
to pass this on to you.

102
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,640
<i>I would like to explain myself.</i>

103
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,560
<i>I believe you are resentful of me</i>
<i>due to several matters.</i>

104
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,000
<i>I will wait at the dock until 10:00 p.m.</i>

105
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,800
<i>I do hope you give me a chance to explain.</i>

106
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,120
<i>Theerathon.</i>

107
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,320
Mr. Rati.

108
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,280
Count Suratheetamtanapich.

109
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,880
Please cease acting like
a commoner in front of me.

110
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,240
I was stupid to have believed you, sir.

111
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,120
That wasn't the case, Mr. Rati.

112
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,600
Do not get up here, sir.

113
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,440
If you do, I will take it that
you are intruding on foreign soil.

114
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,000
I will gladly get arrested for it.

115
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,000
But, please, let me speak.

116
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,680
I'm sorry for not telling you
who I was from the beginning,

117
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,800
but I never wished to use my title
to take advantage of you.

118
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,800
I simply wanted to know you as a…

119
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,920
You intentionally concealed your identity.

120
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,400
But…

121
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,000
I meant to tell you.

122
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,160
It was all my fault.

123
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,760
I was a coward and selfish.

124
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,880
I was afraid you would
distance yourself from me if you knew.

125
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
Please, sir.

126
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,040
You are wasting your time
explaining anything to me.

127
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,000
From today onward,

128
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,920
I am responsible for overseeing
your stay here in Siam

129
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,280
for the next 12 months.

130
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,120
I must thank you

131
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,480
for the clarification.

132
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,920
From now on,

133
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,040
you and I are no longer friends.

134
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,040
So, please, do not send me
any more unofficial letters.

135
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,520
It is extremely inappropriate.

136
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,800
One more thing.

137
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,520
I did not agree
to accept the teaching post.

138
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,840
Father has given me
full authority on the matter.

139
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,640
It seems I have, just now,
made my decision.

140
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,000
Listen. Take all the documents
and leave nothing behind.

141
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,040
Yes, sir.

142
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,440
Father.

143
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,480
Can I have a moment?

144
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,920
I'm going to fetch a ride.

145
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,040
Hurry up before we're late. Go on.

146
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,160
Oh?

147
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
Where are you going?

148
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,360
Mhay? My lord?

149
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,760
I am here to see Mr. Rati.

150
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,920
They all left, sir.

151
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,440
Who? Where?

152
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,320
The ship arrived earlier than expected.

153
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,800
Mr. Lutine and his mission
will leave Siam today.

154
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,040
They all left for the harbor, sir.

155
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,680
Mr. Rati included.

156
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,520
Did he not tell you, sir?

157
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,640
What?

158
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,520
Master!

159
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,040
Hey! Make way!

160
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,680
Master!

161
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,880
Mr. Rati!

162
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,680
Sir?

163
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,120
Would you really leave
without saying a word?

164
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,240
Without a single goodbye.

165
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,680
That is enough, sir.

166
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,200
You should explain this to your friend.

167
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,040
Yes, Father.

168
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,840
Here.

169
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,480
Good luck, Rati.

170
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:45,720
Take care.

171
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,600
And see you soon.

172
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:55,920
Good luck, Rati.

173
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,480
You…

174
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,520
You're not leaving?

175
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,800
If I do,

176
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,600
who is going to teach French?

177
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,840
Please, sir.

178
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,720
I have the place repaired and cleaned up.

179
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,400
If there is anything else you need,
I am here at your disposal.

180
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,480
Thank you, sir,
for letting me impose on you.

181
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,600
Please speak to me like usual.

182
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,160
Call me Thee.

183
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,680
Please don't act like we have
never been friends like this.

184
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,800
I truly cannot act
any other way with you, sir.

185
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,760
I am just a French teacher.

186
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,080
Please, sir,

187
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,760
try to understand my position.

188
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,440
That doesn't mean we can't talk as friends
the way we did before.

189
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,920
We should both focus on our own duties.

190
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
It is better that way, sir.

191
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,360
I will take good care of you.

192
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,880
No matter what your opinion is of me,

193
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,080
I'll always be the same Thee
you met that first day.

194
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,880
I mean it genuinely.

195
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,640
How I miss Kui and Jam.

196
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,280
Oh, that is a handful, sir.

197
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,200
Let me help.

198
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,400
Kui?

199
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,920
Why are you here?

200
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,120
Your morning coffee, sir.

201
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Jam?

202
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,200
What are you both doing here?

203
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,840
Hot coffee, Mr. Rati.

204
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,520
Two cups of coffee just for me?

205
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,520
Soft-boiled eggs too.

206
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,800
The other set is mine.

207
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,960
I asked Jam and Kui to be here with you.

208
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,160
You barely speak to me, and have no one
to talk to when you're alone.

209
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,800
I feared you might go mute,

210
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,680
which would prevent you
from fulfilling your duty as a teacher.

211
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
Watch it.

212
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,000
Coffee, sir.

213
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,760
I believe it is
just the right temperature now.

214
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,280
CIVIL SERVANTS SCHOOL

215
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,480
Mhay, where should I put this?

216
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,160
Just leave it over there.

217
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,440
Come help me set up the desks for now.

218
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,160
- All right.
- Get the broken ones out of the room.

219
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,120
Come on here.

220
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,760
Come on.

221
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,360
Ready?

222
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
Careful.

223
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,920
Sorry.

224
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,880
Oops.

225
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,560
Mhay.

226
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,040
Thank you for recommending me for the job.

227
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,000
Just be good and diligent.

228
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,800
Don't let my Master down.

229
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,760
You might get to keep the job
for a long time.

230
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,320
It is better to get paid without risking
your life, don't you think?

231
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,840
Of course.

232
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,840
Whatever you want,
Mek is at your disposal!

233
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,240
I won't let you down, Mhay--

234
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,440
Mr. Mhay.

235
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,440
I'll keep an eye on you.

236
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,560
Oh.

237
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,960
You got yourself a new helping hand, Mhay.

238
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,160
Yes, sir.

239
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,120
That's good.

240
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,680
Stay in your post, young man.

241
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,240
Don't leave quickly like the last one.

242
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,200
Did he die?

243
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,840
As if!

244
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,920
The last guy sneaked into classes
and listened in.

245
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,640
Once he knew enough of the language,

246
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,800
he got a job as a news translator.

247
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,760
He's doing well now, I heard.

248
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,360
Don't you follow his example.

249
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,600
Just stay and do the job long-term.

250
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,560
Understood?

251
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,640
Do they hire news translators often, sir?

252
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,160
They do, I believe.

253
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,080
Ow! Mr. Mhay!

254
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,760
Go. Get working.

255
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,600
The gentlemen
will be studying here tomorrow.

256
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,640
- That hurts.
- It was supposed to!

257
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,880
Hurry up!

258
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,640
Yeesh!

259
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,760
Does Mr. Rati require anything other than
what we have arranged for him?

260
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,480
Nothing, so far.

261
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,160
You should hurry up to class.
Today is the first day, isn't it?

262
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,920
Yes.

263
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,960
Mr. Rati is here as our nation's guest.

264
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,760
You should attend his class.

265
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,600
In case of any trouble,
we will be the first to know.

266
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,640
Of course, Father.

267
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,680
Hold on.

268
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,920
Can you pass this on to your brother?

269
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,720
Father.

270
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,760
The Little House is practically next door.
Won't you visit it?

271
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,960
You know how I hate answering
your Grandmother's questions.

272
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,200
Hurry up and go.

273
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,000
Well, go on.

274
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:34,480
CIVIL SERVANTS SCHOOL

275
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,280
I hope my first day of work goes smoothly,

276
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,200
successfully,

277
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
and is of service to everyone involved.

278
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,200
Keep me in your prayers, Mother.

279
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,560
Hey.

280
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,720
Keep up with my pace.

281
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,560
I am.

282
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,000
It's just a lesson.
No need to look so downtrodden.

283
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,040
This is better than
your usual dilly-dallying.

284
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,520
It's full of palace officials
and higher-ups.

285
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,840
Get in their circle,
and it will be useful to you later on.

286
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,920
Don't you know anything?

287
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,880
And you're supposed to be in class
when I can't attend it myself.

288
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,000
Father?

289
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,680
What's with him?

290
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,800
Rati?

291
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,200
Hello.

292
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,720
Hold on.

293
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,160
Didn't your father leave?

294
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:00,960
Why didn't you go with him?

295
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,760
What are you doing here?

296
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,080
Sir, I'm…

297
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,560
Monsieur Rati Dier.

298
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,880
The French professor and representative
of the French diplomatic mission.

299
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,520
Professor Rati.

300
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,960
Let me introduce you
to the honorary student.

301
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,400
His Royal Highness
Prince Krom Phraya Pijitpaibool.

302
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,600
Simply call me Mai, Professor.

303
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,720
You're a very young man.

304
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,800
If there is any error
in the teaching of mine…

305
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,000
…in my teaching,

306
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,720
I apologize for it in advance,
Your Highness.

307
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,320
You speak Siamese perfectly.

308
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,560
Hey.

309
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,200
He was a servant in my kitchen, sir.

310
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,360
He was just lucky a foreigner adopted him.

311
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,240
Father.

312
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,280
Please, be quiet.

313
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,800
What?

314
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,000
We will begin with basic greetings.

315
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,200
"Bonjour" means "hello."

316
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,040
Please repeat after me.

317
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,280
Bonjour.

318
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,920
Bonjour.

319
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,200
Repeat after me. Bonjour.

320
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,160
Bonjour.

321
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Bonsoir.

322
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,720
Bonsoir.

323
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,880
Repeat after me. Bonsoir.

324
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,880
Bonsoir.

325
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,400
Bon… Bonsoir?

326
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
Bre…

327
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,920
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

328
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,320
Bre… Bre… brie?

329
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,320
Bons…

330
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,200
- What does that mean?
- Bonsoir.

331
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,000
Now we will try to say the words
with a French pronunciation.

332
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,640
Bonjour.

333
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,480
Bonjour.

334
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,440
Bonsoir.

335
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,720
Bonsoir.

336
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,320
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

337
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,640
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

338
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,520
Everybody knows what "bonjour,"
"bonsoir," and "bonne nuit" mean.

339
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,440
What are you even teaching?
This is a waste of time.

340
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,000
Father! How could you say such a thing?

341
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,480
Shut up.

342
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,240
What? What are you looking at?

343
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,080
Don't you understand Thai?

344
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,360
Before you can be anyone's teacher,

345
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,640
you must learn your place in the world.

346
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,000
A servant like you
should be on your knees.

347
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,840
How dare you stand above
the noble gentlemen in this room?

348
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,360
Father! Please stop.

349
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,440
Baron Wijit.

350
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,880
Please watch your manners.

351
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,080
What Mom Rajawong Rujrapeepat
said was not wrong.

352
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,240
But I am standing here

353
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,400
as a diplomatic representative

354
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,040
who has been appointed to
this important post by the royal palace.

355
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,240
I am not at liberty to neglect my duty.

356
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,240
I ask that you, Baron Wijitphakorn,

357
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,480
have patience and put up with it.

358
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,280
If you truly are unsatisfied,

359
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,720
you are free to file a complaint
with your ministry.

360
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,680
I shall gladly cross your name
off the list of my students.

361
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,840
How dare you?!

362
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,720
Shall we get back to the lesson?

363
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,080
Should we wait until you remove yourself
from this class, sir?

364
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,840
My apologies, Your Highness.

365
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,960
"Bonsoir" is a greeting for the evening.

366
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,200
There is another common word,

367
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,080
<i>"salut,"</i>

368
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,800
which means the same thing,

369
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,240
though it is often used
among close friends.

370
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,760
Moving on.

371
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,960
Bonne nuit.

372
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,080
- Bre…
- Bonne nuit.

373
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,200
Bonne nuit.

374
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,720
Bre… brie?

375
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,440
Bonjour.

376
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,080
- What?
- Bonjour.

377
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,160
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

378
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,200
Bonjour.

379
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,120
We will now have a recess.

380
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,560
The class will resume
at ten in the morning.

381
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,360
<i>Salut…</i> Bonsoir.

382
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,760
Bon… What now?

383
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,000
Mek, focus!

384
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,000
Bon… Bonsoir.

385
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,840
Bon… <i>Salut.</i> Bon.

386
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,719
- Crap!
- Oh!

387
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:28,080
My apologies!
I didn't mean to startle you, sir!

388
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,159
- You!
- You!

389
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,360
What are you doing here?

390
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,280
Hey!

391
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,400
Listen here, you servant.

392
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,960
- Professor Rati.
- Are you trying to--

393
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:48,719
I'm afraid I need some clarification
on the three words you just taught.

394
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,159
Can you explain them to me a little more?

395
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:54,440
All these "bon's" sound so similar.

396
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,720
Let go of me.
You don't need to grab me so tightly.

397
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,720
"Bon-bon, jour-jour."
What even is it?

398
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,640
Dech, recess!

399
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,520
That servant boy.

400
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,280
You are one hardworking man.

401
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:30,880
Not only are you a rickshaw-puller,
but also a caretaker at school?

402
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,200
Are you saving up to be a millionaire?

403
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,880
Silence.

404
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,880
Hey.

405
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,920
Did you hear me?

406
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,480
What is your name?

407
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,320
Mek. My name is Mek, sir.

408
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,600
Would you attend class in my place?

409
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,960
The first class was so boring
that I had no choice but to ditch it.

410
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,560
You should learn something
when you can, Young Master.

411
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,720
I envy you.

412
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,440
I want to learn, to be smart,

413
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,800
but alas, I was born a commoner,

414
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,080
so I never had a chance to choose.

415
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,840
My name is Dech.

416
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,600
Call me "mister," not "young master."

417
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,880
Why did you stop?

418
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,720
- Grandma.
- Yeah?

419
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,880
You gotta be thankful for Mr. Dech.

420
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,120
He was kind enough to let me help you.

421
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,280
Are you comfortable, ma'am?

422
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,760
Entirely.

423
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,600
Careful with my stuff, young man.

424
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,480
You're going to the temple, aren't you?

425
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,480
Yes. Just up ahead.

426
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,080
- Go on.
- All right.

427
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,120
Here we go.

428
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,520
Pull over. Right here.

429
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,120
- We're here.
- Right here?

430
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,360
- Yes.
- All right.

431
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,000
Let me help.

432
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,120
Be careful, ma'am.

433
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,520
Careful.

434
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,280
All right. All right.

435
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,280
Good.

436
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,960
- Here are your things.
- All right.

437
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,160
Whoa.

438
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,640
Thank you, both of you.

439
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,240
I'll carry the rest inside myself.

440
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,400
Of course.

441
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,680
Bye.

442
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
Did your body go numb, sir?

443
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,280
I won't tell anyone.

444
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,360
Are you ready?

445
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,680
Here.

446
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,440
That is too much, sir.

447
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,400
It's for the old lady
and your wage for the day.

448
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,200
Take all of it.

449
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,480
I just want the rickshaw fare, sir.

450
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,120
I said take it.

451
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,160
Spend it on some medicine.

452
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,920
Chewing on cloves
only makes your breath smell.

453
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,760
Here is yours.

454
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,960
It smells unique.

455
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,040
I recognize it.

456
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,680
I know you're that muay fighter.

457
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,440
No, sir.

458
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,480
- It wasn't me, sir--
- Chew on that.

459
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,320
You're in trouble, Mek.

460
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,880
DÉSOLÉ = SORRY

461
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,080
Let me help.

462
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,040
I'm almost done. I don't need help.

463
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,960
What does "désolé" mean?

464
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,760
I wrote it.

465
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,720
I will erase it.

466
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,080
- Let me help.
- No.

467
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,600
- Let me.
- Let go!

468
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:44,640
I'm sorry.

469
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,320
Give me another chance to be your friend.

470
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,600
What must I do to get you to give me
a second chance, Professor?

471
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,000
I'm exhausted.

472
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,280
See you in class tomorrow, sir.

473
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,840
Mr. Rati is back.

474
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,160
Hello, sir.

475
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,800
How was your day?

476
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,840
I'm all drained, Jam.

477
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,280
I'll go fetch a drink and some fruit
so you can feel refreshed.

478
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,640
Here is your cold drink and fruit, sir.

479
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,160
Mr. Rati?

480
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,680
Are you asleep?

481
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,240
Mr. Rati?

482
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,520
Mr. Rati.

483
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,320
Mr. Rati, sir.

484
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,920
Is he dead?

485
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,600
What in the deuce did you say!

486
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,520
He is only asleep.

487
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,640
He's way too still to be sleeping.

488
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,760
That's probably how a proper
gentleman takes a nap!

489
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,880
You're taking a nap out here?

490
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,320
You'll be mosquitoes' dinner, Professor.

491
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,640
- Sir?
- Sir?

492
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,760
What is the matter with Rati?

493
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,120
He would not wake up no matter
how many times I called him.

494
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,400
It's going to get dark soon, sir.

495
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,840
To think he exerted himself so much
that he developed a fever…

496
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,920
- Sir!
- Sir!

497
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:51,520
Kui, follow them!

498
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,840
You come with me!

499
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,600
Kui, do you think they…?

500
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:35,840
No way.

501
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,120
You are imagining things.

502
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,320
I am not!

503
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,640
Did you not see the way
he carried Mr. Rati just now?

504
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,360
I did. I'm sure it's nothing.

505
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,680
What are you doing?

506
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,360
Please stay still.

507
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,560
You have a very high fever.

508
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,520
No. I'm fine.

509
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,080
Don't be stubborn. You have a bad fever,
and if we don't wipe your body,

510
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,640
it will only get worse.

511
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,600
Come. Let me help.

512
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,520
It will make you feel better.

513
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,000
Do you believe me now?

514
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,240
Be patient.

515
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,160
We're almost done.

516
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,920
Why do you treat
a commoner's son like me so well?

517
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,920
You're a gentleman.

518
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,520
Listen to me.

519
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:34,240
I don't get to choose when and with whom
I will have good feelings.

520
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:45,360
I just did. With you.

521
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:49,080
Will you give me another chance?

522
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,280
It's all right.

523
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,400
I won't give up.

524
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,280
I will prove my sincerity
so you'll accept me again.

525
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,040
NEXT EPISODE

526
00:46:54,120 --> 00:46:55,560
If you don't stop holding back,

527
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,160
I'll have my father
get you fired from work.

528
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:01,160
A poor man like me doesn't get to choose.

529
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,560
But you get a chance to choose,

530
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,040
so you should choose well, sir.

531
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,040
Mr. Rati.

532
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,920
That is "Professor" to you.

533
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
<i>I simply want you to be my friend.</i>
<i>Someone who stays by my side.</i>

534
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,520
What do you want me to call you?

535
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,440
Call me

536
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,240
by my name.
