1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,560
"Viscount Rati Jarupich"?

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:05,640
Your title has been published
in the Royal Gazette.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,800
You were born of a kitchen maid!

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:10,840
Even if you have no respect for me,
at least respect His Majesty's judgement.

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,320
How dare you lecture me?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,800
Father!

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,920
-Are you going to deliberately lose?
-I…

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,320
PREVIOUSLY

9
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,920
-Mek!
-Hey! Stop it!

10
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,360
Mek? Mek!

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,320
I, Count Suratheetamtanapich,
solemnly swear.

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,680
Will you pass this on to Mr. Tiwa?

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,720
Tell him it's homework
from Professor Rati.

14
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,080
Of course.

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,560
What are you doing?

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,520
I'm doing…

17
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,480
RATI, THEE

18
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,520
Mr. Rati.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,040
Mr. Rati, sir.

20
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,160
The count has been detained at home
by his princess grandmother, sir.

21
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,600
He's been tasked with the job
of accompanying his betrothed everywhere.

22
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,800
How do you know, Kui?

23
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,520
I met Mhay at the market, sir.

24
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,880
CIVIL SERVANTS SCHOOL

25
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,960
Baron Wijit and his son are absent again.

26
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,160
Baron?

27
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,920
He's a baronet now.

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,960
Oh, right.

29
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,160
Who would have the face to show up
after being demoted?

30
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,080
Our professor is here.

31
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,200
We will be learning to converse
in an official setting today, sirs.

32
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,200
The deputy minister has also been absent.

33
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,360
It is quite normal for a groom-to-be
to have his hands full.

34
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,960
I suppose he must be busy taking care
of the minister's daughter.

35
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,120
Theerathon is on business leave.

36
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,960
He has been gone for several days.
His business must be elsewhere.

37
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,120
He must be out of town,

38
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,480
with his fiancée, perhaps, Your Highness?

39
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,680
Enough surmising about others.
Let's focus on the lesson.

40
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,440
Yes, Your Highness.

41
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,600
Shall we begin?

42
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,600
Excuse me.

43
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,800
Yes?

44
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,080
-Is Mek here today?
-He isn't, sir.

45
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,640
Do you know where he lives?

46
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,280
I don't, sir.

47
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,160
But I heard he works at the grocer's
at the end of the market.

48
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,640
SENG CHAROEN

49
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,720
Mek! Mek!

50
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,080
Mek.

51
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,720
Mek.

52
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,400
Mek!

53
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,480
I told you to put
the palm sugar over here.

54
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,160
I'm trying to count it.
What were you doing moving the rice?

55
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,520
Don't you see?

56
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,800
You mean these buckets, sir?

57
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,480
Yes.

58
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,400
Who are you?

59
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,080
-Should I move them all inside?
-Yes.

60
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,000
All of them?

61
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,600
Who are you?

62
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,200
Huh?

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,680
Move. This is heavy.

64
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,000
Hey.

65
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,200
Who are you?

66
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,840
Dech.

67
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,560
Is he your friend?

68
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,880
Yes.

69
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,760
-On top of that.
-On top of that?

70
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,120
Let go.

71
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,280
Let go.

72
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,760
Whoa.

73
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,480
Over here. Hurry up.

74
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,800
Careful.

75
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,080
Five sacks of rice.

76
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,320
Deliver them to Number 25 on Si Phraya.

77
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,960
How on earth do you carry this?

78
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,120
Be careful.

79
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:05,640
Take two buckets of palm sugar
to Sampheng.

80
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,680
Go on.

81
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,520
On your shoulder.

82
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,920
Let me.

83
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,200
I'll go.

84
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,040
Mek.

85
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,320
Is he your friend?

86
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,320
He's a hardworking young man.

87
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,480
Why don't you bring him to work every day?

88
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
Well?

89
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,560
He's good.

90
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,160
Hold my hand.

91
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,280
Thee, we could crash.

92
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,840
I would never allow that.

93
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,800
Come.

94
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,720
Oh, Thee.

95
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Steady.

96
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,400
See?

97
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,000
All you need to do is have faith in me.

98
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,200
I will never let go of your hand,
no matter what.

99
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,480
Thee.

100
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,480
-Mai.
-Are you on your way home, Rati?

101
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,760
Yes. Your Highness.

102
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,200
"Your Highness"?

103
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,280
I mean…

104
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,240
Yes, Mai.

105
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,159
An evening stroll is surely delightful.

106
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,840
It is breezy enough for a pleasant walk.

107
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,720
Indeed.

108
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,880
It is the perfect weather for kite-flying.

109
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,520
Kites!

110
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,920
Are you in a hurry to go home, Rati?

111
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,440
I'm ready now.

112
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,840
-I'll count to three.
-Umm.

113
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,040
One, two, three.

114
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,320
Let go.

115
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Run, Rati, run.
Keep running.

116
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,000
Pull the string, Rati.

117
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,560
Let's try again.

118
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,680
Thank you.

119
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,120
It's all right, Rati. We can try again.

120
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,880
I'll make sure it catches
the wind this time.

121
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:22,480
One, two, three. Let go.

122
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,360
Pull the string, Rati.

123
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,920
You must run.

124
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,320
The wind here in Bangkok is unlike
the wind in Paris.

125
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,160
I should think the winds are
the same everywhere.

126
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,480
Let me show you.

127
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,200
Step back.

128
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,360
One, two, three.

129
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,400
Let go.

130
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,360
It caught the wind, all right.

131
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,160
Wow!

132
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,560
Now you try it.

133
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,200
I'll only fail again.

134
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,320
Be patient.

135
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,600
Make sure the string is tight
when the kite is let loose.

136
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,920
Patiently pull the string.

137
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,400
Patiently loosen the length.

138
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,640
Are you ready?

139
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,400
Yes.

140
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,040
One, two, three.

141
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,600
-Let go. Go on.
-Let's go!

142
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,040
-It's up! It is up!
-You did it, Rati.

143
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,080
Slowly. Slowly.

144
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,360
I got it to fly!

145
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,760
Well done, Rati.

146
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,040
I did it.

147
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,200
That's how you fly a kite. Let's take
a little break before we continue.

148
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,360
Sir.

149
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,680
I am here to take the professor home,
Your Highness.

150
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,960
Give it to me.

151
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,880
What now? I'm almost done.

152
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,280
It's my job.

153
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,120
Look how messy you are.
Go home.

154
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,120
I can do it.

155
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,720
Don't be so stubborn.

156
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,840
Let go!

157
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,960
Your hearing is no good!
I'll do it, so let go!

158
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,800
Mek, you mule!

159
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,360
We're done.

160
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,800
Go home.

161
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,680
My ears will get better eventually.

162
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,600
You need to stop meddling. Go!

163
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,760
That's not true.

164
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,360
Your ears aren't working properly.

165
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,960
Can you hear me?

166
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,680
Can you hear me?

167
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,520
Can you? Can you hear me at all?

168
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,160
I can hear you just fine!

169
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,040
What's the ruckus?

170
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,240
Mek.

171
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,560
Go and deliver one sack of sticky rice
to Tue's around the corner.

172
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,080
Mek.

173
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,920
Can you hear me?

174
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,560
See? Can you hear what the boss says?

175
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,200
Of course I can!

176
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,680
Sir.

177
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,760
What was that you were saying?

178
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,400
What? You just said you could hear me.

179
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,160
-One sack of sticky rice, is it?
-Yes.

180
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,560
See? He heard.

181
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,080
Dech!

182
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,920
That's my job!

183
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,280
You seemed very happy.

184
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,360
I had a lot of fun flying a kite today.

185
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,400
Had you been here sooner, I might have
asked you to compete with me.

186
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,880
Prince Mai sure takes good care of you.

187
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,520
I guess I'm now useless
and can leave the job to him.

188
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,440
-How could you say that?
-I simply spoke the truth.

189
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,760
If you insist.

190
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,040
You were on leave
and absent for a whole week.

191
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,320
You must have had some important business
that I didn't need to know about.

192
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,280
Yes.

193
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,120
I have an errand to attend to.

194
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,480
I must take my leave

195
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,240
with the professor.

196
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,720
Uh, I…

197
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,200
Your reputation precedes you.

198
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,480
I heard you never lose
a single game of chess, my lord.

199
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,200
Won't you play with me

200
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,960
since you're already here?

201
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,200
Maybe next time, Your Highness.

202
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,760
Don't you want to see, Professor?

203
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,880
I find betting quite thrilling,

204
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,560
especially with friends
and a prize at stake.

205
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,320
Please, my lord.

206
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,320
Would you be up for a bet?

207
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,040
What are we betting, Your Highness?

208
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,920
The professor, perhaps.

209
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,440
If I win, the professor stays with me.
I will bring him home safely.

210
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,120
If you win, you are free to take him away.

211
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,600
Do you accept the terms, or do you not?

212
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,520
I accept, Your Highness.

213
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,800
When it comes to what you hold most dear…

214
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,240
you never let me win, sir.

215
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,800
Hardly, Your Highness.

216
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,040
It was all luck
that I won this time around.

217
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,240
I do hope you keep your word.

218
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,800
See?

219
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,240
Keep me around, and I can be your ears.

220
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,200
Curse you!

221
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,160
You truly are infuriating.

222
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,520
Sir, two mantou, please.

223
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,280
Hold on. Give me four.

224
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,520
Of course.

225
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,960
Two bajang, please.

226
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,720
Here.

227
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,720
Here you go.

228
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,760
-It's hot, so be careful.
-Here's the money.

229
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,040
Here.

230
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,960
What are you doing?

231
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,440
I don't like the fillings in the bajang.

232
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,280
You eat it. Here.

233
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,480
This works out perfectly, then!

234
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,120
Here. Take this.

235
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,480
Now this is a delicacy. Got it.

236
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,240
Wow!

237
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,680
You've never tried it?

238
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,800
No.

239
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,680
I chose not to.

240
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,440
It's too expensive.

241
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,640
I prefer mantou. I get more for the same
price, and it keeps me full for longer.

242
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,800
What about you?

243
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,120
Why won't you have it?

244
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,400
You bought it.

245
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,600
Did you buy it for me?

246
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,400
Just eat it.

247
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,640
My bajang!

248
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,240
Mek!

249
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,200
Save yourself first, why don't you?

250
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,960
My bajang…

251
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,600
Where are you taking me?

252
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,680
Somewhere.

253
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,000
Why won't you tell me?

254
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,200
Are you happy I won that chess game
against Prince Mai?

255
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,200
What?

256
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,840
What are you smiling about?

257
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,120
I am happy.

258
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
Thank you.

259
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,160
Whose house is this?

260
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,160
My lord?

261
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,080
-My lord!
-Mom!

262
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,200
I've missed you so much.

263
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,560
Are you hurt? Do you need me
to take you to the hospital?

264
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,960
I'm sorry.

265
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,800
I didn't mean to do what I did.

266
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:30,400
I miss you and think of you all the time.
I care for you more than my own life.

267
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,200
If I had remained there,
you would have kept coming to see me,

268
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,120
and that would have
caused trouble for you.

269
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,600
Do you understand me?

270
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,920
Mom.

271
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,200
No, don't.

272
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,480
Who is this, Mom?

273
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,280
Joi.

274
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,080
This is Buaphuen,
the woman who gave birth to you.

275
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,120
This woman was your mother, not me.

276
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,640
I have been waiting to tell you the truth.

277
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,600
24 years ago,

278
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,080
my younger sister, Buaphuen,
got herself pregnant.

279
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,000
She was a sickly woman,

280
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:49,440
so I helped her take care of you.

281
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,240
Not long after giving birth,

282
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,240
she passed away,

283
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,880
leaving only her little boy
and this house.

284
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,760
The little boy was so small,

285
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,520
so I called him Joi.

286
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,360
You understand now, don't you?

287
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,320
Your mother is Buaphuen.

288
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,120
Mother Buaphuen.

289
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,960
Mother Buaphan.

290
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,160
I am your aunt, not your mother.

291
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,600
I am the luckiest man in the world

292
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,800
to have had three mothers loving me.

293
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,440
Rati, what are you doing?

294
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,880
Please let me show my proper gratitude
for what you did for me.

295
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,080
I don't know how else to repay you.

296
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,360
I told you.

297
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,800
I'll do everything possible
to make you happy.

298
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,840
That's all I want.

299
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,440
Don't ever do that again.

300
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,920
Oh, my dear,

301
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,000
put on a smile.

302
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,080
As long as you have faith in me,

303
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,600
no matter what happens,

304
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,320
I will never give up.

305
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,640
All right.

306
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,560
Mom, let me help.

307
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,680
Be careful. It's hot.

308
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,600
You share your meal with him.
I'll eat in the kitchen.

309
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,160
I won't allow it.

310
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,560
You share the meal with us.

311
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,280
But how can I sit at the same level
as a count and a viscount, sir?

312
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,520
I would never do that.

313
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,960
Please.

314
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,120
You are now Viscount Rati Jarupich's
respectable relative, Aunt Buaphan.

315
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,520
You are no longer anyone's servant.

316
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,360
Get used to it.

317
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,880
Please.

318
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,000
Please, Mom.

319
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,680
Aunt Buaphan.

320
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,360
I have one thing to ask.

321
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,200
Yes?

322
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,760
From now on,

323
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,680
will you please think of me as
another one of your sons?

324
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,760
That is impossible, sir.

325
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,520
I am just an old commoner. I'll definitely
go to hell if I don't know my place.

326
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,960
You and I are both human beings.

327
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,760
We have the same dignity and humanity.

328
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,600
Titles and statuses are
nothing but pretense.

329
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,560
Please, Mother Buaphan?

330
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,520
Of… of course.

331
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,800
Thank you,

332
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,200
Mother Buaphan.

333
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,480
All right. Shall we eat?

334
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:18,760
Here.

335
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,480
This is mine.

336
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,040
I'll let you borrow it.

337
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,080
Thanks.

338
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,760
My bed is small.

339
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,520
Will that work for you?

340
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,040
If not, you can change your mind
and go home.

341
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,960
I don't want to go home right now.

342
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,560
My father has been demoted.

343
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,440
He's still in denial and raging around.

344
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,880
It's a headache.

345
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,440
If the bed works for you, it works for me.

346
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,320
It's so hot.

347
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,160
Can't you sleep properly?

348
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,320
Mek, be quiet.

349
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,880
I said be quiet.

350
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,280
What did you do?

351
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,120
Did you bite me?

352
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,200
No.

353
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,000
You bit me. I know you did.

354
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,720
I did bite you once.
But I didn't bite you just now.

355
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,200
What did you do, then?

356
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,400
Why did you kiss me?

357
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,920
I wanted to.

358
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,040
Is there a problem?

359
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,520
What are you doing?

360
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,400
What?

361
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,280
I'm kissing my friend,
the way people kiss their pets.

362
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,120
What's the big deal?

363
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,200
Dech.

364
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,880
What?

365
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,440
I have no problems with that.

366
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,920
Mek!

367
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,440
Are you…?

368
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,880
Now we're even, Dech.

369
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,920
We're not even at all.

370
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,920
Thank Mhay for me for the clothes.

371
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,640
I got us a mosquito net.

372
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,800
Let me help.

373
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,000
Do you know how to set up a mosquito net?

374
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,760
No.

375
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,360
Let's work together.

376
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,360
All right.

377
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,440
Take this string
and secure it over the bed.

378
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,360
All right.

379
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,560
Thee.

380
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,160
Like this?

381
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,120
Tighter.

382
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,400
Pull the string tighter.

383
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Tighter…

384
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,320
We're done.

385
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,200
Are you sure you can sleep
in a place like this?

386
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,080
If you sleep here, I sleep here.

387
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,440
I can sleep anywhere
as long as you're with me.

388
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,440
Are we going to bed already?

389
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,159
Thee.

390
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,880
Stay still.

391
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,400
I want to keep having you in my arms
for a little longer.

392
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,080
Let's stay like this all day then.

393
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,920
Wait for me.

394
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,040
You can let go now. Someone could see us.

395
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,880
I told you I'd never let go of your hand.

396
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,640
If anyone has something to say,
I'll be the only one to blame.

397
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,440
Mom.

398
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,600
Did you go to the market?

399
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,640
Thee and I…

400
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,320
got some vegetables for you.

401
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,680
You have a very bountiful garden.

402
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,320
Take care of each other.

403
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,440
"This is a navaratna ring."

404
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,720
"I would be more than happy if you were
to give it to someone you love, son."

405
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,120
Who would be so lucky?

406
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,320
Could we still be friends
if I were to tell you

407
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,640
I fancy you?

408
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,240
What have you done to my son?

409
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,680
Mek!

410
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,920
You lowlife! Stay away from my son!

411
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,680
I won't allow my grandson
and the Wisut family

412
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,840
to be ruined by you.
