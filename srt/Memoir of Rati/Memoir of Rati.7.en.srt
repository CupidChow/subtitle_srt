1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,280
You cannot go to the festival
with anyone but me tonight.

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,120
It is my sole responsibility
to take you to the festival.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,840
I do want to float a lantern
like everyone else though.

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:09,960
Can you come?

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,320
My father insisted I must bring some lady
to the festival tonight.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,440
Thee.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,400
This is Mom Rajawong Tikumporn Borrirak,
the daughter of Duke Udomsawaddamrong.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,560
From now on, my body and my soul
will long for Thee,

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,920
and only for Thee.

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,760
Six months?

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,800
Six months from now,
I must travel back to France.

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,960
What will become of us?

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,800
We will remain what we are.

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,200
If we give it our all and do our best,

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,640
there is nothing to regret.

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,680
I will take care of you the best I can
within these six months.

17
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,120
And I will let you.

18
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,040
Let's start with

19
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,920
going to the ministry with me.

20
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,440
Going to the ministry?

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,840
Is something the matter?

22
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,120
MINISTRY OF EDUCATION

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,520
What's the matter?
Why am I meeting the minister?

24
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,960
Has there been a complaint
regarding my teaching?

25
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,600
-Please tell me.
-You'll know soon.

26
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,040
Is it good news or otherwise?
Please tell me, Thee.

27
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,520
I need to steel myself.

28
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,600
It is good news.

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,680
Very much so?

30
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,600
Rati.

31
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,800
Please.

32
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,840
It is good news.

33
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,080
Very good news.

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,720
"Viscount Rati Jarupich"?

35
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,640
I am not dreaming, am I?

36
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:00,240
Your title has been published
in the Royal Gazette.

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,120
It is reality.

38
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,120
"Viscount Rati Jarupich."

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,640
This title given by His Majesty

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,360
suits you perfectly.

41
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,040
"Viscount Rati Jarupich."

42
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,000
What does the name mean?

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,800
"Rati" means affection and pleasure.

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,400
"Jaru" means elegance.

45
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,120
"Pich" means an intellectual.
A learned man.

46
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,760
You can surmise why I think
the name is beautiful.

47
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,000
Viscount Rati Jarupich.

48
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,920
Count Suratheetamtanapich.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,640
There is one "pich" in my name,
just like yours.

50
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,280
Is that a good thing?

51
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,640
It is.

52
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,400
It warms my heart to hear it.

53
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,560
It feels like I'll always
have you with me.

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,720
From now on, I believe things
will only continue looking up for us.

55
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,440
Mek?

56
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,880
Dech.

57
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,640
What's wrong? You don't look well.

58
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,040
Is this…

59
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,720
from yesterday's match?

60
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,200
You might need to see a doctor.

61
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
I doubt it.

62
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,120
I'm fine. I'll be all right
just with some ointment.

63
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,320
You're being stubborn.

64
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,080
I'm not.

65
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,760
I know myself.

66
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,000
I am fine.

67
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,800
I know you got it,

68
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,120
but I'm worried about you.

69
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,520
Won't you go to the doctor for me?

70
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,800
I'm begging you.

71
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,000
Of course.

72
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,280
I will.

73
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,560
After work, that is.

74
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
Good.

75
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,960
Hold on, Dech.

76
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,640
Look.

77
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,960
I'm almost done saving up.

78
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:00,760
Winning seven or eight more matches
will likely secure it.

79
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,080
Once I have all the money I need,

80
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,560
I'll buy my mother's land back.

81
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,280
Will you go with me?

82
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,960
I want to show you her home.

83
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,520
I'd go even if you didn't ask me to.

84
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,120
It's all thanks to you.

85
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
I believe your pouch has brought me luck.

86
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,000
Well…

87
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,920
I have to go to class.

88
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,760
Oh.

89
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,920
Don't…

90
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,400
forget to go to the doctor.

91
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,200
Study well, Dech.

92
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,000
CIVIL SERVANTS SCHOOL

93
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,680
Professor Rati has been
granted a viscounty.

94
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,200
Bonjour à tous.

95
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,320
Professor Rati.

96
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,920
I heard that you've been made a viscount.

97
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,560
Congratulations. You deserve it.

98
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,080
As a baronet,
I pay my respects to you, sir.

99
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,800
We pay our respects, sir.

100
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,920
By the time your year teaching here is up,
I'm afraid I'll have to bow to you too.

101
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,960
Come on.

102
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,800
Please speak to me
the way you all did before.

103
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,920
I remain the same Rati.

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,240
I'm no better than anyone else.

105
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,120
The taller one grows, the lower one bows.

106
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,120
The more noble one gets,
the more one needs to stay humble.

107
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,280
That's how one stays respectable.

108
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,520
I simply do my job
to the best of my ability.

109
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,880
Whatever title I am given

110
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,000
is like a rewarding glass
of refreshing water,

111
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,640
not a blade to strike someone down.

112
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,480
Hey.

113
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,000
What are you all doing?

114
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,400
You should congratulate
the new viscount, Lord Ruj.

115
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,920
Professor outranks you now.

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,840
You can't call him a servant anymore, sir.

117
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,440
You could be whipped for it now.

118
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,120
What's so funny?

119
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,480
Move away.

120
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,840
Let's begin our lesson, sirs.

121
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,040
CIVIL SERVANTS SCHOOL

122
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,840
The test results are not as important
as your comprehension of the lessons.

123
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,160
The tests are simply a tool for me
to know where else to focus on.

124
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,840
Who got the highest scores, sir?

125
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,320
Was it me?

126
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,440
You got 7 out of 20, sir.

127
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,480
The highest scores

128
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,320
belong to Prince Mai

129
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,760
and Count Suratheetamtanapich.

130
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,080
I noticed that many of you
struggle with vocabulary.

131
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,360
I have compiled an extra sheet
on the matter.

132
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,040
You should have it
with your returned test.

133
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,600
Why do I have two sheets?

134
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,280
Are you mocking me for my bad results?

135
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,560
That is not my intention, sir.

136
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,880
You're flaunting your new title now,
aren't you?

137
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,600
Even if you were made a duke,
it wouldn't change the fact

138
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,760
that you were born of a kitchen maid.

139
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,680
Baron!

140
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,680
Don't think you will ever earn my respect.

141
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,880
Bear that in mind.

142
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,720
I take no issue that you call me
a servant boy.

143
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,760
It is the truth, and I accept it.

144
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,440
However, you must recognize that the title
I received was given by His Majesty.

145
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,680
Even if you have no respect for me,

146
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,520
at least respect His Majesty's judgement
to have granted me the title.

147
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,520
How dare you lecture me?

148
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,520
Father!

149
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,120
You think I'll cower just because
you're a nobleman now?

150
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,120
My lord.

151
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Despite your hatred,
I think you should keep in mind

152
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,800
that Professor Rati is
the son of the French ambassador.

153
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,520
Professor Rati is the man
Siam begged France for.

154
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
He is our nation's guest.

155
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,440
Do you wish to put us at odds with France?

156
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,240
All you care about is whether
one is born high or low…

157
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,160
when your own actions sink beneath
even the dregs of society.

158
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,720
If you don't wish to study, leave class.
Do not be a burden to others.

159
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
I know you don't mind, Professor,

160
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,720
but I can't allow his behavior to pass.

161
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,440
The ministry has taken note of the matter,
and soon, word of it will reach France.

162
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,800
Must such a big deal be made of it?

163
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,720
It affects international relations.

164
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,960
The baron must be punished for it.

165
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,240
What is weighing on your mind?

166
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,200
Lord Ruj is Mother Rung's younger brother.

167
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,480
He is my uncle.

168
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,680
If this matter blows up,

169
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,160
I don't think I can face anyone
at Suriyakorn Palace.

170
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,400
Could Lord Ruj simply be removed
from the student list

171
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,160
instead of legal action being taken
or him being demoted?

172
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,280
He shall be punished
according to the rules.

173
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,960
Siam will not overlook bad behavior.

174
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,920
If France were to find out

175
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,840
that one of their own had been
discriminated against

176
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
to the point of verbal and physical abuse,

177
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,840
they would never accept it,
and would likely call for action.

178
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,680
If it came to that,

179
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,000
the baron could face
even more severe punishment.

180
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,200
It could even mean death.

181
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,360
I understand now.

182
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,560
I can still see unease on your face.

183
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,240
You didn't ask me

184
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,520
if I was in pain.

185
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,920
Are you in pain?

186
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,120
I'm sorry

187
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,280
for not being able to protect you.

188
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,400
It's all right.

189
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,760
It wasn't your fault.

190
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:27,040
You know, I am angry about what happened
and I'm worried about you.

191
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,680
But I must be careful

192
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,480
because I know you care about
what people think.

193
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,440
If I could reveal my true feelings,

194
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,560
there is no way I would not show
my concern for you openly.

195
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,800
It still hurts.

196
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,280
In the future…

197
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,120
I will no longer hold myself back.

198
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,960
I will show my true feelings.

199
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,520
If I am to be ostracized,

200
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,360
I will bear the brunt of it on my own.

201
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,640
-Please don't joke about such things.
-I meant it.

202
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,360
Is not love for another man felt with the
same beating heart as any other love?

203
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,560
Father.

204
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,880
You should apologize to Professor Rati.

205
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,400
What for? What did I do?

206
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,800
Do not feign ignorance.

207
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,560
Your behavior is undermining our nation,

208
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,800
not to mention discrediting
the good name of Suriyakorn.

209
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,480
Resist, if you want.

210
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,680
But if this blows up
and tarnishes Suriyakorn's reputation,

211
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,680
keep it in mind that it is due to
your own actions, Father.

212
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,400
Hey.

213
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,600
Dech.

214
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,640
Dech!

215
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,280
Buaphan.

216
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,600
What are you doing here?

217
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,560
Are you here to mock me like your son did?

218
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,600
You must be dancing with joy
that your son has become a viscount.

219
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,320
You dare look me in the eyes?

220
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,720
The likes of you should remember
your place in the world.

221
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,400
Ungrateful pigs!

222
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,960
-Keep that in mind!
-Father, stop!

223
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,560
-Buaphan, run!
-Never let yourself forget it!

224
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,920
-Father!
-Let go!

225
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,960
-Hammer it into your skull! Get back here!
-Father!

226
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,800
Father!

227
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,680
Father!

228
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,880
Buaphan!

229
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,920
-Father!
-Buaphan!

230
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,560
Buaphan!

231
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,160
-Father!
-Come back here, Buaphan!

232
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,400
-Buaphan!
-Father!

233
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,640
Buaphan! Buaphan!

234
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,760
Come out here! Come out!

235
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,880
Come out!

236
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,520
What the hell are you looking at?
Get lost! Go back to work!

237
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,000
He is…

238
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,280
He is a viscount now.

239
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,040
He is a viscount now.

240
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,640
I've made my decision about the matter
involving Baron Wijitphakorn.

241
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,200
Please don't try to persuade me
against it, Professor.

242
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,360
Rules are rules,
and punishments are necessary.

243
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,720
To let him off the hook is to allow him
to continue his abuse of power.

244
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,760
You need to put a stop to his bullying.

245
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,480
Don't forget who you are now.

246
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,920
You have every right to defend yourself.

247
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I admit it infuriates me
each time you let it happen.

248
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,560
Will you hear me out, Your Highness?

249
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,800
Go on.

250
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,880
I am here to ask

251
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,720
that he be punished according to the law.

252
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:30,280
You are not asking for pardon?

253
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,200
I was going to.

254
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,000
But after speaking to Thee…

255
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,960
I mean, Count Suratheetamtanapich,

256
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,840
I learned that if he goes unpunished,
it will only do more harm,

257
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,400
both to Lord Ruj and to the relationship
between our two nations.

258
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,400
So it was the good count
who clarified that point.

259
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,160
SENG CHAROEN

260
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,040
Dig in.

261
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,320
My treat.

262
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,440
Did you fetch me from home
just so we could eat pagrim kaitao?

263
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,360
My dear Young Master,

264
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,320
please don't think badly of me, sir.

265
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,080
I heard your father slapped the professor.

266
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,680
I'm worried about you.
How are you doing?

267
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,880
It wasn't me who did it.

268
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,480
Why shouldn't I be all right?

269
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,800
At the end of the day,
he is still your father.

270
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,760
You can say it doesn't concern you,

271
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,600
but I don't believe you.

272
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Look.

273
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,960
I'm here if you need someone to talk to.

274
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,680
-Are you?
-Of course.

275
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,720
Ow!

276
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,160
Does it hurt?

277
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,360
No. I'm only joking.

278
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440
You jester.

279
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,400
I didn't want you to be upset.

280
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,840
I'm really here if you need to talk.

281
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,440
Well…

282
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,840
Can I talk to you about something?

283
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,320
Go on.

284
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,120
Someone promised me he would see a doctor,

285
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,520
but he ended up doing anything but.

286
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,000
What do you think I should do to him?

287
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,000
I think

288
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:46,240
you should calm down
and finish your bowl of dessert.

289
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,080
I was going to go, but the rickshaw
has never been busier.

290
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,560
Finish your dessert.

291
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,840
We're going together.

292
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,400
Yes, sir.

293
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Aunt Porn,

294
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,720
give me five more bowls.

295
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,120
Coming up!

296
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
Are you hungry?

297
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,920
It's my treat. I want you to eat well.

298
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,280
Here. I'll even feed you.

299
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,520
How is it?

300
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,960
It's good, isn't it?

301
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,880
You will probably like it too.

302
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,320
Won't you have a taste?

303
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,440
I've had my fill.

304
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,440
Come on.

305
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,800
That's too big of a bite.

306
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,440
-Are you pranking me?
-Of course not.

307
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,360
-Are you sure?
-Of course I am.

308
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,000
-Really sure?
-Really sure.

309
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,920
-You're not joking?
-Of course not.

310
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,920
Mr. Rati.

311
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,640
What news, Kui?

312
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,080
I've asked the attendants
at Suriyakorn Palace,

313
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:04,800
and they said Lord Ruj has been so furious
that no one dares get close to him.

314
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,560
As for your mother Buaphan…

315
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,240
What's happened to Buaphan?

316
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,600
She is currently safe, sir.

317
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,800
The attendants said
Young Master Dech is protecting her,

318
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,120
but no one can say
how long she will remain safe.

319
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:17,760
I need to see her.

320
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,520
What can you do for her if you go there?
You can't just barge into the palace.

321
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
I think you should go
to Count Theerathon, sir.

322
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,400
If he's with you,
he might be able to do something.

323
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,960
That's very smart of you, Kui.

324
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,440
And I know it, sir.

325
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,720
Kanom bueang this way.

326
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,160
Come and get it here.

327
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,280
Can I have some kanom bueang, please?

328
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,280
I was just on my way to see you.

329
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,200
I beat you to it.

330
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,800
I got some kanom bueang for you
on the way here.

331
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,280
I'm afraid a few pieces
might have gone missing though.

332
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,080
Thank you.

333
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,240
I have a feeling it was your mouth that
must account for the missing pieces.

334
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,080
Are you busy after work?

335
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,640
I was wondering if you could come with me
to Suriyakorn Palace to see my mother.

336
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,800
Of course.

337
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,360
I will go grab my bag,
and we'll go in my car.

338
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,920
Father.

339
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,800
Are you here on state matters?

340
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,000
I am here to see you, actually.

341
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,120
I need to talk to you about the wedding
between you and Lady Pa.

342
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,520
I know you're devoted to
serving our country.

343
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,520
I've been persuading your grandmother
to postpone it, but now…

344
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,800
Now, I'm afraid I can no longer avoid it.

345
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,320
I think the time is right for you as well.

346
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,120
You want me to marry someone I don't love?

347
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,040
Lady Pa is the perfect lady for you.

348
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,760
I believe you will come to love her
as time goes by.

349
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,680
Like you and Mother?

350
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,040
Is this what Grandmother said to you too
when she wanted you to get married?

351
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,360
And what happened?

352
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,760
Did you ever fall for Mother?

353
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,920
You married Mother for the honor
and glory of our families.

354
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,800
Meanwhile, the woman you love
lives in the servants' quarters

355
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,600
where you can never set foot.

356
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,840
All to satisfy Grandmother.

357
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,960
In your relationships,

358
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,120
is anyone happy?

359
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,720
Do you truly want the same for me?

360
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,920
My troubles are unlike yours.

361
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,080
I'm worried about you, son.

362
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:45,240
I want you to choose the right path.

363
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,640
I take care of my responsibilities.

364
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,400
I am serving my country.

365
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,600
I work hard to prove myself.

366
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,080
Is that not enough to honor our family?

367
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,800
You can already see
how rough the path up ahead is.

368
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,360
Do you insist on taking it?

369
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,480
Yes.

370
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,480
To struggle with someone I love

371
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,840
seems like a struggle I can be happy with.

372
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,400
Will you pass some books to Tiwa for me?

373
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,320
Mr. Rati?

374
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,680
It really is you.

375
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,560
I came here to see my father.
I was just leaving, actually.

376
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,680
This is good.

377
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,000
I need to talk to you.

378
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,040
I have quietly admired Thee
for a long time.

379
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,400
I was glad when my father
and his grandmother wanted us to marry.

380
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,720
But I think…

381
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,120
Thee is in love with someone else.

382
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,400
My father is the Minister of Education,
the ministry where Thee works.

383
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,480
He would never allow me to be humiliated.

384
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,520
He doesn't care who Thee is in love with.

385
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,240
All he cares about is propriety.

386
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,960
But I am not like my father.

387
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,160
I do not wish to take away anyone's love.

388
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,440
If he doesn't love me,

389
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,960
I don't want him.

390
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,840
But whoever it is that he loves
must be perfect for him.

391
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,080
Someone who is better than me.

392
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,080
What do you think, Mr. Rati?

393
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,560
Are you more perfect for him than I am?

394
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,480
What were you talking to Lady Pa about?

395
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,280
Nothing.

396
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,880
Please tell me.

397
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,520
It's really nothing.

398
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,760
Let's go.

399
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,400
We need to go to Suriyakorn Palace.

400
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,360
Oh, here he comes. Will you put it down?

401
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,520
Wash your hands
before you touch anything, Phu.

402
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,080
It's safe to say
my cooking remains impeccable.

403
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,000
Dear Buaphan, you haven't stopped smiling
since you learned that

404
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,240
your son has been made a viscount.

405
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,120
You should be very comfortable in life now
to have a son you can rely on.

406
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,720
When is he going to come
and take you away?

407
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,120
He is not my son.

408
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,080
He is Lady Rung's son.

409
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,760
If he's not your son, how come you haven't
stopped smiling about him all day?

410
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,560
Can't a woman just be happy?

411
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,400
Tight-lipped, isn't she?

412
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,400
This woman…

413
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
You must be ecstatic.

414
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,720
Buaphan, come here!

415
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,760
-Please let me go, sir!
-Come here!

416
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,160
-Come here!
-Sir!

417
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,480
-Just come with me!
-Sir, please!

418
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,040
Your son doesn't know his place.

419
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,600
I'll drag you to school and show everyone

420
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,640
that his mother
is nothing but a servant in my kitchen!

421
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,640
-Come here!
-No!

422
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,760
-I'm not going, sir! No!
-Come!

423
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,560
If you're using me to hurt the viscount,
I refuse to obey, my lord.

424
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,160
I would rather die!

425
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,360
My lord, please stop.

426
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,800
-Please, sir. I'm begging you.
-My lord, please.

427
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,400
Stay out of this!

428
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,400
Come here!

429
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
Father!

430
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,720
Let Buaphan go.

431
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,760
You're crossing the line.

432
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,960
Stay out of my business, Dech.

433
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
Come here!

434
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,520
Let go!

435
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,880
Grandfather wants to see you.

436
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,880
Why?

437
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,440
Because you slapped Rati.

438
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,520
I told him.

439
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,200
And why on earth did you do that?

440
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,720
You refused to take responsibility
for your actions.

441
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,120
I don't want to be in trouble

442
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,600
so I asked Grandfather for help.

443
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,120
Dech.

444
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,880
Take Buaphan away.

445
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,280
Stop it!

446
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,640
-Did I say you could go?
-Father!

447
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,440
-Where do you think you're going?
-Father!

448
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,520
Come here! Come here!

449
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,040
Father, let her go.

450
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,240
Father!

451
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,840
Let her go!

452
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,880
Buaphan!

453
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,040
Stop!

454
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,720
Father!

455
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,280
Father!

456
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,920
-Buaphan.
-Father!

457
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,080
Buaphan.

458
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:11,920
Father, please!

459
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,160
Stop it!

460
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,680
Go! Don't ever come back!

461
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:17,560
Buaphan!

462
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,800
Father.

463
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,960
You married Mother for the honor
and glory of our families.

464
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,520
Meanwhile, the woman you love
lives in the servants' quarters

465
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,280
where you can never set foot in.

466
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,960
All to satisfy Grandmother.

467
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,800
In your relationships,

468
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,600
is anyone happy?

469
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,400
Where are you going, my lord?

470
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,680
Hello.

471
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,880
We apologize for barging in.

472
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,680
There was no gatekeeper at the door.

473
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,440
Father is upstairs with Grandfather.
He will be here shortly.

474
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,400
How are you, Rati?

475
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,680
I apologize on behalf of my father
for the other day.

476
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,960
I'm all right.

477
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,600
There was no serious harm done.

478
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,120
I heard you have been helping
my mother Buaphan, Baronet.

479
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,360
Thank you.

480
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,960
Not at all.

481
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:14,360
Mr. Rati has some concerns.

482
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,080
He wants to meet Buaphan for a moment.

483
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,240
Can you fetch her for us?

484
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,400
It's all right.

485
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,280
I will meet her in the kitchen.

486
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,920
Something happened this morning.

487
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,360
Father wanted to take Buaphan
to school to embarrass you.

488
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,240
So she…

489
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,640
She ran away.

490
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,400
I already have men looking for her,

491
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,640
though we haven't found her.

492
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,200
My mother, Buaphan,

493
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,840
did anyone find her?

494
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,639
Excuse me.

495
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,960
Have you seen a woman
of about this height named Buaphan?

496
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,520
Excuse me.

497
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,920
Have you seen a woman
of about this height named Buaphan?

498
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,960
No.

499
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,280
Thank you.

500
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,800
Mom!

501
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,560
Stop, Rati.

502
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,239
Leave this matter to me.

503
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,840
-Two-baht worth of these, please.
-Of course. Just a moment.

504
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,239
-One cup of hot tea, please.
-Of course.

505
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,880
Do you really think Mek would do it?

506
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,159
He's never lost, brother.

507
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,719
He must.

508
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,680
He promised to lose this time.

509
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,880
The money from the bet
is bigger than his ego.

510
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,400
A rigged match?

511
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:17,920
Mek.

512
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,000
Dech.

513
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,200
Are you going to deliberately lose?

514
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,320
I…

515
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,120
Why are you doing this?

516
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,320
If I don't give them the money tomorrow,

517
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,040
they'll sell my mother's land
to someone else.

518
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,760
Hey, Mek. Are you ready?

519
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,080
The match is about to begin. Come on.

520
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,320
Mek. Don't you dare.

521
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,360
Don't worry about me.

522
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,440
I'll be fine.

523
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,920
-Go for it!
-You can do it, Mek.

524
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,520
Hey. Go for it!

525
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,120
-Mek!
-Hey! Stop it!

526
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,880
-Mek!
-You can't get in!

527
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,240
Let go of me!

528
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,840
-Stay away!
-Mek!

529
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,120
-Mek! Get up!
-Don't let him.

530
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,200
Let go of me!

531
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,520
Mek!

532
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,840
Mek.

533
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,240
Buaphan is a good woman.

534
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,840
She must be hiding somewhere safe.

535
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,520
I have men looking for her.

536
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,840
We'll have news of her soon.

537
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,120
Thank you.

538
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,040
Have you eaten yet?

539
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,480
I can't stomach anything.

540
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,800
Will you have dinner with me if I ask?

541
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,080
What about this?

542
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,800
Will you at least eat this?

543
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,360
Where did you get it?

544
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,120
I had Mhay look for someone
with a fairy floss machine.

545
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,400
Being the good man that he is,
Mhay actually found someone.

546
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,000
I wanted to celebrate your viscounty
with some fairy floss, you see.

547
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,640
Eat.

548
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,920
Before it melts away.

549
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,800
I can't help but worry about Buaphan.

550
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,920
Did you hear what Baronet Dech said?

551
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:18,080
When she heard the baron
wanted to use her to hurt you, she ran.

552
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,200
Because she loves me,

553
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,640
she doesn't want my name to be sullied.

554
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,920
You're right.

555
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,600
That's why you must take care of yourself
to match the love she has for you.

556
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,040
I don't want
to sully your name either, Thee.

557
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,440
Thee.

558
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,160
Please marry Lady Pa.

559
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,880
I've thought it through.

560
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,720
Marrying Lady Pa is the best thing to do.

561
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,000
You don't want to sully my name…

562
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,640
because you love me?

563
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:17,680
Is this your indirect way
of telling me you love me?

564
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,680
Thee.

565
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,320
You're awake.

566
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,240
How are you feeling?

567
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,720
Does it still hurt?

568
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,960
Your money. I was asked to give it to you.

569
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,800
Now that you have enough money,
you can buy your mother's land back.

570
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,440
Quit fighting.

571
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,480
You don't need to get yourself hurt
like this anymore.

572
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,960
What's wrong?
Why are you staring at me like that?

573
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,800
Mek.

574
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:27,960
Can you hear me?

575
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,280
Mek?

576
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,600
Mek! What's wrong?

577
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,000
Mek.

578
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,000
Mek!

579
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,040
Mek!

580
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,560
Wait right here. I'll fetch you a doctor.

581
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,760
Mek!

582
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,720
Mek, watch out!

583
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,160
You're all right. I'm here.

584
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,760
Mek!

585
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,800
Are you pretending not to understand?

586
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,320
I don't love Lady Pa.

587
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,200
I want to spend the rest of my life
with you, Rati.

588
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,960
What we have is a fleeting moment of joy.

589
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,360
In less than six months,
I will be back in France.

590
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,760
And when that time comes,
what we have right here

591
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,520
will be gone in the blink of an eye.

592
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,120
We will do anything we can
to keep it alive.

593
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,680
Can you keep this fairy floss
from melting?

594
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,200
There has to be a way.

595
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,640
Soon enough, people will talk about us.

596
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:20,400
The good name of
Count Suratheetamtanapich will be gone.

597
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,440
I cannot do that to you.

598
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,240
It shouldn't be wrong
to be true to one's self.

599
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,880
Thee.

600
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,440
Love between two men is impossible.

601
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,880
This is the truth.

602
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,400
Is my love not true, then?

603
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,200
Count Suratheetamtanapich.

604
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,800
Viscount Rati Jarupich.

605
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,560
Both of our names carry the word "pich,"
which means "intellectuals."

606
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,120
Whatever obstacles lie in our path,
we shall take them in stride.

607
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,040
-I think it's impossible--
-Will you please stop saying that?

608
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,960
How, then?

609
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,680
How will you make them understand?

610
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,960
Is there a way that allows us
to be happy together?

611
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,040
Will you please tell me?

612
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,280
Can you really walk away from me?

613
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,120
I'm doing this to protect you, Thee.

614
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,440
Come with me.

615
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,480
Thee, people are staring.

616
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,280
I told you I would show my feelings openly

617
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,280
and I wouldn't hold myself back from you.

618
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,600
Have you seen Mek?

619
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,640
Mek wouldn't be here.

620
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,440
He must be seriously injured.

621
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,000
Are you done?

622
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,920
Good job keeping your promise.

623
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,640
I'll even give you this.

624
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:46,920
LAND DEED

625
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,000
Shame on you.

626
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,040
With the deity of Mai Maan Shrine
as my witness,

627
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,880
I will love and cherish you
and only you, Rati.

628
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:11,280
I will do everything possible
to make you happy,

629
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,520
and I will do everything in my power
to make our love possible.

630
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,880
I don't know right now
how to make that happen…

631
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,960
but as long as you don't give up on me,

632
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,920
I won't give up on us either.

633
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,840
I will do everything possible

634
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,720
to let us be together
like any other couple,

635
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,840
no matter how hard it gets,

636
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,480
and even if it costs me my life.

637
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,920
Please help me in this pursuit
so we can grow old together.

638
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:28,320
I, Count Suratheetamtanapich,
solemnly swear.

639
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,040
Your ears aren't working properly.

640
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,000
Can you hear me?

641
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:58,360
-Can you hear me at all?
-I can hear you just fine!

642
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,880
NEXT EPISODE

643
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,040
Why did you kiss me?

644
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,960
I'm kissing my friend,
the way people kiss their pets.

645
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,400
I had a lot of fun flying a kite today.

646
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,400
Prince Mai sure takes good care of you.

647
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,880
I guess I'm now useless.

648
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,680
Would you be up for a bet?

649
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,680
-What are we betting, Your Highness?
-The professor, perhaps.
