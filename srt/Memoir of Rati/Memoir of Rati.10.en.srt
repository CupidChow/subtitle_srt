1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,520
"This is a navaratna ring."

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,800
"I would be more than happy if you were
to give it to someone you love, son."

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:07,200
Who would be so lucky?

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,400
Could we still be friends
if I were to tell you

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,720
I fancy you?

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,320
What have you done to my son?

7
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,760
Mek!

8
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,000
You lowlife! Stay away from my son!

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:20,760
I won't allow my grandson
and the Wisut family

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,920
to be ruined by you.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,520
Kanom Pong!

12
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,720
- Yes.
- Toasted and crispy!

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,960
All correct, right?

14
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,000
Uncle.

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,000
- One hot coffee, please.
- Yes, sir.

16
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,640
Here you are, sir.

17
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,400
- Here.
- Thank you, sir.

18
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,080
Kanom Bueang, please.

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,240
- Watch out!
- Hey!

20
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,880
- Watch where you're going!
- You watch where you're going!

21
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,840
No, you!

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,200
- It's you who needs to be careful!
- You should walk carefully!

23
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,520
I was careful! You got in my way!
I was buying Kanom Bueang.

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,840
- I'm done arguing with you. I'm leaving.
- Where do you think you're going?

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Thee.

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,440
Rati.

27
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,280
I've missed you.

28
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,440
Grandmother has me followed at all times.

29
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,080
It's been difficult
to sneak off to see you.

30
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,800
I have to be vigilant
with every step I take.

31
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,400
I understand.

32
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,400
Whatever the situation is,

33
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,800
I will do my best

34
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,000
to savor the rest of my time
with you here.

35
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,600
So will I.

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,920
I will savor this time I get
to spend with you.

37
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,320
CIVIL SERVANTS SCHOOL

38
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,480
Today is the last day of school.

39
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,440
I'm glad to see all of you here.

40
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,720
From day one to this moment,

41
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,640
I have been honored and proud

42
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,040
to be tasked with this duty.

43
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,240
For any error or disrespect on my part,

44
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,800
I apologize and accept your criticism.

45
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:46,800
I do hope my lessons benefit all of you

46
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,560
and Siam in some way.

47
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,520
We will take it easy today.

48
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,880
If you have any questions
or inquiries for me,

49
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,360
I am open to them.

50
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,840
Please, sirs.

51
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,280
When are you leaving for France?

52
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,840
In 20 days, sir.

53
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,240
20 days?

54
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,360
In just 20 days.

55
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,720
So soon.

56
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,720
Hello. Do you have a reservation?

57
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,600
This way, please.

58
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,840
Are you going to join us at the table?

59
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,840
Please enjoy your dinner, ma'am.

60
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,880
Go wait outside.

61
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,680
I'll report back to Her Highness

62
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,960
that Master Thee and Lady Pa
truly arrived at the restaurant,

63
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,600
as expected.

64
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,600
Let's go.

65
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,960
Really?

66
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,600
Yes. I found the love of my life.

67
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,080
I'm happy for you.

68
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,640
Thank you.

69
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,640
You can loosen the tension
in your face, Thee.

70
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,640
This is Florion, my beloved.

71
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,880
So the love of your life is Lady Pa?

72
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,160
Yes.

73
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,480
I learned the language of
the Siamese for her.

74
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,320
I met her at
the Floating Lantern Festival.

75
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,080
Her krathong crashed into mine

76
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,480
and it sang…

77
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,240
- Sang?
- "Sank."

78
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,840
- It sank.
- "Sank" is right.

79
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,680
So you can save your jealousy, Thee.

80
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,760
What are you saying?

81
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,160
Me getting jealous?

82
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,280
No way.

83
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,720
All right.

84
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,640
I might have gotten a little jealous.

85
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,240
I'm getting hungry.

86
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:33,760
You are?

87
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,200
- Yes.
- Shall we have dinner?

88
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,760
Please.

89
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,200
Gemini.

90
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,480
The constellation Gemini is over there.

91
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,720
The stars form a rectangle.

92
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,040
Move your head closer to mine.
You'll see them better from this angle.

93
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,280
The yellow and white stars are heads.

94
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,960
Those are arms.

95
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,720
Those are bodies.

96
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,400
These are their legs.

97
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,200
You're right.

98
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,320
This constellation was crucial
to ancient Roman sailors.

99
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,640
Sailors made a wish to the stars
before they embarked,

100
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,520
praying for a safe journey.

101
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,080
I pray that we reach our shared goal.

102
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,360
Thee.

103
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,120
I hope my wish comes true.

104
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,520
Thee.

105
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,120
Where did you run off to
after dinner last night?

106
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,720
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?

107
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,120
What you heard was right.

108
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,240
Who did you meet up with?

109
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,000
The minister.

110
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,840
I have been scrutinized
by some officials at the ministry.

111
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,640
They are saying I don't act like
a deputy minister and professor should,

112
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,200
having attendants following me around
everywhere I go as if I were a child.

113
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,040
The minister was concerned

114
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,480
and did not wish for me
and the Wisut family to be ridiculed.

115
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,720
I did insist

116
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,080
that the attendants are evidence of
your love and consideration for me.

117
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,760
I do not care what they say.

118
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,320
Who are they?

119
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,920
I will have them punished.

120
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,400
How dare they make jokes at
my grandson's expense?

121
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,440
Please let it go, Grandmother.
There is no need to heed it.

122
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,480
I refuse.

123
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,720
How are you going to punish the whole
of the ministry and the university?

124
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,560
Yes. This has spread throughout
the whole Ministry of Education,

125
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,800
and most likely other ministries as well.

126
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,920
Please don't heed it.

127
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,840
I, of all people,
am used to scandalous rumors.

128
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,360
If you will excuse me.

129
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,800
Will you, Your Highness? Will you really
pay for my hearing treatment?

130
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,560
Are you calling me a liar?

131
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,040
Of course not, Your Highness.

132
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,160
I was only surprised I would be so lucky.

133
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,240
Grandfather has always been
a generous man.

134
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,640
When I told him how nice
and how moral you are,

135
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,480
he took a liking to you.

136
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,600
Can I ask you…

137
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,760
Can I ask you something, Your Highness?

138
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,320
My grandson has always been
kind of a fool.

139
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,400
But he takes his studies seriously
when you're here.

140
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,000
He even wants to work.

141
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,160
You must have been a good influence.

142
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,640
How can I not help someone like that?

143
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,840
But I am…

144
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,560
I am a lowly servant, sir.

145
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,840
For now.

146
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,920
Ambitious men like you
don't stay where they are for long.

147
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

148
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,280
A servant like me
is eternally grateful, sir.

149
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,080
Don't you let Grandfather down.

150
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,400
Why did you let this lowlife in?

151
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,280
What did this snitch tell you now, Father?

152
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,600
He didn't tell me anything bad.

153
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,800
He was bringing me good news, actually.
Dech is quitting his job.

154
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,840
What?

155
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,520
You don't tell your father
these things anymore, do you?

156
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,760
Well?

157
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,320
He still tells me.

158
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:16,760
Dech and his friend are going to take
the news translator exam.

159
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,840
Soon too.

160
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:25,040
He hopes to let this man stay here
to make it convenient for their study.

161
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,920
Have you decided if you want to be
a translator for a ministry

162
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,720
or a newspaper?

163
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,520
You still look worried.

164
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,400
There's no need to be.

165
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,640
I can help.

166
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,440
Thank you, Your Highness.

167
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,000
Wow, Thee.

168
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,240
Ms. Ruedi really knows how to cook.

169
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,160
She did all of this by herself.

170
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,000
These are the nine auspicious desserts.

171
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,440
It is believed that eating them
will bring good luck into your life.

172
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,600
Where should I start?

173
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,800
Anywhere you like.

174
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,920
I'll go with this one.

175
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,520
Did you order palm sugar, sirs?

176
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,320
You die today, you lowlife.

177
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,800
What's going on over there, Thee?

178
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,640
Thee.

179
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,000
Thee!

180
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,400
Run!

181
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,440
Lord Ruj?

182
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,200
Mek!

183
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,119
Are you all right?

184
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,520
My lord.

185
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,319
Professor.

186
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,079
Mek.

187
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,200
Mek!

188
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,440
He's awake.

189
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
My lord.

190
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:45,440
Professor.

191
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,160
Thank you both.

192
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,160
If you hadn't been there,
I would have died.

193
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,120
It's no big deal.

194
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
We're glad you're safe, Mek.

195
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,600
I promise you,

196
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:10,160
I will repay you for this great favor.

197
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,760
Mek. Mek!

198
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,120
How are you feeling?
Who did this to you?

199
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,160
Tell me right now. I will go and get them.

200
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,640
Who did this to you? Hurry up, tell me!

201
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,600
Dech!

202
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,960
I can barely hear,
and yet you're annoyingly loud.

203
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,840
Ow!

204
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,440
You foul mouth.

205
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,320
I'm all right now.

206
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,360
The count and your professor saved me.

207
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,320
Professor.

208
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,440
My lord.

209
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,280
Thank you.

210
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,520
Do you know who did this?

211
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,920
I can't help but feel bad for Mek.

212
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,560
Baronet Dech is with him,
so he'll be fine.

213
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,760
I don't know who he got into a fight with.

214
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,720
It must have been very intense

215
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,240
if they dared attack him
in front of the Mai Maan Shrine.

216
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,000
It was Lord Ruj.

217
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,200
Lord Ruj?

218
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,480
Lord Ruj…

219
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,960
Will his hatred toward us ever subside?

220
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,400
Take a seat, Baronet.

221
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,040
With a witness and evidence,

222
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,680
do you still deny it, sir?

223
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
It's none of your business.

224
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,560
Baronet. Mind your manners.

225
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,000
You dare frame me
for a crime I did not commit?

226
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,880
Why don't you tell him what you did?

227
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:18,360
You were sneaking about with Count Thee
in front of the Mai Maan Shrine.

228
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,880
The Mai Maan Shrine is open
to all believers.

229
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,880
The count and I were there
to say our prayers.

230
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,480
Is that a crime, sir?

231
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,760
We harmed no one,

232
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,240
unlike you, who hired someone
to attack Mek.

233
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,400
I didn't do
what Lord Rati is accusing me of.

234
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,600
It isn't true.

235
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,800
If you insist on denying it,
I must say it worries me.

236
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,120
Because, as a high-ranking official,

237
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,320
you could use your power
to hurt someone else.

238
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,120
Mek would likely not be the last.

239
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,560
Don't you think that accusation
is exaggerated, sir?

240
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,600
Know that this accusation is against
the whole of the Suriyakorn family.

241
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,960
Have you forgotten

242
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,040
that your own adopted mother

243
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,840
was also a Suriyakorn?

244
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,920
You and I are not related.

245
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,880
I no longer feel obligated
to give you respect.

246
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:24,120
I will trust your judgement
on the matter, Your Highness.

247
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,560
I didn't do anything.

248
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,920
This is the truth.

249
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,000
I have received information
from both parties.

250
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,440
As of this moment,

251
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,640
there is an open investigation
into the matters involving you.

252
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,920
This includes the assault on Lord Rati
in front of high-ranking officials

253
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,840
and the attack on commoners.

254
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:49,440
The possible sentences are prison time,
demotion, and public shaming.

255
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,040
Any of these three.

256
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,480
I didn't--

257
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,720
Your Highness.

258
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,000
I called upon you suddenly

259
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,240
because I have news
regarding the Deputy Minister.

260
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,680
We have a duty to uphold, Your Highness.

261
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,520
We must arrest the baronet immediately.

262
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,200
I understand. Do as you must.

263
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,280
Laws are laws.

264
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,440
Father.

265
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
Sir!

266
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,000
Baronet, sir!

267
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,560
Please stop!

268
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,560
Sir!

269
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,120
Sir!

270
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,120
Sir, please wake up.

271
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,000
Sir!

272
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,560
Mhay! You frightened me!

273
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,200
You might want to wipe the saliva
off your face, sir.

274
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,440
Makes me wonder who's the injured one.

275
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,640
My master asked me to bring you
some pork rice soup.

276
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,880
Thanks.

277
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,760
Hey, did the police find out who did this?

278
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,760
Yes, sir.

279
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,920
The man who hurt Mek

280
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:55,400
worked for Lord Rujrapeepat, sir.

281
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,680
I apologize on my father's behalf.

282
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,640
Why are you apologizing?

283
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,720
You didn't hurt me.

284
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,360
Lord Rujrapeepat has resisted arrest
and escaped.

285
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,280
I think if Mek remains here,

286
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,600
he will be in danger.

287
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,480
Run.

288
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,280
Run?

289
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,160
I know my father better than anyone.

290
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,080
We must run.

291
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,920
Where are you going to run to?

292
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:00,280
These are all the documents
that need your attention today, sir.

293
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,560
Thanks.

294
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,200
You have a meeting in the afternoon on the
establishment of Chulalongkorn University

295
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,120
with the Ministry
of the Royal Household, sir.

296
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,520
Grandmother.

297
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,720
I have consulted with the minister
about the date of your wedding.

298
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:33,320
We have agreed on the beginning of
next month, as it is most auspicious.

299
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,320
In ten days' time?

300
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:45,000
Lady Pa is here with the guest list
from her side of the family.

301
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:52,680
You and Lady Pa must start inviting
these guests in person tomorrow.

302
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,600
Go and tell him.

303
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,520
- You go.
- You go!

304
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,000
Mhay just told us that his master
won't be able to come here tomorrow, sir.

305
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,560
The Wisut family's heir

306
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,160
and the only daughter
of the Minister of Education

307
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,400
are getting married?

308
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,440
They are perfect for each other.

309
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,040
It is very honorable, Your Highness.

310
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,240
We extend the invitation to you, sir.

311
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,400
We'll understand if you cannot--

312
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,880
I'll be there.

313
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,080
It's the wedding of Count Thee
and Lady Pa, after all.

314
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,960
How could I miss it?

315
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,320
How many days has it been?

316
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:08,920
I don't know.

317
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,560
Jam!

318
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,440
Mhay?

319
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,320
What are you doing here?

320
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,880
I have some banana stalks with me.
They're good in soup.

321
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,680
Go on and take them for your soup.

322
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,960
Oh, right! How kind of you!

323
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,320
I'll be sure to make a good soup.

324
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:50,080
Enjoy it.

325
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,640
I'm off, then.

326
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,680
All right.

327
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,760
Good luck.

328
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,560
Here, sir.

329
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,200
<i>I will send someone to pick you up at</i>
<i>your residence at four o'clock tomorrow.</i>

330
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,480
<i>You have to show up.</i>

331
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,520
<i>Thee.</i>

332
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,080
Thee.

333
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,040
Rati.

334
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,640
How much I've missed you.

335
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,920
It's been so long.

336
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,640
Are you tired?

337
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,840
I will go through anything if it means
I get to spend a little time with you.

338
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,960
When will we be able
to meet again like this?

339
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,600
The time we have left to spend together
is so quickly depleting.

340
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,120
Do not worry about
what hasn't yet happened,

341
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,920
or a time that hasn't yet come.

342
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,720
The best we can do is
make the most of today,

343
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,800
so we can be together openly
and never part from each other again.

344
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,360
I shall wait.

345
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,680
I will make it happen.

346
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,600
WANTED

347
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,400
Watch it!

348
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,520
Watch it!

349
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,240
Hey! Watch where you're going!
You startled my passenger!

350
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,840
It's your fault, you servant!

351
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,240
Oh, you foul mouth!

352
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,520
Don't you know who I am!

353
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,200
I don't know and I don't care.

354
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,000
We're both human beings! We're all equal!

355
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,320
Don't you dare look down on me!

356
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,680
Guys, get him!

357
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,080
You look down on us, huh?

358
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,040
Scum!

359
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,240
How dare you?!

360
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,240
You snob!

361
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,680
Give him more!

362
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,080
You think we're below you, huh?

363
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
You snob!

364
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,680
Darn it!

365
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:11,800
You should take your clothes off
before you get sick.

366
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,239
Right.

367
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,080
Let me dry your hair.

368
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,000
I can do it myself.

369
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,199
Grandmother.

370
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,440
Shame on you!

371
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,800
And what is this? What is it?

372
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,360
Rati and I love each other
sincerely and strongly.

373
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,720
We feel for each other

374
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,760
the way a man feels for a woman.

375
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,800
We have good intentions
towards each other.

376
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:21,240
I never wanted to hide
my relationship with Rati

377
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:24,600
because I know I am certain about him

378
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,720
and will never change my mind.

379
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,840
Please give me back my locket.

380
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,160
I will have your father

381
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:57,120
request the royal matrimonial water
for you and Lady Pa.

382
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,720
Do you understand?

383
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,840
I would rather die

384
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,720
than be embarrassed
for the rest of my life.

385
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,680
The lives of all the Wisut family members

386
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,480
are in your hands.

387
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,720
Whatever you do,

388
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,960
think about the consequences.

389
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,520
Please do not request
the royal matrimonial water, Grandmother.

390
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,400
You are using it to control me.

391
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,560
I'm begging you.

392
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,440
Everything I do is to preserve
the pride and honor of our family.

393
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,120
But this is my life!

394
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,600
It's not your life!

395
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,680
It's not anyone in this family's life!

396
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,160
Thee.

397
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,360
Listen to me.

398
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,400
You belong to the Wisut family.

399
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:23,440
You are not free to do things that
would bring dishonor to my family.

400
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,480
I will never yield.

401
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,840
Grandmother.

402
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:36,200
Will the only time you ever let me go
be at my funeral?

403
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,480
Get out!

404
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,280
Go!

405
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,400
Have a hot cup of ginger tea, sir.

406
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,240
It will help you sleep.

407
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,400
Jam. Kui.

408
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,240
What happens if one refuses
the royal matrimonial water?

409
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,760
It is a crime, sir.

410
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,240
It is a grave offense against the nation.

411
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,200
What should I do?

412
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,960
THEE

413
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,760
I solemnly swear to the Goddess Ganga

414
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,680
and all the deities here tonight

415
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,600
that, from now on, my body and my soul

416
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,520
will long for Thee,

417
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,680
and only for Thee.

418
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,720
I don't know right now
how to make our love possible,

419
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,000
but as long as you don't give up on me,

420
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,760
I won't give up on us, either.

421
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,440
I will do everything possible

422
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,440
to let us be together
like any other couple…

423
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,840
no matter how hard it gets,

424
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,400
and even if it costs me my life.

425
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,480
Thee.

426
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,480
Come with me.

427
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,520
My acquaintance asked me to tell you
he is repaying your favor

428
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,560
by letting you two stay at his place
for as long as you like.

429
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,600
Her Highness refuses to call off
the wedding between you and Lady Pa.

430
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,880
They are preparing for the ceremony.

431
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,240
<i>We have no choice but to part.</i>

432
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:46,960
<i>Let us savor happiness in this sanctuary</i>
<i>until the very last day.</i>

433
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,160
I want to be with you like this forever.

434
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,600
<i>"Memoir of Rati"?</i>

435
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,920
<i>Whenever you miss me,</i>
<i>write in this memoir.</i>

436
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,320
<i>Save every memory for me.</i>
