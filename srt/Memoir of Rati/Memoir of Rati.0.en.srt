1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:03,450
Hello.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,000
I’m Theerathon.

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,800
Or Count Suratheetamtanapich.

4
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:10,500
But by all means, call me P’Thee.

5
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:15,900
Hello.

6
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:17,300
I am Rati.

7
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,500
I am the penman behind the Memoir of Rati.

8
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,540
Hello, sir.

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,700
I’m Mek.

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,640
Hello.

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,500
I’m Mom Luang Dechapatrapee Suriyakorn.

12
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:54,050
<i>He reigns, O, he reigns</i>

13
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:56,820
<i>He reigns over Wiang Chai</i>

14
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,820
<i>Where his people live in peace</i>

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,900
It’s called Nang Phattalung.

16
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,000
The Siamese government would like our officials

17
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,710
to learn the language and culture
of our great friends from France.

18
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,970
I hope you will do your best as an interpreter.

19
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,700
I will not let you down, Father.

20
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,460
To sum up Memoir of Rati,
[GREAT SAPOL AS THEERATHON / INN SARIN AS RATI]

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,530
as the title suggests,
it is from the memoir of Mr. Rati.

22
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:40,310
It’s from his diary,
reciting his journey from France.

23
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:44,140
Rati is a Thai who grew up in France.

24
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,810
He has a chance to come back to
his homeland and recount the story in his diary.

25
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,940
Mainly it is about
Rati’s encounter with Theerathon.

26
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,200
Rati is a French teacher

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,050
who travels to Thailand with
the French diplomatic mission.

28
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:05,400
Rati receives a mission
from the Thai authorities

29
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,260
to teach French to the Thai students there.

30
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,120
These students are
the upper crust of Thai society.

31
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:16,140
He’s one of the students as well.

32
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,900
I play the earl of the Ministry of Education.

33
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:21,880
He’s also involved in the country’s Foreign Affairs.

34
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,130
I’m not the only student there.

35
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,420
- Almost all the officials must take his class.
- I have 20 students!

36
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,090
Right.

37
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,670
There will be conflicts between them.

38
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,530
Since everyone is in his class,
there are bound to be some issues arising.

39
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,160
Fight!

40
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,960
Our winner!

41
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,680
Thanks for the money.

42
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,670
As for us,
[AOU THANABOON AS MEK / BOOM THARATORN AS DECH]

43
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,890
we find love in the muay ring.
[AOU THANABOON AS MEK / BOOM THARATORN AS DECH]

44
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:50,690
We do.

45
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:53,190
Their first meet is in the ring.

46
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,720
They just don’t know each other at the time.

47
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,190
He sees me. I don’t see him.

48
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,160
Right.

49
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,810
He’s a better fighter and he defeats me.

50
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,160
That shocks him.

51
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,670
And Mek happens to get a job as
a cleaner at the school he goes to.

52
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:13,520
There’ll be some obstacles for these two.

53
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:16,080
There’ll also be some romantic moments.

54
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,690
You gotta stay tuned to see how things
will turn out for all four of us.

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,700
My name is Theerathon.

56
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,990
Mr. Theerathon.

57
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,610
My name is—

58
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,250
Rati.

59
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,510
It means pleasure.

60
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,000
It is a pleasure to meet you.

61
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:32,790
I play Theerathon or Count Suratheetamtanapich.

62
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,930
Mr. Thee here is gentle and smart,

63
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,630
and he knows how to read people.

64
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,370
More importantly, what I like about him is

65
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,130
the fact that he’s a family man

66
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,340
who cares and appreciates the people he loves.

67
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,000
Unless they’re his family or his beloved,

68
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,970
he’s ready to stand up to anyone else
to protect his own people.

69
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,490
P’Thee is the eldest son of
the Suangsuralai House.

70
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:03,600
He lives with his father and
his grandmother in the grand house.

71
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,960
But Thee also has a younger brother, Tiwa,

72
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,200
who was born from a different mother.

73
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,770
He lives in a separate house.

74
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:16,890
Thee is the earl of the Ministry of Education.

75
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,640
He’s a public servant working
in the Ministry of Education.

76
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:21,890
You’ll see him in neat clothes.

77
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,810
Mostly he wears a uniform.

78
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,760
As you can see, the collar comes up to here.

79
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,350
Almost all of Thee’s outfits are like that,
for work and for school.

80
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,930
This is how he’d dressed

81
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,980
in every scene.

82
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:38,810
But when he’s out with Rati,
or not fulfilling his duty,

83
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,130
he’s in more casual clothes.

84
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,600
He likes spending time with Rati.

85
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,040
Taking Rati to the temple or temple fair,

86
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,060
lotus picking, and lotus folding,

87
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,900
bringing Rati home to meet his family,

88
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:01,290
these are things Theerathon does only for Rati.

89
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,680
Let’s just agree that Thee is down bad.

90
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,840
He’s down bad and obvious about it.

91
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:12,890
He’s not shy to show his feelings for his beloved.

92
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,650
(How much, mister?)

93
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,170
2 for 20.

94
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,560
They’re small but you’re not allowed to complain.

95
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,170
This is my first time being in a period piece.

96
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,090
I’ve never worn anything like this.

97
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,180
These clothes are thick,

98
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,940
and we film in the sunlight…

99
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,390
I mean, it’s Thailand’s weather.

100
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,040
This is no weather for a heavy sweater like me.

101
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,660
But it’s really fun,

102
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,040
and I feel like I get to explore something new.

103
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,850
One of the hardest parts of of this role

104
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,360
is to adjust how fast I talk.

105
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,670
I’ve never been in a period piece,

106
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,780
so I don’t know how slow people from that era talked.

107
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,210
Should I speed up or slow down?

108
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,330
Do I pronounce every word more clearly?

109
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:07,370
It takes some time to adjust
my speech patterns to make it right.

110
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,290
Not too slow and not too fast.

111
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,540
Everything has to sound right

112
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,040
and fits well with this character.

113
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,330
Anyone interested in some grilled lotus stems?

114
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:21,170
Oh, it’s really hot. My flower is wilting.

115
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,840
P’Great is, like, so nice.

116
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,830
He’s super nice.

117
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,610
He’s so nice.

118
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,210
Agreed.

119
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,410
He’s full of warmth.

120
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,570
I understand why P’Inn enjoys being around him.

121
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,480
“Yes, Inn?”

122
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,070
He just folds when it comes to P’Inn. Every time.

123
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,380
- I just think that that’s lovely.
- Not just with P’Inn, though.

124
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,380
With everyone on set as well.

125
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,540
P’Great is always so polite with everyone.

126
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,990
When he calls our names, too.

127
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:55,000
<i>I feel as if my body would float far away
if I did not hold on to something.</i>

128
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,650
<i>I don’t quite know what it means.</i>

129
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,300
Mr. Rati.

130
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,030
Mr. Thee.

131
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,500
Will you call me by my name?

132
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,120
Rati is a Thai who grew up in France

133
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,360
with the diplomatic mission.

134
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,290
His father is the French ambassador.

135
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,720
He comes back to Thailand after 20 years.

136
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,850
Rati is a determined person.

137
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:20,200
He comes to Thailand from France with a job,

138
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,400
as one of the diplomatic mission
to be friends with the Thai government.

139
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,910
He’s also a teacher.

140
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,760
He teaches French.

141
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,330
Rati’s hobby is the very thing
that makes this series possible,

142
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,100
which is journaling.

143
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,940
There will be a lot of scenes like that, you’ll see,

144
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,940
where, at the end of each day,

145
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,300
Rati jots down his thoughts for the day.

146
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,180
He talks to his mother in his locket.

147
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,340
He writes everything down as memories.

148
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:00,410
Like I said, Rati leaves Siam when he is a boy,

149
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:02,210
and lives in France for 20 years.

150
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,980
Naturally he’s curious to find out
how this place is like now.

151
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,660
He goes back to the Suriyakorn Palace,
his adopted mother’s palace.

152
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,970
He also gets to meet P’Thee’s family.

153
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,220
His Grandma Princess

154
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,730
who objects to their relationship.

155
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:23,650
Everyone gets to wear the official uniform.

156
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,880
With a pair of silk pants.

157
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,450
I get to wear a suit made of wool.

158
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,520
Two-three layers—
Three layers, including the vest.

159
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,700
It’s really hot at the legation.

160
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,400
It’s also very beautiful.

161
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,530
You’ll get to see Rati’s different fashion.

162
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,510
There’s what he wears when he just
gets back from France,

163
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,060
and what he wears after being
in Thailand for a while.

164
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,870
The wardrobe changes with
the character development.

165
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,350
I’ve been in more than 10 series,

166
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,550
and nothing is as difficult as
speaking French.

167
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:03,380
I mean, I’d be fine if there were a few lines.

168
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,050
But since he’s a teacher, and an interpreter,

169
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,990
I have to speak a lot of French.

170
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:13,810
I have some scenes with a whole page of French.

171
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,810
Or worse, in a drama scene with his father,

172
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,300
the French script is three pages long.

173
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,130
Three pages of nothing but French.

174
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:35,930
It’s tough work.

175
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,600
First of all, I have to take some classes.

176
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,680
I have to learn the basic
pronunciation of French.

177
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:48,680
Second, there’s a French teacher on set, one-on-one.

178
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,900
Lastly, I have to remember the lines.

179
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,930
I have the teacher behind the camera,
as well as a personal prompter.

180
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:58,090
This whole thing is new to me as an actor.

181
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,060
I honestly didn’t expect P’Inn
to speak fluent French on set.

182
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,940
He’s like a native speaker.

183
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,370
Wow, P’Inn, hear that?

184
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:09,100
He clearly works hard for the character.
Because that is so obviously hard to do.

185
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,730
This matter Siam wants with you…

186
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,610
Whatever you see fit, I will respect it.

187
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,390
Besides the language barrier,

188
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,210
one more thing I have to do is lose weight.

189
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,210
Rati is a charming man.

190
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,290
With all these characters around him,

191
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,090
he’s an outstandingly charming man.

192
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:29,700
He seems delicate and gentle.

193
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,080
So I lost some weight for the role.

194
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:33,800
When I started filming, I was 74kg in weight.

195
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:35,780
But I was 63kg after a while.

196
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,600
11 kilograms for Memoir of Rati.

197
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,470
Pull the chariot.

198
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,460
Hey, this isn’t hard.

199
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:44,850
I thought it would be hard.

200
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,910
When I learned that the series
is based on a period novel,

201
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,250
I… I learned this from P’Aof.

202
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,400
You, too, I think.

203
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:56,140
P’Aof called me at, like, midnight,

204
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:01,000
to tell me about this novel he found interesting.

205
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:04,380
It’s a romantic period piece.

206
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,840
I’ve always wanted to be in a romantic period piece, too.

207
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,800
So I was hooked right away.

208
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,410
(Careful.)

209
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:20,260
Sharing the scene with P’Great
is always so smooth.

210
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,290
It’s…

211
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,810
I’d say we fit perfectly together as actors.

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,890
I feel like we can get in characters very quickly.

213
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:35,000
With P’Great, I feel like we’re instantly in sync.

214
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:37,330
It’s simple and easy to work with.

215
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,890
Everyone’s happy with it.

216
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,080
Their chemistry is atomic.

217
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:41,730
Totally!

218
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,600
They’re so good.

219
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,690
You think it’s oozing out of your screen?

220
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,570
Imagine what it’s like behind the camera.

221
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,920
We’re brainrotting over here, let’s say.

222
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,890
There’s this scene we film at night.

223
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,860
It was cold at the time.

224
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,190
And we were in an air-conditioned room.

225
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,460
The cold doesn’t really bother P’Great usually

226
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,610
while P’Inn gets cold all the time.

227
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,700
P’Inn was wrapped up in his blanket
and sitting against P’Great like this.

228
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,390
Yep.

229
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,370
They’re adorbs.

230
00:14:02,707 --> 00:14:04,177
Our winner!

231
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:05,797
Thanks for the money.

232
00:14:09,007 --> 00:14:09,587
Hold on.

233
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:12,357
I need to know who that man is.

234
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:15,917
Mek is a hard-working man.
[AOU THANABOON AS MEK]

235
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:16,307
[AOU THANABOON AS MEK]

236
00:14:16,307 --> 00:14:18,147
He doesn’t shy away from work.
[AOU THANABOON AS MEK]

237
00:14:18,327 --> 00:14:20,117
He’s also determined.

238
00:14:20,157 --> 00:14:22,067
Whatever pays, he’ll take it.

239
00:14:22,097 --> 00:14:25,817
His main jobs are the rickshaw and muay.

240
00:14:25,977 --> 00:14:27,477
Mek is actually very calm.

241
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:28,557
He’s nice.

242
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:29,677
He loves his family.

243
00:14:30,007 --> 00:14:32,537
Mek is really hard-working.
[BOOM THARATORN AS DECH]

244
00:14:32,557 --> 00:14:34,307
He’s constantly working.

245
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:36,917
But he’s not just like that with work,

246
00:14:37,317 --> 00:14:39,597
he’s also diligent.

247
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:41,457
He works hard to save up money

248
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:45,377
so he can follow his dreams and goals.

249
00:14:45,397 --> 00:14:48,797
That’s what’s so different from this Young Master Dech.

250
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:51,007
He was born with a silver spoon.

251
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:53,797
The one thing he lacks is passion.

252
00:14:53,807 --> 00:14:56,987
And that’s what he recognizes in this man.

253
00:14:57,067 --> 00:15:02,037
That’s what makes Dech feel like
there’s a purpose to life after all.

254
00:15:02,287 --> 00:15:04,587
The difficulty for this role is muay.

255
00:15:05,077 --> 00:15:06,817
I’ve never done that before.

256
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:09,137
His mannerism is also hard.

257
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:10,187
I play a commoner,

258
00:15:10,197 --> 00:15:13,837
so he addresses the other characters with different titles.

259
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,897
There is specific vocabulary for each title.

260
00:15:15,907 --> 00:15:18,477
So I really gotta learn these words carefully

261
00:15:18,497 --> 00:15:20,767
to make this as realistic as possible.

262
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:24,447
You’re a gentleman and you’re rich,

263
00:15:24,937 --> 00:15:26,137
why do you fight?

264
00:15:31,877 --> 00:15:32,987
I learned how to do muay thai.

265
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:35,417
Well, it’s not exactly that.

266
00:15:35,427 --> 00:15:39,787
My personal trainer knows a little muay thai,

267
00:15:39,797 --> 00:15:42,667
so I was taught some of it

268
00:15:42,677 --> 00:15:44,387
to make it look more natural on screen.

269
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:46,777
Mek is an all-around fighter.

270
00:15:46,797 --> 00:15:50,077
He knows muay tab chak,
he knows the arts of muay.

271
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:52,017
Whatever pays, he’ll do it.

272
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:59,257
How is this character dressed?

273
00:15:59,347 --> 00:16:02,967
I imagine he just puts on whatever
he can grab in the morning.

274
00:16:02,977 --> 00:16:05,407
Mostly, it’s a short-sleeved top like this,

275
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:06,517
because he pulls a rickshaw.

276
00:16:06,657 --> 00:16:08,977
With the hot weather,

277
00:16:08,987 --> 00:16:12,107
he dresses up for the occasion.

278
00:16:12,117 --> 00:16:15,817
There are scenes where Mek
works as a cleaner at a school,

279
00:16:15,837 --> 00:16:17,137
so he puts something more polite on.

280
00:16:17,157 --> 00:16:19,507
Long-sleeves and pants, for example.

281
00:16:19,757 --> 00:16:21,117
Don’t envy this character, guys.

282
00:16:21,127 --> 00:16:25,867
I have to darken my skin, the entire time.

283
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:29,217
Imagine the weather while filming,
the lotion feels super sticky on my skin.

284
00:16:29,457 --> 00:16:33,447
The lotion feels sticky and leaves stains on everything.

285
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:34,717
So no, don’t envy Mek.

286
00:16:36,527 --> 00:16:37,977
Don’t touch me. You’ll stain me.

287
00:16:40,117 --> 00:16:42,137
It takes half an hour to get done,

288
00:16:42,157 --> 00:16:43,217
and another hour to wash off.

289
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:46,147
It’s not just my arms, but my back, too.

290
00:16:46,157 --> 00:16:47,457
Someone helps me put it on,

291
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:50,537
but I gotta wash it off myself.

292
00:16:50,547 --> 00:16:52,667
If I don’t wash it off properly, I stain my bed.

293
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:54,107
Don’t—

294
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:55,757
No!

295
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:57,447
He really stained me.

296
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:58,977
I’m not playing with you anymore.

297
00:16:59,007 --> 00:17:02,197
Every time we’re done filming the wide short,

298
00:17:02,217 --> 00:17:06,467
and moving to more close-up shot,

299
00:17:06,487 --> 00:17:08,747
I gotta have my makeup redone, every time.

300
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:11,667
The weather is hot and I sweat.

301
00:17:11,677 --> 00:17:16,397
Or maybe it gets faded

302
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:18,067
or washed off with my sweat.

303
00:17:18,277 --> 00:17:20,017
So I always have it redone.

304
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,707
P’Boom literally refuses to stay around me on set.

305
00:17:22,727 --> 00:17:23,307
True.

306
00:17:23,697 --> 00:17:25,077
He said, “Aou, stay away from me.”

307
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,337
Well, he stains me.

308
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:30,787
Keep in mind that I wear a uniform.

309
00:17:30,797 --> 00:17:32,617
- It’s white.
- It’s all white.

310
00:17:32,907 --> 00:17:35,127
I mean, we can’t always avoid it.

311
00:17:35,207 --> 00:17:39,447
When he touches me, he leaves a handprint.

312
00:17:39,647 --> 00:17:41,217
Aou’s handprint.

313
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:44,467
The wardrobe staff gotta clean it every time.

314
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,287
I just thought it was easier to just avoid him,

315
00:17:46,307 --> 00:17:47,747
like, “Go away.”

316
00:17:51,387 --> 00:17:52,047
Get away!

317
00:17:53,317 --> 00:17:54,017
Ow!

318
00:17:54,627 --> 00:17:57,567
Well, Aou is huggable today.

319
00:17:57,647 --> 00:18:00,217
Usually, I don’t let him anywhere near me.

320
00:18:00,637 --> 00:18:02,207
He’ll only stain me.

321
00:18:03,757 --> 00:18:06,427
You were kind enough to
not get me in trouble for hitting you.

322
00:18:06,687 --> 00:18:09,347
Now you’re teaching me how to read and write.

323
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:12,417
You are a literal angel, my Lord.

324
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:16,067
I play Young Master Dech.

325
00:18:16,237 --> 00:18:19,147
He’s a stubborn boy.

326
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:21,507
He refuses to do what someone expects of him.

327
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:23,347
He’s a headstrong man.

328
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:27,837
He’s a student.

329
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:29,397
So that’s how he meets Rati.

330
00:18:29,407 --> 00:18:31,507
Rati teaches at his school.

331
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:33,717
Dech is Lord Ruj’s son.

332
00:18:33,767 --> 00:18:37,847
Lord Ruj lives in the Suriyakorn Palace.

333
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:41,957
This is the palace Rati’s mother, Rung, grew up in.

334
00:18:41,977 --> 00:18:47,377
Lord Ruj has an obvious disdain for Rati.

335
00:18:47,397 --> 00:18:49,557
But Dech doesn’t.

336
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:55,107
Dech helps Rati when he can
and always encourages him.

337
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:59,797
Dech wants to live his own life,

338
00:18:59,817 --> 00:19:02,717
not the life his father wants for him.

339
00:19:03,097 --> 00:19:05,917
That’s why he does muay tab chak.

340
00:19:06,287 --> 00:19:08,027
Mek happens to be a fighter himself.

341
00:19:08,187 --> 00:19:10,797
At a temple fair, as Mek is walking by,

342
00:19:10,807 --> 00:19:18,037
he sees Dech in the ring,
daring people to fight him.

343
00:19:18,147 --> 00:19:21,617
So Mek gets in the ring as well
and that’s their first meeting.

344
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:31,527
The hardest part for this character is probably

345
00:19:31,997 --> 00:19:32,897
how he speaks.

346
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:36,437
I’m a yapper and I don’t make sense most of the time.

347
00:19:36,457 --> 00:19:40,997
But I gotta follow my lines almost 100%

348
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:44,877
since the character’s mannerism is different.

349
00:19:45,147 --> 00:19:50,067
I have to work on my speech
to make it fit with the period.

350
00:19:50,677 --> 00:19:52,147
You must have meant to pull a prank on me.

351
00:19:53,597 --> 00:19:55,717
Why would I do that, sir?

352
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:58,787
In this series, it’s about…

353
00:19:58,807 --> 00:19:59,417
Friendship.

354
00:19:59,437 --> 00:20:01,727
Friendship, yes. They’re friends.

355
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,387
Usually, our characters in other series start off as boyfriends.

356
00:20:05,397 --> 00:20:06,257
Right.

357
00:20:06,277 --> 00:20:07,717
But in this series,

358
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:10,547
we see their development from strangers…

359
00:20:10,567 --> 00:20:11,427
Right.

360
00:20:11,457 --> 00:20:13,067
To rivals.

361
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,937
And it goes from there.

362
00:20:14,977 --> 00:20:17,117
They’re a bit intense.

363
00:20:17,697 --> 00:20:18,557
What do you mean by that?

364
00:20:18,637 --> 00:20:19,277
Well, they are!

365
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:22,307
- Our pair is romantic, right?
- I see.

366
00:20:22,337 --> 00:20:24,077
Those two are so intense.

367
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,717
Their affection and their…

368
00:20:27,387 --> 00:20:31,347
their language of love are
a bit more intense than our pair.

369
00:20:31,627 --> 00:20:33,087
Once I accept you as my own,

370
00:20:33,187 --> 00:20:34,937
you are mine for the rest of our lives.

371
00:20:40,477 --> 00:20:46,667
The Suriyakorn Palace is home to one family.

372
00:20:46,687 --> 00:20:50,237
This includes Rati’s grandfather,

373
00:20:50,257 --> 00:20:52,897
and also Young Master Dech,

374
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:53,917
Lord Ruj,

375
00:20:54,457 --> 00:20:56,177
A lowlife like you dares to teach me?

376
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:00,207
P’Nam plays Lord Ruj.

377
00:21:00,757 --> 00:21:01,797
He’s the bad guy.

378
00:21:01,947 --> 00:21:03,617
He is the obstacle.

379
00:21:04,107 --> 00:21:05,517
He doesn’t like Rati,

380
00:21:05,527 --> 00:21:07,147
because, as I told you before,

381
00:21:07,257 --> 00:21:11,017
first, Rati is the son of his sister, Lady Rung,

382
00:21:11,097 --> 00:21:13,157
who has passed away.

383
00:21:13,387 --> 00:21:15,407
Second, Rati is raised by Lutine,

384
00:21:15,427 --> 00:21:17,157
and Lord Ruj hates him, too.

385
00:21:17,187 --> 00:21:18,897
Not to mention he is raised abroad.

386
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:21,267
When he comes back, he’s back as one
of the diplomatic missions.

387
00:21:21,297 --> 00:21:26,367
So Ruj thinks Rati must be arrogant
when he’s moved up in society.

388
00:21:26,377 --> 00:21:29,767
That’s why he has so much hatred
and contempt for Rati.

389
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:30,857
I feel awful.

390
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:32,857
- I feel sorry for him.
- It’s okay.

391
00:21:33,177 --> 00:21:36,317
Lord Ruj is none other than my father.

392
00:21:36,547 --> 00:21:39,117
He’s a strict guy.

393
00:21:39,237 --> 00:21:40,907
He’s a strict father.

394
00:21:41,207 --> 00:21:42,037
He’s strict with everyone.

395
00:21:42,047 --> 00:21:44,917
He wants things done exactly according to him.

396
00:21:45,267 --> 00:21:47,017
He’s mean and strict.

397
00:21:47,327 --> 00:21:48,627
Not with himself, though.

398
00:21:48,647 --> 00:21:50,777
“You must not skip class. But I will.”

399
00:21:50,797 --> 00:21:51,497
You know what I mean?

400
00:21:51,517 --> 00:21:53,147
Well, he’s ruthless.

401
00:21:53,157 --> 00:21:53,917
He is!

402
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,507
This character is the most ruthless in the series.

403
00:21:56,527 --> 00:21:57,307
Right.

404
00:21:57,477 --> 00:21:59,247
P’Nam sure knows how to act.

405
00:21:59,507 --> 00:22:01,597
Even after we hear “Cut,” he keeps going.

406
00:22:01,907 --> 00:22:04,197
No cameras are in sight, but he’s in character.

407
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:05,417
Father.

408
00:22:05,467 --> 00:22:06,037
Hmm?

409
00:22:06,097 --> 00:22:07,767
How are we today? Having fun?

410
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:10,917
Your father has lost his voice.

411
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,407
I think this is one of the worst characters
I’ve played in my life.

412
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:15,397
Really?

413
00:22:16,017 --> 00:22:17,577
Normally I play good guys.

414
00:22:18,157 --> 00:22:21,267
Lady Rung’s married to Rati’s father,
who is the French ambassador,

415
00:22:21,277 --> 00:22:22,587
named Lutine.

416
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:24,917
So it’s Lutine and Rati.

417
00:22:25,207 --> 00:22:28,167
The dad-son duo of Lutine-Rati.

418
00:22:28,177 --> 00:22:31,517
When his mother dies, they return to Thailand.

419
00:22:31,817 --> 00:22:33,347
This matter Siam wants with you…

420
00:22:33,377 --> 00:22:35,627
Whatever you see fit, I will respect it.

421
00:22:36,237 --> 00:22:39,867
He’s a father who has…

422
00:22:40,047 --> 00:22:42,527
expectations for his son.

423
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:44,807
He wants his son to do his duty well.

424
00:22:44,817 --> 00:22:47,697
Be a good teacher,

425
00:22:47,707 --> 00:22:51,867
or represent France well.

426
00:22:51,897 --> 00:22:53,417
He’s quite disciplined.

427
00:23:02,697 --> 00:23:03,267
Cut!

428
00:23:04,937 --> 00:23:08,087
P’David is French.

429
00:23:08,107 --> 00:23:10,597
He speaks French in his day-to-day life.

430
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,807
He’s a native.

431
00:23:13,127 --> 00:23:15,617
But even as a native speaker,

432
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:17,997
he still has to consult our dialect coach.

433
00:23:18,017 --> 00:23:25,937
The French used in the series
is the French spoken during that period.

434
00:23:26,147 --> 00:23:30,287
So David himself has to
get familiar with the lines, too.

435
00:23:46,978 --> 00:23:47,718
Thee.

436
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:53,768
I hope their betrothal is still well in order.

437
00:23:55,378 --> 00:23:58,048
My family lives in the Suangsuralai House.

438
00:23:58,358 --> 00:24:01,428
Mae Goi plays my Princess Grandma.

439
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:05,138
My father is played by P’Jab.

440
00:24:05,158 --> 00:24:07,998
There’s also Tiwa and Miss Ruedi.

441
00:24:08,008 --> 00:24:10,408
She’s my father’s second wife.

442
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:15,298
The grandmother doesn’t like her much
so they live in a smaller house.

443
00:24:15,438 --> 00:24:18,888
I understand you come from a free country.

444
00:24:19,028 --> 00:24:23,758
But “free” does not mean
you can harm anyone as you wish.

445
00:24:24,058 --> 00:24:26,678
Grandmother is a very conservative lady.

446
00:24:26,928 --> 00:24:34,178
Everything must be done correctly
according to traditions.

447
00:24:34,258 --> 00:24:38,578
Both characters, mine and P’Jab’s,

448
00:24:38,588 --> 00:24:43,018
are expected to live their lives
according to the Grandmother’s plans.

449
00:24:43,058 --> 00:24:45,358
It’s as if everything’s been written

450
00:24:45,528 --> 00:24:50,818
according to what Grandma thinks
is right, correct, and appropriate.

451
00:24:51,138 --> 00:24:53,128
She believes the family’s image

452
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:56,288
is more important than
the happiness of her own offspring.

453
00:24:56,438 --> 00:24:59,178
(Can you show affection for him?)

454
00:24:59,208 --> 00:24:59,818
For me?

455
00:24:59,868 --> 00:25:00,848
(Yes.)

456
00:25:01,078 --> 00:25:03,168
(Since you two are not so friendly in the story.)

457
00:25:03,358 --> 00:25:04,708
Mae Goi is absolutely lovely.

458
00:25:04,718 --> 00:25:09,878
There’s a dramatic scene with her,

459
00:25:10,138 --> 00:25:12,138
where she isn’t exactly in the frame.

460
00:25:12,158 --> 00:25:15,298
I told her she didn’t have to act for that scene.

461
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:18,078
I told her to just take it easy and take a rest.

462
00:25:18,188 --> 00:25:19,658
But she didn’t listen to me at all.

463
00:25:19,668 --> 00:25:22,978
She walked right in and sat down,
and acted the scene out with me so seriously.

464
00:25:23,118 --> 00:25:26,238
I really appreciated her for that.

465
00:25:26,248 --> 00:25:28,308
She really works hard.

466
00:25:28,328 --> 00:25:29,768
She’s also really kind.

467
00:25:30,248 --> 00:25:32,638
They have their stuff!

468
00:25:33,108 --> 00:25:34,288
Let’s get inside and stay cool!

469
00:25:35,798 --> 00:25:38,908
The Siamese government would like our officials

470
00:25:39,358 --> 00:25:42,668
to learn the language and culture
of our great friends from France.

471
00:25:42,818 --> 00:25:45,978
My father in the series…

472
00:25:46,648 --> 00:25:49,378
He’s quiet and serene.

473
00:25:49,878 --> 00:25:53,448
He’s so different from Grandma.

474
00:25:53,578 --> 00:25:56,118
He’s been raised rather strict,
so he doesn’t want the same for his sons.

475
00:25:56,128 --> 00:26:04,648
But there are times when he doesn’t want to
force or go against the Grandmother as well.

476
00:26:04,658 --> 00:26:06,968
Let’s say, he understands his son,

477
00:26:07,088 --> 00:26:08,918
but he obliges his mother anyway.

478
00:26:09,248 --> 00:26:10,078
That’s about it.

479
00:26:13,188 --> 00:26:15,978
P’Jab is so well-versed with period drama.

480
00:26:15,998 --> 00:26:19,178
There are so many times that,
while reading the lines,

481
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:22,978
P’Jab can even tell when some words are wrong.

482
00:26:22,988 --> 00:26:28,758
He knows the lines and
the pronouns of that period well.

483
00:26:28,778 --> 00:26:31,738
He teaches me everything, really.

484
00:26:31,778 --> 00:26:34,718
I’m new to this.

485
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:36,228
And he’s been willing to show me the ropes.

486
00:26:36,468 --> 00:26:38,208
Even when I was sick,

487
00:26:38,608 --> 00:26:41,248
he came and talked to me.

488
00:26:41,628 --> 00:26:43,928
Please look forward to this series.

489
00:26:43,948 --> 00:26:49,328
It’s a period series, a period BL series.

490
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:53,238
The main characters are so adorable together.

491
00:26:53,248 --> 00:26:54,528
So please look out for it.

492
00:26:54,838 --> 00:26:55,978
This is Tiwa, my brother.

493
00:26:55,998 --> 00:26:57,188
Bonjour, P’Rati.

494
00:26:57,668 --> 00:27:01,078
Tiwa is my brother from a different mother.

495
00:27:01,118 --> 00:27:03,998
He’s a studious boy.

496
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:06,788
He loves learning new languages,

497
00:27:07,138 --> 00:27:08,648
including French.

498
00:27:08,658 --> 00:27:15,408
The first time he meets Rati, he remembers
something in French to say to Rati.

499
00:27:15,428 --> 00:27:17,808
He’s an adorable brother and an optimist.

500
00:27:18,118 --> 00:27:22,958
He doesn’t feel lacking in anyway,

501
00:27:23,338 --> 00:27:24,318
even though he can’t walk.

502
00:27:24,328 --> 00:27:26,148
He’s only got one trauma,

503
00:27:26,158 --> 00:27:28,968
which is the fact that he doesn’t see
his dad often enough.

504
00:27:29,068 --> 00:27:32,348
He feels like he’s been fenced off.

505
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,078
I’ll take you on a walk.

506
00:27:36,258 --> 00:27:37,968
I don’t want to go with him! Help!

507
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,198
Don’t scream when something happens.

508
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:46,628
Go!

509
00:27:48,618 --> 00:27:50,498
This is my first time working with Ford.

510
00:27:50,508 --> 00:27:54,448
When he’s in full costume,
I think the role suits him.

511
00:27:54,668 --> 00:27:57,508
He’s an adorable boy.

512
00:27:57,518 --> 00:28:02,828
When you let him play a bright character like that,

513
00:28:03,138 --> 00:28:09,168
and in that costume, he’s really Tiwa.

514
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:15,178
Miss Ruedi, I think,

515
00:28:15,668 --> 00:28:21,358
is who Tiwa gets his optimism and kindness from.

516
00:28:21,368 --> 00:28:24,938
These two are alike.

517
00:28:24,988 --> 00:28:28,168
They are both optimistic
despite being made to feel like outsiders.

518
00:28:28,178 --> 00:28:31,298
They are both so lively and full of love,

519
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:33,218
that even Theerathon feels it from them,

520
00:28:33,238 --> 00:28:35,518
regardless of coming from a different mother

521
00:28:35,538 --> 00:28:37,908
and getting all the love from the family.

522
00:28:37,978 --> 00:28:42,068
She’s very open-minded
and very accepting of Theerathon.

523
00:28:42,348 --> 00:28:43,028
Thee.

524
00:28:46,128 --> 00:28:48,068
You’re better for him than I am, aren’t you, Mr. Rati?

525
00:28:49,218 --> 00:28:51,528
Lady Pa is my fiancee.

526
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:53,448
She’s played by Kapook.

527
00:28:53,708 --> 00:28:58,478
She is chosen to marry me.

528
00:28:58,828 --> 00:29:01,028
Lady Pa is clever.

529
00:29:01,388 --> 00:29:04,768
She’s Siam’s iron woman, really.

530
00:29:04,918 --> 00:29:08,198
You gotta stay tuned to find out
why she’s an iron lady.

531
00:29:08,468 --> 00:29:11,528
See what happens
that makes me call Lady Pa that.

532
00:29:11,848 --> 00:29:14,958
She’s so decisive and strong.

533
00:29:15,298 --> 00:29:15,988
The name is Rati.

534
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:16,748
Rati.

535
00:29:17,168 --> 00:29:17,848
Rati.

536
00:29:18,458 --> 00:29:19,328
I said Ratee.

537
00:29:19,538 --> 00:29:20,248
Mr. Rati.

538
00:29:20,688 --> 00:29:22,168
I won’t hold it against you, Pa.

539
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:23,278
Why don’t you go and rest inside where it’s cool?

540
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:24,088
Okay!

541
00:29:24,618 --> 00:29:25,928
You stay outside.

542
00:29:27,518 --> 00:29:28,458
Working with Kapook?

543
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:29,998
She looks like a fierce lady, right?

544
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,568
But when you get to work with her,
you realize she’s a bit of a dork.

545
00:29:33,608 --> 00:29:39,448
She’s funny and always fun to be around.

546
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:41,138
You’re better than me, aren’t you?

547
00:29:41,178 --> 00:29:42,248
Stare at each other.

548
00:29:42,368 --> 00:29:44,478
Rati has a house. Rati has a car.

549
00:29:44,698 --> 00:29:46,388
Rati is an award-winning actor.

550
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:52,618
I hope you will do your best as an interpreter.

551
00:29:54,978 --> 00:29:56,088
What’s your name, sir?

552
00:29:57,438 --> 00:30:01,958
Prince Krom Phraya Vijit–Pijitpaibool.

553
00:30:03,818 --> 00:30:07,068
Prince Mai is a modern man.

554
00:30:07,258 --> 00:30:11,878
Despite outranking everyone in the series,

555
00:30:11,898 --> 00:30:17,968
he’s an open-minded man towards everything.

556
00:30:18,078 --> 00:30:19,078
They’re friends.

557
00:30:19,098 --> 00:30:23,438
But in being friends, they’re also a bit of rivals.

558
00:30:30,258 --> 00:30:31,368
P’Guy comes to work and fish.

559
00:30:31,728 --> 00:30:34,488
He brings his fishing rod to work.

560
00:30:34,498 --> 00:30:36,688
He’s so lively.

561
00:30:36,788 --> 00:30:38,878
Being around him is really fun.

562
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:40,008
I can talk to him about anything.

563
00:30:40,018 --> 00:30:42,208
We’re both gym freaks.

564
00:30:42,218 --> 00:30:43,478
So we get along.

565
00:30:43,488 --> 00:30:46,298
Something always makes us laugh.

566
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:47,178
Right.

567
00:30:47,618 --> 00:30:49,098
Mr. Mhay.

568
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:51,618
Mr. Mhay is my personal attendant.

569
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:54,008
He supports me in everything I do.

570
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:57,528
Whether it’s seeing Rati, or sneaking off at night,

571
00:30:57,548 --> 00:31:01,618
going out and whatnot, Mhay is there with me.

572
00:31:01,658 --> 00:31:04,738
I think deep down,
Thee thinks of him as a big brother.

573
00:31:04,748 --> 00:31:06,558
But with their social statuses,

574
00:31:06,578 --> 00:31:11,248
they are set to do what their duties dictate them to.

575
00:31:11,358 --> 00:31:12,478
P’Kui, P’Jam.

576
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:13,498
Yes, sir?

577
00:31:13,568 --> 00:31:15,178
Yes, sir? I’m here!

578
00:31:16,568 --> 00:31:17,418
P’Kui and P’Jam.

579
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,058
I call them P’.

580
00:31:19,678 --> 00:31:24,058
He has Mr. Mhay. I have P’Kui and P’Jam.

581
00:31:24,068 --> 00:31:26,138
They're Support A and Support B.

582
00:31:26,448 --> 00:31:29,808
They praise everything Rati does.

583
00:31:30,268 --> 00:31:35,858
When Rati has to make any decisions,

584
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:41,228
P’Kui and P’Jam are there to help weigh the options.

585
00:31:41,238 --> 00:31:44,788
They are such a delightful addition to the story.

586
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:49,898
These two characters make the series
more light-hearted and even more fun.

587
00:32:22,043 --> 00:32:23,643
It’s so good.

588
00:32:23,903 --> 00:32:25,293
I didn’t know who was singing.

589
00:32:25,703 --> 00:32:26,393
Oh, yeah.

590
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:30,293
One of the crew played it for us,
saying it’s the soundtrack.

591
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,453
This was during a meal.

592
00:32:31,463 --> 00:32:34,583
I listened to it and thought
that it’s perfect for this series.

593
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:36,333
It suits the story well.

594
00:32:36,353 --> 00:32:38,173
We learned later that it was performed by Ford.

595
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:39,483
I saw Ford’s photo in the studio,

596
00:32:39,503 --> 00:32:41,913
- but I didn’t suspect anything.
- I didn’t even see that.

597
00:32:41,983 --> 00:32:45,513
But Ford’s speaking voice is already nice.

598
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,823
So it’s no wonder he sings well.

599
00:32:59,493 --> 00:33:01,793
This is quite new to me.

600
00:33:01,883 --> 00:33:03,763
I’m nervous, but it’s a good challenge.

601
00:33:03,843 --> 00:33:04,793
It’s fun.

602
00:33:05,223 --> 00:33:06,603
We work really fast today.

603
00:33:06,623 --> 00:33:10,593
Working with these professionals
make things go so smoothly.

604
00:33:18,523 --> 00:33:21,113
We’re filming the MV
for the soundtrack, Miracle.

605
00:33:21,193 --> 00:33:23,483
It’s hard because I have to
pronounce the words well,

606
00:33:23,493 --> 00:33:25,673
get the emotions across,
and pause at the right time.

607
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:28,493
It has a traditional Thai music feel to it.

608
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:29,973
It’s such a romantic song.

609
00:33:29,983 --> 00:33:35,633
I want to get the emotions right.

610
00:33:35,843 --> 00:33:38,653
I can’t wait for you guys to hear the full version.

611
00:33:38,663 --> 00:33:42,603
I’m sure it will make your
watching experience even better.

612
00:33:51,383 --> 00:33:53,453
We’re in the studio today.

613
00:33:53,503 --> 00:33:55,223
It’s our duet.

614
00:33:55,253 --> 00:33:57,593
It’s called Forever….

615
00:33:57,613 --> 00:33:58,503
Written.

616
00:33:58,593 --> 00:34:00,803
You won’t get to hear it today, I’m afraid.

617
00:34:00,983 --> 00:34:05,193
You have to stay tuned to the series to hear it.

618
00:34:05,203 --> 00:34:06,903
Look forward to it.

619
00:34:06,913 --> 00:34:09,333
And please let us know what you think.

620
00:34:09,363 --> 00:34:10,823
It’s really good, I’m telling you.

621
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:13,793
When I go back to France,

622
00:34:14,033 --> 00:34:15,953
I will miss you dearly.

623
00:34:17,023 --> 00:34:19,893
I miss you as soon as you’re out of my sight.

624
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:22,603
I want everyone to pay attention to every scene.

625
00:34:22,713 --> 00:34:24,123
I agree.

626
00:34:24,143 --> 00:34:26,723
Every scene has been through
a thorough creative process.

627
00:34:26,723 --> 00:34:27,293
Right.

628
00:34:27,313 --> 00:34:30,513
The lighting, the camera work, the ambience.

629
00:34:30,523 --> 00:34:31,063
Yes.

630
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:33,833
- Everything is so detailed.
- Very detailed.

631
00:34:33,913 --> 00:34:35,163
The firework scene is amazing.

632
00:34:35,353 --> 00:34:36,573
It is.

633
00:34:36,753 --> 00:34:37,453
So there’s that scene.

634
00:34:37,463 --> 00:34:41,693
But there are scenes where everything
just blends in so well.

635
00:34:41,973 --> 00:34:42,583
Loads!

636
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:44,193
There are loads of them. They’re gorgeous shots.

637
00:34:44,203 --> 00:34:46,193
I love the beginning and the end.

638
00:34:46,223 --> 00:34:47,763
The Nang Phattalung scenes.

639
00:34:47,993 --> 00:34:50,103
You think it looks good in the pilot?
The real thing is even more elaborate.

640
00:34:50,173 --> 00:34:52,583
The whole puppet show theater was on set.

641
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:54,153
I kinda messed around a bit…

642
00:34:54,273 --> 00:34:56,613
I messed around.

643
00:34:56,633 --> 00:35:00,383
The puppet show crew was behind a curtain,
they don’t know what a speed camera is.

644
00:35:00,393 --> 00:35:04,603
I told them I wanted to see
some grand scenes from Ramayana.

645
00:35:04,623 --> 00:35:07,383
Oh, they got up at 2 in the morning
to put on a show for me.

646
00:35:07,633 --> 00:35:11,073
The crew finally told them,
“No, we don’t want that scene.”

647
00:35:11,163 --> 00:35:11,733
It was funny.

648
00:35:11,983 --> 00:35:12,833
It was fun.

649
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:14,373
It was beautiful!

650
00:35:14,393 --> 00:35:15,893
It really was.

651
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:19,113
And the way they sing…

652
00:35:19,163 --> 00:35:20,803
The Thai poetry they recite

653
00:35:21,003 --> 00:35:22,093
is so beautiful.

654
00:35:22,473 --> 00:35:24,673
It’s beautiful. You really gotta see them once.

655
00:35:24,883 --> 00:35:25,473
Fight!

656
00:35:26,393 --> 00:35:27,363
Go for it!

657
00:35:27,973 --> 00:35:29,043
Fight!

658
00:35:29,813 --> 00:35:33,863
There’s this interesting scene
between our characters.

659
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:36,333
Our muay scene.

660
00:35:36,673 --> 00:35:38,783
That scene is…

661
00:35:39,153 --> 00:35:41,463
That scene is muay tab chak.

662
00:35:41,843 --> 00:35:44,053
To fight in a muay tab chak bout,
you must have your eyes closed

663
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,193
and only listen to the footsteps
on dried palm leaves.

664
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:50,583
Since we can’t see anything,

665
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,493
we have to rehearse it a lot.

666
00:35:53,573 --> 00:35:54,323
Right.

667
00:35:54,683 --> 00:35:57,563
We just don’t want any mistakes
that result in injuries.

668
00:35:57,743 --> 00:36:00,243
I really want you to see that scene.

669
00:36:00,273 --> 00:36:02,323
We worked really hard for that,

670
00:36:02,533 --> 00:36:07,203
and we have to trust each other a lot.

671
00:36:07,763 --> 00:36:09,153
It was a struggle.

672
00:36:09,423 --> 00:36:11,983
- But it came out really well.
- It really did.

673
00:36:12,423 --> 00:36:14,563
The scene I don’t want anyone to miss

674
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:16,433
is the lovey-dovey scenes.

675
00:36:16,763 --> 00:36:17,783
Lovey-doodie.

676
00:36:18,483 --> 00:36:19,063
What?

677
00:36:19,373 --> 00:36:19,923
What?

678
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:22,873
There’s some sweet scenes, too.

679
00:36:22,883 --> 00:36:25,473
You gotta take your time
watching these characters.

680
00:36:25,493 --> 00:36:27,503
Because the story proceeds slowly,

681
00:36:27,763 --> 00:36:31,133
but you will, no doubt,
end up getting invested in them.

682
00:36:31,153 --> 00:36:31,693
Right.

683
00:36:31,803 --> 00:36:33,033
Are you messing with me?

684
00:36:33,213 --> 00:36:33,753
No.

685
00:36:33,763 --> 00:36:34,453
You sure?

686
00:36:34,663 --> 00:36:35,273
Yes.

687
00:36:35,333 --> 00:36:36,113
You sure?

688
00:36:36,233 --> 00:36:36,813
Yes.

689
00:36:36,823 --> 00:36:37,623
Sure sure?

690
00:36:37,673 --> 00:36:38,593
Sure sure.

691
00:36:38,703 --> 00:36:39,673
Why does no one yell “cut”?

692
00:36:41,463 --> 00:36:42,693
(Cut.)

693
00:36:45,473 --> 00:36:46,963
Aou is so unprofessional!

694
00:36:47,523 --> 00:36:52,673
This is one of the happiest sets I work on.

695
00:36:52,913 --> 00:36:54,963
The production is amazing.

696
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:56,123
The director is talented.

697
00:36:56,153 --> 00:36:57,343
The producers are nice.

698
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,303
We’re well fed and well rested.

699
00:36:59,763 --> 00:37:01,443
We do work a lot each day,

700
00:37:01,463 --> 00:37:04,703
since we film 25-30 scenes in a day,

701
00:37:04,713 --> 00:37:08,433
in extremely hot weather,
but everyone gives it their all.

702
00:37:08,623 --> 00:37:10,573
Makeup and hair is amazing, too.

703
00:37:10,593 --> 00:37:11,833
The artists are so great.

704
00:37:11,853 --> 00:37:13,763
Every outfit is a masterpiece.

705
00:37:14,113 --> 00:37:17,933
The props are so well made.

706
00:37:17,943 --> 00:37:19,333
The letters, for example,

707
00:37:19,563 --> 00:37:22,303
that the characters read in each scene,

708
00:37:22,433 --> 00:37:25,003
even knowing they won’t be on screen,
they’re all actual letters.

709
00:37:25,513 --> 00:37:26,883
I’ve never worked on a set like that.

710
00:37:26,963 --> 00:37:29,093
It’s not typed out, but handwritten.

711
00:37:29,703 --> 00:37:31,153
I’ve never seen such a thing.

712
00:37:31,193 --> 00:37:33,113
They don’t hold back with props.

713
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:35,363
Mind you, the script written
in the letters is in cursive,

714
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:37,063
for the French letters, too.

715
00:37:37,263 --> 00:37:38,953
I’m simply impressed.

716
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:40,133
It’s a difficult series to film.

717
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:42,473
You gotta have the location ready,

718
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:44,003
the wardrobe, the hair,

719
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:47,763
each scene is a whole work
that takes a lot of time.

720
00:37:47,973 --> 00:37:50,443
I thought it was going to be intense.

721
00:37:50,453 --> 00:37:52,863
But as it turned out, the crew has
made it a really fun experience.

722
00:37:52,873 --> 00:37:55,353
Someone is always cracking jokes.

723
00:37:55,363 --> 00:38:01,083
No matter how much pressure they are under,
no one has ever lashed out at anyone.

724
00:38:01,093 --> 00:38:04,883
There are some crew members
whom I’ve worked with before.

725
00:38:04,903 --> 00:38:08,093
So it’s been such a comfortable workspace for me.

726
00:38:08,483 --> 00:38:09,283
No pressure at all.

727
00:38:09,323 --> 00:38:11,503
The crew members are all so nice.

728
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:13,163
Everyone from the director
to every little crew member,

729
00:38:13,173 --> 00:38:15,483
the wardrobe team
and the makeup team, as well.

730
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:18,203
The makeup team has to work on my skin, right?

731
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:21,143
They feel bad for me
that I have to wash it off later.

732
00:38:21,153 --> 00:38:24,643
They worry it might get itchy.
I have my allergies and whatnot.

733
00:38:24,793 --> 00:38:26,783
So they feel bad and worry about me.

734
00:38:26,823 --> 00:38:31,563
The wardrobe was like,
“Let’s get you in long-sleeves today.”

735
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:33,693
And the director is always like,

736
00:38:33,753 --> 00:38:36,173
“I kinda feel bad for poor Mek.”

737
00:38:36,203 --> 00:38:40,603
I don’t get to work with veterans much.

738
00:38:40,663 --> 00:38:44,873
I wondered at first if I would
get along with the older actors.

739
00:38:44,883 --> 00:38:48,723
There are a lot of them on set
so I was worried at first.

740
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:50,643
But right from the first read-through,

741
00:38:50,693 --> 00:38:52,423
I learned that they are all so friendly.

742
00:38:52,433 --> 00:38:53,833
They are all so nice to me.

743
00:38:54,303 --> 00:38:57,043
I immediately felt comfortable
working with them.

744
00:38:57,193 --> 00:39:00,203
I’m always happy to be on set.

745
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:09,623
Kru Zhen is so nice.

746
00:39:09,883 --> 00:39:13,983
She’d always told me, as we started filming,

747
00:39:14,003 --> 00:39:16,213
to take it easy and just be myself.

748
00:39:16,223 --> 00:39:17,663
Just act how I interpret the character.

749
00:39:18,093 --> 00:39:19,693
I was always going to her,

750
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:22,703
asking if I got it right as Theerathon.

751
00:39:22,713 --> 00:39:24,793
She’d be like, “You’re him. Don’t worry.”

752
00:39:24,973 --> 00:39:27,713
It took me a while to get the character right.

753
00:39:27,903 --> 00:39:31,273
So I’d worry when filming
some emotional scenes,

754
00:39:31,283 --> 00:39:32,203
but she’d reassure me I did well.

755
00:39:32,213 --> 00:39:33,883
She told me not to think too much,

756
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:35,583
because that’s how I mess up the character.

757
00:39:35,593 --> 00:39:37,873
She’s always there to slap me into shape.

758
00:39:38,403 --> 00:39:39,913
She’s kind and funny, too.

759
00:39:40,323 --> 00:39:41,723
Oh, P’Zhen is just talented.

760
00:39:41,783 --> 00:39:43,713
She reads the screenplay so thoroughly

761
00:39:43,733 --> 00:39:46,683
and knows how to make
the scenes look beautiful.

762
00:39:46,793 --> 00:39:48,053
I know because I’ve seen it.

763
00:39:48,433 --> 00:39:49,913
Every frame is beautiful.

764
00:39:50,203 --> 00:39:51,783
We worked hard for it

765
00:39:51,803 --> 00:39:53,153
and it really paid off.

766
00:39:53,713 --> 00:39:57,903
She knows what she wants
from each character.

767
00:39:57,923 --> 00:39:59,603
And I love that it’s very obvious

768
00:39:59,613 --> 00:40:01,843
which makes it easier for me
to understand my character.

769
00:40:01,863 --> 00:40:06,243
I have my own interpretation on my character,

770
00:40:06,473 --> 00:40:10,013
and she helps flesh it out.

771
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:11,183
She’d let me know,

772
00:40:11,423 --> 00:40:12,353
which is nice.

773
00:40:12,733 --> 00:40:17,373
She’s one of the most
“on point” directors, I dare say.

774
00:40:17,673 --> 00:40:22,003
She knows what she wants.

775
00:40:22,593 --> 00:40:25,973
And she knows how to take us
actors as well as the crew

776
00:40:25,983 --> 00:40:29,643
in that direction for each scene.

777
00:40:29,743 --> 00:40:30,453
Quickly, too.

778
00:40:30,483 --> 00:40:32,813
We’re able to get everything done
on time because of her,

779
00:40:32,823 --> 00:40:34,763
and in a perfect manner.

780
00:40:41,223 --> 00:40:42,893
Nothing’s coming out.

781
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,263
Please look forward to this series.

782
00:40:47,283 --> 00:40:49,613
It’s got a lot of interesting points.

783
00:40:50,003 --> 00:40:54,703
We’re back in time
when this kind of love is forbidden.

784
00:40:54,713 --> 00:40:56,053
It’s a hidden kind of love.

785
00:40:56,073 --> 00:40:59,393
The relationships, not just Thee and Rati’s,

786
00:40:59,403 --> 00:41:01,703
include Dech and Mek’s,

787
00:41:01,783 --> 00:41:03,493
as well as the relations in each family.

788
00:41:03,583 --> 00:41:06,183
There are so many conflicts,

789
00:41:06,203 --> 00:41:08,603
and so many kinds of love in one story.

790
00:41:08,773 --> 00:41:10,263
And it’s not just romantic,

791
00:41:10,273 --> 00:41:12,243
but also funny.

792
00:41:12,493 --> 00:41:16,963
One more charm of Memoir of Rati

793
00:41:17,353 --> 00:41:19,233
is that this is an OG love.

794
00:41:20,293 --> 00:41:22,243
Love, back in the day, progresses gradually.

795
00:41:22,303 --> 00:41:27,133
These two exchange letters.

796
00:41:27,243 --> 00:41:29,903
They sneak off for a secret rendezvous

797
00:41:29,913 --> 00:41:31,363
at 9 p.m. behind a temple.

798
00:41:31,803 --> 00:41:32,963
I mean it!

799
00:41:32,973 --> 00:41:35,803
How does he first approach him?

800
00:41:35,813 --> 00:41:36,783
Take him to see his family.

801
00:41:38,043 --> 00:41:41,673
I don’t think you find that much
in modern-time series.

802
00:41:41,743 --> 00:41:44,263
This is a rare one.

803
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:46,793
I can’t wait for you to see it.

804
00:41:46,953 --> 00:41:50,313
I think there’s a lot of
unmissable points for this series.

805
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:52,673
It’s a GMMTV series, for one.

806
00:41:52,713 --> 00:41:55,143
And GMMTV’s first period series, no less.

807
00:41:55,153 --> 00:41:55,833
Right?

808
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:57,243
- Do you really wanna miss that?
- Right?

809
00:41:57,253 --> 00:41:58,343
And it’s a Cholumpi production.

810
00:41:58,353 --> 00:42:00,623
Their production is gorgeous.

811
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,213
Yes.

812
00:42:01,223 --> 00:42:06,503
They’re experts on period drama.

813
00:42:06,523 --> 00:42:08,673
- The series is full of top actors.
- All top actors!

814
00:42:08,683 --> 00:42:11,563
I mean, it’s GMMTV’s first period drama.
What more do you need?

815
00:42:11,573 --> 00:42:13,383
It’s not just a period drama,
it’s a BL period series.

816
00:42:13,403 --> 00:42:15,763
So many firsts.

817
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:17,343
And we really work hard for it.

818
00:42:17,353 --> 00:42:22,073
All in all, we just want you to give it a try.

819
00:42:22,103 --> 00:42:25,043
We work really hard on this.

820
00:42:25,053 --> 00:42:26,343
Not just us.

821
00:42:26,353 --> 00:42:28,593
This includes P’Great, P’Inn,
and the other actors,

822
00:42:28,603 --> 00:42:30,663
the director, as well as the crew members.

823
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:34,513
We all work hard to make this series a success.

824
00:42:34,523 --> 00:42:39,473
Please give Memoir of Rati a try.

825
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:44,103
My body and my soul long only for you.

826
00:42:44,303 --> 00:42:45,763
My body and my soul

827
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:49,793
also long only for you.

828
00:42:56,423 --> 00:42:59,053
Please look out for Thee or Theerathon.

829
00:42:59,063 --> 00:43:02,643
Let’s see if he’ll overcome
the obstacles in his life.

830
00:43:02,673 --> 00:43:05,093
And let’s see if he’ll win Rati over.

831
00:43:05,113 --> 00:43:09,803
Please check out Memoir of Rati.

832
00:43:10,153 --> 00:43:14,003
Lastly, I want you to adore my character, Rati,

833
00:43:14,013 --> 00:43:15,913
in Memoir of Rati.

834
00:43:15,943 --> 00:43:22,403
I work really hard as an actor
to bring him to life.

835
00:43:22,743 --> 00:43:25,713
I can’t wait for you to see him.

836
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:28,373
Besides Rati,

837
00:43:28,393 --> 00:43:30,723
please look forward to
the series Memoir of Rati.

838
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,943
And please root for the other actors
and characters, too.

839
00:43:34,253 --> 00:43:35,543
They work really hard on this.

840
00:43:35,553 --> 00:43:39,963
And I think every character
is charming in their own way.

841
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:42,093
Please enjoy the engaging story,

842
00:43:42,443 --> 00:43:49,063
but also the details of the production as well.

843
00:43:49,073 --> 00:43:53,403
You’ll realize that this series
really is rare, like I said before.

844
00:43:53,513 --> 00:43:58,703
Please keep Young Master Dech in your heart.

845
00:43:58,743 --> 00:44:00,803
I put my whole effort into this role.

846
00:44:00,813 --> 00:44:04,713
It’s such a challenging role for me.

847
00:44:04,733 --> 00:44:06,973
It’s also a challenge for Aou,

848
00:44:06,993 --> 00:44:08,033
for P’Great and P’Inn as well.

849
00:44:08,043 --> 00:44:13,033
This is the first time all four of us
get to work together.

850
00:44:13,053 --> 00:44:16,403
So please check out the series Memoir of Rati.

851
00:44:16,753 --> 00:44:19,623
Keep an eye out for Mek
and Young Master Dech,

852
00:44:19,633 --> 00:44:21,953
and their relationship.

853
00:44:21,963 --> 00:44:25,253
Let’s see in what direction
their relationship will head to,

854
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:28,213
how they’ll fall in love,

855
00:44:28,223 --> 00:44:29,963
and what obstacles wait for them.

856
00:44:30,183 --> 00:44:32,053
Please stay tuned.

857
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:36,923
You gotta stay tuned to see where
Theerathon and Rati will end up.

858
00:44:36,933 --> 00:44:43,793
See their journey from the beginning
and how sweet they are in…
