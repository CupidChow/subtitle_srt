1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:09,280
<i>Following the assassination</i>
<i>of the Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary</i>

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,840
<i>in Sarajevo,</i>

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,600
<i>tensions flared across Europe.</i>

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,040
<i>One month later,</i>

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,880
<i>the first bullet was fired.</i>

6
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,640
<i>Now, the world has been plunged</i>
<i>into a great war.</i>

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,760
<i>One which not only affects</i>
<i>the great nations of Europe</i>

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,200
<i>but which has spread unstoppably</i>
<i>to become the First World War.</i>

9
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,400
<i>On my return to Siam,</i>

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,640
<i>I wonder what awaits me.</i>

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,160
<i>Whatever it is,</i>

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,960
<i>I pray it's a good thing.</i>

13
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,960
It has been 20 years.

14
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,760
Everything looks so different now.

15
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,240
I do hope to meet

16
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,040
who I'm meant to meet.

17
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,320
Are you ready?

18
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,919
Yes.

19
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,200
- Why is there a French vessel in our port?
- We inquired with the French Legation.

20
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,400
The vessel belongs to
the French ambassador.

21
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,160
The French ambassador?

22
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,800
What business does France want with us,
to send an ambassador

23
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,640
when there is already a legation here?

24
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,480
CUSTOMS

25
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,520
WAT PHRAYA KRAI PIER

26
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,920
- Hello.
- Hello.

27
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,320
Please excuse us for not organizing
a more respectable reception.

28
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,440
We were not notified beforehand

29
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,520
that the French ambassador
would be arriving.

30
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,160
It's all right.

31
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:34,000
We received an order
to urgently deliver an important letter

32
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,800
to Siam.

33
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:41,880
Please, rest leisurely…

34
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,000
You are free to speak Thai, sir.

35
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,480
I will interpret for you.

36
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,160
Please rest leisurely for now.

37
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,320
We will notify His Majesty of your arrival

38
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,200
and will get back to you in due course.

39
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,200
"Please rest for now."

40
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,200
"We will request an audience
with His Majesty,

41
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,040
and will get back to you in due course."

42
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,760
Rati here is our interpreter.

43
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,920
He is also my son.

44
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,320
He said that my name is Rati.

45
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,840
I am the interpreter for
the French ambassador.

46
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,360
I am also his son.

47
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,640
You have the features of a Siamese,

48
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,560
but you are French?

49
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,200
SUANGSURALAI HOUSE

50
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,760
They said they came to deliver a letter,
but in wartime like this,

51
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,760
it is more likely that they are here to
pressure us to join the Entente.

52
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,520
One of the Central Powers, Germany,
has been a great ally to us, sir.

53
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,440
THE FRENCH LEGATION

54
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,560
A number of Prussians work for
the Siamese Government.

55
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,120
How are we to be certain
Siam remains neutral?

56
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,640
The countries around Siam

57
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,200
all belong to either France or England.

58
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,160
Siam is well aware
we can easily take them by force.

59
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,160
If we are too welcoming towards France,
it could be mistaken as us taking sides.

60
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,320
It could breach the neutral ground
we have established.

61
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,880
We don't need to…

62
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,440
place undue pressure on Siam.

63
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,280
It would only risk spreading hatred
among the Siamese.

64
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,800
But if we do not play along,

65
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,440
France would likely force us
to cede our lands again.

66
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,480
That Siamese interpreter…

67
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,120
Why has the French embassy employed
a Siamese man as their interpreter?

68
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:48,280
Rati. What do you think about this?

69
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,200
Rati.

70
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,960
We shall rely on you heavily
for the next month.

71
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,920
I hope you will do your job well
as an interpreter.

72
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,720
Do not forget that you are
my son, a Frenchman.

73
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,960
You must prioritize
what is best for France.

74
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,360
Mother Rung taught me well.

75
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,280
I won't allow her efforts to go to waste.

76
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,159
I won't let you down, Father.

77
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,720
There is nothing good about wars, Mother.

78
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,000
It's been nearly a year now,

79
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,640
and no one knows how long it will go on.

80
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,320
Excuse me,<i></i>my good sir.

81
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,160
Bonjour. My name is Jam, sir.

82
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,640
I am… at your disposal…

83
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,680
throughout… your stay, sir.

84
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:54,440
You can call me for anything
and everything, sir.

85
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,960
Would it be easier to converse in Thai?

86
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,200
I've brought you some Siamese attire.

87
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,960
If you ever need anything,
please call for Jam, sir.

88
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,840
That's a temple fair.

89
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,520
Temple fair?

90
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,840
Mother Rung told me

91
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,080
that a Siamese temple fair is
even more fun than an amusement park.

92
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,040
They are fun all right, sir.

93
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,880
Although they're full of thieves
these days.

94
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,720
Some of them even look like
proper gentlemen.

95
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,360
A clueless foreigner like you
would be an easy target for them.

96
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,920
You are not thinking about going,
are you, Mr. Rati?

97
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,040
Don't walk with your rumbling tum!
Try some soft-boiled rice!

98
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,040
Soft-boiled rice? Hot boiled rice is here!

99
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,000
Soft-boiled rice!
Want some soft-boiled rice?

100
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,480
Drinks? Jasmine tea?

101
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,480
One glass, please.

102
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,760
- Soft-boiled rice this way!
- Cotton candy!

103
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,040
- Sweet, beautiful cotton candy!
- All right. Hot boiled rice is on the way.

104
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,160
- Refreshing drinks.
- Soft-boiled rice?

105
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,720
<i>He reigns, O, he reigns</i>

106
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,680
<i>He reigns over Wiang Chai</i>

107
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,560
<i>Where his people live in peace</i>

108
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,880
It is called <i>Nang Phattalung.</i>

109
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,960
It's a famous shadow play from the South.

110
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,920
The government introduced it
so people here could watch.

111
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,560
The language might be quite hard
to understand for a foreigner like you.

112
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,760
You're mesmerized by a simple temple fair

113
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,640
and are wearing brand-new clothes.

114
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,640
I figured you weren't from Siam.

115
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,720
How knowledgeable and observant of you.

116
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,920
<i>Some of them even look like</i>
<i>proper gentlemen.</i>

117
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,080
A clueless foreigner like you
would be an easy target for them.

118
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,160
Thank you for the information.

119
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,640
RATI

120
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,880
- Thank you.
- Soft-boiled rice?

121
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,200
- How much?
- A quarter, sir.

122
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,880
My pouch!

123
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,040
Rati.

124
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,240
That's my name.

125
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,760
My sister embroidered it for me.

126
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,000
Rati. You have such a beautiful name.

127
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,080
- Thief!
- Thief!

128
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,160
- Thief! That's mine!
- Hey! Thief!

129
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,520
Back off. Let go!

130
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,800
Let go!

131
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,840
Sir! Are you hurt?

132
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,720
My pouch!

133
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,440
Give me back my pouch!

134
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,360
- Stop!
- Hey! Get out of my way!

135
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Get away!

136
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,320
Give me back my pouch. Stop!

137
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,120
Stop!

138
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,360
Stop! Give me back my pouch.

139
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,720
Give it back!

140
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,960
- What the hell?!
- Let go!

141
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,400
Let go of me!

142
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,520
Over here, officer.

143
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,880
Arrest him.

144
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,000
Halt!

145
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,640
- Take him!
- Arrest him, officer.

146
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,880
Get up.

147
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,160
Let go of me!

148
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,360
How dare you be rude to the officer?

149
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,600
Your sister embroidered your name on it.

150
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,560
The pouch must mean a lot to you.

151
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,960
"Rati" means pleasure.

152
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,440
It is a pleasure to meet you.

153
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,720
You thought I was a thief?

154
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,880
I am unfamiliar with this city.

155
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,800
I must stay vigilant, mustn't I?

156
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,440
You are right.

157
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,400
You must be especially careful
in a foreign land.

158
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,440
My name is Theerathon.

159
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,920
Please call me Thee.

160
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,840
Mr. Theerathon.

161
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,080
- My name is--
- Rati.

162
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,720
Mr. Rati.

163
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,160
Do you still think I am a thief?

164
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,920
Do you trust me now?

165
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,120
That will take some more time.

166
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,320
I can wait.

167
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,440
- If so…
- Yes?

168
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,440
Thank you.

169
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,040
You're buying me a new shirt?

170
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,040
Your shirt is all torn from
you trying to get my pouch back.

171
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,520
You bought several.

172
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,119
You're a foreigner,

173
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,440
but your generosity is certainly Siamese.

174
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,839
I will gladly accept your gift.

175
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
You don't sound like a commoner.

176
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,600
You don't sound like a foreigner.

177
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,880
Please get changed.

178
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,760
I will.

179
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,920
What are you looking at?

180
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,160
Nothing.

181
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,720
Hey, the fight is about to go down!
Let's go!

182
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
- Would you like to watch a muay fight?
- Muay?

183
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,600
Yes.

184
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,800
Let's go! Go for it!

185
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,000
- Come on!
- Get in.

186
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,520
Excuse me.

187
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,520
Mek, you good?

188
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,360
The match is still on!

189
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,320
Go, go, go!

190
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,800
- Go for it!
- Go, go!

191
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,480
Kick him to the corner!

192
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
Come at me!

193
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:11,160
- Get up!
- No, don't get up!

194
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,400
Get up!

195
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,520
- Get up!
- No, don't! Let that side win.

196
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,080
One. Two. Three.

197
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,800
Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine.

198
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
Ten.

199
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,400
- Get up!
- He won!

200
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,040
Does anyone want to challenge
our champion?

201
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,880
Win 20 baht as your prize!

202
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,040
Anyone?

203
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,920
- Anyone up for a challenge?
- He will!

204
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,560
You will? Come over here.

205
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,880
This man right here will.

206
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,920
- Come on here. Hurry up.
- Mr. Rati, I don't know muay.

207
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,560
I doubt that, Mr. Thee.
You handled that thief quite well.

208
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,920
- He will.
- Come on here.

209
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,200
I truly do not know muay.

210
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,160
My apologies.

211
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,200
I do not know muay.

212
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,360
Make up your mind.

213
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,480
Apologies.

214
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,440
Come on.

215
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,680
- Hurry up.
- Mr. Thee.

216
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,840
Anyone else?

217
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,080
Anyone else?

218
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,640
Anyone?

219
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,320
Give it up for our champion!

220
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,720
One more time!

221
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,080
Let's hear it for Mek!

222
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,200
- Sir.
- Aye?

223
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,480
I need to go to Princess Kaew…

224
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,960
You could have gotten me beaten up
back there, you know.

225
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,720
You seem well-built and strong.

226
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,600
I didn't dream that you didn't know muay.

227
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,080
- Fist fights are not my area of expertise.
- What is your expertise, then?

228
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Good question. I wonder what it is.

229
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,640
I'm going to look for something sweet.

230
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,000
No! Isn't it a crocodile?

231
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,800
It is a crocodile, all right.

232
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,040
Oh…

233
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,800
Any drinks?

234
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,480
Cold, refreshing drinks.

235
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,640
Soft-boiled rice.

236
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,000
What is it?

237
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,960
It is not proper to cut
a gentleman's path.

238
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,280
12, 13, 14.

239
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,520
15, 16, 17.

240
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,080
18, 19, 20.

241
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,960
Ouch.

242
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,920
Hey, Mek.

243
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,840
Give me a ride.

244
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,840
One quarter, my good sir.

245
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,200
You beat me bloody
and you're charging me money?

246
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,240
What do you even need all that money for?

247
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,200
I need it for…

248
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,440
"None of your business."

249
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,560
Please, sir.

250
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,080
It's just my bad luck
to have run into you.

251
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,440
Hold tight, sir.

252
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,240
This rickshaw is speedy.

253
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,200
- Let's go!
- Mek!

254
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,440
- Make way, ladies!
- I am an injured man!

255
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,640
Mek!

256
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,640
Stop!

257
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,000
Slow down!

258
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,360
Here they are.

259
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,680
Thank you.

260
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,160
Americans call it fairy floss.

261
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
It is made of sugar.

262
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,920
I assume you have tried it
in France before?

263
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,600
- It melts the moment it touches my tongue.
- Is this one just as good?

264
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,520
It's sweet and fluffy, like clouds.

265
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,680
Have you tasted clouds?

266
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,360
Please enjoy it before it fades away.

267
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,320
I can't help but want to savor it
with my eyes too.

268
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,720
It deflates when it comes
into contact with air.

269
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,520
Even if you don't eat it,
it will still be gone eventually.

270
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,360
Sweet, but fleeting. How awful.

271
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,000
To extend your joy a little longer.

272
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,640
I won't turn you down then.

273
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,440
You are the first good thing
that's happened

274
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,280
since my feet touched Siamese ground.

275
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,400
Go for it!

276
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,400
Khun Dech!

277
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,400
Khun Dech!

278
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,200
- Khun Dech!
- Khun Dech!

279
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,320
Place your bets!

280
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,120
Place your bets now!

281
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,000
- Khun Dech. Go for it!
- Khun Dech. Try kicking the stomach!

282
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,080
That is muay tab chak.

283
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,720
What is muay tab chak?

284
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,080
Fighting by the sound of the opponent's
footsteps on the palm leaves.

285
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,920
- Khun Dech!
- Khun Dech, go for it!

286
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,840
- Khun Dech!
- Khun Dech, go for it!

287
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:48,520
- Khun Dech, go for it!
- Go for it!

288
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,120
Right hook!

289
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,440
Flying knee kick. Good job!

290
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,040
- Khun Dech, get him!
- Quick! Quick!

291
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,920
Go for it!

292
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,320
Khun Dech! Khun Dech!

293
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,080
Go! Go, go, go!

294
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,600
One, two, three.

295
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,680
Khun Dech wins!

296
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:25,800
Khun Dech! Khun Dech! Khun Dech!

297
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,760
Khun Dech! Khun Dech! Khun Dech!

298
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,320
Who is this Khun Dech guy?

299
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,520
Khun Dech! Khun Dech! Khun Dech!

300
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,480
I don't know.

301
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,680
Get in here if you dare.

302
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,440
I can take anyone down.

303
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,520
Khun Dech!

304
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,000
Khun Dech! Khun Dech! Khun Dech!

305
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,120
We're here.

306
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,760
Khun Dech! Khun Dech! Khun Dech!

307
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,400
Thank you.
Call for me on your way back.

308
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,520
I will be around here.

309
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,640
Khun Dech! Khun Dech! Khun Dech!

310
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,720
You're not up for
a challenge tonight, Mek?

311
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,560
For the muay tab chak fight?

312
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,320
That's for amateurs.
I don't waste time with those.

313
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:15,720
I heard the prize money is 30 baht.

314
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,160
- 30 baht?
- Yeah.

315
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,080
To the square, please.

316
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,280
Of course. Wait a moment.

317
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,480
Over here, please.

318
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,640
Please.

319
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,960
Hurry up, miss.

320
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
You ready?

321
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,120
Mek, it's supposed to be my shift!

322
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,360
Careful or you'll trip over--
There you go.

323
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,120
Fighting with your eyes closed seems hard.
Don't you think so, Mr. Thee?

324
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,440
If you have tried it,
you'll know it's not much of a feat.

325
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,720
Mr. Theerathon.

326
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
Close your eyes.

327
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,920
I said close your eyes.

328
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,840
If it is not much of a feat,
why don't you try and land a hit on me?

329
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,200
See?

330
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,640
Not much of a feat.

331
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,440
I could do with a lesson then.

332
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,480
Let's get you home.

333
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,640
I'll walk with you.

334
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,880
Other people would have been
exhausted from the journey,

335
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,680
but you went out and reveled.

336
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,360
That's a true Siamese trait.

337
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,200
- I am exhausted, but…
- But you couldn't help going anyway.

338
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
You are right.

339
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,040
A Siamese trait.

340
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,360
I am, in fact, French.

341
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,640
Yes, my mother was Siamese,

342
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,040
but I am a Frenchman.

343
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,680
What is your role
with the French ambassador?

344
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,360
You stay at the French legation.

345
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,560
A French vessel just arrived
at our port today.

346
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,560
I am…

347
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,480
an interpreter.

348
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,680
An interpreter?

349
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,400
Strange.

350
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,960
How come a Siamese interpreter
is working for the French?

351
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,360
Tomorrow is the last night of the fair.
Will you come?

352
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,000
I will wait for you here at dusk.

353
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,400
Please do me the honor of
letting me be a good host.

354
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,840
Mother…

355
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,720
Mr. Thee.

356
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,640
Mr. Thee!

357
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,880
Sir! Stop!

358
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,880
Stop!

359
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,560
- Give me back my locket.
- Locket?

360
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,360
My mother's locket.

361
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,320
It means the world to me.
Give it back!

362
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,120
Will you please slow down?

363
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,120
I did not take your locket.

364
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,280
Search me if you must.

365
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,960
It's really not here.

366
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,160
Maybe…

367
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,600
you lost it while struggling
with the thief earlier?

368
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,280
Let go!

369
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,960
What are you doing?

370
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,120
I must have lost it
when the thief grabbed me.

371
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,640
The water is dark and cold right now,
and you're unfamiliar with the river.

372
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,960
It's dangerous.

373
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,120
- Let me in.
- Mr. Rati.

374
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,040
I will help you look for it tomorrow.
We should do it tomorrow.

375
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,000
The longer we wait,
the further the current will carry it.

376
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,040
Mr. Rati.

377
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,600
That locket is my mother.

378
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,320
For your safety.

379
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,920
Thank you.

380
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,600
Please be careful.

381
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,600
I will.

382
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,160
Mr. Thee?

383
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,240
Mr. Thee.

384
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,920
Mr. Thee.

385
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,120
Let's take a break.

386
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,560
I can do it.

387
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,520
Please take a break.

388
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,480
Good thing you bought me some new shirts.

389
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,400
Are you cold?

390
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,000
No. Not at all.

391
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,400
We'll take a little rest before we resume.

392
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,920
Let's wait until daybreak.

393
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,679
If something must be lost,

394
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,480
let it be a simple locket,

395
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,719
not lives.

396
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,239
Especially the life of a good man like me.

397
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,440
We will find it.

398
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,320
Believe me.

399
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:52,000
Inside that locket is the photograph
of me, Mother Rung,

400
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,400
Father Lutine,

401
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,000
and my younger sister, Belle.

402
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,520
We took that photograph
when I first called her "Mother."

403
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,960
It meant so much to her

404
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,480
that she carried it with her at all times.

405
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,520
Before she passed away,

406
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,320
she gave it to me.

407
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,840
She wanted to let me know that

408
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,440
I was no longer alone.

409
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,840
I had a family.

410
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,240
And that's why it means so much to you.

411
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,600
There's still time before dawn.

412
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,000
I want to show you something.

413
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,120
Mind your head.

414
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,480
Where are you taking me?

415
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,320
What is this place?

416
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,240
The Mai Maan shrine.

417
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,640
A foreigner like you might not believe
in this faith, but we do.

418
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,760
The god here grants wishes.

419
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,600
Please let me find my mother's locket.

420
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,280
Please let it return to me.

421
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,880
I will do anything.

422
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,920
Anything?

423
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,200
Yes.

424
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,600
Let Rati have his wish,

425
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,560
and I will also do anything.

426
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,360
No rope this time.
I will get in the water with you.

427
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,360
Mother Rung's locket.

428
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,200
I'm glad we found it.

429
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,680
Won't you introduce me to your mother?

430
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,440
Greetings, Madam Rung.

431
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,920
My name is Thee. I am friends with Rati.

432
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,280
Yes, madam. We are friends.

433
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,360
Rati accepts me as his friend.

434
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,600
Don't you?

435
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,960
Friends are supposed to be able
to trust each other.

436
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,040
What do you think of him, Mother?

437
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,800
Mother said

438
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,600
this man is a good person.

439
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,600
He can be trusted.

440
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,520
We are friends now?

441
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,440
Let's go home.

442
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,480
I will walk you.

443
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,480
You don't need to.

444
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,880
You were in the water
much longer than I was.

445
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,280
You should hurry home and rest.

446
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,840
Thank you.

447
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:32,000
Are you sure it is a good idea to get
friendly with the French, master?

448
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,920
I told you not to call me that
when we're outside.

449
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,920
Does he know who you are, sir?

450
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,120
He thinks I'm a commoner,

451
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,640
all thanks to the clothes
you fetched for me, Mr. Mhay.

452
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,840
Look. He saved the boy's life!

453
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,080
My son! Are you okay?

454
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,040
Master!

455
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,720
These are the best clothes
I could find here, sir.

456
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,320
You know I don't care about such things.
Let's get going.

457
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,080
Over there, sir.

458
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:27,440
<i>O King, the Great King</i>

459
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,400
<i>The Great King of Wiang Chai</i>

460
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,080
<i>And his wife, Princess Kaew</i>

461
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,040
It is called <i>Nang Phattalung.</i>

462
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,640
Thanks.

463
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,720
Father.

464
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,520
I need to consult you.

465
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,200
The situation between
Siam and France is not ideal.

466
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,640
Things could get out of hand.

467
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,480
I need your help with something.

468
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,800
My help?

469
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,840
How can I help?

470
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,960
The Siamese interpreter.

471
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,400
Rati. His name is Rati.

472
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,320
Do you know him?

473
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,960
Yes.

474
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,800
Good.

475
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,160
I need your help with Rati.

476
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,200
<i>Something bad happened today,</i>

477
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,280
<i>but so did something supremely good.</i>

478
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,160
<i>The good thing that happened</i>

479
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,880
<i>has made today a good day.</i>

480
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,160
<i>A happy day.</i>

481
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,440
<i>Like Mother Rung always said,</i>

482
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,680
<i>the best kind of good fortune</i>

483
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,480
<i>is meeting good people.</i>

484
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,080
<i>I was lucky today.</i>

485
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,080
<i>Rati.</i>

486
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,320
P.S.

487
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,320
Thank you…

488
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,000
Mr. Thee.

489
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,920
<i>I'm well aware that the Siamese</i>
<i>don't like the French much.</i>

490
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,640
<i>The Siamese are just like the French.</i>

491
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,880
<i>Some can distinguish between the good</i>
<i>and the bad. Some can't.</i>

492
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,280
<i>What about you, Thee?</i>
<i>Which kind are you?</i>

493
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,000
NEXT EPISODE

494
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:37,760
Thanks for the money.

495
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,640
How will you quell this rumor?

496
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:44,120
Maybe it is time you got married, Thee.

497
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,640
Mr. Rati.
