1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,320
A wound that deep is hard to heal.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,080
I might not get over it anytime soon,

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,280
But if I can be with you,

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,400
I know I’ll definitely heal.

5
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,920
Will you be with me, Plawan?

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,200
Thank you so much, P’ Oab.

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,440
For being honest so I can move on.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,640
I’m asking seriously.

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,000
What’s your relationship with Chef Oab?

10
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,760
I like you, Plawan.

11
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,560
If I’m right for you, you can take your time before agreeing to be with me.

12
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,320
I’m sorry, Kluer.

13
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,400
Isn’t it clear enough by now that I’m trying to court you?

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,400
Then try canceling the condo project
you’re planning on Chef Oab’s property.

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,360
Are you brave enough to do that?

16
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,520
It’s the final round.

17
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,720
If you’ve got something good,

18
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,040
Show it all.

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,200
Stir-fried basil with long beans.

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,200
What are you on about?

21
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,480
Have you forgotten the name of the restaurant?

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,000
There's no rule about it.

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,600
No rule says stir-fried basil can't have long beans.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,080
I'm bored.

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,520
Bored of being played by Chef and Plawan.

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,240
I'm confident my stir-fried basil is way tastier than Plawan's.

27
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,120
But I don't believe for a second

28
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,240
that Chef can stay neutral in this situation.

29
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,920
I think we've found the winner who will inherit this restaurant.

30
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,200
And the winner is...

31
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,120
And the winner is...

32
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,520
Plawan.

33
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,360
Chef, are you joking?

34
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,480
You're deciding this after watching that clip?

35
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,560
See?

36
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,000
I told you.

37
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,560
There's no such thing as a fair competition.

38
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,600
You misunderstood me, Kluer.

39
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,959
I admit it.

40
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,960
You've made every stir-fried basil dish delicious.

41
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,720
But have you forgotten the name of this restaurant?

42
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,280
The basil here doesn't come with long beans.

43
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,960
It's part of the branding,

44
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,960
a promise we've made to the customers who come here specifically for that.

45
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,680
They definitely aren't expecting basil with long beans.

46
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,080
You doing this

47
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,320
means you've forgotten the most important people
in this restaurant—our customers.

48
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,400
Kluer, you wanted to lose on purpose, didn’t you?

49
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,800
Why would you do that?

50
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,760
Didn’t you say you loved this restaurant?

51
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,560
Why would you give up so easily?

52
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,000
You misunderstood.

53
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,120
I didn’t surrender on my own.

54
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,360
I was forced to give up.

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,080
Because of Plawan’s relationship with Chef,

56
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,720
I couldn’t do anything.

57
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,680
If Plawan becomes Chef's partner
and gets the restaurant,

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,720
I won’t be able to do anything either.

59
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,880
How can I compete with that, Plawan?

60
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,520
But I don’t blame Plawan.

61
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,600
Even without Plawan as a rival,

62
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,320
I still wouldn’t be chosen as the successor with Chef.

63
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,000
If Chef wanted to choose me,

64
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,440
he wouldn’t have arranged
this competition in the first place.

65
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,200
I wish you luck.

66
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,840
Kluer, Kluer!

67
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,560
I hereby cancel all agreements,
and I’ll refund every penny to you.

68
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,200
You're deciding this after watching that clip?

69
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,480
See?

70
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,680
I told you.

71
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:53,400
There's no such thing as a fair competition.

72
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,800
I didn’t surrender on my own.

73
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,000
I was forced to give up.

74
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,480
How can I compete with that, Plawan?

75
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,600
Why didn’t you tell me before coming up here?

76
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,800
Chef, are you upset about Kluer?

77
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,159
If you're upset,

78
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,080
will you comfort me?

79
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,000
Holding me this tight, should I charge you?

80
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,520
I'll charge 20 baht per hug.

81
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,680
Getting the restaurant isn’t enough for you, huh?

82
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,160
Speaking of that,

83
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,480
I think I’m not suitable to be
the successor of this restaurant.

84
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,680
If you want to find someone else
to replace me, that might be...

85
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,400
What should I do?

86
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,559
To stop this kid from overthinking?

87
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,600
So, what do you want me to do?

88
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,040
(No one is allowed on the third floor
under any circumstances)

89
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,760
You want to go another round?

90
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,360
Do you still have the energy?

91
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,120
I know now.

92
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,400
That you're working for Metas.

93
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,400
(I am about to transfer another payment,
and I hope you'll stay until the final round.)

94
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,960
I’ve transferred a large sum of money to you.

95
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,080
I hope you stay until the final round.

96
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,680
This photo was sent to me by someone.

97
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,520
Plawan went to Metas' house.

98
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,960
These two are definitely connected.

99
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,160
What should we do now?

100
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,640
Should we kick them out?

101
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,240
Let's wait and see first.

102
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,480
Hey, Oab.

103
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:57,840
I heard you’re head over heels for Plawan.

104
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,000
So much that you're willing to
hand the restaurant over to the enemy?

105
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,880
I’ll take care of this.

106
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,000
Let’s wrap up the restaurant matter first,

107
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,480
then I’ll come back and settle things
between you and me for good.

108
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,920
Chef, Chef!

109
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,600
Please listen to me, Chef!

110
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,560
I have an explanation for this.

111
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,720
Are you really Metas’ guy?

112
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,480
I’m warning you, don’t lie.

113
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,000
Because no matter what,
I’m going to ask Metas myself.

114
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,200
It’s true.

115
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,800
I was really sent here.

116
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,880
I’ve seen the evidence all along,

117
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,600
but I tried to overlook it.

118
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,280
In the end, I hoped you wouldn’t choose
to do that to me and to the restaurant I love.

119
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,360
But in the end, you just came to mess with my head.

120
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,960
You deceived me.

121
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,440
You tricked me into falling in love with you
so you could sell this restaurant to Metas.

122
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,800
Isn’t that right?

123
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,320
Isn’t it true?

124
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:21,960
Chef.

125
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,280
Chef, listen to me first, Chef.

126
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,720
Chef, can you please listen to me first?

127
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:31,480
My feelings for you are real, Chef.

128
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,400
I love you, Chef.

129
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,080
I like you.

130
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,320
I’ve never faked it.

131
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,280
But about the restaurant, I…

132
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,720
Or are you going to say you didn’t make any deal with Metas?

133
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,360
That he didn’t approach you and talk to you?

134
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,360
He offered you a final deal, didn’t he?

135
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,280
You made me passionate

136
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,720
about wanting to continue running this restaurant.

137
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,000
But when everything confirmed

138
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:04,360
that you came to deceive me, to hurt me,

139
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,080
all this restaurant has are bad memories now.

140
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,200
Chef, Chef.

141
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,280
I’ve already told Metas.

142
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,600
That I won’t do any of it anymore.

143
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,920
I will cancel all the contracts.

144
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,440
Please, Chef.

145
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,200
I don’t know anymore

146
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,280
what of your words I can still believe.

147
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,680
You don’t need to lie to me or do anything anymore.

148
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,280
Plawan.

149
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,920
You’ve won.

150
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,560
The sales contract is on the table.

151
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,960
Take it to Metas for him to sign,
and schedule the transfer date.

152
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,560
Then you can do whatever
the hell you want with this place.

153
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,840
I’m done with everything.

154
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,200
All this time,

155
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,520
it’s my own stupidity.

156
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,600
From now on,

157
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,120
let’s pretend none of this ever happened.

158
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,000
Chef, Chef, stay with me.

159
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,360
Chef.

160
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,440
Chef.

161
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,600
Chef.

162
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,560
Chef.

163
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,320
Chef.

164
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,720
(Plawan)

165
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:45,080
I got the place, and you, Plawan, got a big pile of money.

166
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,560
It's all good things for everyone.

167
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,520
Here, take it.

168
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,200
You.

169
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,000
You.

170
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,440
Tell your friend to stop crying already.

171
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,280
Let's celebrate with a drink instead.

172
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,240
Thank you both, you and Plawan, so much

173
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,560
for doing all of this for me.

174
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,040
Cheers.

175
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,000
You're making things worse the more you speak, Metas.

176
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,960
It's fine, you don’t have to defend me.

177
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,760
Here’s the sales contract for the building.

178
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,400
Whatever you want to do with it is up to you.

179
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,280
But I’ll need some time to pack my things.

180
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Do you have a lot of stuff?

181
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,120
Hey, you.

182
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,160
He just asked for some time to pack his things.
Why are you being so stingy?

183
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,960
It’s not like the building’s going anywhere.

184
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,600
Aren’t you rich?

185
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,800
You bought the physical therapy clinic,
and you bought my time too.

186
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,880
Is there nothing I can do to your friend?

187
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,160
Alright, alright. Fine, fine.

188
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,400
I’ll give you three days to pack your stuff.

189
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,680
Is that enough?

190
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,240
Yes, that's enough.

191
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,520
Hey, hey!

192
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,360
Are you coming to do
your physical therapy at my place today?

193
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,360
Or should we watch a movie instead? You can choose.

194
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,840
Dinner is also an option.

195
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,080
You’ve gotten much better already.

196
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,000
You can start using another physical therapist now.

197
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,480
I already told you,

198
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,880
I won’t use any other physical therapist except for you.

199
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,800
But you can only do physical therapy for me, no one else.

200
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,600
I’m thinking about quitting the clinic.

201
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,640
And then going abroad to study for a while.

202
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,920
No matter how much you want to follow me,

203
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,280
you can’t follow me all the way overseas, right?

204
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,480
That’s right, I’m rich.

205
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,600
So I’m changing my plan.

206
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,800
I’ll go work at a public hospital instead.

207
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,800
And don’t try to buy the government or the country, okay?

208
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,360
Why are you so eager to run away from me?

209
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,200
What did I do wrong?

210
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,280
I’m really disappointed in you, Metas.

211
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,400
No matter how long I wait for you,

212
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,680
I won’t be able to make you trust me more than this.

213
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,920
It’s better if I give up now.

214
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,400
You haven’t lost yet.

215
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,600
You won against me a long time ago.

216
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,280
Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been chasing after you like this.

217
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,040
You see,

218
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,200
I’m serious about you.

219
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,400
I’ve never done this for anyone before.

220
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,280
No matter how serious you are,

221
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,560
I’ll always lose to the money in your hands.

222
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,880
You love money more than anyone else.

223
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,480
That contract over there is proof of it.

224
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,960
I could never love someone
who values money more than other people.

225
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,360
If the client needs anything,

226
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,360
contact the clinic.

227
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,280
Don’t contact me directly anymore.

228
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,120
I’ll excuse myself now.

229
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,280
Wait, hey, you—

230
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,600
You!

231
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,280
Alright, take it out to serve, kid.

232
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,720
Wow, Pun Sib!

233
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,640
The customers are eating today, not tomorrow.

234
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,520
Hurry up!

235
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,480
Yes, Chef!

236
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:11,960
Chef?

237
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:13,480
I told you to call me "P'."

238
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,360
I don’t want to be old like P' Oab!

239
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,000
Got it!

240
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,680
It’s done, P'.

241
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,920
Hello.

242
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,280
Here comes another one.

243
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,320
So, am I not a Chef?

244
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,520
But rather P' Aoy or P' Chod, here to give love advice?

245
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,280
Don’t ask me anything.

246
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,120
I don’t know anything about where P' Oab is.

247
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:58,240
I really don’t know where to go looking for Chef Oab anymore.

248
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,760
Chef Nab Nueng, have you spoken to Chef Oab?

249
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,120
It’s not just you who can’t reach P' Oab.

250
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,720
I can’t reach him either.

251
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
And this time,

252
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,720
it’s worse than when Kao Suay was still around.

253
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,040
Don’t you think?

254
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,600
That what you did was too much?

255
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,000
If it were me,

256
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,520
I wouldn’t dare show my face here.

257
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,360
Chef, don’t you think that was a bit harsh?

258
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,960
My friend looks completely defeated.

259
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,800
So what?

260
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,800
Someone who sells out others for money deserves
to be punished like this, right?

261
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,480
It’s my fault.

262
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,160
For deciding to make a deal with Metas.

263
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,400
But I’m not asking for much.

264
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,120
I just want Chef Oab to contact me and let me know he’s okay.

265
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,960
Please, Chef Nab Nueng, let me know if you hear from him.

266
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,520
When are you going to stop being like this, Plawan?

267
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,080
You can’t do this at my house, Plawan.

268
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,520
Now my whole house smells like basil!

269
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,600
I just asked you to take care of the basil plant for a bit.

270
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,040
I’m looking for a new place to put it.

271
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,080
But my condo doesn’t have a suitable spot for growing basil.

272
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,760
I wasn’t just talking about the basil plant, you know.

273
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,680
I meant you too.

274
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,960
You’re moping around like a sad puppy every day.

275
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,960
When are you going to get over it?

276
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,400
I don’t know.

277
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,680
Maybe I’ll never get over it.

278
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,280
JJ!

279
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,680
JJ, wait for me!

280
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,160
JJ!

281
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,080
JJ, JJ!

282
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,240
Wait for me!

283
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,200
Who approved your resignation?

284
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,200
I haven’t received any paperwork yet!

285
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:08,960
Take it then!

286
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,560
Where’s the paperwork?

287
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,200
I haven’t approved your resignation yet.

288
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,120
Alright, fine.

289
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,160
You want to play it like this?

290
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,200
Then take it!

291
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,280
You can do this all day, Metas.

292
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,560
I’ll just go print more.

293
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,960
Can’t you just not resign?

294
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,040
Why are you letting Plawan’s issues affect us?

295
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,040
There was never an "us" in the first place.

296
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,080
You can lie about anything,
but don’t say you weren’t affected by me.

297
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,320
I’ll admit, I might have let my guard down with you a bit.

298
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,440
I may be weak against persistence,
but I still have my principles.

299
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
I don’t like people who take advantage of others,

300
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,760
and I don’t like people who value money over everything else.

301
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,000
Wait,

302
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,120
you let your guard down for me?

303
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,760
In any case, my feelings don’t matter as much as yours, right?

304
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,800
(Studying abroad)

305
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,000
(France)

306
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,280
What are you doing, P'?

307
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,280
Looking for a school to study at?

308
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,800
Yeah.

309
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,400
I’m just checking it out for now.

310
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,200
If I don’t go to study,
I’m thinking of becoming a chef in France.

311
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,520
I don’t want to be a restaurant owner anymore.

312
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:05,880
Headache.

313
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,560
I think it's more of a heartache.

314
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,680
I’m just kidding.

315
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,360
You really know everything, huh?

316
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,640
Want to go again?

317
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,520
I don’t know your heart as well as you do.

318
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,600
Plawan came to see you the other day.

319
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
He looked pretty hurt.

320
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,400
His face was like a sad puppy,

321
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,400
like one abandoned at a gas station by its owner.

322
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,680
You already told me.

323
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,240
And another thing,

324
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,040
I didn’t deceive the kid.
The kid’s the one who deceived me.

325
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,800
I’m just reminding you, P'.

326
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:41,920
P' Oab.

327
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,120
If you’ve already made a decision,

328
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,680
there’s no turning back.

329
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Yes.

330
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,720
Oh, Plawan, darling!

331
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,000
Long time no see!

332
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,800
Did you come all the way to my condo for something, P’?

333
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:17,040
Ever since you became the heir to
Chef Oab’s basil restaurant, you’ve been in high demand!

334
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,520
People are reaching out to get you on shows left and right.

335
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:22,360
Cooking shows, family shows—

336
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,800
and I’ve already scheduled everything for you!

337
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,440
There are restaurant host gigs and booth appearances.

338
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,400
This year’s going to be a hit!

339
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,800
P’,

340
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,160
I don’t want to work in showbiz anymore.

341
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,360
I’m going to retire.

342
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Retire?

343
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,320
What are you going to do, then?

344
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,200
All this time, I didn’t know what I wanted to do.

345
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,440
I knew I had a good face and a nice body,

346
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,720
so I wanted to try showbiz to make good money.

347
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,600
But now I’ve found what I really want to do.

348
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,000
What my heart really wants is...

349
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,120
to become a chef.

350
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,400
-A chef?
-Yes.

351
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,280
JJ!

352
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,080
You’ve been missing!

353
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,480
I thought you’d rotted away in your condo by now.

354
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,800
But it’s good you’re here.

355
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,200
Hurry up and take your basil plant

356
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,560
out of my house already!

357
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,120
I came to get my basil plant,

358
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,360
and I also want to invite you to do something.

359
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,920
I’m unemployed, and I’m almost out of money.

360
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,400
What are you trying to get me into now?

361
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,720
I’m not going anywhere.

362
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,760
I’ve decided I want to open
a restaurant that sells stir-fried basil.

363
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,080
I’ve thought it through.

364
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,760
This is what I really love.

365
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,360
My dream now is to become a chef.

366
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,920
I want to open a restaurant like Chef Oab.

367
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,720
Listen, Plawan, think about this carefully.

368
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,000
Are you sure this is your dream
and not just your guilt talking?

369
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,560
Opening a restaurant isn’t something to take lightly.

370
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,080
I really want to open a restaurant.

371
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,560
You know I’ve never had
this kind of passion for anything before.

372
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,960
And it’d be amazing if you joined me in my plan.

373
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,440
So what’s this plan of yours? Let’s hear it.

374
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,120
Let me ask you straight—
did you ever have any other options?

375
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,240
Did you really need to tear down that building?

376
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,920
But you should know that spot is
prime real estate for a luxury-class condo.

377
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,280
And I’ve already set my mind
on making that project a success.

378
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,160
Why else would I hire your friend?

379
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,360
What if you developed that area into a mixed-use space?

380
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,120
The front could be a community mall,
and the back could be your luxury-class condo.

381
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,720
Since you’re already doing it,
why not build a city and a society?

382
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,400
Give the rich everything they need in one project.

383
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,800
Like a one-stop service.

384
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,280
A multi-function real estate project with condos?

385
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,560
Exactly, you’ve got the idea.

386
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,520
Not only would you make money,
but you’d also be raising the standard of that area.

387
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,960
You’d create jobs for the local people,

388
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,080
letting them work in the community mall,

389
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,280
and the restaurants would help the community thrive.

390
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,160
It’d be a win-win for both sides.

391
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:06,000
You wouldn’t have to evict or push anyone out anymore.

392
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:10,520
What would you do if someone held
a grudge against you and shot you one day?

393
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,199
Why are you smiling?

394
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,719
Are you okay? Smiling to yourself out of nowhere.

395
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,600
I’m trying to have a serious conversation here.

396
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,000
You care about me.

397
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,960
You seem really concerned about me.

398
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,280
Well...

399
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,520
I want to be in a relationship with someone good.

400
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,679
And not with someone
that people talk badly about behind their back.

401
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,080
Listen,

402
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,320
you don’t have to be that kind of ruthless investor, Metas.

403
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,760
Think about it carefully.

404
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,960
Here’s the report you requested, Mr. Metas.

405
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,760
If you approve,
we can close the deal with China right away.

406
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,320
Leave it there.

407
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:02,600
Mr. Metas,

408
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,280
Are you feeling alright?

409
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,560
Normally, you’re never slow when it comes to money.

410
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,800
Sorry about that.

411
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,480
Hello, Mr. Metas.

412
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,360
You.

413
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,080
I can’t believe it.

414
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,400
That you came to see me here.

415
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,400
Well, if you’ve got something to say, just say it.

416
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,400
Come on, JJ, I’m begging you.

417
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,960
If you’ve got something to say, just say it.

418
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,280
Coming over here like this, I thought you missed me.

419
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,880
My friend is asking if you could not
demolish the original site of the basil restaurant.

420
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,920
He’ll pay you rent instead.

421
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,160
Rent, huh?

422
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,720
I charge a lot, you know.

423
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,200
And how much are you thinking?
You know he doesn’t have the money.

424
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,040
If you don’t want to rent, then don’t.

425
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,960
I told you this plan wouldn’t work.

426
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,800
I think your friend can pay.

427
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,080
But I’ll only deal with you two directly.

428
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,800
Tell your friend to wait outside.

429
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,160
Yes.

430
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,480
This plan is perfect.

431
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,680
The plan to sell me out, huh?

432
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,560
-What are you doing?
-Stay with me.

433
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,840
Please, I’m counting on you.

434
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,640
-I’m counting on you, JJ, please.
-Plawan, Plawan!

435
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,920
So, how do you want me to pay?

436
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,520
Let me warn you,

437
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,480
I can be just as ruthless as any investor like you.

438
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,480
If I have it, I’ll pay; if I don’t, I won’t.

439
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,200
I’ve already thought about it.

440
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,320
Thought about what?

441
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,200
You really did think it through.

442
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,520
And what about the condo project you’ve been so focused on?

443
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,880
Are you just going to abandon it?

444
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,080
I can abandon it.

445
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,280
I was ready to give it up the moment you walked through that door.

446
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,000
If changing the project means

447
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,280
you’ll let me pursue you fully, then it’s worth it.

448
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,200
Like this.

449
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,320
I’m okay with it.

450
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,120
After you’ve said all that,

451
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,840
is there even a way for me to say no?

452
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,800
So...

453
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,280
does this mean I can start courting you?

454
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,960
Oh, you!

455
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,480
Hey, you!

456
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,680
Hey, you!

457
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,280
Ouch, you!

458
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,880
Seeing this, you two are quite a perfect match.

459
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,080
If you ever need me to sign as a witness when you register your marriage,

460
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,360
feel free to call me.

461
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,200
I’ll prepare my pen starting today.

462
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,320
Plawan!

463
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,520
You’ve spoken well. I like that.

464
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,520
I won’t charge rent for the first three months.
Consider it startup capital.

465
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:34,920
Thank you, brother-in-law.

466
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,520
Well said.

467
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,680
Plawan,

468
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,720
take this—it’s from Kluer.

469
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,600
Wait a minute, Kluer, I have something I want to talk to you about.

470
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,480
I’m about to open a new basil restaurant with no long beans.

471
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,320
I want you to be the chef there.

472
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,040
I’m not cooking anymore.

473
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,520
Go ask someone else.

474
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,000
Kluer...

475
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,400
Wait, Kluer!

476
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,400
Kluer!

477
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,400
Kluer...

478
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,680
If it’s because of that, I’m sorry.

479
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,480
I’m sorry that I was working for Metas.

480
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,880
I’m sorry.

481
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,960
I’m sorry that I couldn’t return your love.

482
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,480
I feel guilty too.

483
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,040
I feel sad too.

484
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,480
But not as much as the regret

485
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,080
of not seeing you, Kluer, in the kitchen again.

486
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,480
Kluer...

487
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,280
I don’t want this to be the reason that makes you stop cooking.

488
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,080
I’m sorry.

489
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,040
Kluer... Kluer!

490
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,760
So, Plawan, did he agree?

491
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,880
He didn’t. He’s probably really angry with me.

492
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,560
Then I guess you’ll have to put up a hiring announcement.

493
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,080
Looks like that’s the only way.

494
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,680
Take this.

495
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,400
I’ve already prepared some graphics for PR for the restaurant.

496
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,280
What do you think?

497
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,720
(The countdown to the return of
Stir-fried basil without long beans)

498
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,960
JJ, my friend!

499
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,760
Plawan, what are you doing? Let go!

500
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,720
What good deeds did I do in my past life

501
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:01,840
to deserve such a wonderful friend in this one?

502
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,440
Post it on social media, on every platform, my friend!

503
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,160
Here, post it now!

504
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,480
Post it, post it, post it!

505
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,960
My dear friend!

506
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,640
What the hell are you doing?

507
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,120
(The countdown to the return of
Stir-fried basil without long beans)

508
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:26,960
You’ve won.

509
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,680
Now, you can do whatever the hell you want with this restaurant.

510
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,960
I’m done with everything.

511
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,480
You’ve really made up your mind, huh?

512
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,360
To go this way?

513
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,480
Yes, Master.

514
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,480
Well, then, good luck with your new path.

515
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,680
You’re talented

516
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,080
and hardworking.

517
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,280
Wherever you go, you won’t starve.

518
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,880
Remember,

519
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,080
if you don’t know where to go,

520
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,160
come back to me.

521
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,960
Thank you so much, Master.

522
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,960
(Stir-fried basil without long beans, à la carte)

523
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,480
- Looks good!
- Thank you

524
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:21,960
Are you sure?

525
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,760
You don’t want me to drop you off?

526
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,280
I already called a car.

527
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,360
You stay and finish cleaning up the restaurant.

528
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,280
There’s still the online orders to handle.

529
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,800
Sorry, the restaurant is closed.

530
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:44,280
Why are you here?

531
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,360
Hey, Nab Nueng, stop!

532
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,880
Let me handle this.

533
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:50,600
I’m here to see Chef Oab.

534
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,360
What do you want from me?

535
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,880
Hiding out here, huh?

536
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,640
If you’ve got something to say, just say it.

537
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,480
I’m not in the mood to play games with you.

538
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,280
Calm down, Chef.

539
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:05,760
I just wanted to say...

540
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,000
I like your cooking skills.

541
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:11,760
It’s delicious.

542
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,760
You came here just to tell me that?

543
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,160
Someone like you can have as many chefs as you want.

544
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,480
If you want something, just say it directly.

545
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,080
You haven’t changed at all, have you?

546
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,800
I just wanted to let you know about your basil restaurant.

547
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,480
I’m not demolishing it anymore.

548
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,360
Plawan is planning to keep the restaurant running

549
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,880
while waiting for you to return.

550
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,360
I want to invest in the restaurant too.

551
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:44,880
I think it’ll be worth it.

552
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,280
The opportunity is right in front of you.

553
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,360
Don’t let it slip away.

554
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,160
Now that you’ve said your piece, you can go.

555
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,480
Okay.

556
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,760
You came back out of guilt,

557
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,680
and now you’re playing Cupid?

558
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,240
So what’s it going to be, P’?

559
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,160
Are you going back or not?

560
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,040
We start serving customers in 10 minutes.

561
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,960
Yes, Chef.

562
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:38,560
Wait, am I really going to be the only chef here?

563
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,480
You’re not counting me, Auto?

564
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,680
I can cook, you know.

565
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,760
Well, you’re not exactly a great cook, Plawan.

566
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,560
With just one chef, is this place going to survive?

567
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,680
You’re not being very encouraging.

568
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,800
-But it’s true.
-Exactly.

569
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,880
There’s a difference between
being able to cook and cooking well.

570
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,000
Excuse me.

571
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,360
Are you still hiring chefs here?

572
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,240
Well, are you still hiring chefs?

573
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,560
Plawan, with a catch served up on a silver platter,
aren’t you going to take it?

574
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,680
Of course, of course!

575
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,880
Are you ready to start today?

576
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,600
I’m ready, Chef.

577
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,840
My restaurant is saved!

578
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,040
Alright, alright, enough drama—it’s not a series.

579
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,400
We’re opening in 10 minutes, hurry up!

580
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:50,680
Yes, Chef!

581
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:57,160
-I’m the Chef!
-I’m the owner! Now get to work!

582
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,920
-What would you like to order, P’?
-Two orders of Wagyu basil.

583
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,720
-Medium spicy, please.
-Medium spicy, okay.

584
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,840
-Wagyu beef, right?
-Can I order, too?

585
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,960
One basil beef, please.

586
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,160
-But can I have...
-Stir-fried basil instant noodles.

587
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,480
Sure, sure!

588
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,880
Stir-fried basil with squid, rice,

589
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,160
with two fried eggs.

590
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,880
One stir-fried basil with scallops in mala sauce.

591
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,160
Chef!

592
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:33,960
Yes, serve it.

593
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,960
-Ready to serve?
-Go ahead!

594
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,080
I think you enjoy running
this restaurant more than being a physical therapist.

595
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:33,880
Oh, come on.

596
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,640
Don’t try to hype me up.

597
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,640
And you better start looking for a new order-taker soon.

598
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,360
My back is killing me.

599
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,080
I do physical therapy for others,
and now I have to do it for myself too.

600
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,960
Oh, come on, listen to you complain.

601
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,880
But I already closed the orders, didn’t I?

602
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,080
Why is there another one?

603
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,680
Is there a lot of orders? I can handle it.

604
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,400
Just one.

605
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,680
They ordered through the restaurant’s online system.

606
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:04,240
But isn’t this dish something we don’t have on the menu?

607
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,280
What dish?

608
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,880
Croquette stuffed with stir-fried basil.

609
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:12,960
(Croquette stuffed with stir-fried basil)

610
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,400
Croquettes stuffed with stir-fried basil.

611
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,760
This dish is just for you,

612
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,920
and I guarantee you’ll love it.

613
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,160
Oh, Plawan

614
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,760
Is anyone here? Is anyone here?

615
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,880
I’m here to deliver food.

616
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,600
Are you here to deliver food?

617
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:19,960
Yes.

618
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,680
Here’s the food you ordered.

619
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,720
(Authentic Basil)

620
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,360
(Authentic Basil)

621
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,160
(Stir-fried basil without long beans)

622
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,280
Hey, Plawan,

623
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,280
isn’t it a bit too quiet like this?

624
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,080
Yeah, where did everyone go?

625
00:52:57,360 --> 00:52:58,360
Plawan!

626
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,080
-Come here and check this out.
-What is it?

627
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:03,680
-Hurry up!
-What’s going on?

628
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,360
Plawan, you’ve got to see this.

629
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,160
Run faster!

630
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,880
I can’t wait to meet the chef!

631
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:13,960
When will the chef come out?

632
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,960
-I want to ask...
-I really want to meet the chef.

633
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,160
Are these people or what?

634
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,280
At this rate, we’re going to go broke for sure.

635
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,760
Our restaurant is ready now, everyone.
Please come on in.

636
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,360
I cooked every dish myself.

637
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:09,880
Please, come on in.

638
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:23,360
Which table should we pick?

639
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:24,640
How about this table?

640
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,360
This table, right?

641
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,280
-Wow, the atmosphere is great.
-Just let the staff know.

642
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,360
The chef is very handsome!

643
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,840
Chef Oab!

644
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,080
Do you guys see what I’m seeing?

645
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,160
Is this really Chef Oab’s restaurant?

646
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:43,760
Chef Oab selling made-to-order dishes?

647
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,080
The world must be ending.

648
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:47,600
JJ!

649
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,080
Do you remember that guy who ordered croquettes yesterday?

650
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,680
The last order was from Chef Oab himself.

651
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,560
What a cheeky move.

652
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,480
This is basically declaring war on our restaurant!

653
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,600
Have you gone to clear things up with Chef yet?

654
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,440
What happened?

655
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,680
And what did Plawan say to the chef?

656
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,680
-Hurry up, what did you say?
-Yeah, hurry up!

657
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,680
-Why are you quiet?
-What did you say?

658
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,360
I just said...

659
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,080
"Here’s your food," like that.

660
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,760
You idiot!

661
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,160
Our restaurant is doomed for sure!

662
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,960
I was nervous!
What was I supposed to do?

663
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,360
Chef Oab looked at me like I was a stranger.

664
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,960
He didn’t care about me at all.

665
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,880
Do I even still have a chance anymore?

666
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:51,760
The opportunity is right here, man!
Can’t you see it?

667
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,760
The opportunity you’ve been waiting for for months!

668
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,480
So what are you waiting for?

669
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,080
Go apologize and clear things up with the chef!

670
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,480
But the chef won’t talk to me—what am I supposed to do?

671
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:05,480
Yesterday, after delivering the food,
he just walked straight into the restaurant.

672
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,960
It’s a good thing he ordered the croquette basil;

673
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,280
that’s how I knew it was Chef Oab.

674
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,160
In that case, fight fire with fire.

675
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,600
If the chef can order food from our restaurant for delivery,

676
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,360
we can order food from his restaurant for delivery too!

677
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:33,960
Don’t give up!

678
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,240
Yeah, do it, Plawan!

679
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,080
Order food and make the chef deliver it to our restaurant!

680
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,080
Do it!

681
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,760
Order the most complicated dish possible.

682
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,280
Type in the request to have him deliver it personally—yeah, exactly!

683
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,760
Order Chef’s special granita and kindly request personal delivery.

684
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,560
Are you done?

685
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,360
Straighten up your shirt, it’s time to go.

686
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:18,080
I booked a movie

687
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,880
and a dinner reservation at the hotel.

688
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,880
I think I’m going to pass.

689
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,960
I want to stay here with Plawan for a while.

690
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,880
Your friend is already a grown man.

691
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:36,560
I’m not getting in the way of my friend’s time with his partner.

692
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:44,800
Right, Plawan?

693
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,960
Just go.

694
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:54,960
Don’t worry about me. I’ll be fine.

695
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,280
Why are you so stressed?

696
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,800
Chef Oab already accepted your order, didn’t he?

697
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,880
It’s been showing as "in progress" for 3-4 hours now.

698
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,880
Is granita really that hard to make?

699
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,480
Maybe Chef doesn’t want to see me anymore.

700
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:18,560
This feels like a double heartbreak.

701
00:58:19,160 --> 00:58:20,960
Hey, it’s okay.

702
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,160
You

703
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,920
-What are you saying?
-I’m just protective.

704
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:28,320
How can you let them take Plawan so easily?

705
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,120
You’re giving up this easily?

706
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,520
Do you even really love him?

707
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,360
If you love someone, you’ve got to go after them!

708
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,920
Look at me as an example.

709
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,960
What’s with you?

710
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,520
Plawan stressed out.

711
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,800
Look, Chef Oab’s new restaurant is nearby.

712
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,880
If it were me, I’d close up shop

713
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,400
and go sit outside Chef Oab’s restaurant right now.

714
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,240
You’re right! Go for it, trust me.

715
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,240
Hurry up, get up!

716
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:09,800
Yeah!

717
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,320
I guess I’ll give it another shot.

718
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,720
You

719
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,040
What are you doing now?

720
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,280
Oh, wasn’t that okay?

721
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:35,280
I mean, it’s okay, but is this really the right time?

722
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,480
(Authentic Basil Restaurant)

723
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,680
Our restaurant is closed now.

724
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,160
You walking in like this...

725
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,880
I could call the police and charge you with trespassing.

726
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,240
I ordered a granita, and no one delivered it.

727
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,640
You’ve already deducted the money from me.

728
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,360
I’m just here to find out where my granita is.

729
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,760
If you didn’t want to make it,

730
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,560
why did you accept my order?

731
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,760
You accepted both the croquette basil

732
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,520
and my granita order.

733
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,720
Doing that makes me think I still have hope.

734
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:04,840
I don’t know.

735
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,880
I just want to eat food made by you.

736
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,680
As for making the granita for you,

737
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,200
I’m still thinking if I should do it or not.

738
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,880
You don’t have to make it for me.

739
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,080
Honestly.

740
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,960
I just wanted the chance to apologize to you.

741
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,480
I’m sorry.

742
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,360
I’m sorry for deceiving you all this time.

743
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,160
I made you feel hurt.

744
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:37,800
Even when I had the chance to tell you the truth,

745
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,360
I was afraid of being hurt myself.

746
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,280
So I avoided

747
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,760
doing the right thing all along.

748
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,160
I’m sorry.

749
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:20,280
Thank you for being patient with me.

750
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,240
Now that you’ve come to deliver the food,

751
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:31,080
I was hoping you’d say those words.

752
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:33,400
The words “I’m sorry.”

753
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:41,120
But instead, you said,

754
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,680
"Here’s your food."

755
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:50,600
You really know how to mess with my head.

756
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,120
I’m giving you one last chance, Plawan.

757
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,080
If you hurt me again,

758
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,400
you’ll never taste the granita I make for the rest of your life.

759
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:18,600
I’m sorry.

760
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:21,600
I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry!

761
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:28,080
Everything I’ve felt for you has been real, Chef.

762
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,480
I’ve never loved anyone as much as I love you.

763
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,000
That’s just how it is.

764
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,200
Someone like you...

765
01:03:53,640 --> 01:03:55,080
Next time you make a mistake,

766
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,080
just say you’re sorry.

767
01:03:58,520 --> 01:03:59,400
Understand?

768
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:00,760
Yes.

769
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:13,880
Hey, you.

770
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,080
It’s late.

771
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,400
I’m about to sleep, so you should head home.

772
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,280
I can’t drive home anymore, I’m exhausted.

773
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,880
And my legs hurt so much.

774
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,960
I’ll just sleep here.

775
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,760
And you can do some physical therapy on me too.

776
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,360
The harder, the better, you know.

777
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,560
You...

778
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:49,960
Don’t say such crazy things!

779
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:52,200
Go home already.

780
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:54,280
I’m going to call Plawan in a bit,

781
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:56,200
to see how he’s doing right now.

782
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,760
Hurry, hurry!

783
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:00,920
When are you going to stop babying your friend like this?

784
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,600
This is supposed to be time for just the two of us.

785
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:08,280
Oh!

786
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,520
You!

787
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,760
Go home, go home, quickly!

788
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:13,160
Can I stay?

789
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,400
I want to move in and live with you.

790
01:06:16,520 --> 01:06:17,720
Go home.

791
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:19,040
Hurry up!

792
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:22,160
Go home already.

793
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,880
-Don’t be stubborn!
-No, I don’t want to leave yet.

794
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,080
You must be joking.

795
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:41,360
My house is so small—how would you live here?

796
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,680
You can’t just move in and then say

797
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:46,360
you can’t handle it afterward—that’s not fair.

798
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:49,840
If you do that, I’ll be seriously mad.

799
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,240
Even if the house is small,

800
01:06:51,720 --> 01:06:53,800
having you nag me every day like this—

801
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,000
I’ve been hearing your scolding for so long,
and I’m never tired of it.

802
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:01,280
If I move in, I don’t think I’ll ever get bored.

803
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:03,280
And you,

804
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,400
you’re the person who’s come into my life and changed everything.

805
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:16,880
Are you really serious about me?

806
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,040
Absolutely.

807
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,880
So serious I’d give up money,

808
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:27,880
give up my house,

809
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:30,440
just to be with you.

810
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,600
But I’ll warn you.

811
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:46,960
I might be good at scolding,

812
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:51,000
but I’m not very good at love.

813
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,240
That’s okay.

814
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:55,280
I can teach you.

815
01:07:57,840 --> 01:07:59,560
I can teach you for the rest of our lives.

816
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:02,439
(Two weeks later)

817
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,840
Be careful with that.

818
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:07,640
I can do it myself!

819
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:08,680
Just stay still.

820
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:09,800
It’s done, Chef.

821
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:11,080
Put it on.

822
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:16,600
Pun Sib!

823
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:19,880
Amazing!

824
01:09:20,279 --> 01:09:21,240
Thank you.

825
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,720
Look at that—perfect!

826
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:26,840
Beautiful!

827
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,399
Stay still!

828
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,200
Welcome!

829
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,880
Congratulations on your new restaurant!

830
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,880
I’ll give you a discount on rent for 3 months.

831
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:58,080
Consider it a warm welcome from your brother-in-law.

832
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:00,360
No need.

833
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,320
I can pay. I didn’t ask for a favor.

834
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,640
Let’s go.

835
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,120
Thank you, brother-in-law.

836
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:16,240
Plawan!

837
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:17,280
Hurry, accept it.

838
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,440
-You’re impossible.
-Hurry up!

839
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:24,440
Enough already.

840
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,240
The light’s getting in my eyes.

841
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,320
JJ!

842
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,640
Are you a billionaire's bride now or what?

843
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,840
No, we’re not married yet, so how could I be?

844
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,920
It’s just an engagement ring for now, reserving my spot.

845
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:51,800
As for how big the wedding ring will be,

846
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:54,200
I guess we’ll all have to wait and see!

847
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:00,320
Don’t!

848
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,200
Get married! Get married! Get married!

849
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:07,960
Get married! Get married! Get married!

850
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,080
Get married! Get married! Get married!

851
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,560
So annoying!

852
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:15,640
Acting all shy and small.

853
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,560
And what about you?

854
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:19,680
Acting all weak.

855
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:22,640
For me, it won’t be long.

856
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,040
What about you? When’s your turn?

857
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:33,800
My turn is coming soon, don’t worry.

858
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:37,600
And when exactly is that?

859
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,680
Get married! Get married! Get married!

860
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,440
Get married! Get married! Get married!

861
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:53,800
Get married! Get married! Get married!

862
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,320
Am I really being overrun by a kid here?

863
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,320
Taking over my whole bedroom...

864
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,880
And probably my whole heart, too.

865
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:21,480
Do you even need to ask?

866
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:23,440
You’ve already taken it all.

867
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,240
Don’t you want an engagement ring
and a wedding ring like JJ’s?

868
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:45,960
I’m not in a rush. I don’t care about material things.

869
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:48,600
How is that possible?

870
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,320
From someone as money-obsessed as you?

871
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:54,960
Oh, please.

872
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:57,240
Hey!

873
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,160
Don’t push it too far.

874
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,920
I’m still young—I can get married whenever.

875
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,320
But at your age, Chef...

876
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:07,760
Oh man, if you break up with me,
no one else will take you.

877
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,120
And on top of that, you’re grumpy like a dog.

878
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:11,560
So I’ve made up my mind.

879
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:13,440
I’m going to take care of you myself, Chef.

880
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,320
Me?

881
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,120
Sorry, Chef.

882
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,520
I need to propose first.

883
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,440
Because if I wait for you to ask,

884
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,280
we’d probably end up married in the next life.

885
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,480
Marriage equality is already legal,

886
01:14:50,240 --> 01:14:51,280
so I don’t want to wait.

887
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:04,920
Will you marry me, Chef?

888
01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:01,240
After putting the ring on, what do we do next?

889
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:02,680
Take a photo!

890
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,240
Like this!

891
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,200
You little rascal.

892
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:14,200
Can you stop messing with me for just one day?

893
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:16,760
No way, it’s too much fun.

894
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,400
Stay with me for a long time
so I can keep messing with you.

895
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,120
No need.

896
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,160
(Meddling Chef)

897
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:22,240
Sorry!

898
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,520
That’s a wrap!
(Cut!)

899
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:33,120
(Great job, everyone!)

900
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,880
What are you doing here?
(Totally confused here.)

901
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:43,760
Got to tease first.

902
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:44,800
Go ahead, Plawan, kiss him.

903
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,160
Chef Oab teases, then kisses.

904
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,840
Got a leg cramp!

905
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:03,200
This part is tense.

906
01:18:03,200 --> 01:18:04,800
My stomach is shaking all over.

907
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:06,760
When you touch it—

908
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:07,840
Hey, my stomach’s shaking!

909
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:12,120
It feels like the table keeps sliding.

910
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,800
Let’s sailub lead.

911
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,080
Sailub pushes, and he shakes.

912
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:17,480
(Getting embarrassed now.)

913
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:24,520
That’s not it.

914
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,240
You’re still in the mood to crack jokes, huh?

915
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:36,640
(Someone’s sneaking a bite.)

916
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,680
(Caught in the act.)

917
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:40,760
Does it hurt?

918
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,480
Got thick hands.

919
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,960
Wow, thick just like your face!

920
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,720
Don’t be rough with me, okay?

921
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,840
I’m wet!

922
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,360
I’m soaked, and I’m cold.

923
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:58,440
Such a crybaby.

924
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,160
I’m cold.

925
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:01,280
Why are you posing?

926
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,880
Afraid you won’t look as cool as Chale?

927
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,200
What’s up with this guy?

928
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:05,200
He’s acting weird.

929
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,960
Khun Metas, the guest you’ve been waiting for.

930
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,120
Nope, that’s not it.

931
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:22,040
That’s not the right voice.

932
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,160
Totally shocked.

933
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,800
Went to several events last night.

934
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:36,400
P’ Oab!

935
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,760
P’ Oab!

936
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:41,920
It’s okay, the chef will die now anyway.

937
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,040
Hit the keys!

938
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:45,640
P’ Oab! P’ Oab! P’ Oab!

939
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,080
What did you order?

940
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,760
We need to film another scene now.

941
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:53,680
That’s right.

942
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:56,560
(Don’t mess with the younger one’s hair.)

943
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:59,120
So mean!

944
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,800
Where do you expect me to fight you, Plawan?

945
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,440
Huh?

946
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,000
(There, there. It’s okay.)

947
01:20:13,640 --> 01:20:15,600
Actually, we brought a fire truck to spray the water.

948
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:16,600
We hired them for this.

949
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,200
We set up the rain ourselves.

950
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:19,720
I’m telling you, this was a big investment.

951
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,560
It feels so real.

952
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:22,480
Yeah Yeah !

953
01:20:22,480 --> 01:20:24,000
This area is massive,

954
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,440
stretching for several kilometers.

955
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:26,640
How much to hire you?
Can you stop now?

956
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:27,600
Let’s stop for a bit.

957
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,880
Watch the umbrella!

958
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:42,320
Wait your turn.

959
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,160
Cut! Let’s do it again.

960
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:49,640
Cut! Again.

961
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:52,000
(Didn’t even get to go anywhere.)

962
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:52,560
All done!

963
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,800
That’s a wrap for the series
"This Love doesn't have Long Beans"

964
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:55,920
Wrap it up, wrap it up!

965
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,960
I can’t say much, or I might cry.

966
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,440
Better get going now.

967
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:04,600
This Love doesn't have Long Beans.
