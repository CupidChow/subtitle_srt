1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,840
Chef, you're letting me keep this?

2
00:00:04,930 --> 00:00:05,990
I believe you're talented.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,300
You'll find the unique selling point of your restaurant for sure.

4
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,270
But you need to have more confidence in yourself.

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,670
If I come up with a new dish at my restaurant,
I'll come back and invite everyone to try it.

6
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:14,820
You seem to hate me,

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,140
but every time we meet, my heart races uncontrollably.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,790
If it's not racing out of anger,

9
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,890
it's racing for another reason.

10
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,710
Are you some kind of heart therapist?

11
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,790
Are you mad at me?

12
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,620
I don’t like things that are unclear.

13
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:25,730
I’ll ask you directly then.

14
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:27,110
About us on the rooftop...

15
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,310
what do you really think, Chef?

16
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,750
you made me want to make granita again.

17
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,990
But with a new flavor.

18
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,550
That looks just like you.

19
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:44,500
If we start,

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,650
I won't let you stop like last time.

21
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:55,900
(I am about to transfer another payment,
and I hope you'll stay until the final round.)

22
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,170
Ouch!

23
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,790
Damn it.

24
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,550
Didn't your parents teach you any manners?

25
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,040
What time do you think it is?

26
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,590
I have work early tomorrow.

27
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,990
Dude, Chef Oab and I slept together.

28
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,230
Huh? What did you just say, Wan?

29
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,790
I warned you, didn't I?

30
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,730
You idiot.

31
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,300
Don't yell at me just yet!

32
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,520
My heart is already fragile right now.

33
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,090
JJ, what should I do?

34
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,230
Right now, you need to stay focused, Wan.

35
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,550
Sleeping together is one thing,

36
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,010
love is another.

37
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,120
But you must not fall in love with that chef, no matter what.

38
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,300
Hey, that's easier said than done!

39
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,660
I'm telling you this for the last time,

40
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:50,070
no matter how hard it is, you have to do it.

41
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,990
Otherwise, you might as well quit the competition.

42
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,950
Do you understand?

43
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,640
JJ, JJ...

44
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:30,810
Come in first.

45
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:32,820
Yes.

46
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,030
Chef, come over here for a moment.

47
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,280
Did you prepare all of this yourself?

48
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,430
Yes.

49
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,710
I didn't think you'd wake up on time

50
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,980
after such a strenuous workout together last night.

51
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,909
Being young really is great.

52
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,000
I've had even more intense workouts before.

53
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,480
Is this something you need to brag about?

54
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,570
Was it so amazing that you remember it enough to boast to me?

55
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,110
I'm not one to nitpick,

56
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,330
but what makes him better than me?

57
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:01,060
I meant actual exercise,

58
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,860
not what we did last night.

59
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,580
Didn't anyone ever teach you?

60
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,330
Kids who speak ambiguously often get punished.

61
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,240
I won't be punished

62
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,380
because I'm trying to be a good chef.

63
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,500
Try it, Chef.

64
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,909
Did you make this yourself?

65
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,840
Yes, try it.

66
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,900
It's tasty.

67
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,570
But the basil filling needs some improvement.

68
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,060
You've overcooked it, and the aroma of the basil is gone.

69
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,000
Okay, then you don't have to eat it.

70
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,200
Eat it.

71
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,360
You don't have to.

72
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:14,010
Eat it.

73
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,200
But it's overcooked, right?

74
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,650
Come on, come on.

75
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:27,690
Chef,

76
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,720
I need to talk to you about something serious.

77
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,909
Why? What's the matter?

78
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,190
I want you to keep what happened last night a secret.

79
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:51,150
I don't want others to think badly of us

80
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,690
or see the competition as unfair.

81
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,530
Just because we like each other or slept together

82
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,500
doesn't mean I'll be biased in the competition.

83
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,710
The person who will inherit my restaurant,

84
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,710
even if it's a lover or a family member,

85
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,050
if they don't have the skills,

86
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,640
I won't give them the restaurant.

87
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,790
Otherwise, I would have sold it off easily a long time ago.

88
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,470
That's good.

89
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,020
But,

90
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,920
do you really like me, Chef?

91
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,700
Or do you not like me?

92
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,940
But from what I saw,

93
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:41,210
you seemed quite happy last night.

94
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:46,110
Yeah.

95
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,570
So, what is it?

96
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,150
What do you like?

97
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,970
Both, I guess.

98
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,230
But I'm not sure if you truly like me, Chef.

99
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,620
Let's wait until things at the restaurant settle down.

100
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,130
Then, I'll clear things up between you and me.

101
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,430
Right now, you need to stay focused, Wan.

102
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,400
Sleeping together is one thing, love is another.

103
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:26,480
But you must not fall in love with that chef, no matter what.

104
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,870
I hope you succeed.

105
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:34,340
What should I do?

106
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,770
Chef, I need to talk to you about something serious.

107
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:50,040
I want you to keep what happened last night a secret.

108
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,970
I was away from the office for just a few days,

109
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,770
and our revenue dropped this much?

110
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,160
What are you all doing?

111
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,570
Mr. Metas, your physical therapist has arrived.

112
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,240
Hurry up and take care of me.

113
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,600
Quickly!

114
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:23,750
You're here already?

115
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:25,760
Let's start the physical therapy, I'm ready.

116
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,400
Hey,

117
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,850
watch it!

118
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,810
And have you had breakfast?

119
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,350
I don't eat breakfast.

120
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,860
Normally, I just have a cup of coffee.

121
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,510
Why don't you eat breakfast?

122
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:50,340
It's the most important meal of the day.

123
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,330
If you don't eat, where will you get the energy for physical therapy?

124
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,310
Sit down.

125
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,720
Sit down

126
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,540
Wait for me here.

127
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,660
Plawan, can you check the stock for me and see if it's ready?

128
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,440
Sure.

129
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,650
Everyone, how's the prep going?

130
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,970
Almost done, Chef.

131
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,100
Today, I'll be at the stir-fry station.

132
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,190
Pun Sib, you don't need to fry today.

133
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,270
You'll be greeting customers instead.

134
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,320
Yes, Chef.

135
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,800
Kluer,

136
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,580
you'll be at the washing and prep station.

137
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:56,360
Plawan, you'll be at the frying station today.

138
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,150
Frying?

139
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:58,360
Me?

140
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,410
Yes, I said we need to rotate tasks in the kitchen.

141
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,170
You can't just serve all the time.

142
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,110
To be the successor, you need to be good at every position.

143
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,650
Is there a problem?

144
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,210
No, Chef.

145
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,160
Then get to it.

146
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,050
Yes, Chef.

147
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,840
Wrap it up quickly.

148
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,480
Is this the right way to wrap it, Chef?

149
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,300
Hmm...

150
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,170
Wrap the spring rolls properly.

151
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,940
Be serious about it.

152
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,830
How should I wrap them?

153
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,610
What are you doing?

154
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,250
None of these are any good.

155
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,360
This one is mushy, and this one is burnt. Fry them again.

156
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,460
Yes, Chef.

157
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,730
Give them to me.

158
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,690
Give them to me.

159
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,570
I told you,

160
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:28,200
I don't show favoritism just because we've been together.

161
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,130
If you get eliminated early,

162
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,630
it will make things clear between us.

163
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,350
Fry them again.

164
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,590
Do it properly.

165
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,860
Are we doing the right thing by not using the privileges of being close?

166
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,540
Come on, hurry up.

167
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,170
Fry them properly

168
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,540
and make sure each piece is evenly golden.

169
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,360
Yes, Chef.

170
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,370
You're really not meeting expectations.
Give it to me.

171
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,740
Watch how I do it.

172
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,520
-Make sure it's evenly golden.
-Kluer, look.

173
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:21,100
When I was frying, he yelled at me and threw the food in the trash.

174
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:23,750
But with Plawan, he's almost holding his hand while teaching.

175
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,690
What's going on?

176
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,350
Who knows? Maybe Chef Oab has changed.

177
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:29,870
Really?

178
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,340
Now fry it.

179
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,590
Why aren't you out there greeting customers?

180
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,910
Why are you in the kitchen?

181
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,300
Yes, Chef.

182
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,850
I've never eaten breakfast in my life.

183
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,990
I can't eat in the morning.

184
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,760
My body is already used to it.

185
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,990
Why are you bothering me about this?

186
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,350
Hey you, sit down, now.

187
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,240
Quickly!

188
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,010
Discipline and habit are different things.

189
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,720
If your body is used to it,
then you need to create new habits for your body.

190
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,900
Start by eating something light like this.

191
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:34,190
You're a physical therapist, just do your job.

192
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,550
Why are you forcing me to eat?

193
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,590
Breakfast helps your body get the nutrients it needs

194
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,300
and will help you recover faster.

195
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,380
If you don't want your brain to age prematurely, just eat breakfast.

196
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,340
It's not that hard.

197
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,730
You're really fussy and bothersome.

198
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,530
Fine, I'll eat,

199
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,310
but only because I want the physical therapy session to end quickly.

200
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,500
Thank you very much.

201
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,880
Wait a minute,

202
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,670
sit with me for a while.

203
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,140
You can cook pretty well.

204
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,700
Were you ever a housekeeper or a caregiver before?

205
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:43,690
I've taken care of people before, like Plawan.

206
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,080
That guy is even more demanding than you.

207
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:50,730
You seem really close to Plawan.

208
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,460
You're not one of those friends who secretly has feelings for him, are you?

209
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,000
Oh, come on. Me and Plawan?

210
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,660
Don't get any funny ideas.

211
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:02,520
We've known each other since high school.

212
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,710
Apart from me, he doesn't have anyone else.

213
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,140
He loves to provoke and annoy people,

214
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,170
so I always have to step in and clear things up.

215
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,770
So it’s just like with the restaurant situation,

216
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,420
where you have to come and clear things up with me.

217
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,730
What do you get out of it?

218
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,520
Did Plawan make any deals with you?

219
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,510
What deals ?

220
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,960
What can a person like him do for me?

221
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,680
If he just stops crashing at my place for free,

222
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,580
I'd be grateful enough.

223
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,320
So, it means you're at a loss.

224
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,590
You have to pay for the ride to talk to me,

225
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,060
spend time you could be earning money,

226
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:40,100
and even possibly pay for your friend's meals, right?

227
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,140
That's true.

228
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:44,980
Now I'm not even sure if I have a friend or a kid.

229
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,630
How about this?

230
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,560
If your friend wins this competition,

231
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,600
I'll open a physical therapy clinic for you.

232
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:56,240
For what reason?

233
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,620
Because you're a talented physical therapist.

234
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:01,490
You deserve to have your own clinic.

235
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:02,390
Why?

236
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:06,700
Are you planning to invest in me
and then squeeze profits from me every day?

237
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,340
Keep your money.

238
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:10,360
I can still earn my living on my own.

239
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,470
Or if you have too much money and don't know what to do with it,

240
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,240
why not donate it for tax deductions?

241
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,460
At least that way, someone will benefit from your money.

242
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,110
You!

243
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,560
You even told your friend to exploit me,

244
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,560
and now

245
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,410
I’m offering you a deal.

246
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,110
I don’t want you to be taken advantage of.

247
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,550
If we become partners,

248
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,860
we both benefit, don’t we?

249
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,030
But I don’t think like you.

250
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:41,190
People don’t need to constantly worry about who’s getting the better deal.

251
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:44,020
Act tough all you want.

252
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:45,910
I’ll wait and see

253
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,720
how long you can stay this righteous.

254
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,850
Everyone is selfish at the end of the day.

255
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,800
Everyone, we're done cleaning up the place.

256
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,160
How about we go for some grilled pork?

257
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,360
My treat.

258
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,300
Huh? What did you say, Chef?

259
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,910
You're treating us to a meal?

260
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,180
Are you hard of hearing?

261
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,200
I said I’m treating you all to grilled pork.

262
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,090
In a million years,

263
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,540
I’ve never seen Chef treat anyone to a meal.

264
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,320
That’s right.

265
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,090
What got into you, Chef?

266
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,140
Nothing got into me.

267
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,000
I just noticed you’ve all been stressed for several weeks,

268
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,600
and I wanted to take you out to relax.

269
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,310
I’ve said before, we work as a team in the kitchen.

270
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,640
Going out to eat together helps build relationships.

271
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,770
If you really wanted to build relationships with us,

272
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,070
you should have invited us

273
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,380
while Auto was still here.

274
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,090
You sure talk a lot. So, are you coming or not?

275
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,050
Of course, Chef. Who would say no to that?

276
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,770
I'm definitely going. What about you guys?

277
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:25,920
I’m in.

278
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,440
Yeah, let’s go.

279
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,290
And what about you?

280
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,640
How could I pass up something free like this?

281
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:40,960
Alright then, once we're done here, let’s meet in front of the restaurant.

282
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:41,890
Yes, Chef.

283
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,160
Let's meet up.

284
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:46,990
(Let's meet up.)

285
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,520
Please walk slowly, Mr. Metas.

286
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,340
Yes, that's good,

287
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,600
walk slowly.

288
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:53,770
Very good.

289
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,950
Please walk slowly.

290
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,370
Mr. Metas, slowly turn around.

291
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,310
Walk slowly,

292
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,790
excellent job, Mr. Metas.

293
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,460
I think you're improving a lot now.

294
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:23,140
And you said you'd do physical therapy for 45 minutes a day.

295
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,920
Look,

296
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,430
it's already dark.

297
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,890
Why haven't you gone home yet?

298
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,180
I'll call my secretary to take you home.

299
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,530
It's alright, sir.

300
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,530
I planned to stay and help you take a shower.

301
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,280
In this condition, it might be difficult for you.

302
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,010
Come on, let me help you.

303
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,180
No need for that.

304
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,170
You don't need to call your secretary.

305
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,940
They must have gone home a long time ago.

306
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:49,100
I can manage on my own.

307
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,170
I pay my secretary for 24-hour service.

308
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,910
You should go home, I can take care of myself.

309
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,360
Let me help you instead.

310
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,110
Chef.

311
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,670
What's up?

312
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:31,350
I apologize, but I can't go with you.

313
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,550
I have an urgent matter to attend to.

314
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,410
If you weren't planning to eat,
why did you invite us out in the first place?

315
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,820
I wanted to treat you all.

316
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,400
Just eat and enjoy yourselves.

317
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,450
In that case, can I refill the dessert?

318
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:52,650
Go ahead.

319
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,050
Yes! I'll go get some dessert.

320
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:05,380
Chef, what do you think about Plawan?

321
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,890
Why do you ask me that?

322
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,300
I don't think anything special about him.

323
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,350
Plawan is just one of the contestants.

324
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,210
I treat him the same as you and Pun Sib.

325
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,400
There's nothing special.

326
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,790
I didn't mean it that way.

327
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:29,520
I meant, do you think Plawan has shown any improvement?

328
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,770
Because initially, you didn't seem confident in his cooking skills at all.

329
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,490
During the first rounds, you even asked me to keep an eye on him.

330
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,120
Oh, that.

331
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,300
Well, he has improved.

332
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:47,470
Thanks for keeping an eye on him for me.

333
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,660
It's nothing. I'm happy to help.
If you need me to do more, just let me know.

334
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,420
What do you mean?

335
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,840
I like Plawan, Chef.

336
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,980
You!

337
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,180
Don't lock the door!

338
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,210
Ouch.

339
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,380
Mr. Metas, Mr. Metas.

340
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:30,990
Hey,

341
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,630
Metas!

342
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:33,750
Are you okay?

343
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,780
Turn over, please. Turn over.

344
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,020
Are you hurt?
Tell me where it hurts.

345
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,670
And why are you barging in like this?

346
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,240
Get out, I'm naked!

347
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,470
-You!
-Give me the towel.

348
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,060
It's okay, take it easy and get up slowly.

349
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,150
Don't put weight on the injured leg, okay?

350
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,980
Let me help you up. Here we go.

351
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,850
You hold me gently.

352
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,850
One, two, just like that.

353
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,090
Mr. Metas, your guests have arrived.

354
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,660
-Hey, close it!
-Close it now!

355
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,350
-Close it!
-Hurry!

356
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,190
-Oh, close the door first!
-Wan!

357
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:35,010
What's with you?

358
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,470
Out of thousands of physical therapists in the country,

359
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,970
you’re the one who has to take care of Metas?

360
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,350
And this late at night?

361
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:44,570
No physical therapist works this late.

362
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,240
And just now, in the bathroom...

363
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:49,970
Stop it, Wan.

364
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Metas just fell, and I went in to help. That's it.

365
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,370
Is that really all?

366
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,990
Yes, really.

367
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,980
What?

368
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,590
What the hell?

369
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,020
Stop poking me.

370
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,160
I said, stop poking.

371
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,030
Alright, let’s get to the point.

372
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:28,170
You have to be back by 10:00 PM, right?

373
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:28,930
Yes, that's correct.

374
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:31,450
I don't want any of my investments to be wasted.

375
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,350
I want to know your plan to win this competition.

376
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,430
That way, I'll know if you're sure to win,

377
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,390
or if I need to prepare money to buy out the winner instead of you.

378
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,810
Or maybe you're not confident about the next round at all.

379
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,330
You can tell me, so we don't waste time.

380
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:01,030
Even Chef Oab, my friend Wan, managed to get him.

381
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:04,050
The restaurant issue will resolve itself in time.

382
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,390
Just focus on the deal for now, right?

383
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,110
What’s with you?

384
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,860
JJ, you don’t need to tell him about that.

385
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
I didn’t want anyone to know.

386
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,370
I’m not lying, though.

387
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,320
But if you don’t want me to talk, then I won’t.

388
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,190
Not bad.

389
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,470
This is better than I thought.

390
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,440
Use your relationship

391
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,700
to make Chef Oab give you the restaurant quickly.

392
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,720
Are you crazy?

393
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,110
I can't do that.

394
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,540
My friend has dignity, Mr. Metas.

395
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:49,010
Dignity doesn't fill your stomach.

396
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,060
As soon as the job's done,

397
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:53,070
the money will be transferred to your account immediately.

398
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,910
So, what’s your plan?

399
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,520
So, what’s the deal with you and Mr. Metas?

400
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:11,030
Should I call you a millionaire daughter-in-law already?

401
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,860
Millionaire daughter-in-law?

402
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:16,010
I told you to stop making things up.

403
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,340
Wan. Damn it.

404
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,220
Mr. Metas just bought a big package at my clinic

405
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,610
and asked me to do his physical therapy. That’s all.

406
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:29,150
But what I saw didn't seem to be just that.

407
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,710
Cut it out.

408
00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:33,540
Tell me now, JJ.

409
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,040
How far have things gone?

410
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,610
If I happen to lose in this round, I might need to use you as leverage.

411
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:44,930
Too bad for you. If you lose, you’ll have to pay up

412
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:48,190
because there’s nothing between me and Mr. Metas.

413
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,590
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I am.

414
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,510
I just found out

415
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,830
why Mr. Metas became such a ruthless investor.

416
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,090
It’s because his family was once betrayed.

417
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,620
It's not surprising that someone
who lost everything would turn out like this.

418
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,260
Sometimes pity

419
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:14,820
is the beginning of love,

420
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,240
as P’ Aoy and P’ Chod said.

421
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,850
Oh, come on. P’ Aoy and P’ Chod, really?

422
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,220
Stop grilling me.

423
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,510
You've been listening to too much Club Friday.

424
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,310
I just pity him. It’s nothing more than that.

425
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,220
I think my situation isn't as suspicious as yours.

426
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:35,460
You’re aiming to inherit the restaurant
but acting like Natasha for Mr. Metas,

427
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,950
yet you ended up sleeping with the chef.

428
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,550
Are you not feeling anything at all?

429
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,390
Of course I am! I’m completely shaken.

430
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,460
What should I do? I don’t want to do this anymore,

431
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:59,050
but I can’t pay Mr. Metas back right now.

432
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:02,330
I’ve already spent the money on my condo rent.

433
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,580
I’m so stressed out!

434
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,190
I've warned you, Wan.

435
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:12,700
If Chef Oab finds out you lied,

436
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,840
you better prepare yourself because he’ll cut you out of his life for good.

437
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,260
I'm serious, Wan.

438
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:19,070
When the truth comes out,

439
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:22,310
Chef Oab will never speak to you again.

440
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,550
Jeez, JJ.

441
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,530
Could you not stab me in the heart for once?

442
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,710
My heart hurts enough already.

443
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:35,730
Then you better decide if you want to confess your love,

444
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,860
you need to confess your sins first.

445
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,290
Confess your sins.

446
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,270
What should I do, Wan?

447
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,180
Why are you here? Do you need something?

448
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,400
No, I just came to report that I’ve arrived at the restaurant.

449
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,300
That's all. Good night, Chef.

450
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,120
Where have you been?

451
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,180
Why didn't you join us for dinner?

452
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,830
I took the team out to eat for team bonding.

453
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,690
How can it be complete without you?

454
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,410
I can't say, Chef.

455
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:24,580
If you can’t tell me, then don’t.

456
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,670
But know this, I’m not pleased.

457
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,030
Wait, Chef.

458
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,830
Are you ready to tell me now?

459
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,970
It's just...

460
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,160
Well, I.

461
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,700
Ah, Chef!

462
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:02,740
Use your relationship

463
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,720
to make Chef Oab give you the restaurant quickly.

464
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,300
The reason I can't go

465
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,010
it's because I had family business to attend to.

466
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,910
Once I’ve sorted it out, I’ll tell you, Chef.

467
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,650
Are you sure it's family business?

468
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,910
Yes, I'm sure.

469
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,800
But I can't give you the details.

470
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,060
Can't tell

471
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,340
or won't tell?

472
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,690
You will have to tell me everything eventually.

473
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,600
You can't hide anything from me.

474
00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:46,070
You'll end up with sore hands.

475
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:48,630
Look, your hands are all red.

476
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:49,980
Come wash them quickly.

477
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:04,840
Salt will help soothe the burning from the chili.

478
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,030
What are you doing, clumsy again?

479
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:19,030
I don't want Wan's hands to burn from the chili.
I'm helping him wash them.

480
00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:20,320
Let me see.

481
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,550
No, it's fine. I'm okay, really.

482
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,060
I can wash them myself.

483
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:36,840
Suit yourself then.

484
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,760
Hurry up

485
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,170
and wash properly.

486
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:48,100
If it gets in your eyes, it'll be worse.

487
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,650
I'm not a child anymore. I know, I know.

488
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,320
What time is it now?

489
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,850
You guys are just chatting away.

490
00:36:57,930 --> 00:36:59,380
The customers are about to arrive.

491
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,500
Yes, Chef.

492
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:04,890
Alright, let's quickly go and greet the customers at the front.
My hands feel better now.

493
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,090
Thanks a lot, Kluer.

494
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,720
I like Wan, Chef.

495
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,370
Romance at work?

496
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:24,070
Aren't you afraid of conflicts?

497
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,790
You two are competing for my restaurant, remember?

498
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,210
It's okay, Chef.

499
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,180
You and Kao Suay managed to run the restaurant together before.

500
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,730
I don't think it will be a problem.

501
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,860
If we end up together,

502
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,680
whether I or Wan wins,

503
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,680
we can still run the restaurant together.

504
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:42,250
So,

505
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:45,210
you're not going to stop me from courting Wan, right?

506
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,180
No,

507
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,110
do whatever you want.

508
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,070
Just don't let it affect the work at the restaurant.

509
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:00,680
You have my word, Chef.

510
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,670
Hello, dear customer.
May I know the name under which the reservation was made?

511
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,380
I didn't make a reservation.

512
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,390
I'm sorry, but we only accept customers with reservations.

513
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:12,190
You can book through LINE or call us.

514
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,070
Excuse me, but our restaurant is not open yet.

515
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,910
Our restaurant is not open yet.

516
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,570
Kluer,

517
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,620
please prepare everything before we open.

518
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,620
Yes, Chef.

519
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:33,800
Kao Suay?

520
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,850
Oab!

521
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:28,730
Everything here is just like it was before.

522
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:04,270
Why are you back so soon?

523
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:06,820
Did you take a break from school?

524
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,310
If I had known about Dad earlier,

525
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,340
I would have come back sooner.

526
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,870
Why didn’t you tell me about him?

527
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,190
Master didn't want you to abandon your scholarship

528
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,310
or your future

529
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:22,520
to come back because he was ill.

530
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:25,120
But this surgery is a big deal.

531
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,310
How could you and Dad decide something like this without me?

532
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,550
I tried talking to Master about it.

533
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:33,050
But Dad didn’t let you call me, right?

534
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,690
Um,

535
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:41,410
is that why you haven’t contacted me at all, Oab?

536
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,840
I called the hospital

537
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:50,810
and they said Dad is about to have emergency surgery.

538
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,060
Oab,

539
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:59,330
can you come with me?

540
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,280
Kluer, who was that woman earlier?

541
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,410
Is she Chef Oab's girlfriend?

542
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,740
Yeah, she’s Chef’s ex-girlfriend.

543
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:46,460
Oh, I see.

544
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:51,830
Everyone, I have an urgent matter today, so we’ll close the restaurant.

545
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,750
-Kluer,
-Yes?

546
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,400
Call and cancel all reservations for today, and issue full refunds.

547
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:01,300
Tell them it’s a family emergency.
They should understand.

548
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:02,420
Got it, Chef.

549
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:11,850
Chef seemed really rushed.
Is something bad happening?

550
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,780
Yeah, Kao Suay didn't look well from the moment she arrived.

551
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,340
Kao Suay's father needs emergency surgery.

552
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,350
What?

553
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:26,920
Chef Oab considers Kao Suay and her father as part of his family.

554
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:29,100
It's worrisome.

555
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,350
Even if we worry,

556
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,690
there’s nothing we can do, right?

557
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,650
Plawan, Kluer,

558
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,230
should we go out and find something to eat?

559
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,030
I’ve never been to a night market in my life. Look.

560
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,660
There’s nothing that interesting.

561
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,900
Let’s just go back to the supermarket.

562
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,260
The market is hot and crowded.

563
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,420
Come on, Plawan, go to the night market with me.

564
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:24,460
Please.

565
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,310
I’m not going. I’d rather sleep.

566
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,520
You two can go if you want.

567
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,090
You're acting like an old man.

568
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,610
Don't you usually vlog about food?

569
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,210
Your viewers are starting to ask when the next episode is coming.

570
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,510
I don't want to do anything.

571
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:39,590
I’m leaving.

572
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:40,720
Hey,

573
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:41,770
wait a minute.

574
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,750
Kluer, help me out.

575
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:45,790
I promise

576
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,170
we'll take just one picture for social media, and that's it.

577
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:49,980
It's rare to close the restaurant early.

578
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:50,740
Please.

579
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,330
Plawan, come with us.

580
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:57,950
It won't take long, just a meal together.

581
00:44:57,990 --> 00:45:00,130
We still have to return and watch the restaurant.

582
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,780
A change of scenery will be good.

583
00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:04,540
I'll show you around the area.

584
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,270
It's not often that Chef isn't here.

585
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:08,340
Come on.

586
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,040
Exactly. Teamwork.

587
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:14,020
Chef will know we are closer when we get back.

588
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:15,700
Please.

589
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:21,080
Okay.

590
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:23,670
Let’s go to the night market!

591
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:40,720
Doctor, how is my father?

592
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:42,770
Everything went well.

593
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,870
After the surgery,

594
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,140
we will move the patient to the ICU for observation.

595
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,360
If everything is fine,

596
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,500
we will then transfer him to the regular patient room.

597
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,060
Thank you, Doctor.

598
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:54,610
Thank you so much.

599
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,720
You're welcome.

600
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,800
Don't worry.

601
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,700
The ICU is just for close monitoring.

602
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:05,870
Everything is fine now.

603
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,800
I trust

604
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,470
that the doctor did everything they could,

605
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:13,450
but...

606
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:19,310
But what are you worried about, Kao Suay?

607
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,840
But won't Kao Suay's return affect our competition?

608
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,000
If Chef decides not to sell the restaurant after all,

609
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,350
I'd be really happy.

610
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,960
We never wanted this place to change into something else.

611
00:46:31,050 --> 00:46:32,020
Oh, come on.

612
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,970
With such a prime location,

613
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:35,840
it deserves a bit of renovation.

614
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:37,660
If I were to get the restaurant,

615
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,230
I’d expand it to accommodate more customers,

616
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:43,170
diversify the menu,

617
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:46,100
-and invite influencers and celebrities to dine here.
-Chef Oab!

618
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:53,720
That will help draw in more customers.
Just thinking about it gets me excited.

619
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,850
What about you, Plawan?

620
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,710
What do you want to do with the restaurant if you win?

621
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:02,300
I don't know. Why even think about it?

622
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,160
Kluer said it himself, if Kao Suay is back,

623
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,390
anything can happen.

624
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,140
We’ll just have to wait and see.

625
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:13,470
If Kao Suay is worried about the expenses,

626
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:16,300
you don't have to be. I've already set money aside.

627
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:19,650
Oab, don't even think about
using the money from selling the restaurant to help me.

628
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,480
I don't want you to sell the restaurant.

629
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,580
You knew about that?

630
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:27,580
Of course, with your announcement all over social media,

631
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,820
I found out even from over there.

632
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,220
Let me figure it out on my own first.

633
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:36,900
Kao Suay,

634
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,570
you should save your money for your studies.

635
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,630
You’ll need a lot to graduate.

636
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,200
As for your dad, don’t worry. I'll handle it.

637
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:48,380
I respect him as much as a father, and I won't leave his side.

638
00:47:48,810 --> 00:47:50,440
I've decided to take a break from my studies.

639
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,040
Hey everyone, let's take a photo!

640
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:58,160
Come on, come on, let's take a picture.

641
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:00,250
At first,

642
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,090
I thought that seizing opportunities in life was the most important thing.

643
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:05,610
But in reality,

644
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:09,210
the people who have been by my side all along are more important

645
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:10,790
that's my dad

646
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,360
and you.

647
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,230
Here, here, come quickly,

648
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:18,400
turn around.

649
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:21,100
One, two, three.

650
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:24,830
Thank you, Chef Oab,

651
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,750
for always being so good to me.

652
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:29,980
No one has been as good to me as you have.

653
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:44,090
One more photo. One, two, three.

654
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:11,100
Come on, let me help you.

655
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:13,990
If you cut like this, you might lose a finger for sure.

656
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:16,730
Thanks,

657
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,920
almost became a nine-fingered Plawan.

658
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:23,270
But if I lose two fingers...

659
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:26,030
-I love you?
-No,

660
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:27,280
Spider-Man.

661
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,590
Pew, pew, pew.

662
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,240
But if I lose three fingers,

663
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:34,070
I'll suddenly become a great singer.

664
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:34,970
Why is that?

665
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:38,240
Rock star.

666
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,940
You're funny.

667
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,920
Rock star.

668
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,050
Rock.

669
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,050
-Rock.
-Rock.

670
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:50,870
I'll bite you.

671
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:52,680
Oh, really?
Going to bite?

672
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:01,510
Hey, we're almost done preparing.

673
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:03,240
Chef, you can go wait outside.

674
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,330
Chef, Kao Suay is here.

675
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:11,690
Hello, everyone.

676
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:15,650
Today I'll be your server.

677
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,490
Feel free to give me any suggestions, don't hesitate.

678
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,370
Alright then,

679
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,800
Kao Suay has helped out here before.

680
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:32,030
Today, Kluer will be at the cooking station, Pun Sib at the frying station,

681
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:33,890
and Plawan

682
00:50:35,010 --> 00:50:36,560
will be at the dishwashing station.

683
00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:38,480
We'll divide the work like this today.

684
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,020
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

685
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:45,360
Chef Oab, can I get an apron?

686
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,610
Can you put it on me?

687
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:13,860
Ouch!

688
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:15,990
Are you okay?

689
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,880
Let me take you to get a bandage.

690
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:21,160
But today, you'll have to wear gloves while washing dishes.

691
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:28,430
Chef Oab, could you help me tie my hair?

692
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,630
This looks so delicious, Chef Oab.

693
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:11,700
It's ready to be served.

694
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:12,860
Okay.

695
00:52:28,050 --> 00:52:29,680
Don't be distracted while working in the kitchen.

696
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:31,100
Are you okay?

697
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,250
Why wouldn't I be okay?

698
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:37,850
Well, because of Kao Suay.

699
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:42,550
Didn't you tell me you broke up with Kao Suay?

700
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:44,810
Yes, I did.

701
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,120
Then that's that.

702
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:48,770
I believe what you said.

703
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,210
Why would you need to explain more?

704
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,700
Or is there something new you need to explain?

705
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,780
And are you okay

706
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,710
with Kao Suay helping out in the restaurant like this?

707
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:04,380
Kao Suay is so skilled, how could I not be okay?

708
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:06,610
Don't worry about me, Chef.

709
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,440
Anything that's good for the restaurant,

710
00:53:08,650 --> 00:53:10,070
I have no problem with it.

711
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,760
The Four Seasons dish consists of four bites.

712
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:32,350
The first bite has a mild flavor to adjust your palate,
featuring shrimp with basil sauce.

713
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:37,810
The second bite intensifies, highlighting
the sweet freshness of scallops in basil sauce.

714
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:42,370
The third bite is aromatic with basil,
adorned with crab meat and topped with basil sauce.

715
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:43,490
Lastly,

716
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:47,160
the fourth bite is crispy
and spicy with fried grouper coated in basil sauce.

717
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,410
Enjoy!

718
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,380
Ouch!

719
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:26,590
Are you hurt?

720
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,100
How long have you been practicing walking?

721
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:31,490
Are you overdoing it?

722
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,210
No worries,

723
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:37,420
I've been practicing walking since morning.

724
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:40,280
This week, I plan to stop using the walker.

725
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:42,550
Get ready to teach me new physical therapy exercises.

726
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,190
Hurry up, I need to recover quickly.

727
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:47,330
Hey, stop right there.

728
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:49,580
It's already afternoon.

729
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:51,210
How many hours have you been walking?

730
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,100
Did you stretch as I instructed?

731
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:55,430
Have you been following what I taught you?

732
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:58,500
Do you feel more stiff or in pain?

733
00:54:59,320 --> 00:54:59,920
Huh?

734
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,010
Why? It's just the usual stiffness,

735
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:04,910
maybe a bit of sharp pain here and there.

736
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,480
Then you need to stop and rest.

737
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:10,000
Grab my arm.

738
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,910
Come on, grab my arm.

739
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,240
What do you want, huh?

740
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,510
Complaining about practicing walking and then overdoing it.

741
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:27,670
Can you do things moderately?

742
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:30,600
I'm making you practice walking, not overexert yourself.

743
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:34,410
Always in a rush to handle your billion-dollar business,

744
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,610
but don't you care about your own health?

745
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:42,070
You're so nagging. It's easy for you to say.

746
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,290
I don't want to rush back to work,

747
00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:46,570
but if I don't work,

748
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,260
who will handle it?

749
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:50,710
You're not a businessman, so you wouldn't understand.

750
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:51,920
Do you see your knee?

751
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,020
It's all inflamed.

752
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:56,170
No more physical therapy today.

753
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,350
Let's apply a cold pack first.

754
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:04,350
Ouch, be gentle!

755
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,730
Does it hurt a lot?

756
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,090
I can still bear it.

757
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:10,540
Why bear it?

758
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:12,400
Hold this.

759
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:21,430
I'll give you a painkiller.

760
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:27,330
I’ve washed my hands.

761
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,060
Open your mouth.

762
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:31,870
Open up.

763
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:34,340
Open up.

764
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,570
Here’s some water.

765
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:45,950
One more pill.

766
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:19,790
Just rest for today.

767
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,280
I'll be going now.

768
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:23,560
Oh, come on.

769
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:26,660
So, you're really not going to do physical therapy for me today?

770
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,430
You came all this way,

771
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,850
and I won’t let your clinic

772
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:32,780
deduct your hours for nothing.

773
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,180
It’s no big deal.

774
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:35,420
I’ll just go back.

775
00:57:36,910 --> 00:57:38,030
Wait a minute.

776
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,150
What now?

777
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,240
What’s this?

778
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,680
It's for your transportation.

779
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,420
You came here for nothing today.

780
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:53,020
But you've already paid my clinic.

781
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:54,700
It's included in that.

782
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,830
Why would you pay me extra?

783
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:59,850
Everything in this world runs on money, you know.

784
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,380
It’s not something to be ashamed of.

785
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,270
This stays between you and me.

786
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:15,220
When will you stop throwing money at people?

787
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:17,780
Let me be clear.

788
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:22,010
I get paid properly by the clinic.

789
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,290
And if you keep this up,

790
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:26,540
you can start looking for a new physical therapist.

791
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:30,580
Okay!

792
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:31,870
Act tough all you want.

793
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:33,010
You'll soon realize

794
00:58:33,130 --> 00:58:36,270
there's nothing in this world money can’t conquer.

795
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:00,840
I miss this place.

796
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,570
Everything's still the same, isn't it, Chef Oab?

797
00:59:10,030 --> 00:59:12,370
Thank you for letting me help out at the restaurant.

798
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:15,690
If I stayed at the hospital, I'd probably go crazy.

799
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,700
And...

800
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:20,850
how's your father doing?

801
00:59:20,950 --> 00:59:22,260
He's awake,

802
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:25,370
but still in the ICU for observation.

803
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:28,480
They don't allow relatives to stay with him.

804
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:36,710
Are you really going to sell this restaurant, Chef Oab?

805
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:45,230
That's what I'm thinking.

806
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:48,620
That's a shame.

807
00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:51,800
I still remember the first day we looked at this building.

808
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,330
But losing the restaurant isn't as sad as losing Chef Oab's cooking skills.

809
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:57,430
I’m not quitting cooking.

810
00:59:58,240 --> 00:59:59,050
I'm just taking a break.

811
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:01,950
Whenever I feel the passion to cook again, I'll come back to it.

812
01:00:03,610 --> 01:00:05,130
So, what if...

813
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:08,630
what if I wanted to invest in the restaurant with you again?

814
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,730
This time I won't leave.

815
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,580
My father probably wants me to stay here too.

816
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:25,850
Please give me time to prove myself and win your heart back.

817
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,750
Kao Suay has a new menu to propose to you, Chef Oab.

818
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:07,110
But our customers really love our current menu.
There's no need to change it.

819
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:10,180
Why does it seem like when Plawan talks to you,
it's different from everyone else?

820
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:12,390
Chef Oab, do you have something going on with Plawan?

821
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:13,770
Didn't you say you didn't think anything of it at first?

822
01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:15,340
This means you're really upset, aren't you?

823
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:18,720
Who is the new clinic owner?

824
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:21,690
Do you think harassing me like this

825
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:23,170
will make me give up on you?

826
01:01:23,210 --> 01:01:24,070
That's never going to happen.

827
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:27,940
Kluer, it seems like you're the only one who really believes in me.

828
01:01:27,990 --> 01:01:31,110
But I'm serious about confessing my feelings to Plawan.

829
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:33,000
It has to be today.

830
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:37,490
What are you doing?

831
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:38,940
Being clumsy again?

832
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,150
(Wrong hand, Chef.)

833
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,660
When we're together, we do things like a couple,

834
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:48,140
like holding hands.

835
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:51,540
(He's blushing.)
But look at you, you're the one being all flirty.

836
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:52,540
Putting an arm around the shoulder, like this?

837
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:53,160
Yeah, just like that.

838
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:54,410
It's so perfect.

839
01:01:58,510 --> 01:01:59,860
No, it's not!

840
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,640
Don't just stare at him.

841
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:06,430
Stealing my duties.

842
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:08,620
(Don't be jealous.)
