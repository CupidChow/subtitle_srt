1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,560
(No Long Beans Basil' restaurant)
Let's see.

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,000
Here we meet again with Plawan, the Golden Tongue of Basil.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,920
This channel will take everyone to taste basil dishes from all over.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,600
And today, I'm bringing everyone to

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,040
the 'No Long Beans Basil' restaurant.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,840
Ah, I've heard that the chef here is really strict.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,920
I don't know how it's going to be.

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,400
Let's go in and check it out!

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,520
Let's go, everyone. Follow me inside!

10
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,000
The door itself is impressive!

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,240
And here we are, everyone.

12
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:45,400
Just stepping inside,
we can already smell the amazing aroma of basil stir-fry.

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,400
Oh wow, the atmosphere of this place is incredible!
There's the table I reserved. Alright, let's go!

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,160
Oh wow, the plating style
and the restaurant's atmosphere are absolutely beautiful!

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,640
It looks like the food is coming!

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,720
Wow.

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,600
Just carrying it over, the aroma is already amazing!

18
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,039
The plating is absolutely stunning!

19
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,840
Let's take a cover photo for the video!

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,720
Let's start tasting it!

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,360
Wow, oh my!

22
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,120
It already looks beautiful,

23
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,600
but the taste is incredibly rich and delicious.

24
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,800
What should I try next? Alright, let's go with the beef, beef it is!

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,479
Who gave you permission to film a vlog in my restaurant?

26
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,520
Hey, what's going on? I'm a big fan of yours!

27
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,320
I'm here to review your restaurant!

28
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,280
Here he is, everyone, the one and only Chef Oab!

29
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,120
Also known as the 'Hellfire Chef.'

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Ohhh.

31
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,759
This is the real deal!

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,560
Take the plate away.

33
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,680
Hey, wait! Where are you taking the plate?

34
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,960
I haven't even started eating yet...

35
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,080
Our restaurant doesn't allow filming that disturbs other customers.

36
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,160
Please leave.

37
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,280
Hey, how can you do this, Chef?

38
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,960
It took me a long time to get a reservation here.

39
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,880
And now you won't even let me make content?

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,800
Hey!

41
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:12,120
This restaurant welcomes only
those who genuinely want to enjoy basil stir-fry.

42
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,160
People who make superficial review content...

43
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
...are not welcome in our restaurant.

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,240
Please leave as well.

45
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,320
Could you please put it down gently?

46
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,320
It took me a long time to get a reservation here.

47
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,800
A really long time.

48
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,440
How can you treat a customer like this?

49
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,880
Here it is, everyone.

50
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,120
This is the face of Chef Oab.

51
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,120
This is the 'No Long Beans Basil' restaurant.

52
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,520
To all my fans, don't come to this restaurant.

53
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
The food isn't good, and the service is terrible.

54
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,840
Not good at all.

55
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,600
But you broke the restaurant's rules yourself.

56
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,720
Hey, what is this?

57
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,400
I cook food for people to eat, not for the camera.

58
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,040
Don't come again next time. Go!

59
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:54,200
Yeah, I won't come back next time. This place is terrible.

60
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,640
-What, come on!
-Chef, please don't!

61
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,960
Come on, come on! Think you're tough? Come on then!

62
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,400
Oh wow!

63
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,360
You think you're a famous chef?

64
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,680
Do you know that my channel is way more popular?

65
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,280
I have thousands of subscribers.

66
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,320
You're definitely going to be famous now, Chef.

67
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,720
Ouch!

68
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,800
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

69
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,560
Yes, I'll be there right away. Just a moment, really.

70
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,040
Alright, bye.

71
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,560
Remember this.

72
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,240
Face forward, face forward. Wow, looking sharp! This is perfect.

73
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,520
Wow, very solid. Okay, rub your stomach just like that.

74
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,520
-Rub your stomach just like that.
-Good!

75
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,280
Alright, next person, please.

76
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
Next person.

77
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Where did he go?

78
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,120
I'm sorry, everyone.

79
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,560
Come on, Plawan, take your place.

80
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,440
Face forward, please. Face forward.

81
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,360
Yeah, that's it. Ouch! Now turn to the side.

82
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,920
There you go, looking good. Do a full turn.

83
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,480
Okay, Plawan. Take off your shirt.

84
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,000
Take off your shirt. Go ahead.

85
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,280
Can I not take it off?

86
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,880
Is something wrong?
Oh, is the air conditioning too cold?

87
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,760
Team, please lower the air conditioning.

88
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,680
Why not? Come on, we're wasting shooting time.

89
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,880
-Well!
-What?

90
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,280
It's just that right now my body doesn't have a six-pack.

91
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,000
I haven't had time to work on it.

92
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,159
I told you from the beginning that we needed someone with a six-pack.

93
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,560
Just take it off. It's alright.

94
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,280
But I'm really good-looking, you know.

95
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,080
In this era.

96
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,240
Any body type can present products.

97
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,000
Or are you trying to set the beauty standards for society?

98
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,680
Well, yes.

99
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,480
But this is an ad for a weight loss clinic, you know.

100
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,320
(Transform a ruined body into a fabulous one!)
(Weight loss clinic.)

101
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,440
Do you understand that this is a job for a weight loss clinic?

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,320
You said he was a rising star.

103
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,640
Is he a falling star instead?

104
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,600
And if he can't follow instructions like this, put him on the blacklist.

105
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,120
And tell the modeling agency not to send anyone like this again.

106
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,760
Wait a minute, please. Calm down.

107
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,040
Even though my body isn't in great shape right now...

108
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,120
But I can pose and act well.

109
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:28,560
Like this, like this, or like this.

110
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,880
Please, let me try one test shot.

111
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,040
Let me try in front of the camera one more time.

112
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,880
What am I supposed to do with acting?

113
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,640
This is a weight loss clinic, damn it!

114
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,760
The client wants six-packs, do you understand?

115
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
Get out now!

116
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Ouch, ouch!

117
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
Oh wow!

118
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,840
Why do people these days only judge others by their appearance?

119
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
Not giving anyone a chance.

120
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,680
Damn it!

121
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,680
What should I do next?

122
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,440
What now?

123
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,960
(Please pay the electricity bill by today..
Apologies if you have already paid.)

124
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,280
(The remaining balance is 999 baht.)

125
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,920
Damn it, why is there only this much left?

126
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,320
What should I do next?

127
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,480
I went through all the trouble to get you that casting job, Wan.

128
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,640
And you got yourself kicked off the set.

129
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,440
And now you have the nerve to ask me
to help pay the electricity bill for your place.

130
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,440
I really tried my best, sis.

131
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,160
But the casting team didn't choose me.

132
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,960
If you want to be a model, you need to be in good shape.

133
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,320
Otherwise, it's like tying a rope around your own neck.

134
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,600
Sis, please help find a job for Wan

135
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,080
Just one job, please. A really great one.

136
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,640
I promise I'll pay you back with interest.

137
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,400
Sis, please. I'm begging you.

138
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,480
You said you were going to get in shape at the beginning of the year.

139
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,480
But you keep going around eating basil stir-fry everywhere.

140
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,200
Oh, come on, sis, basil stir-fry is delicious!

141
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,560
Who can resist it?

142
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,240
And besides, it's not like I don't exercise.

143
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,159
But you know that I've hurt my wrist.

144
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,400
Because I was shooting that motorcycle commercial for you.

145
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,280
Look at this, sis. It still hurts.

146
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,720
Take a look, sis. Look.

147
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,400
Alright, alright, I understand.

148
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,600
If being a model is so difficult...

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,360
why don't you switch careers?

150
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,640
Being an influencer pays well.

151
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,320
Even more prominent than some famous celebrities.

152
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,240
If you specialize in something.

153
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,680
But I've been eating just one dish for two months now, sis.

154
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,320
Doesn't that make me an expert yet?

155
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,400
See, even when I go out to eat, I haven't seen a single customer come in.

156
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,280
When I go out to eat, I have to pay for it myself.

157
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,400
If a basil stir-fry isn't good, I can't bring myself to compliment it.

158
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:26,080
My taste buds were made to enjoy only the best basil stir-fry.

159
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,360
Oh, come on, why don't you get it?

160
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,440
Talking to you is pointless.

161
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,559
Sis, please.

162
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,200
Okay then, if you don't get in shape...

163
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,440
Don't call me again, understand?

164
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,600
Uh, sis...

165
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,880
Sis, please help me with the electricity bill.

166
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,680
Or at least help with the coffee bill, sis.

167
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,320
Sis, sis, please!

168
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,200
Oh wow.

169
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,400
Creditors these days are so relentless.

170
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,840
Don't they have any sympathy?

171
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,040
Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?

172
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
I'm staying at your place, of course.

173
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
I'm letting you stay at my place for tonight only.

174
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,520
Tomorrow, make sure you go back to your own place.

175
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,840
Oh, I just got here and you're already kicking me out

176
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,400
My place doesn't have air conditioning, and the power's been cut.

177
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,360
JJ, how can you let your best friend live like that?

178
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,600
Stop right now!

179
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,240
I've already paid your electricity bill.

180
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,680
Your power will be back on tomorrow.

181
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,400
Do you have any other problems?

182
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,320
Thanks, my dear friend, but...

183
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,320
I just found out they've taken the water meter too.

184
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,800
You'll pay my water bill too, right?

185
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,280
Wan, you're asking for it now.

186
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,000
Pay your water bill too? I'm your friend, not your dad.

187
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,440
Oh wow, JJ, buddy.

188
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,840
Come on, think of our 30 years of friendship.

189
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,080
30 years, huh? You're only 25.

190
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
You jerk.

191
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,560
I don't care.

192
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,400
I'm only paying for this month, alright?

193
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,240
And if I see you sleeping at my place again...

194
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:23,120
...I'll charge you 500 per night.

195
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,960
...plus a 500 cleaning fee, making it 1,000.

196
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,400
You bloodsucker.

197
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840
Huh!

198
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,440
When I find a modeling job, I'll pay you back.

199
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,920
A modeling job? With how much you eat?

200
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,120
And you can't even exercise properly.

201
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,480
I just can't right now.

202
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,640
Say the whole thing.

203
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,400
I'll be your physical therapist.

204
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,200
You're the one who forgot my instructions.

205
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,160
I told you not to indulge your cravings, didn't I?

206
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,600
You still can't exercise like you used to.

207
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,040
Otherwise, you'll need wrist surgery.

208
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,080
See your wrist, right?

209
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,320
I know, let go! It hurts, it hurts!

210
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,640
Let go, okay?

211
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,600
I'm serious, Wan.

212
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,040
What kind of modeling job are you talking about?

213
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,480
Why are you pushing yourself to do this?

214
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,360
Pushing myself? I love modeling work.

215
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,040
You don't actually like modeling.

216
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,680
But you like the money.

217
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,040
You like the money, do you hear me?

218
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,520
Talking to you is like...

219
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,440
...frustrating as hell.

220
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,280
-Don't eat it.
-Hey, where are you taking that?

221
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,280
Hey, wait a minute, JJ!

222
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
Damn it!

223
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,960
From the top chef of the show.

224
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,840
Kitchen Fire.

225
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,520
How can you dare to call this food?

226
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,560
The pork isn't even cooked.

227
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,120
And the taste is terrible.

228
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,200
If you're just here to mess around, get out.

229
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,280
Yes, Chef.

230
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,880
Each dish is made with ingredients carefully selected
by the chef with great attention.

231
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,440
Even though I only sell basil stir-fry...

232
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,720
...it will be a basil stir-fry you can't find anywhere else.

233
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,680
And most importantly...

234
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,480
the basil stir-fry at this restaurant has no long beans.

235
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,280
What do you think, Chef?

236
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,000
I think this is really great, Chef.

237
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,320
If you want any changes, just let me know, Chef.

238
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,560
I'd like the content to be more concise.

239
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,680
Or maybe make the logo bigger?

240
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,440
No, thanks.

241
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,400
No, I don't want that.

242
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,040
So, do you want me to make it more concise or make the logo bigger, Chef?

243
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,320
I don't want any of that.

244
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,800
I've decided not to use this clip.

245
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,560
Kluer, please handle the expense claims for the team.

246
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,480
But Chef...

247
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,520
This is just the first draft.

248
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,120
We can still make any changes needed.

249
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,760
Your team did a great job.

250
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,400
I'm not dissatisfied with anything.

251
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,680
But I've just decided not to continue with this restaurant.

252
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,520
I'm in the process of selling the business.

253
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,920
Huh?

254
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,000
Chef?

255
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,560
Chef!

256
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,920
Are you serious, Chef? You're really selling the business?

257
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,160
You've been my assistant for how many years now?

258
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,400
Have you ever seen me joke around?

259
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
Because of this...

260
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,360
...that's why you haven't introduced any new dishes recently, right?

261
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,080
I've lost my passion.

262
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,560
I thought so.

263
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,520
I was just talking with the others
in the restaurant, saying something felt off.

264
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,280
Up until now, I wasn't sure.

265
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,400
That's why I haven't told you all.

266
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,080
But don't worry.

267
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,640
If anyone takes over the restaurant,

268
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,240
I'll ask them to keep you all employed.

269
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,720
Don't you want to cook basil stir-fry anymore, Chef?

270
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,720
I still love cooking.

271
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,440
But some things just aren't the same anymore.

272
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,600
Is it because of Kao Suay?

273
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
Our restaurant,

274
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,320
the basil stir-fry without long beans.

275
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,840
Welcome!

276
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,600
If anyone knew why P'Oab

277
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,120
opened a basil stir-fry restaurant without long beans,

278
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,400
they'd be really confused.

279
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,560
It's easy to explain.

280
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,720
My girlfriend is allergic to long beans.

281
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,720
Has Chef Oab told Kao Suay yet that he's going to sell the restaurant?

282
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,960
Why do you want me to tell her?

283
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,920
Telling her won’t make her care anyway.

284
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm just going to take a break.

285
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,720
To get my passion back.

286
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,800
I've been cooking for 10 years.

287
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,200
I must get tired.

288
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,920
Former Hellfire Chef from the famous TV show.

289
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,640
Suddenly acting desperate for money and selling the shop like this.

290
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,160
It looks suspicious, you know.

291
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,160
I have my own problems.

292
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,640
And another thing,

293
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,120
I didn’t borrow money from you, Kluer.

294
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,520
So, Chef, who are you planning to sell it to?

295
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,240
Whoever contacts me first, I'll sell it to them.

296
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,800
I'm not that hard to talk to.

297
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,640
If you’ve decided to sell, why worry about the small stuff?

298
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,160
(Mr. Oab-uea Kuaskulkit)
(Twenty million baht)

299
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,600
No matter how many hundreds of millions, I won't sell it to you.

300
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,280
Stop contacting me.

301
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,840
I thought you said you'd sell to anyone who was interested.

302
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,640
If you think the amount I offered is too low,

303
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,920
You can try writing a new number and send it back to me.

304
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
How much do you want?

305
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,360
The number isn’t a big deal.

306
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,440
It’s the people that matter.

307
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,440
I'll sell this shop only to someone I'm satisfied with.

308
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,960
I won't sell this restaurant to greedy investors

309
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,240
who just want to use this space for something else.

310
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,000
You, Metas.

311
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,080
(No trespassing. This area is the property of MT Group Co., Ltd.)

312
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,520
What are you doing at my restaurant?

313
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,480
This place has been seized.

314
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,800
You can't do this, Uncle.

315
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,680
Master!, please.

316
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,480
Master! What did you guys do to my master?

317
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,720
You can't do this, everyone get out!

318
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,720
Hey, hold them back!

319
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,440
Get out!

320
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,920
I thought you were mad about something else.

321
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,960
So it was about that condo over there.

322
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,040
The restaurant is really old.

323
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,560
Preserving it is pointless.

324
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,359
I'm redeveloping that area

325
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,760
to make it beneficial for others.

326
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,240
Isn't that a better thing to do?

327
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,400
Chef Anas's restaurant has been open for nearly a hundred years.

328
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,599
Passed down from generation to generation

329
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,960
How did you force him to sell?

330
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,079
But it wasn't Chef Anas's place.

331
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,359
I bought it from the landowner.

332
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,119
So, what's wrong with that?

333
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,720
I don't want to waste my time talking to trash
like you who doesn't appreciate the value of food.

334
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,880
I know you're trying to buy up my restaurant.

335
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,960
To build a new community mall and condos.

336
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,360
What benefit is all your rambling about?

337
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,960
It's all for your own benefit

338
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,560
Get out now.

339
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
Suit yourself.

340
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,040
But no one else will offer you as good a price as I did.

341
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,400
The fact that you want to sell the shop quickly

342
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,960
isn't it because you need a large sum of money?

343
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,920
If you change your mind, just give me a call.

344
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,760
I'm available 24/7.

345
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,040
This place has been seized

346
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,680
Don't let them seize it.

347
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,480
I'm calling the police.

348
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
Go ahead, call them.

349
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Everyone, get out!

350
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,920
(No trespassing. This area is the property of MT Group Co., Ltd.)

351
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,560
Go!

352
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,720
(Bunyavej Hospital)

353
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,760
Mr. Anas's coronary artery disease,

354
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,760
It's now in a severe stage,

355
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,880
causing significant lack of blood flow to the heart.

356
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,880
We should expedite the surgery as soon as possible.

357
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,200
Have you been able to contact Mr. Anas's daughter?

358
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,520
Not yet, doctor.

359
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,760
But we'll try to contact her as soon as possible.

360
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,040
Okay.

361
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,480
I need to go now.

362
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,240
Don't call and tell her.

363
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:33,120
Let's not bother Kao Suay.

364
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
Master.

365
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,560
Master, don't you really plan to tell Kao Suay?

366
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,680
that your condition has gotten this bad?

367
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,360
Just focus on her studies.

368
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,360
Kao Suay already has enough on her plate.

369
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,720
She doesn't need to know about my situation.

370
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,640
In that case,

371
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,520
Master, let Nab Nueng and me help with the expenses.

372
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
So you can get the surgery quickly.

373
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,920
I won't allow it, Oab.

374
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,520
Stop right there

375
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,960
Master, please.

376
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,560
Master, please let us help

377
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,840
No way.

378
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,880
No, Oab, no.

379
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,360
I said no.

380
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,680
P'Oab,

381
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,280
Master Anas is just this stubborn.

382
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,240
Before coming here,

383
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,120
I transferred 500,000 baht to you.

384
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,760
Use it to pay the hospital first.

385
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,240
And tell them I'll sign anything as long as
they can stabilize his condition as much as possible.

386
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,640
I'll find more money soon.

387
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,240
So where did you get the money?

388
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,640
Don't tell me you broke the bank

389
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,840
and used your last savings.

390
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,000
And what about your restaurant?
Are you not running it anymore?

391
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,280
This is my business.

392
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,680
You go and handle the payment.

393
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,800
I'll take care of the money.

394
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,080
Hey, wait!

395
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
Ohhh.

396
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,440
The student and the master are just alike.

397
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,200
You're just as stubborn as your Master.

398
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,480
Oab.

399
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,480
Why don't you try the last option?

400
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,560
Stop that thought right there, Nab Nueng.

401
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:25,840
Why, though?

402
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,760
Just bring Kao Suay back to Thailand.

403
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,000
You know the Master always listens to his daughter.

404
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,240
I'm not going to bring her back.

405
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,520
The Master himself said no.

406
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,600
I don't want to be the reason he deteriorates further.

407
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
Why not, brother?

408
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,640
Are you afraid to call your ex?

409
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,040
If you don't call Kao Suay,

410
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,840
it's like you're letting the Master's condition

411
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,800
worsen even more.

412
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,400
While you're doing nothing about i

413
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,640
(Kao Suay)

414
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:16,080
(Kao Suay)

415
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,640
(Kao Suay)

416
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,120
(United States of America
Los Angeles)

417
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,600
Is something wrong, P' Oab?

418
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,800
No,

419
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,000
nothing's wrong.

420
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,320
I just called wrong number.

421
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,720
Ahh!

422
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,000
Okay.

423
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,600
Uh! Well...

424
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,520
Has Kao Suay called her dad recently?

425
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,720
With exams coming up, I haven't talked to him much.

426
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,920
Is something the matter?

427
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
Um...

428
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,560
Well.

429
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
Master.

430
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,840
I haven't been able to reach the Master much lately.

431
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,800
It would be good if you could call him.

432
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,320
If there's anything you need to tell me, just say it.

433
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
Oab.

434
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,440
Ah!

435
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,680
It's probably morning in America now, right?

436
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,560
You're probably getting ready for study.

437
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,080
Sorry to bother you.

438
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,280
Don't forget to call your dad.

439
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,400
Huh.

440
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,080
Alright.

441
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,840
If you're going to sell your restaurant,

442
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,640
then I'll sell mine too.

443
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,040
I'll use the money to help the Master as well.

444
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,920
Chef Nab Nueng,

445
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,440
you just opened this restaurant last month.

446
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,200
Have you already paid off the bank loan?

447
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,520
Just my restaurant alone should be enough
to cover all the hospital expenses.

448
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,880
Yeah, brother,

449
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,240
so what's the deal?

450
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,720
Did Metas really have the nerve to ask to buy your place?

451
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,240
Doesn't he have any sense of shame?

452
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,880
What do you expect from someone like him?

453
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:50,800
But don't worry,

454
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,600
I made sure to send him packing.

455
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,040
And what about others, brother?

456
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,560
Has anyone else shown interest in buying the restaurant?

457
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,400
There have been a few.

458
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,000
But after digging a bit, it turns out
that those interested in buying my restaurant

459
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,600
are all investors associated with Metas.

460
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,040
So I haven't made a decision yet.

461
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,520
Even though I need the money,

462
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,000
I don't want my restaurant to just get demolished.

463
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,320
At the very least, I want someone
who will actually continue running the place.

464
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,160
Oab.

465
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,400
How about this?

466
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,240
You could hold a cooking competition

467
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,120
to select someone to take over the restaurant.

468
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,480
-A cooking competition?
-Yes.

469
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,960
That way, you'll find someone you can trust

470
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,400
not to demolish your restaurant.

471
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,240
Plus, you'll get someone with the right skills

472
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,480
to carry on the Chef's Table basil stir-fry.

473
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,680
Right?

474
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,000
So, what do I need to do?

475
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,240
(Sell the business.)
Find a successor

476
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,200
for 'No Long Beans Basil' restaurant

477
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,360
through a cooking competition

478
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,600
to select someone

479
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,680
with the following qualifications:

480
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,880
First, has 20 million baht.

481
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,320
Wow,

482
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,600
Excellent cooking skills.

483
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,880
Passionate about basil stir-fry.

484
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,080
Must not be affiliated with MT Group.

485
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,320
If anyone meets all these qualifications,

486
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,000
Chef Oab is ready to sell the

487
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,880
'No Long Beans Basil' restaurant to them.

488
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
Oh wow, Oab,

489
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,360
20 million baht?

490
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:22,920
Come on, Nueng,

491
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,840
I'm just following your idea

492
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,680
about posting to find candidates.

493
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,520
Chef Oab, you should select based on more realistic

494
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,160
and achievable qualifications.

495
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
This is what I want.

496
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,880
If someone meets all the qualifications,

497
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,200
they'll get my restaurant.

498
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,680
Hey!

499
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,440
It's your idea after all.

500
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,760
(Sell the business.)

501
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,920
(Seeking a suitable successor through a basil stir-fry cooking competition)
(for 'No Long Beans Basil' restaurant.)

502
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,400
Order someone to infiltrate that chef's competition.

503
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,040
Do whatever it takes to make sure our person wins,
no matter how many millions it costs.

504
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,440
Just for a single basil stir-fry restaurant?

505
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,240
Boss, are you really going to invest that much?

506
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,160
You don't understand.

507
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,400
Once that area becomes the new community mall,

508
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,120
the value I'll gain

509
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,520
will increase many times over.

510
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,720
The reason for holding this competition is simple:

511
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,160
I want to sell the restaurant to someone truly skilled.

512
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,760
Those who are just after the land to start a business,

513
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,000
don't bother contacting me.

514
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,160
It's a waste of time.

515
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,600
Also, I want to show that foul-mouthed chef that

516
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,400
those who say money can't buy everything are just losers

517
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,360
who don't have enough of it.

518
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,760
(Sell the business.)
Yes.

(for 'No Long Beans Basil' restaurant.)

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,640

522
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Come this way.

Wan.

524
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,960
Go go.

525
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
Please, have a seat.

526
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,440
Please wait here. The previous interview isn't finished yet

527
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,360
Sure.

528
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,120
Wan.

529
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,040
-Wan.
-What?

530
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,480
Are you sure about this?

531
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,280
This is an office, not a kitchen.

532
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,280
Yes, this is the place.

533
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,680
I found out from a secret group of chefs.

534
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,720
Why do you want to audition for a cooking competition?

535
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,000
Do you want to be a chef?

536
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,600
I don't want to be a chef,

537
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,360
I want the money.

538
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
What are you talking about?

539
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Look at this.

540
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,480
The post I made about selling the business is just as it says.

541
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,560
Anyone with the skills can come and compete.

542
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,880
If you win,

543
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,680
you can buy my business.

544
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,280
I want to sell the restaurant to someone truly skilled.

545
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,840
Those who are just after the land to start a business,

546
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,120
don't bother contacting me.

547
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,400
It's a waste of time.

548
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,440
What’s your deal?

549
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,320
You said you didn't like Chef Oab,
that foul-mouthed chef you had a problem with before.

550
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,640
And now you want to apply to be his successor?

551
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,880
What are you thinking?

552
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,000
And another thing, Wan,

553
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,320
this whole job of posing as a successor or whatever,

554
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,200
it sounds like a scam.

555
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,040
How can you be so stupid to take it on?

556
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,440
You idiot!

557
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,000
Look, Metas Siramongkolsawat

558
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,520
is a real estate tycoon.

559
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,480
His company, MT Group,

560
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,200
definitely has the money for me for sure.

561
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,840
I don't mean he doesn't have money in the way you think.

562
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,480
I mean you.

563
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,680
You have to disguise yourself to deceive the top chef in the country.

564
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,960
And another thing,

565
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,800
Wan, can you even cook?

566
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,800
Huh?

567
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,960
Can you?

568
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,240
(Personal background)

569
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,760
You are both an actor and a model,

570
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,400
so you have a long history of cooking, is that right?

571
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,240
Yes, I'm good at acting.

572
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,640
You might have seen some of my work.

573
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,760
Never seen it.

574
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,680
I'm starting to wonder

575
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,960
if you're just a minor, insignificant actor.

576
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,520
And another thing,

577
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,360
with a body like that,

578
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,160
you really think you could be a model?

579
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,560
You sure are good at critiquing, aren't you?

580
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,480
My work hasn't been released yet, but you, you'll see it soon enough.

581
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,920
I don't care about your career.

582
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,680
I only care about the basil stir-fry.

583
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,280
What signature dishes do you have?

584
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,760
A lot. I can make anything.

585
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,120
But whether it's tasty is another matter.

586
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,400
I'm very busy.

587
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,800
If you can't cook,

588
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,000
then what's the point?

589
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,440
Please leave.

590
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,480
Please leave.

591
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,280
-Mr. Metas, wait a moment!
-This way, please.

592
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,120
I may not be able to cook,

593
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,080
but I can definitely beat the others

594
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,200
because I've eaten basil stir-fry at hundreds of restaurants.

595
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,600
If I were to compete in a superfan contest,

596
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,840
I'd definitely get first place.

597
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,360
With such a lame experience?

598
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:50,400
Chef Oab would reject your application in the first round.

599
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,600
Just submitting your application,

600
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,000
I feel sorry for the trees that had to be turned into paper for you.

601
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,720
I don't talk to people who waste my time.

602
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,760
Every minute,

603
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,560
I can earn millions.

604
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,560
Right now, I'm about to lose 10 million

605
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,080
because I'm talking to someone like you.

606
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,480
And what do rich people eat

607
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,440
that makes their mouths so disrespectful to others?

608
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,560
Your feet are on the ground just like everyone else's.

609
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,600
You're not floating down from the sky.

610
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,280
Why boast as if you're better than everyone else?

611
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,240
Hey, you.

612
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,440
Wan, he is insulting you.

613
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,360
And even though this guy might only have his looks going for him

614
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,800
and doesn't seem very trustworthy,

615
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,120
when it comes to eating basil stir-fry,

616
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,320
he's never lost to anyone.

617
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,600
If you don't believe me, I'll show you his vlog.

618
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,840
All 100 clips are about basil stir-fry.

619
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,640
Just because he's good at eating doesn't mean he'll beat the competitors.

620
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,960
I've calculated that sending your friend

621
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,160
would be a wasted opportunity.

622
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,800
Oh, you're so confident.

623
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,360
-Hey, calm down.
-What?

624
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,560
Wan, get out. Don't hold me back.

625
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:51,400
And if you don't choose my friend, then don't.

626
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,120
My friend doesn't need someone like you.

627
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,080
Let's go, Wan.

628
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,240
-We're going home.
-Hey, wait! Please give me a chance, Mr. Metas.

629
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,120
What's wrong with you?

630
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,880
Stand tall.

631
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,880
Why are you looking so defeated?

632
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,920
I didn't pass Mr. Metas' selection.

633
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,000
That means I've lost my chance to make a million, right?

634
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,440
How can it be hopeless?

635
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,160
He didn't send you,

636
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,360
but he didn't forbid you from entering
the competition to become the successor, did he?

637
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,000
What do you mean?

638
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,800
If you pass the audition and get into Chef Oab's restaurant,

639
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:29,120
there's no reason that greedy investor wouldn't hire you.

640
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,280
Holy crap,

641
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
my dear friend,

642
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:35,960
how did you think of that?

643
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,080
At that point, when you hold all the cards, you can negotiate.

644
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,840
And then, Wan,

645
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,440
you can demand money

646
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,320
and bleed him dry.

647
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,720
Wow, I was so close to giving up.

648
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,320
What should I do now?

649
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,280
Where did he go?

650
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,360
He was just here.

651
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,480
Where is he?

652
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:10,520
Ah,

653
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,239
it's the annoying YouTuber.

654
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,679
Why are you following me?

655
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,679
What? Who's following you?

656
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,760
I'm just here shopping.

657
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,320
Can you walk alone?

658
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
No, right?

659
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,520
What's your problem?

660
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,679
-Give it to me.
-Hey!

661
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,840
It's mine.

662
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,320
Hey!

663
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,520
Oh!

664
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,520
Why are you keeping track of what I'm buying?

665
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,159
Just a coincidence.

666
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,199
I'm just here to buy ingredients for cooking.

667
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,360
What's the issue?

668
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,000
I think it concerns me,

669
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,360
so I'll take this.

670
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,000
And don't follow me again.

671
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,880
I don't need a fan.

672
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,920
You don't know me well enough.

673
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,160
(Carrot ½ Kg., Cucumbers, Tomatoes, Large Onions, Bell Peppers)
(Spur Chili, Garlic, Green Oak Lettuce,Karen Chili, Wagyu Beef 2 Pack)

674
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,960
And this.

675
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Is everything here?

676
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,080
Carrots,

677
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,560
tomatoes...

678
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,600
What are you doing at my place,

679
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,200
and why did you buy so many ingredients?

680
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,960
You're the one who told me I have to pass the audition

681
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,120
to squeeze money out of Mr. Metas.

682
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,160
So today, I followed Chef Oab and noted all his ingredients.

683
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,840
I'm going to replicate everything exactly like he does.

684
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,480
Why don't you practice on your own?

685
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,880
Why come here?

686
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,720
It's not like I can cook.

687
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,280
Because you can cook better than I can.

688
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,000
If you can make an omelet without burning it, you're already ahead.

689
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,920
What does that have to do with anything?

690
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,720
If I beat Chef Oab,

691
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,080
it means you've also beaten Mr. Metas, JJ.

692
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,640
Or are you going to leave me to struggle on my own?

693
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,840
Come on,

694
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,320
my hand hurts.

695
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,160
Alright, alright,

696
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,720
let's just get this over with.

697
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,920
So, where should we start?

698
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,280
Hey, stop!

699
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,160
Huh?

700
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,240
Who told you to do it like that?

701
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,840
When you pound the ingredients, cover it with your hand like this

702
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,360
so it doesn't splatter.

703
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,400
Hand, hand.

704
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,200
Just like that, not too much.

705
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,840
How's this? Is it okay?

706
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,960
What are you doing? You have to peel it first.

707
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,680
Yeah, like that. That's enough.

708
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,000
-That's enough.
-A bit more.

709
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,440
Now the basil leaves, add them in.

710
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,200
Is that enough?

711
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,920
Why are you adding so much?

712
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,160
It smells amazing.

713
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,400
Oh, acting like a pro now.

714
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,720
Oh, Wan, my kitchen is a mess!

715
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,360
Here you go.

716
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,760
Hurry up and eat.

717
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,360
Do I really have to taste this?

718
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,880
Of course you do. Come on,

719
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,800
taste it quickly.

720
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,960
Ugh, ptooey!

721
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,240
Wan, what did you make for me?

722
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,400
It's stir-fried basil with minced pork and a fried egg.

723
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,160
I used the exact ingredients from the recipe I saw.

724
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,480
What recipe?

725
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,680
The pork is burnt to the core, and it's so salty it hurts my kidneys.

726
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,120
Am I going to die from this?

727
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:58,400
I don't want to beat Mr. Metas or whatever.

728
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,480
Just stop.

729
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,560
People need to improve, my friend.

730
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,480
Get ready to taste the next dish.

731
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,440
Hey, wait!

732
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720

733
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:11,960

Wan,

748
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,320
are you dead or what?

749
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,480
Not dead yet,

750
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,080
just a bit tired.

751
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,800
I needed to rest to save my energy.

752
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:53,960
So how far have you gotten

753
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,760
with your perfect basil stir-fry?

754
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,720
I think I've improved a lot.

755
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,680
I even prepared something for you to taste.

756
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,280
Here, try this.

757
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,960
I'm really confident in this dish.

758
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,160
It's delicious, and I guarantee it won't hurt your kidneys.

759
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,960
Come on, taste it.

760
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,600
I'm really confident.

761
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,400
Hurry.

762
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,440
I'm probably going to die first.

763
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,360
Come on, quickly.

764
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,800
How is it?

765
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,880
How is it?

766
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,480
How does it taste?

767
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,360
It's not bad.

768
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,080
It's not bad, right? I knew it.

769
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,520
Do you want another bite to make sure the flavor is consistent?

770
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,240
Try it.

771
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,560
By the way,

772
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:50,120
have they announced the results for the first round of applications?

773
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,520
Or have they already selected the candidates?

774
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,640
I have no idea.

775
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:04,840
Hey, it's here!

776
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,800

777
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,320

Yay! Aren't you happy for me?

Of course I am.

785

But how did you manage to pass?

786
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,360
Well, for a million bucks, let's do this.

787
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,400
Hmm.

788
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,040
Huh!

789

Hey,

790
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,240
where are you guys from?

791
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,520
Everyone,

792
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,280
welcome to the first selection round

793
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,200
for finding the successor of the 'No Long Beans Basil' restaurant.

794
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,400
In this round, we will select only the top 3 candidates.

795
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:33,280
Those who pass will train with me for 1 month.

796
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,120
I will announce the names of those who have passed.

797
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,680
These are the rules,

798
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:39,080
if you feel you can't handle it,

799
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:40,800
you can leave right now.

800
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,520
The rules for the first round are as follows.

801
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,040
We will have 2 tests.

802
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,960
The top 3 scores from the combined results of both tests

803
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,440
will pass this round.

804
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,960
Any questions?

805
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,560
Good.

806
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,560
Now, I will announce the first challenge.

807
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,960
Today, each of you must cook a basil stir-fry dish of your choice.

808
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,240
You must also present your dish.

809
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,800
You have 15 minutes.

810
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,640
Ingredients are in the kitchen.

811
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,120
You may begin.

812
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,520
Has it started?

813
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,720
Yeah, it has. Pork is pork.

814
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:30,880
Oops!

815
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:37,720
Ouch! Ouch!

816
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,120
Five!

817
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,400
Four!

818
00:45:58,760 --> 00:45:59,760
Three!

819
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,120
Two!

820
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,480
One!

821
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,760
Time's up.

822
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:04,840
Everyone, stop what you're doing.

823
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,320
I'll give you a 10 minute break,

824
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,880
then I'll call each of you to present your dish to me,

825
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,480
one-on-one.

826
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,960
Yes, Chef.

827
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:19,080
Mr. Fan,

828
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,320
I think we need to have a little chat.

829
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:34,320
I didn't expect you to take this competition seriously.

830
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,480
Have you ever cooked before?

831
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,480
Well, um, yeah. I just made the basil stir-fry for you.

832
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,000
That doesn't qualify as basil stir-fry.

833
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,280
It's not even the work of a professional chef.

834
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,560
Plawan,

835
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,520
your nickname caught my attention

836
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,400
because I've filleted many fish in my life,

837
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,840
including a whale once.

838
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,400
I think you're just getting in the way here.

839
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,920
Wouldn't it be better for you to go home?

840
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:15,720
What, Chef?

841
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,800
Oh, ouch, Chef, let go of me.

842
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,080
Are you going to let your hand swell like this?

843
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,040
What kind of chef are you?

844
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,640
Oh, ouch, Chef.

845
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,720
Your hand is injured, and you still
compete in something you're not good at?

846
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:38,080
Only someone without any sense would do that.

847
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:41,640
First, you need to soak it,

848
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,320
and then apply some snow lotus cream.

849
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,320
Chef, you don't have to get so close.

850
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:51,520
I'm feeling uncomfortable.

851
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,280
Aren't you a fan?

852
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,760
You should be happy,

853
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:56,520
not uncomfortable.

854
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,200
Plawan.

855
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,280
Are you the one Metas sent to compete?

856
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,680
Every week, someone will be eliminated.

857
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,920
Every action you take will count towards your total score.

858
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,720
From now on, you are all competitors.

859
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,440
I'll warn you once more, if you're not serious, you should step back.

860
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:55,040
Someone like you will never succeed.

861
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,680
What kind of chef is as harsh as a dog?

862
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,880
If you stand like this while chopping, you'll ruin your back.

863
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,240
If you don't get the 2 million..

864
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,480
You don't need to hire my friend for this job anymore.

865
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:03,960
But if your friend fails,

866
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,520
he will have to return every single baht to me.

867
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,720
I have an announcement.

868
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,520
One person who made it to the next round has a secret deal with Mr. Metas.

869
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,760
Will you confess, or should I say the name?

870
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:14,800
What are you doing?

871
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,840
Cold like 10 degrees.

872
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,480
(Really cold, huh?)
Not happening.

873
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,560
Sunbathing comfortably? Not happening.

874
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:21,720
(It's so cold til my back is wet.)
See this?

875
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,160
(Really into it, huh?)

876
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,400
(Emotions running high.)
Get out of the kitchen.

877
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:29,520
Take a break.

878
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,480
Get out of my kitchen.

879
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:33,400
(Why the big performance, old man?)
It doesn't have to be this dramatic.

880
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,920
-No, no, no.
-Look at this.

881
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:36,080
(The prankster old man)

882
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,360
t stinks.

883
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,200
(Why so hot-headed?)
What's with all this?

884
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:40,520
Hey, JJ,

885
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,640
come on.

886
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,240
If you don't choose my friend...

887
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,920
(Wow, that's over the top.)
You're overacting.

888
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,600
What are you doing?

889
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,680
I'm chopping carrots, Chef.

890
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,160
I'm making stock, right

891
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,280
When making stock, focus on speed. It doesn't need to be that precise.

892
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,400
Oh!

893
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,880
If you stand like this while chopping, you'll ruin your back.

894
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,520
Get ready to see an orthopedic doctor.

895
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,080
Spread your legs a bit more.

896
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:13,960
Hold the knife properly.

897
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,520
Why does someone so harsh

898
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,240
have to smell so good?

899
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,760
I want to eat, Chef.

900
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,360
Hey!

901
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:27,680
I want to eat basil stir-fry.

902
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,040
What is this?

903
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,200
Yeah!

904
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,680
Meeting you is really bad luck for me.

905
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:36,320
Next time, I'll put up a sign that says 'Do not approach.'

906
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:38,440
Help me take off my pants, will you?

907
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:39,520
Gently!

908
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,880
How am I supposed to pee?

909
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,560
Do I have to do everything for you?

910
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,320
Hurry up, I need to pee.

911
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,480
Am I your dad or something?

912
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,520
-Are you done yet?
-Wait a second, stay still or it'll get messy.

913
00:50:58,640 --> 00:50:59,640
Try it.

914
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,560
It's so delicious, Chef.

915
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,640
Why don't you sell it?

916
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,720
I only make it for my ex.

917
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,200
Why are you telling me this?

918
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,600
But you've made me want to make granita again.

919
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:49,160
If you start,

920
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:51,640
I won't let you stop like last time.

921
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,560
Are you serious about me?

922
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,400
Absolutely serious.

923
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:35,760
Does it really smell that good?

924
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,680
You can trust me.

925
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,440
I'm sincere with you too.

926
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,360
But the method is wrong.

927
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,480
If you use Wan's method,

928
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,560
we might have been friends.

929
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,920
You can't hide anything from me.

930
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,960
I've never loved anyone as much as I love you, Chef.
