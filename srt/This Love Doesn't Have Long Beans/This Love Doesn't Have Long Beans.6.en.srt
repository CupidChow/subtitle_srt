1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,010
Dude, Chef Oab and I slept together.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,890
I want to know your plan for winning this competition.

3
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:09,960
What should I do? I don't want to do this anymore.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,700
If you're going to confess your love, you should confess your sins first.

5
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:15,580
You seemed happy last night.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,080
When will you stop throwing money at people?

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,920
And if you keep this up,

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,180
you can start looking for a new physical therapist.

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,050
What if I wanted to invest in the restaurant with you again?

10
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,100
This time I won't leave.

11
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,800
Please give me time to prove myself and win your heart back.

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,590
Kluer, is this Chef Oab's Facebook?

13
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,340
Yeah, it's Chef's personal Facebook.

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:47,580
Wow.

15
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,480
Oh.

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,030
Chef Oab still hasn't deleted his couple photos with Kao Suay.

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,690
He must've been really heartbroken.

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,230
When they broke up, he kept posting deep quotes non-stop.

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,430
Hey, wanna go out for drinks tonight? It's Friday night; should be fun.

20
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,039
Wanna go? I feel like dancing.

21
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,590
Plawan, are you coming?

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,460
No, thanks.

23
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,620
My finger hurts.

24
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,700
You need your fingers to dance or what?

25
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,760
How should I know?

26
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,760
Plawan, right?

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,440
Yes.

28
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,610
I saw Chef Oab asking for you earlier.

29
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,550
At first, I thought he wanted you to help with the basil plants.

30
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:41,020
I saw Chef talking with you about business,

31
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,479
so I didn't want to disturb him.

32
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,640
ou probably don't need to go now.

33
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:47,460
Chef Oab seems to be managing on his own.

34
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:49,490
Okay.

35
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,750
Thanks for calling about my dad.

36
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,870
What are you talking about?

37
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,350
I didn't know anything about it.

38
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,020
(Selling the business)

39
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,240
(Looking for a Suitable Successor
Compete in Cooking Stir-Fried Basil)

40
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,230
His ex came back like this.

41
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,120
How am I supposed to move forward?

42
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:42,450
And the two of them are so perfect together.

43
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,300
Do you understand what "perfect couple" means?

44
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,400
Yeah!

45
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,940
Heaven has sent you an answer, my friend.

46
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,829
Turn this crisis into an opportunity.

47
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,890
Use this chance to let go.

48
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,630
Let them be together if his ex is back.

49
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,210
Your relationship with Chef Oab was impossible from the start anyway.

50
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,040
It's bad enough you're deceiving him about the restaurant,
you don't need to deceive him into loving you too.

51
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,070
You can go to hell alone, don't drag me down with you.

52
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,380
If P' Oab agrees,

53
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,450
the competition to find the successor
for the restaurant wouldn't be necessary anymore.

54
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,510
What do you think, P' Oab?

55
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,940
Everyone,

56
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,070
it's almost time for the second round of the competition.

57
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,970
Exciting, isn't it?
I wonder what the next challenge will be.

58
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,930
Who knows?

59
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:09,370
With Khun Khao Suay back,
Chef might change his mind and not sell the restaurant.

60
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,320
So...

61
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,630
they're getting back together?

62
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,850
Does that mean this competition was for nothing?

63
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,040
Yeah, like...

64
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,070
he's got his passion back or something.

65
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,330
At this age, he's not likely to say one thing
and do another like a child playing pretend.

66
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,600
Let's focus on preparing for the next round.

67
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,010
What are you all doing?

68
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:34,070
Why aren't you rushing to prepare everything yet?

69
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,320
We just wanted to say that even if
Chef changes your mind about selling the restaurant,

70
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,040
we still want to prove ourselves so that Chef will hire us to work here.

71
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,600
Changing mind?

72
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,050
What are you talking about?

73
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,220
Well...

74
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,580
Khao Suay came back.

75
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,240
There is no cancellation of anything.

76
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,270
Today, I'm giving you a new challenge.

77
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:54,980
Just basil.

78
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,980
The challenge is just one word.

79
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,220
Basil.

80
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,080
You can make any dish,

81
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,720
but the main ingredient must be holy basil leaves.

82
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,900
I'll be focusing on creativity for scoring.

83
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,510
The one with the lowest score will be eliminated.

84
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,570
Any questions?

85
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:14,760
No, Chef.

86
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,080
Good.

87
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,050
Then get ready for today.

88
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,350
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

89
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,240
Thank you.

90
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,570
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

91
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,970
Please come again next time.

92
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,800
Hello, everyone.

93
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,450
Hello, Chef Oab.

94
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,470
I have something to show you.

95
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,940
Let's sit down.

96
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,930
I was thinking of changing the storefront.

97
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:12,080
I had a friend who is an architect
design a new interior for the restaurant.

98
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,670
Take a look, Chef Oab. Do you like it?

99
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,910
It looks nice,

100
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,250
but...

101
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,360
Kao Suay is thinking of opening a new branch as well.

102
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,630
If we make everything more systematic,

103
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,000
you won't have to be so tired, Chef Oab.

104
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,250
Isn't it too soon?

105
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,490
I haven't even thought about that yet.

106
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,080
It's okay.

107
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,740
Don't worry, Chef Oab.

108
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:37,120
You just focus on the kitchen,

109
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,180
and I'll take care of everything else as before.

110
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,570
But I'm planning to sell this restaurant, Kao Suay.

111
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:48,060
I don't have the passion to continue this restaurant anymore.

112
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:51,980
Renovating the restaurant doesn't seem necessary to me.

113
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,230
Chef Oab,

114
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,030
we can find the passion again gradually, right?

115
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,350
Or do you not want to cook anymore?

116
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:09,830
I'll help you find a new passion.

117
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,350
Maybe you're just tired of basil.

118
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:15,490
But at least let's try changing the restaurant first.

119
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,000
But no matter what, there must be no long beans

120
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,240
because I'm allergic to them.

121
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,230
That's why our restaurant got its name, right?

122
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Eat it.

123
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,140
No, thanks.

124
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,330
I'd rather join my friends for a meal.

125
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,500
Wait a minute.

126
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,470
Pun Sib and Kluer have already gone out for lunch.

127
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,230
They probably couldn't find you, so they left to eat first.

128
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,780
Does it smell good?

129
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,450
Share some with me.

130
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,540
No, this is mine.

131
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,500
You're just like a child.

132
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,730
You were sulking a moment ago,
but now that you have food, you're in a good mood.

133
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,360
Who was it that made me sulk?

134
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,930
I know you were sulking,

135
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,430
that's why I'm here to make it up to you.

136
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,850
Just a moment ago, you were annoyed.

137
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:10,810
And Kluer and Pun Sib too.

138
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:13,570
I haven't agreed to anything with Kao Suay

139
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,990
about renovate our restaurant yet.

140
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,380
Maybe not today,

141
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,130
but who knows about the future?

142
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:22,460
How can I trust you, Chef?

143
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:25,000
At first, you said you broke up with her,

144
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,130
but now that she's back, you seem all excited.

145
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,830
Hey!

146
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,130
Chef!

147
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,660
What do you mean I'm excited?

148
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,980
Let go.

149
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,560
So you really are upset.

150
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,740
You said you didn't care at first.

151
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,030
I didn't mean anything by it.

152
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,840
I've been waiting for you to explain.

153
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,530
I don't want to be unreasonable.

154
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,690
Can you let go now?

155
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,740
You can trust me.

156
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,590
Chef!

157
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,730
P'Som, why did you call me to the clinic?

158
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:29,320
Is there a problem with the paperwork

159
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,470
or a new client?

160
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,820
No, it's not that.

161
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,960
Then why are you packing up your things?

162
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:38,180
I probably won't see you for a long time, JJ.

163
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,520
Take care of yourself, okay?

164
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,900
What do you mean, not see me for a long time?

165
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,150
Don't tell me you're dying

166
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,480
or seriously ill without telling me.

167
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,410
-Oh, stop it.
-Hey! Let me see.

168
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,200
Can you think positively for once?

169
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,260
Today is just my last day at work.

170
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,640
Are you resigning?

171
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,280
You didn't tell me at all.

172
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,100
Wait, but you're the owner of the clinic.

173
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,950
How can you quit your own clinic?

174
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,700
I'm not quitting.

175
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,290
I sold it.

176
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,020
Someone offered to buy it

177
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,160
for a great price.

178
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,660
But don't worry.

179
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,940
The new owner said they would keep everyone on staff.

180
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,800
No one will lose their job.

181
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,130
Wait, so you're just leaving us like that, P'Som?

182
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,620
Hold on a second, who is the new owner of the clinic?

183
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,670
Huh!

184
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,450
You know him very well.

185
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,410
Oh, here he comes now.

186
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,710
Act tough all you want.

187
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:54,330
You'll soon realize there's nothing in this world money can’t conquer.

188
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,540
What are you doing?

189
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,430
You, wait a minute.

190
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,640
What's with you?

191
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,150
There's no need to be afraid of me over something like this.

192
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,520
I'm not afraid of you.

193
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,180
If you want to buy this place, that's your business.

194
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,300
But if I want to quit, that's my decision.

195
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:15,290
But I need a place where you work.

196
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,900
So no matter where you go,

197
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:19,090
I'll follow and buy that business too.

198
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,000
You've already seen what I'm capable of, haven't you?

199
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,950
But this is real life, not a game of Monopoly.

200
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,650
Do you think using this method

201
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,080
will make people respect you in real life?

202
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,480
They’re just afraid of your financial power.

203
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,530
Do you think harassing me like this will make me give up?

204
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,820
No way.

205
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,300
Wait a minute.

206
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:51,120
I want to ask you something seriously—do you have any other way

207
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:54,550
to make people like you or want to be around you?

208
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,530
I have money.

209
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,020
I don’t need anything else.

210
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,210
You just don’t know how and you’re afraid to try.

211
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:04,010
Let me tell you something.

212
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,630
If you want to win people's hearts,

213
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,810
you have to use your heart,

214
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:10,060
not just throw money at the problem like you do.

215
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,750
You can buy this place,

216
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,670
but you can’t use money to buy someone like me.

217
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,870
How could you even think that way, Metas?

218
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,220
I’m really disappointed in you.

219
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,370
-Wait, JJ.
-Let go of me.

220
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,410
JJ.

221
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,670
JJ.

222
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,820
Heart for a heart, huh?

223
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,860
Everyone,

224
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,560
I think I have a plan

225
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,890
to help the three of us pass the second round.

226
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,700
If we work together

227
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,620
to create the menu and cook the same dish,

228
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,660
how can Chef eliminate any of us?
Isn't that right?

229
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:01,840
It won't work.

230
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,170
We might all get kicked out of the restaurant

231
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,540
if we try that.

232
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,660
Agreed.

233
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,640
Chef can be lenient with anything but cooking.

234
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,920
Oh, do we really have to compete against each other?

235
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,920
I don't want to compete anymore.

236
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,220
Why?

237
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,990
Don't you want the restaurant anymore?

238
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,560
But honestly, Pun Sib,

239
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,300
your family is really rich.

240
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,070
Why don't you just ask your dad to open a restaurant for you?

241
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,130
Why compete here?

242
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,490
Yeah, your family is super rich.

243
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:31,700
Because I want to become the best chef on my own.

244
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,450
I've always had private tutors before.

245
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,660
I've never had friends, always doing things alone.

246
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,170
When the three of us cook together, it's amazing.

247
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,600
But when Auto packed his bags and left, I was really sad.

248
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,080
I don't want to lose any more friends.

249
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,180
But this is a competition.

250
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,430
One day, we all have to go our separate ways.

251
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,550
When it's over,

252
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,460
all relationships will end too.

253
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:09,490
It doesn't have to be that way.

254
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,350
If we're clear with someone,

255
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,430
we can try to make the relationship last.

256
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:18,110
It doesn't mean that because the competition is over,

257
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,870
the relationships have to end too.

258
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,820
Hey! How about this,

259
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,220
let's make a promise.

260
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,720
Whoever wins has to bring the others to work at the restaurant.

261
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,290
Sure,

262
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,080
I'm fine with that.

263
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,660
You two probably have a better chance of winning than I do.

264
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,720
Hey.

265
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:58,130
Oh, I'm hungry.

266
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,530
You're sneaking food from the restaurant again.

267
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:10,579
If you eat this much, I'll have to charge you.

268
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,950
Oh, Chef!

269
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:14,650
You scared me, coming in like that.

270
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,130
Still not full?

271
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,210
When I'm stressed, I can't eat much.

272
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:20,609
Stressed?

273
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,250
About what?

274
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,369
The competition, of course.

275
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,460
No one wants to lose.

276
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,050
About the restaurant...

277
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,630
why are you asking so much?

278
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,200
About everything, really.

279
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,130
Including Kao Suay.

280
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,500
Is that clear enough?

281
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,130
I'm going to bed. I don't feel like answering questions.

282
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,070
Hey, wait a minute!

283
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:42,710
Sulking again?

284
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,810
Aren't you hungry?

285
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,900
Wait a bit.

286
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,250
It's done.

287
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,500
Wow, you said it was easy, Chef.

288
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,110
It is easy, only took a moment.

289
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,100
Oh?

290
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,350
I'll eat first.

291
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,420
Delicious.

292
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,030
I've changed my mind.

293
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:35,130
I'm not giving it to you.

294
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,000
Hey, wait a minute, Chef!

295
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,470
You said you were making it for me.

296
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,030
Wow,

297
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,650
it's really good.

298
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,590
I'll take it to my room, then.

299
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,360
Good night, Chef.

300
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,730
Plawan, wait a minute.

301
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,620
Do you need anything else?

302
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:13,910
Just some basil leaves.

303
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:17,450
Got the flavor right.

304
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:20,810
Everyone,

305
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,650
get ready to open the restaurant.

306
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,990
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

307
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,530
Hello, everyone.

308
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,120
Hello, Kao Suay.

309
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,480
Hello, P' Oab.

310
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,410
Are you here to help out at the restaurant, Kao Suay?

311
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:34,530
Yes,

312
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,590
but today I'm not here to serve.

313
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,180
I have a new menu idea to propose to P' Oab.

314
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:40,820
A new menu?

315
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:42,090
Yes.

316
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,630
We haven't had a new menu in a long time, Chef.

317
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,760
Many customers have been asking for it.

318
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,300
I got the idea from a focus group of our former customers.

319
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,890
They shared what kind of new dishes they would like to see.

320
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,770
Recently, lobster has been trending in Asian chef's tables.

321
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,580
But making it as just a stir-fried basil dish might be too simple.

322
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:05,430
How about making it a clay pot lobster basil fried rice?

323
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,670
I think it would sell well.

324
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,950
Wow, that sounds great, Kao Suay.

325
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,270
If we are to introduce a new menu,

326
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,030
I'll need time to experiment
and perfect the dish before offering it to customers.

327
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:20,590
It will be time-consuming and quite hectic.

328
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,810
That’s why I rushed to tell you, P'Oab,

329
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:24,300
so we can start preparing early.

330
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,650
I've already come up with a new promotion,

331
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,550
just need to finalize the graphics.

332
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,110
But our customers really love our current menu.

333
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,410
It's like our signature now.

334
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,340
I don’t think we need to change it.

335
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,090
Everything is perfect as it is.

336
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,040
What do you think, Chef Oab?

337
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,030
That's true.

338
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:51,930
But...

339
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,810
our restaurant hasn't had a new menu for a long time.

340
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,830
What Kao Suay said makes sense.

341
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:06,940
In that case, why don’t we try making stir-fried basil with long beans?

342
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,780
It’ll surprise our customers

343
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,550
and show that we’re rebranding.

344
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,900
P'Oab can’t do that

345
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,800
because I’m allergic to long beans.

346
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,070
And so?

347
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:18,780
We can’t.

348
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,290
Kao Suay is really allergic to long beans.

349
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,580
Then how about short beans?

350
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,990
Go to work.

351
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,250
-Yes, Chef
-Yes, Chef.

352
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,890
P'Oab, take a look at the menu.

353
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,270
Is Plawan not fond of me or something?

354
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,060
Kao Suay,

355
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,380
you’re overthinking.

356
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:16,500
Plawan didn’t even know why I named the restaurant this way.

357
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,340
So...

358
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,300
does P'Oab have something going on with Plawan?

359
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,850
When Plawan talks to you,

360
00:22:26,890 --> 00:22:28,370
it doesn’t seem the same as with others.

361
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,820
Kao Suay,

362
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,960
the truth is,

363
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,690
P'Oab and Plawan...

364
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,120
-we’re kind of...
-It’s okay.

365
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,800
I might not know as much about the menu as you do.

366
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,740
P'Oab, you can decide.

367
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,040
If you don't want this menu,

368
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,210
I won’t mind.

369
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,440
It’s so hot!

370
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,470
Wait, wait.

371
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,670
How did you get into my house?

372
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,630
Hey, how do you even know where I live?

373
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:43,050
Answer me when I ask you something.

374
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,600
It wasn't that hard.

375
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:46,940
I just looked up the clinic's employee registry.

376
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:48,810
And why are you here?

377
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,040
Let me tell you right now, no matter how much you offer, I won't sell.

378
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,060
I won't sell this house to you.

379
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,480
You don't have to sell it.

380
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:01,630
If I really want to, I can buy all the surrounding land

381
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:04,520
and properties of your neighbors instead.

382
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,420
Hey! Don't tell me that you're...

383
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,860
I'm not going to do anything for now.

384
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,880
The other day, I thought about what you said.

385
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:15,930
Maybe I've been judging you too harshly based on my personal experiences.

386
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,010
You don't have to quit the clinic.

387
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:20,690
Go back to work as usual.

388
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,210
However,

389
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,410
you will only do physical therapy for me.

390
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:31,430
I knew it.

391
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,510
During this time,

392
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,550
I want to observe your behavior to see

393
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,010
if you're as kind-hearted as you claim.

394
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,810
Maybe you'll actually change my mind.

395
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,580
I'll come back to do physical therapy for you,

396
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,840
but I will also treat other patients.

397
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,760
It's up to you if you want to accept this offer.

398
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:58,310
At worst, I'll just become a physical therapist at a public hospital.

399
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,000
I might earn less,

400
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,120
but you

401
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,490
certainly can't buy a public hospital, right?

402
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,100
You were supposed to show me

403
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,810
what being a genuinely good person looks like.

404
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,920
Why is it so hard for you to understand?

405
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,510
-Ouch!
-Hold on.

406
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,300
See?

407
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,080
You should be more careful when moving around.

408
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,760
Can you help me get inside?

409
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,200
It's getting hot out here.

410
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,460
Come on, let's go.

411
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,210
Standing around like this isn't good for your knee.

412
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:48,470
You might accuse a physical therapist like me

413
00:25:48,510 --> 00:25:50,080
of hurting a patient,

414
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,980
even if I want to.

415
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,960
Blow on the tea, please. It's hot.

416
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,660
Be careful not to burn your mouth.

417
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,470
On your first day after quitting,

418
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,370
what did you do?

419
00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:13,520
Nothing much.

420
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,410
I ate, watched movies, listened to music,

421
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:17,690
played games, and then watched some series.

422
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:20,830
You live like a housewife over 40 years old.

423
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,730
Oh, come on.

424
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,690
If my life is so much like a 40-year-old housewife,

425
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:28,840
then you don't need to bother.

426
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,480
I'm already stressed out with work as it is.

427
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,230
I have friends too.

428
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,060
If Wan is free, I always invite him to watch movies with me.

429
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:42,700
You like watching movies too?

430
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,690
I thought you were

431
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,200
just a serious, no-nonsense kind of guy.

432
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,660
I watch all kinds of movies.

433
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:52,230
Comedy, drama, action, horror.

434
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,580
I can watch anything.

435
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,450
But Wan is scared of ghosts,

436
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,180
so I have to watch horror movies by myself.

437
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,140
This guy is too attached to friends.

438
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,030
I don't think it's very good.

439
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,370
Wan isn't very smart, you know.

440
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:08,980
Even though my friends seem silly and quirky.

441
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,550
But there is one thing I have more than you,

442
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,830
and that's sincerity.

443
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:17,620
Otherwise, how could I have stayed friends with him all this time?

444
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,520
I am sincere with you too.

445
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,620
But your methods were wrong.

446
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,940
If you used Plawan's approach,

447
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,780
we might have been friends.

448
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,090
I agree.

449
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,690
Agree on what?

450
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,940
Agree to go.

451
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:40,110
You don't need to ask me twice.

452
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,250
I'll go see the movie with you.

453
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,510
Hey, I haven't even invited you yet.

454
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,090
Hello.

455
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,470
Book a whole theater

456
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,820
for the most popular horror movie right now.

457
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,150
Any movie will do, just arrange it for me.

458
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,830
Not sure if there will be traffic,

459
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,000
so book it for three showings.

460
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,060
Just in case.

461
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,350
Handle it for me.

462
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,950
Aren't you going to change clothes?

463
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,070
Did you just come out of the house looking like this?

464
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,830
-Me
-Uh-huh.

465
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,080
I'm inviting you to a movie, you know.

466
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,940
Damn!

467
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,250
How can you just barge in like that?

468
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,990
Well, I need to pee.

469
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:46,470
Do you want me to pee in the middle of your house?

470
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,700
Don't you know

471
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,060
the word 'wait'?

472
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,860
Stop complaining and let me pee first.

473
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,020
Wait a second.

474
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,510
What now?

475
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,620
Help me take off my pants.

476
00:28:59,690 --> 00:29:00,960
Are you crazy?

477
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,360
I'm not doing that.

478
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,770
Your legs are injured,

479
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,730
but your hands are fine.

480
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,370
Well, your house doesn't have grab bars like mine.

481
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,530
What if I slip and fall?

482
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,390
Hurry up, I really need to pee.

483
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,380
Quickly,

484
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,710
Come closer.

485
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
Easy now.

486
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:27,310
Be gentle.

487
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:31,050
How am I supposed to pee like this?

488
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,450
-Do I have to hold it for you?
-Yes, you have to.

489
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,930
Hurry up, I need to pee.

490
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,920
Okay, there you go.

491
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,270
Aim straight.

492
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,820
-Is it straight?
-Okay, okay.

493
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,160
-Are you done yet?
-Wait, stay still or it'll spill.

494
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,240
Oh no, it's splashing everywhere.

495
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,430
Everyone, gather around.

496
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:23,510
I've decided to try selling a new dish.

497
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,870
I'm not adding a new menu

498
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,200
to give you more work,

499
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,870
but because I realized

500
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,300
I haven't trained you in creating new menus yet.

501
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,010
This will be useful for the second round of the competition.

502
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,910
Creating new dishes is as important

503
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,840
as the taste for a chef's table.

504
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:54,620
Understand?

505
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,620
You don't have to explain much, chef.

506
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,760
It's already clear to us.

507
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,460
I'll give you a recipe to follow,

508
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:14,770
but don't forget that you can enhance the flavors

509
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:16,450
and presentation of the dish.

510
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,490
And what does the winner get, chef?

511
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,060
What kind of question is that?

512
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,950
The winning dish will be sold in the restaurant.
Isn't that good enough?

513
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,690
It'll be sold here, for real.

514
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:26,630
Really?

515
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,730
Is that true, chef?

516
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:34,550
Go get ready, then.

517
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,610
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

518
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:01,920
Hurry up.

519
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,890
Yes, Chef.

520
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,070
Start preparing the shrimp, Kluer.

521
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,040
Yes, chef.

522
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,590
Stay focused.

523
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:19,760
The customers want to eat food, not the cook's blood.

524
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:21,050
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

525
00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:21,990
Yes, Chef.

526
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,620
Kluer, your dish tastes good.

527
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:37,040
Stick to this flavor.

528
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,130
Pun Sib,

529
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,260
your presentation is excellent.

530
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:45,469
I think combining the strengths
of these two will make a great dish for sale.

531
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,710
As for you,

532
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:55,969
I'm very disappointed.

533
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,940
I thought your skills would have improved by now.

534
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,380
It's clear you didn't put in the effort.

535
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,370
You should reflect

536
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,450
on what you really want.

537
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:08,880
Do you just want to eat, or do you want to be a serious chef?

538
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,450
Plawan.

539
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,610
Plawan.

540
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,750
He tried his best, Chef.

541
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,200
He's just a bit stressed today.

542
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,110
Plawan.

543
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,290
Plawan, calm down.

544
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,990
Calm down.

545
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,700
It's okay. I think I'm going to drop out of the competition.

546
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,360
Nothing I do seems to please the Chef.

547
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,200
Everything I make turns out wrong.

548
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,500
Chef Oab probably didn't mean it that way.

549
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:10,470
You know he's always been like this.

550
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,890
That's true, but from the first day until now,

551
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,570
it's been months, and I'm still getting scolded the same way.

552
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,000
Maybe I really do need to reconsider my path.

553
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,480
Hey!

554
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:22,030
Don't overthink it.

555
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,350
Trust me, you can do it.

556
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,030
You really can.

557
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:30,240
Well, I was just a bit angry.

558
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:35,330
Being suddenly thrown a problem to solve right away

559
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,240
isn't something just anyone can do.

560
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,660
But what you did was already impressive.

561
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,210
It wasn't bad at all.

562
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,070
With a little more practice,

563
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,970
you might even surpass me.

564
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,470
Thanks.

565
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,580
Kluer.

566
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,440
You're probably the only one

567
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,450
who believes in me this much.

568
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,380
Thank you.

569
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,340
It's alright.

570
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:13,940
I always believe in you.

571
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,230
If you need anything, just tell me.

572
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,880
Thank you.

573
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,350
Good thing I reserved the whole theater for three showings.

574
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,610
The traffic was insane.

575
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:26,630
I told you it wasn't necessary.

576
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:29,810
How could I not? You wanted to see a movie,

577
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,710
so I have to take care of my physical therapist in the best way possible.

578
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:36,480
You should take care of yourself first.
You've put me through enough trouble already.

579
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:43,700
Mom, I want to watch Paranormal Rivalry.
Why can’t I see it?

580
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,190
The ticket seller said someone reserved the whole theater, sweetie.

581
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,730
Watch something else.

582
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,920
But I want to see it now.

583
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:53,430
Please, Mom.

584
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,350
Hey, you!

585
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,740
If you want to watch, come join us.

586
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,030
Oh, we wouldn't want to intrude.

587
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,070
It's fine.

588
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,360
I didn’t pay for it myself, anyway.

589
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,290
That guy!

590
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:05,820
You!

591
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,350
That gentleman over there reserved the theater for us.

592
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,810
Thank him, dear.

593
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,880
Thank you very much, kind sir.

594
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,950
You’re very generous!

595
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,460
So cute!

596
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:19,170
Come on, let's go watch the movie.

597
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,430
Wait.

598
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,380
What now?

599
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:25,600
Because the kid called me handsome,

600
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,210
I'm letting it slide.

601
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:29,710
He meant me, obviously.

602
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,940
You're so full of yourself. Let's just go.

603
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:36,570
-Let’s go watch the movie.
-Hey, you!

604
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:38,000
-Great job.
-You!

605
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:38,920
Wait for me.

606
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,210
Don't watch, sweetie.
The images might stick with you.

607
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,490
You!

608
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:11,800
What now?

609
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,700
Geez, you!

610
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:17,850
What is it now?

611
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,490
-What?
-Don’t come closer.

612
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:26,760
I'm scared.

613
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,330
Dad's fine now.

614
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,710
You can go back to your studies.

615
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:19,170
Why are you still worrying about such things?

616
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,100
What's going on with you?

617
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,910
And you,

618
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,630
shouldn't you be looking after your restaurant?

619
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,510
What are you doing here?

620
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,300
Has the master gotten better?

621
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,800
What?

622
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:37,340
I'm not sick or anything.

623
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,950
It's not funny, Dad.

624
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:41,190
This is not a joke.

625
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:44,270
What if something happened to you?

626
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,670
Why didn't you tell me?

627
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:50,120
If something happened, how would I cope?

628
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,290
Khao Suay, Dad...

629
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:00,320
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

630
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,070
I was just worried about you.

631
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:08,810
I didn't want you to throw away your future.

632
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,160
I'm sorry, dear.

633
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,610
Oab.

634
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:25,790
Darn it.

635
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:28,950
Just a moment ago, I was worried something might have happened to Master.

636
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:31,320
Now you're raising your voice at Dad.

637
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,320
The Master's daughter

638
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,740
is always hard to please.

639
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:39,510
Besides me,

640
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,940
no matter how stubborn she is,

641
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,900
you're the only one who can handle her,

642
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,250
Oab.

643
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,630
It's really a shame.

644
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:53,210
I thought we would become a family.

645
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:02,710
Master is asleep now.

646
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,530
Let's eat, P' Oab.

647
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,830
Did you order stir-fried curry again?

648
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:13,460
You know they always put long beans in it.

649
00:43:15,850 --> 00:43:18,350
And you always have to pick them out.

650
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,360
If you can't eat them, why do you keep ordering it?

651
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,800
Thank you, P' Oab.

652
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:29,460
Nobody knows Kao Suay as well as you do, P' Oab.

653
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,440
It's just a habit.

654
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:41,000
Small things like this aren't a big deal
for people who are familiar with each other.

655
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:49,270
If it were just someone familiar,

656
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,440
they wouldn't do this for each other.

657
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,710
Wow, do you have a lot of free time?

658
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,510
Coming to make granita in my room,

659
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,240
don't you have your own room?

660
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,820
I do,

661
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,940
but I don't want to see anyone else.

662
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:24,920
This isn't the usual granita recipe.

663
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,960
It's the one you made for Kao Suay, isn't it?

664
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,260
This image reminds me of someone.

665
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,450
It looks like that kid Plawan at your restaurant.

666
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:39,310
Yeah!

667
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:40,530
Why?

668
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:42,280
If it's true, then so what?

669
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,560
Do whatever you want.

670
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,020
If you want to announce that you're courting someone younger, just do it.

671
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,540
Why should you worry about Kao Suay over something that's already over?

672
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,120
Sure, courting is fine,

673
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,140
but right now, Kao Suay needs support.

674
00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:07,900
Even if I don't love Kao Suay like a lover anymore,

675
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:09,750
look at the name of my restaurant.

676
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,630
There's no long beans in the basil dishes.

677
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:13,660
Do you know why?

678
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,810
Because Kao Suay is allergic to long beans.

679
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:19,840
And another thing,

680
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,520
Kao Suay's life is tough enough as it is.

681
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,310
Do you expect me to reject her?

682
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,750
Oh, P' Oab.

683
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,060
How long are you going to drag this out?

684
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:30,150
Gratitude is one thing,

685
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:31,830
love is another.

686
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:33,230
If it’s not right,

687
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,720
you’ll end up rejecting her anyway.

688
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:37,020
The longer you let this drag on,

689
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:40,140
won't it just give Kao Suay false hope?

690
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,960
One down, one down.

691
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:49,570
Come on, come on, come on!

692
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,740
Aren’t you stressed?

693
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:55,230
We have to compete in the second round soon.

694
00:45:56,180 --> 00:45:56,750
-Hey, come here.
-What?

695
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:59,190
-What?
-If you can't think for yourself, help me think.

696
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,890
Help me out here.

697
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,060
Fine, fine, alright.

698
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,420
For the sake of you teaching me how to cook.

699
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:07,980
So, what ideas do you have, Kluer?

700
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,120
None.

701
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:12,870
Try thinking about what you’re good at,

702
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:14,750
what you usually enjoy doing.

703
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:16,130
Cooking.

704
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:22,690
In this life, have you ever liked anything a lot besides the kitchen?

705
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:25,920
Liked?

706
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:32,820
Well, yeah, but...

707
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:34,430
I can't tell you.

708
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,930
Why not?

709
00:46:38,310 --> 00:46:40,940
Tell me so I can help you come up with ideas.

710
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,060
Everything can be a creative idea.

711
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:45,760
Don't worry about looking silly.

712
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,850
I promise I won't make fun of you.

713
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:54,530
I can't, I just can't tell you.

714
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,420
How about this?

715
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,220
If we stay cooped up in the restaurant, we won't come up with anything.

716
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:01,930
Let's go for a walk in the amusement park.

717
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:05,140
Changing the scenery might help.

718
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:05,800
Sound good?

719
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:09,740
Sounds good, we can find something to eat too.

720
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,110
Kluer, let's go.

721
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,010
Alright, alright, let's go.

722
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:19,560
Uh, can I finish up in the restaurant first?

723
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:30,980
Let's keep playing.

724
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:46,270
Hi, P' Oab.

725
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:48,230
Kao Suay,

726
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:50,210
can you come to the restaurant?

727
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,820
I have something to talk to you about.

728
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,140
Dad's not asleep yet.

729
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,410
I'm busy taking care of him right now. Can we talk another day?

730
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,380
Alright, take care of your dad first.

731
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,850
I'll wait at the restaurant.

732
00:48:05,410 --> 00:48:08,400
When you're done, come see me at the restaurant.

733
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:10,810
I really want to talk about us.

734
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,730
But now Kao Suay knows

735
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:21,070
that Kao Suay still loves P' Oab the same.

736
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:24,320
P' Nab Nueng, can't you help talk to P' Oab?

737
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:26,000
At least,

738
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:28,920
let him reconsider one more time.

739
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,660
If we truly love someone,

740
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:35,730
we want to see them happy, right?

741
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,250
I think

742
00:48:39,270 --> 00:48:42,270
you should also respect P' Oab's decision.

743
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,100
I have to say,

744
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:49,230
I'm one of P' Oab's close friends.

745
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,940
I can't be the middleman for you.

746
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,240
But my advice

747
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,010
is to think carefully

748
00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:58,860
before you decide to do anything.

749
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,020
P' Oab

750
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:03,220
loves Kao Suay like family.

751
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:06,410
Don't do anything that will make both of you regret it.

752
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:10,040
Sorry,

753
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:11,510
could you please check the bill?

754
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:13,440
Oh sure, just a moment.

755
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:16,620
Think about it, okay?

756
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:21,430
Here you go, customer.

757
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,330
Here it is.

758
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:37,710
I can't go tonight, Kao Suay.

759
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:40,850
Let's talk another day.

760
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:01,610
Plawan,

761
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:02,840
let's go.

762
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,560
Where did Pun Sib go?

763
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,500
He said he had some urgent business.
If he finishes in time, he'll hurry to join us.

764
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,010
What's up with him?

765
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:14,610
He was the one who invited us, and now he's flaking out.

766
00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:17,040
Never mind.

767
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:18,430
We're already here, so let's go.

768
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:20,660
Okay, let's go.

769
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,940
Good luck, and all the best!

770
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:30,360
Kluer,

771
00:50:30,650 --> 00:50:33,190
I've made this opportunity for you, don't let it slip away.

772
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,500
Slip away?

773
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,100
What are you talking about?

774
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:37,780
Kluer likes Plawan, right?

775
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,450
You should confess your love to Plawan.

776
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:41,510
How can you just blurt that out?

777
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,260
And how did you find out about this?

778
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:48,210
But I'm serious, you should confess your love to Plawan.

779
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,650
The second round of the competition is coming up,

780
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,010
and if one of us gets eliminated,

781
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:55,360
it might be a long time before we see each other again.

782
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,080
So

783
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:00,010
it has to be today, understand?

784
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:04,260
Alright,

785
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:06,620
I'll try my best.

786
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:08,070
Thank you so much.

787
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,590
Kluer,

788
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:13,710
let's go.

789
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,230
Yeah, let's go now.

790
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:21,980
This one, this one.

791
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:22,940
This one, right?

792
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:29,130
-Come here, I'll show you how to do it.
-Try it now?

793
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,620
Watch this,

794
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,690
shoot now.

795
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,940
How's that? How's that?

796
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:53,820
My turn, how's that? How's that?

797
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:54,740
What the...?

798
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,120
Oh, thank you.

799
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:05,430
Isn't it cute?

800
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,500
What's going on?

801
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:11,450
Why?

802
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:12,760
I give this to you.

803
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,320
Really?

804
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,540
Really?

805
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,610
Thank you, Kluer.

806
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:27,730
Alright.

807
00:52:29,930 --> 00:52:31,720
The orange one looks tasty, let me have a bite.

808
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:33,510
Hey, hey, it'll be gone!

809
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:34,730
That's enough, stop.

810
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:35,790
I'm outta here.

811
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:40,700
Kluer, have some.

812
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:44,830
Liquor?

813
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:46,540
-Want some more?
-No, thanks.

814
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,640
-Just a bit, come on.
-No, thanks.

815
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,280
Are you asleep?

816
00:52:58,450 --> 00:52:59,510
Wanna meet up?

817
00:53:18,390 --> 00:53:19,170
Whoa,

818
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,530
you scared me, Chef.

819
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:23,820
What are you doing sitting here alone this late?

820
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,520
Nothing much,

821
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,340
just thinking about some stuff.

822
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,190
Is everyone else already in bed?

823
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,090
Not yet.

824
00:53:31,210 --> 00:53:33,050
Kluer and Plawan haven't come back yet.

825
00:53:33,390 --> 00:53:35,440
It's good that you're here, Chef.

826
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:38,740
I thought I’d be alone in the restaurant.

827
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:40,830
I'm really scared of ghosts.

828
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,350
They haven't come back yet?

829
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:44,170
Where did they go?

830
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:47,160
Kluer and Plawan went to the market

831
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,250
at the intersection.

832
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:52,560
But don’t be hard on Kluer.

833
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:53,700
Well.

834
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,250
I shouldn’t be telling you this, Chef,but...

835
00:53:56,940 --> 00:53:58,910
I thought it’s better to tell you

836
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:01,440
so you won’t get mad at Kluer if they come back late.

837
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:02,740
Well.

838
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,460
Kluer is going to confess his love to Plawan.

839
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:18,220
If we end up together,

840
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:21,760
whether I or Wan wins, we can still run the restaurant together.

841
00:54:21,890 --> 00:54:24,350
So, you're not going to stop me from courting Wan, right?

842
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:28,940
Chef.

843
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,740
Plawan, hurry up.

844
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,090
Quick, quick.

845
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:37,690
Let's go.

846
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,880
Let's ride the carousel.

847
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:39,560
Come on.

848
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:41,290
Then let's go.

849
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,990
Not that way, come down first.

850
00:54:45,430 --> 00:54:47,360
-Isn't it this way?
-No, over there.

851
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:29,820
If you let them misunderstand too much

852
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:32,000
and he run away,

853
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:34,350
no one will help you take responsibility.

854
00:55:45,310 --> 00:55:46,230
Plawan,

855
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:01,280
well...

856
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,620
I have something to tell you.

857
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,750
I’ll ask directly.

858
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,120
What’s going on between you and Chef Oab?

859
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,490
I know how Kluer feels about you,

860
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,200
but what I want to know more is how you feel about Kluer.

861
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,620
I'm serious about you.

862
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:54,270
What do you want me to prove?

863
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:58,440
Then why don't you try canceling the condo project
you're planning to build near Chef Oab's restaurant?

864
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,570
Are you willing to do that?

865
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:02,550
Wow, Chef, this is really delicious.

866
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:03,860
Can you teach me how to make it?

867
00:57:03,890 --> 00:57:05,140
Sure, I can teach you.

868
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:07,160
But when I do,

869
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:08,770
just don’t cry.

870
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:14,160
Hold on a second.

871
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:15,710
Just a moment.

872
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,570
(Uncle is easily scared)
That really scared me.

873
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:20,590
I was on the phone

874
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,940
and didn’t see him come out and say 'oops' right in front of me.

875
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,350
Show him your teeth, sweetheart.

876
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:26,900
Now try taking out your teeth.

877
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,060
-No, no, not that.
-Hey, seriously.

878
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,420
Is it real?

879
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,260
(Really shocked)

880
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:34,300
-That's so cool.
-Just like him.

881
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,270
You take them out too.

882
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:36,640
(Just kidding)
I can't.

883
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,930
(The battle for Chef Oab)

884
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:43,910
(This one is mine)
