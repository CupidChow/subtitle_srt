1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,650
A fan like you, if you're not serious, just step back.

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,380
People like you will never succeed.

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:08,690
If you don't get the two million..

4
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,880
You don't need to hire my friend for this job anymore.

5
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:13,290
The first installment is 30% of 2 million.

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:18,240
But if your friend doesn't win.
He has to return every baht.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,960
I don't see you as a competitor or enemy.

8
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:24,220
A restaurant can't be run by one person alone; we have to work together.

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,780
You'll be doing real work and rotating through all tasks,

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,700
from selecting and preparing ingredients,
washing and cutting vegetables, serving, and cleaning the kitchen.

11
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,750
What are you doing?

12
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:33,910
Even washing dishes takes you this long?

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,880
Sorry, Chef.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,980
Get out.

15
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:48,710
But I...

16
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,810
Get out.

17
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,460
I said, get out of my kitchen

18
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:08,020
You all have to prepare the next dish within 5 minutes.

19
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,250
-Yes, Chef.
-Hurry up!

20
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,620
Yes, Chef.

21
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,140
Uh, Chef, Chef,

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,470
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,840
Please don't kick me out.

24
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,190
I told you before,

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,460
there's no room for mistakes in this kitchen.

26
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,100
But I can fix it,

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,960
Chef.

28
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:25,360
Give me another chance.

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,360
Please, Chef, Please.

30
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,060
Before asking for another chance,

31
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,490
go take care of that wound.

32
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:33,870
Ah!

33
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,900
It's fine, Chef. Just a small cut.

34
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:41,380
See, it's already better.

35
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,830
Who taught you to treat a wound like that?

36
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,039
Follow me.

37
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,200
Uh, Chef?

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
Ouch, it hurts!

39
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,800
You're a grown man, still crying over this.

40
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,829
You want to be a chef but don't take care of your hands?

41
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,840
If you get hurt worse than this, how will you cook?

42
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,120
I'll be more careful, Chef.

43
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,630
What's wrong?

44
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,610
Nothing,

45
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,630
I just think of the smell of basil from you...

46
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:02,110
it smells really good.

47
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,280
This is a basil stir-fry restaurant.

48
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,240
If you can't smell basil,

49
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,060
you should get your nose checked.

50
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
Or are you just hungry?

51
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,080
Well, I...

52
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,230
Are you hungry for food,

53
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,490
or are you hungry for me?

54
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,710
Are you kidding, Chef?

55
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,460
I'm not hungry for anything.

56
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,960
I'm full.

57
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,900
Take it to serve.

58
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,020
Yes, Chef.

59
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,040
I know you're angry, Chef,

60
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,120
but everyone makes mistakes.

61
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,360
Why don't you give Plawan a chance?

62
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,630
What are you talking about?

63
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,040
I haven't done anything yet.

64
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,740
But you kicked Plawan out, didn't you?

65
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,600
Where are you going?

66
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,350
Get back to work.

67
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,970
We still have one more dish to prepare, don't we?

68
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,890
Plus, after this round, we need to get ready for the evening service.

69
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,930
Are you sure you're up to it?

70
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,520
In this condition, you should go rest.

71
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,970
Staying here will just get in the way of others.

72
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,370
No, I can do it.

73
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,780
Let me help fix the problem with the broken plate.

74
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760
How do you plan to do that?

75
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,890
The plate set you broke is custom-made with no spares.

76
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,370
Our restaurant is a chef's table,

77
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,650
serving all dishes simultaneously and they must be identical.

78
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,290
My customers expect matching plates for everyone,

79
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,840
or there will be comparisons.

80
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,600
We have a full house of 10 guests tonight.

81
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,690
I'll find a replacement plate for you before dinner service.

82
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,160
Plates aren't just dishes,

83
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:32,120
they must elevate our food.

84
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,840
If I don't have the right plates for tonight,

85
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,170
you can pack your bags and go home.

86
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,050
Yes, Chef. Thank you, Chef.

87
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,530
Hey!

88
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,920
Are you going to stand around all day?

89
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,340
If you have something to do, go do it.

90
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,390
Yes, Chef.

91
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:14,280
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

92
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,600
Is this all we have as spares?

93
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,730
What should I do?

94
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,680
Thought you were going to leave.

95
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,980
I will if I can't find replacement plates for tonight's dinner.

96
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,590
That plate seems too plain.

97
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,110
Exactly,

98
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,820
and also need to convey the essence of basil stuffed spring rolls.

99
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,860
How do spring roll communicate that with what?

100
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:40,990
What should I do?

101
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,340
If you can't change the plate, change the plating style.

102
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,590
How?

103
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,080
If you're using this plate,

104
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:50,130
you have to make the presentation so beautiful
that people overlook the plate itself.

105
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,620
That might work,

106
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:53,970
but it’s not enough.

107
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,810
Why do you think Chef Oab orders custom plates

108
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,980
if we could just plate nicely on any dish?

109
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,230
What should I do?

110
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,820
Hello, do you have plates for sale?

111
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,220
Only three?

112
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,260
Hello, the plates I showed you, do you have them?

113
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,660
Ten plates?

114
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,070
What?

115
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,900
3,000 baht each?

116
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,290
Who are you selling to?

117
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,890
Fine, I'll take them.

118
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,310
Can you give me a discount?

119
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,250
Then...

120
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,570
What inexpensive items do you have in your store?
Please send some to me.

121
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:29,840
I need them urgently.

122
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,159
What are you doing with that cutting board?

123
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,630
It's for serving the spring rolls.

124
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,530
Interesting idea,

125
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,850
but how will you make it work?

126
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,470
We don't have much time left. I want to ask everyone for help.

127
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,920
It looks okay,

128
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,770
but it's missing something.

129
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,210
Maybe decorating it like this would be better.

130
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,730
Keep the main ingredient in focus

131
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,230
and place the vegetables and flowers around it

132
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,170
so they don't distract too much.

133
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,000
So we can serve it like this, right, Chef?

134
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,340
Yeah, that'll work.

135
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,380
Yes!

136
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,940
Alright, get ready.

137
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,020
The customers will be arriving soon.

138
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,840
Yes, Chef.

139
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,270
Why are you smiling?

140
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,300
Does this mean I'm not getting kicked out, Chef?

141
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,660
Just for this round.

142
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,340
Come on, Chef,

143
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,530
a little praise wouldn't hurt.

144
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,790
I'm good at problem-solving, right?

145
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,550
If you hadn't messed up in the first place,

146
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,390
I wouldn't have had to fix this.

147
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,790
Now, get ready.
The next round of customers is coming.

148
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
Yes, Chef.

149
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,100
Wait a second.

150
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,580
Your idea is good.

151
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
Keep that creativity.

152
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,580
It sets you apart from others.

153
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
Yes, Chef.

154
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
Now hurry up and get to work.

155
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,560
Yes, Chef.

156
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,580
Here, sign this.

157
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,710
Stop stalling, will you?

158
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,340
I need to get some sleep.

159
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,630
I have work early tomorrow.

160
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,190
Oh come on,

161
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,030
you haven't seen me in ages.

162
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,880
Don't you miss me, buddy?

163
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,930
Not really.

164
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,550
Hurry up.

165
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,210
Fine, fine.

166
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:08,880
Here you go.

167
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,370
Aren't you going to read the contract first?

168
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,700
Nah,

169
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,590
if you say it's good, then it's good.

170
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,190
I've used my brain enough today; it's about to explode.

171
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,140
Use your brain sometimes, will you?

172
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,800
So, how's it going?

173
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,610
Are you getting any better at cooking?

174
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,650
You need to hurry up and improve your skills.

175
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,190
What training?
The chef won't even let me touch the wok.

176
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,840
He has me washing dishes all the time.

177
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,050
You got a cut on your first day at work?

178
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:37,160
You're nothing if not consistent, Wan.

179
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,800
It’s that damn chef's fault.

180
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:39,780
He made a loud noise

181
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:40,950
and scared the hell out of me.

182
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,580
So, have you figured out his weakness yet?

183
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,850
How are you going to beat him?

184
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
I have no idea.

185
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,190
But there's something weird about the Chef.

186
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,140
Weird how?

187
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,260
Is he a psycho or something?

188
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,620
No, not like that.

189
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,000
Every time I get close to him,

190
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:59,460
I smell basil stir-fry coming from him.

191
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,120
Seriously, Wan?

192
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,180
That's weird?

193
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,800
He's a chef who cooks basil stir-fry.

194
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,420
No, it's not just that.

195
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,370
Even when we're not in the kitchen,

196
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:09,770
I still smell basil on him.

197
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,390
It's like the smell of basil is ingrained in every part of him

198
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,880
even clothes, hair, everything.

199
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,810
Whenever I get close to him, I feel strange.

200
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,070
And before I know it,

201
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,140
I'm staring at him until he looks

202
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,350
like he's about to bite my head off.

203
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,130
Hey.

204
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,720
Hmm?

205
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,570
Don't tell me you have a crush on the Chef.

206
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,430
What?

207
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,170
Don't say stupid stuff like that.

208
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,390
Then why are you blushing.

209
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,300
Blushing?

210
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:42,120
What blushing?
Maybe it's because I drank a lot of beer.

211
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,100
I'm warning you,

212
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:47,600
don't fall for Chef Oab.

213
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,130
If you already have, dig yourself out of that hole.

214
00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:52,710
Eventually, Chef Oab will find out

215
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,690
you're working for Metas.

216
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,620
Or do you want to watch your two million disappear right in front of you?

217
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:00,880
No, the two million must be mine.

218
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,810
Good.

219
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,350
Then keep that in mind:

220
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:05,820
you're there to work, not to fall in love.

221
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,290
For the two million,

222
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:08,920
I won't like that Chef.

223
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,210
From now on,

224
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,290
I'll keep my distance and won't get closer than an arm's length.

225
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,950
Not just keeping your distance, you need to train hard too.

226
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,470
I'll stay an arm's length away

227
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,990
and train hard

228
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,200
for tomorrow

229
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,160
I'll be at the stove.

230
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,350
Good!

231
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,110
Why are my eyes burning?

232
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,630
Where's the water?

233
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,510
Who's there?

234
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,470
Who is it?

235
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,030
Or could it be a thief?

236
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:02,950
What should I do?

237
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,480
Let's see how tough you are.

238
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:34,590
Plawan,

239
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,130
it's me!

240
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,650
Kluer,

241
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,800
why are you sneaking around?

242
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,550
Keep your voice down,

243
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,200
you'll wake the whole place.

244
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,690
What's going on?

245
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,430
Keep it down.

246
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,670
Why are you coming back so late? Where have you been?

247
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,100
I had some business to take care of.

248
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,540
Plawan, please don't tell Chef about this.

249
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,410
I don't want to get kicked out. Please?

250
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,620
Ugh, come on,

251
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,060
these stupid rules. Don't worry about it.

252
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:08,870
Yeah,

253
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,340
but

254
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,650
rules are rules, you know.

255
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,490
Why?

256
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,360
Are you changing your mind and going to tell the Chef?

257
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,510
No, I won't tell anyone.

258
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:27,110
But I can't help cover for you for free.

259
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,180
What do you want, then?

260
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,470
Simple.

261
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,720
Teach me how to cook.

262
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,020
Huh?

263
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,700
Why should I?

264
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,970
If you applied to be a chef, you should already know how to cook.

265
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,450
Plus, we're competitors, you know.

266
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,270
What?

267
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,300
Just the other day, you said we could be friends.

268
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:49,290
Why are we enemies now?

269
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,300
But I don't know if the Chef will be okay

270
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,370
with competitors teaching each other.

271
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:57,050
Why overthink it?

272
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,150
If the Chef didn't specify it in the rules, then it should be fine, right?

273
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
So, what do you say?

274
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,319
Alright, fine.

275
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,599
But about me coming back late,

276
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,480
not a word to anyone. Got it?

277
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,230
Got it.

278
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,620
Ease up on the knife and make long slices.

279
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,090
Don't hold the cucumber too tightly,

280
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:43,160
or it'll bruise.

281
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:51,960
Here,

282
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,730
do it like this.

283
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,440
See?

284
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,080
That way, you won't cut into it.

285
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:04,310
This isn't so hard.

286
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,860
What are you doing, Auto?

287
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:51,690
Auto,

288
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:01,660
what are you up to?

289
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,700
Jeez,

290
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:07,670
don't sneak up on me like that.
You scared me!

291
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:10,140
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

292
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,750
What are you writing?

293
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,670
Nothing.

294
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,770
I have to take this call.

295
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,180
Don't lock the door, okay?

296
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,310
Okay.

297
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,050
He's definitely hiding something. Probably a girlfriend.

298
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,530
Today will be the same. We'll divide the tasks among us.

299
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:40,350
Yesterday, I let everyone choose their roles.

300
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,690
Today, may I be at the frying station?

301
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,450
But today, I'll assign the tasks myself.

302
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,770
Kluer, you'll be at the frying station.

303
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,860
Auto, you're on stir-fry.

304
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,140
Pun Sib, you're on dishwashing.

305
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,100
Plawan, you greet the customers.

306
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,220
It might be better to stay away from the kitchen.

307
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,950
Let's see if you can manage without breaking anything.

308
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,980
Now, get ready for work.

309
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,070
Yes, Chef.

310
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:13,570
Ugh, such nice hands and I have to wash dishes.

311
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,980
What if I get a reaction from the detergent?

312
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,720
Chef?

313
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:36,960
What?

314
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,600
Chef?

315
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,960
Stay right there, Chef.

316
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,280
That way, I don't have to smell it.

317
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,280
What are you talking about?

318
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,770
Smell what?

319
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,260
I'm not wearing any cologne. What's your point?

320
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,620
Well,

321
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,570
I just wanted to ask

322
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,100
if I'll get another chance to cook.

323
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,090
I haven't had the opportunity to show my skills yet.

324
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,040
You think one night of practice

325
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,200
will make you a master?

326
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,520
Wait, you knew about last night, Chef?

327
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,290
I told you, everything that happens in this restaurant

328
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,750
is under my watch.

329
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,310
Your skills aren't stable enough yet.

330
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,060
I can't let you be at the stove.

331
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:18,570
And another thing,

332
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,180
focus on doing your assigned tasks properly first.

333
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,930
Don't cause any more problems like yesterday.

334
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,640
Yes, Chef.

335
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,980
You also need to set the tables.

336
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,860
This tough Chef,

337
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,660
he won't let me into the kitchen. It's so frustrating!

338
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,610
Even if it's just serving, you have to do your best.

339
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,370
Keep reminding myself, two million baht.

340
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,420
JJ.

341
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:53,830
Yes, sir?

342
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,260
Do we have any appointments today?

343
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,240
No, we're waiting for walk-ins.

344
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,260
In that case, take care of the patients instead of Ek for today.

345
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,720
He's got food poisoning.

346
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,020
I'll handle the front desk.

347
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,720
Got it. Just send me the location.

348
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,610
I'll go prepare.

349
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,660
Okay.

350
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,250
Damn!

351
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,150
If you don't get 1.5 million, don't take it.

352
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,710
My friend doesn't need someone like you.

353
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,220
No way.The world can't be this small.

354
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:49,320
(Patient record: Mr. Metas Siramongkolsawat)

355
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,220
Oh, there it is.

356
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,410
It really is him.

357
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,800
Damn it.

358
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:57,810
Excuse me, sir.

359
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,290
Hello, Mr. Metas.

360
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,910
I'll be your physical therapist today.

361
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,360
Where's my regular therapist?

362
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,410
Why are you here?

363
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,110
I'm sorry, but Mr. Ek got sick unexpectedly,

364
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,520
so I had to step in.

365
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,780
Shall we get started?

366
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,700
I see from your records that you've had an ankle injury before.

367
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,420
Let me take a look at your ankle.

368
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,300
No need.

369
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:26,910
I want to finish my session quickly and leave.

370
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:30,970
Next time,

371
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,000
if my regular therapist isn't available, let me know.

372
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,140
I can change the person in time.

373
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,720
I don't want just anyone to be sent.

374
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,220
Actually,

375
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,440
there won't be a next time.

376
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,450
I'm switching therapists

377
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:46,810
from today onward.

378
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,410
Damn it.

379
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:07,860
Excuse me,

380
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,750
I think there's something wrong with your ankle.

381
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,410
Let me take a look first.

382
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,700
Serve it!

383
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,790
Alright.

384
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,870
Look, don't push yourself too hard.

385
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,820
Hey, you!

386
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:35,110
You you!

387
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,650
You you you you.

388
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,330
Let me see it.

389
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,370
Hey, I told you, there's nothing wrong with me.

390
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,570
Stay out of my business.

391
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,560
Let me check it.

392
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,710
If you still want to walk, stay still.

393
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,570
What are you doing?

394
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,070
I think your ankle might be twisted.

395
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,110
I'll give you some first aid before

396
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,980
you go to the hospital for further treatment.

397
00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:04,120
Could you call an ambulance for me, please?

398
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,480
Be gentle.

399
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,860
Enjoy your meal.

400
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,630
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes?

401
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,240
Is the food too spicy for you?

402
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,770
No, it's fine.

403
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,860
Are you allergic to any food?

404
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,210
No,

405
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,300
but I'm allergic to celery.

406
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,990
I didn't mention it earlier because I didn't expect it to be in the food.

407
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:01,910
I apologize.

408
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,600
Our soup contains celery.

409
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,420
Let me take it back.

410
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,900
Sure,

411
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:11,580
It's good that I only ate a little,
otherwise the situation could have been worse.

412
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,120
Could you change the soup for the customer, please?

413
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,470
-Are you okay, man?
-I'm okay, I'm okay.

414
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,810
-Okay?
-Okay, okay.

415
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,870
eah, just a bit itchy.

416
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:20,910
-Do you have any?
-Any what

417
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:21,970
Medicine. Do you have any?

418
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,610
Hey,

419
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:24,910
You sure you're okay?

420
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
I'm fine, really.

421
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,200
Drink plenty of water.

422
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:29,710
Excuse me, if you don't mind, here's an antihistamine.

423
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,050
I carry it with me because I have frequent allergies.

424
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,880
Thank you so much, really appreciate it.

425
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:34,930
You're welcome.

426
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,140
Don't worry,

427
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,440
our restaurant only has one dish with celery.

428
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,760
I apologize for the inconvenience.

429
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,150
It's okay, really.

430
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,990
You sure you're okay?

431
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,050
Yeah, I'm fine.

432
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,150
Go ahead and eat.

433
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,040
-Thanks so much.
-Thank you.

434
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,540
Your assistant is impressive.

435
00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,030
If it weren't for him, I'd probably be in the hospital by now.

436
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,490
I apologize for the oversight.

437
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,160
I'll make sure to refund your meal.

438
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:06,810
No need, it was my mistake

439
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,620
for not mentioning it earlier.

440
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,540
I admire you, Chef.

441
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,510
Your place is beautiful, Chef.

442
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,510
Just no celery next time.

443
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:16,710
Absolutely, no celery next time.

444
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,720
I have to leave.

445
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,010
Thank you.

446
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,470
Did I do well, Chef?

447
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,270
Yes, you did.

448
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,310
Chef, what are you doing?

449
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,520
Wait, Chef!

450
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,580
Hey, Chef, you won't come in.

451
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,900
Chef,

452
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,220
Chef!

453
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,110
Hey, hey, careful.

454
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,200
I won't like that Chef.

455
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,890
From now on, I'll keep my distance.

456
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,330
Smells so good.

457
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,440
It smells that good, huh?

458
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,270
I don't mind

459
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:27,300
if you like my scent.

460
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,340
What are you talking about, Chef?

461
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,820
I'll go help my friend clean up in the kitchen.

462
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,030
Oops!

463
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,620
Excuse me,

464
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,050
it's been several hours tonight.

465
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,420
Haven't you been able to contact
the family of the patient who just had knee surgery?

466
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,700
It seems that his secretary is on the way.

467
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,540
What about his family?

468
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,620
I don't know.

469
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,730
The emergency contact number for Mr. Metas

470
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,330
is his secretary's number.

471
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,220
Oh, how are you feeling?

472
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,080
Are you in pain?

473
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,260
Not yet.

474
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,860
Once the anesthesia wears off, it might hurt.

475
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,530
During the initial physical therapy, it could be painful.

476
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:56,870
How are you holding up? Not feeling so tough now, huh?

477
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,390
If you're going to keep annoying me like this,

478
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,050
you can leave.

479
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
It's a waste of time.

480
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,690
I need to rest.

481
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,740
Whether I'm here or not, it's the same waste of time.

482
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,170
Suit yourself.

483
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,530
Every time I see you, it's bad luck.

484
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,290
Ever since that deal fell through.

485
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:20,400
Next time, I'll put up a sign

486
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,590
to keep you away.

487
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:23,930
Hey!

488
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,990
I'm doing my job.

489
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:31,080
Rest assured, you're getting your money's worth with me taking care of you.

490
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,610
It's past my shift now.

491
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,830
Once someone comes to take over,

492
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:39,930
I'll leave.

493
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,110
Then go ahead and leave.

494
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,860
No one's coming.

495
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
Go on.

496
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:52,330
Where are your family and your secretary?

497
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,040
My secretary came to sort out the insurance paperwork and then left.

498
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,790
As for family,

499
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,050
I don't have anyone.

500
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:15,050
Why are you looking at me like that?

501
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,020
I'm fine.

502
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,370
Staying in a VIP room like this is like being in a hotel.

503
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:22,730
It's comfortable.

504
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:24,840
If I need anything, I can just press the button to call a nurse.

505
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,890
You don't need to pity me.

506
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,490
And don't you get lonely sleeping alone?

507
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,140
Hey you scooped a lot of dessert. This is a real treat!

508
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:51,410
But it tastes good.

509
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,260
Hey, can you say that again?

510
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,720
I want to record it.

511
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:59,250
Oh man, if Chef Oab praises it like this, maybe my restaurant

512
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,760
will have long queues like yours.

513
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:02,540
Cut it out. That's enough.

514
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,580
Come on,

515
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:04,970
just a little bit.

516
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:08,150
If you don't stop filming, I'm going to start yelling.

517
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,640
Why don't you go back to making desserts?

518
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,760
You make desserts even better than your basil stir-fry.

519
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,340
No, I don't feel like it.

520
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,240
Maybe I'll think about it after I sell the restaurant.

521
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,550
So what's up today?

522
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:31,290
You wouldn't come all the way to my place after closing time

523
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,740
just to try my new dessert recipe, right?

524
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:37,100
You're pretty sharp, aren't you?

525
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,950
Of course! It's me,

526
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,940
Nab Nueng, your beloved little brother.

527
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,720
Come on,

528
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,090
tell me what's going on.

529
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,940
Well, lately I've noticed

530
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,080
that some people don't want to be around me,

531
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:54,510
saying I smell. What do you think?

532
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,510
You smell?

533
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,480
Why are you sniffing around so much?

534
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,660
Bro,

535
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,170
There's nothing, really.

536
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,070
Did you switch colognes or something?

537
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:10,670
No, I didn't change anything.

538
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:13,650
Or maybe it's just an excuse because he doesn't want to be near me.

539
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,010
Do you think that's possible?

540
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,970
I guess it could be possible.

541
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,750
But did you do something to make them dislike you?

542
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,360
I don't know.

543
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,150
Maybe they hate me because I yelled at them.

544
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,290
Are you talking

545
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,150
about someone in the restaurant?

546
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,320
A contestant,

547
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,070
perhaps?

548
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,380
Of course not! No way.

549
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,200
Sure.

550
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,530
Sure.

551
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:41,480
Oh, I see.

552
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,410
But do you remember the last time you felt like this?

553
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,080
It was when you were into Kao Suay.

554
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:48,010
If it's like this,

555
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,980
it might mean

556
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:52,760
you like that person, right?

557
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,190
You're making things  up.

558
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,410
That's impossible.

559
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,970
I just don't want to create a tense atmosphere.

560
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,190
Okay, Oab.

561
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,290
If you say you don't like them, then fine.

562
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:06,110
But honestly,

563
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,440
I don't want you to shut yourself off.

564
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:12,570
If you feel something for someone,

565
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,080
I want you to open up.

566
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:19,929
Maybe your passion for cooking that seemed to have faded

567
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,590
might come back again.

568
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,290
Smells so good.

569
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:52,480
Why would I be lonely?

570
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:55,909
I usually sleep alone anyway.

571
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,640
But you're not in your normal condition now, are you?

572
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,620
You're bedridden, feeling unwell.

573
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:00,890
Don't you see?

574
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,650
Look at your knee.

575
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,360
Alright,

576
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:12,270
I'll stay with you until you fall asleep,

577
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:14,130
then I'll leave.

578
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,110
As for the overtime pay,

579
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,760
I'll claim it later. Okay?

580
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,670
When you sleep, you seem to be more at peace.

581
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,260
You've all trained enough now.

582
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:10,080
I'll announce the first challenge:

583
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:12,320
basil stir-fry with a perfectly round fried egg.

584
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,430
The rules are the same.

585
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:16,550
The one with the lowest score will be eliminated.

586
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:18,650
Please get ready.

587
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,220
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

588
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:26,790
Let's go.

589
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,480
Okay, let's do this.

590
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,530
A round fried egg?

591
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,630
What's that about?

592
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,210
Isn't a fried egg

593
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:35,820
supposed to be round?

594
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,640
Your cat is feeling better now.

595
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:43,660
There's no need to worry.

596
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,350
Thank you very much, doctor.

597
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:51,210
Hey, Kluer.

598
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:53,500
Is that all there is to it for a round fried egg?

599
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,590
Yup, that's it.

600
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,080
It's so easy. Why would Chef test us on this?

601
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,610
Is there a hidden trap?

602
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,620
There's no trap.

603
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,360
A round fried egg seems simple, right?

604
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,980
But making it perfect is tough.

605
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,730
The balance between the yolk and white has to be just right.

606
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,300
Plus, you need to crack the egg so it keeps its shape.

607
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,030
Simple dishes like this are where we have to get creative.

608
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,450
The highlight of a Chef Table restaurant

609
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,150
is creativity.

610
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,150
Is that so?

611
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,020
Kluer, can you teach me how to make stir-fried basil with round fried egg?

612
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,350
Please please.

613
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,910
Are you crazy?

614
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,170
This is a real competition.
Who teaches their competition?

615
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,590
I already taught you a lot last time.

616
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,700
But you need to continue teaching.

617
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,090
One time isn't enough. Please, Kluer,

618
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:52,480
Please, please.

619
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,200
Please, you're my only hope, please.

620
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,160
Fine,

621
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,280
but just this once, okay?

622
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,420
Deal!

623
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,230
Thank you!

624
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:17,950
I'll be right back.

625
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,290
Why are you calling now?

626
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,310
Just a quick call to check on things.

627
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,680
Isn't the competition coming up again this week?

628
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:33,400
How prepared are you?

629
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,460
I won't let you down.

630
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,700
But next time, don't call when I'm at the restaurant.

631
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,830
-It'll cause problems.
-What are you doing?

632
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,970
I asked what you are doing?

633
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,230
Chef Oab.

634
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,770
How did you get up here?

635
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,800
Don't you know this floor is off-limits?

636
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,430
Wait a minute,

637
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,300
I was just talking to my father.

638
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,350
I didn't want to disturb Kluer by talking in our room.

639
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,850
And Kluer didn't tell you the important rule that this floor is off-limits?

640
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:13,500
The third floor is off-limits. Only Chef Oab is allowed up there.

641
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I'm sorry.

642
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,360
I was in a hurry and didn't think.

643
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,090
Wait a minute.

644
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,400
Now that you're up here,

645
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,210
help me with something.

646
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:35,550
Help with what?

647
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:47,320
Can you help me with planting the seedlings?

648
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,020
Sure thing.

649
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:26,120
Why does Chef Oab, who is usually so strict,

650
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,360
have such a side like this?

651
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,470
Damn it.

652
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:33,420
So charming.

653
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,360
Do you do this every night, Chef?

654
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,520
Once a month.

655
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:47,020
The basil plants have a lifespan of about 30 days,
then they need to be replaced and replanted.

656
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,220
It takes about 20 days for them to grow to a usable size.

657
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,300
So, I have to plant them myself every month

658
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,390
to ensure a steady supply.

659
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,540
Why don't you just buy them?

660
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:58,700
It seems like it would be easier.

661
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,770
If I didn't run a basil-focused restaurant,

662
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,970
I wouldn't need to grow them myself.

663
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:16,840
Each basil leaf has a unique aroma and spiciness.

664
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:20,110
Wild basil has

665
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,800
a great scent but doesn't look as nice,

666
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,630
while market basil

667
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,000
looks good

668
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,290
but lacks fragrance.

669
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,740
I need leaves that suit the dishes we serve here,

670
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,490
so I have to grow them myself.

671
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:35,290
Oh, that's why

672
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:39,440
the basil at your restaurant
smells exactly like the one my mom used to grow.

673
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,470
She used to plant it herself too.

674
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,960
Her signature dish was basil beef.

675
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,680
I still remember how it tasted.

676
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:51,150
Sadly, I never learned to cook it myself.

677
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,380
I just enjoyed her cooking.

678
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,130
After she passed away,

679
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,320
I haven't had it since.

680
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,550
I've been wondering

681
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,120
where your obsession with basil came from.

682
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:10,070
It's probably because of that.

683
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:13,160
Your body has this fragrant basil scent.

684
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,460
Your basil aroma is unique and different from anywhere else.

685
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,750
It's a special scent that I can only get from here.

686
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,140
Basil leaves?

687
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:25,640
Yes,

688
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,390
it's the basil leaves or maybe the stir-fried basil?

689
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:46,870
I can't really say,

690
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:51,240
but I always smell a very fragrant basil scent from you.

691
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,560
Talking like this...

692
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,220
does it mean you want to 'taste' me

693
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:05,590
like you want to taste stir-fried basil?

694
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,260
The selection day is approaching.

695
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:07,160
Does anyone who has been serving want to try working in the kitchen?

696
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:09,910
I think working outside is best for everyone.

697
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,240
You’re really the type who doesn't think things through, huh?

698
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:14,360
Besides you, who can work with him?

699
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,380
But I’m warning you, if you get swayed, this won't end well.

700
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,250
What are you going to do to Metas? our clinic will be finished.

701
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:23,140
If he posts on social media,

702
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,450
Why are you here again?

703
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:26,570
Are you mad at me?

704
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,250
I don’t like things that are unclear.

705
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:29,420
I’ll ask you directly then.

706
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,140
About us on the rooftop... what do you really think, Chef?

707
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,400
Plawan came up with this idea.

708
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:38,300
Using a wooden cutting board painted black,

709
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:39,970
along with the crispy red pastry for the spring rolls.

710
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,680
Why are you so creative, Wan?

711
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:43,540
(Chef Oab seems suspicious...)

712
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:47,270
(Perfect!)
(Hugs Chef Oab tightly)

713
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,800
(Every take is perfect...)

714
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,360
What pose should I do?

715
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:05,570
(Shows off a bit)
Oh, how could we forget to distribute the treats?
