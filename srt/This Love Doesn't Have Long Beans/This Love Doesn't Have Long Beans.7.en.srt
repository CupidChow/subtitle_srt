1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,620
If you want to announce that you're courting someone younger, just do it.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,420
Why should you worry about Kao Suay over something that's already over?

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,320
The longer you let this drag on, won't it just give Kao Suay false hope?

4
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,020
You were supposed to show me

5
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,060
what being a genuinely good person looks like.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,940
Can you help me take off my pants?

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,840
Oops.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,590
I'm very disappointed.

9
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,350
I thought your skills would have improved by now.

10
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,880
It's clear you didn't put in the effort.

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,030
Kluer, it seems like you're the only one who really believes in me.

12
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,400
But I'm serious about confessing my feelings to Plawan.

13
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,020
It has to be today.

14
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,530
I shouldn’t be telling you this, Chef,
but... I thought it’s better to tell you

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,350
Kluer is going to confess his love to Plawan.

16
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,060
Plawan,

17
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,340
well,

18
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:04,709
I have something to tell you.

19
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,060
Kluer, Plawan.

20
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,770
Chef, how did you get here?

21
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,340
I was just passing by.

22
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,130
And why is Plawan like that?

23
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,900
He probably drank a bit too much.

24
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,620
Did you bring your car?

25
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,050
Then let’s meet at the restaurant. I’ll take Plawan back first.

26
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,990
Come down.

27
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,010
Plawan.

28
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,010
Plawan.

29
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,430
Plawan, wake up.

30
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,000
Get up slowly.

31
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,230
Mmm...

32
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:40,020
Are we there yet?

33
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,620
I know you're not really asleep.

34
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,750
Get down and walk on your own.

35
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,360
I’m heavy, you know.

36
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,250
Come down now.

37
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,970
My back is killing me.

38
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,570
Why did you have to pretend to be drunk?

39
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,200
I was actually drunk, but now I'm sober.

40
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,290
You said you’d take me back.
Why aren’t we getting in the car?

41
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,810
We are going back.

42
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,620
But I need to know what you said to Kluer first.

43
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,010
Why do you care?

44
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,730
Why wouldn’t I care?

45
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,360
I know how Kluer feels about you.

46
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,800
But what I really want to know is how you feel about Kluer.

47
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,480
Did you accept Kluer's love?

48
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,520
Whether I did or not, what does it have to do with you, Chef?

49
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,850
Don’t forget that we aren’t anything to each other.

50
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,770
Hey!

51
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,060
When I said my back hurt, I meant it.

52
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,540
Stay here and talk it out.

53
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,240
Fine.

54
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,280
Are you still upset about Kao Suay’s new menu?

55
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,740
Am I allowed to talk about that?

56
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,250
Of course you can.

57
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,720
Why wouldn’t you be able to?

58
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,990
Because ever since Kao Suay came back, you haven’t been the same, Chef.

59
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,640
It’s like you’re struggling but can’t quite get over it.

60
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,630
It’s like you’re trying to push Kao Suay out of your life,

61
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,670
But in the end, you just let him back in so easily.

62
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,400
It’s like Kao Suay is your weakness.

63
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,400
But I understand.

64
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,120
A wound that deep is hard to heal.

65
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,120
That’s why I don’t want to rush you, Chef.

66
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,510
Chef, do you know the term 'pain of joy'?

67
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,660
No, I don’t.

68
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,030
Why?

69
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,340
In sports science,

70
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,730
When you feel like you're in pain, like your muscles are tearing apart,

71
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,830
That’s it.

72
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,950
It’s building stronger muscles.

73
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,720
Is that how you feel, Chef?

74
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:23,220
If you feel that way,

75
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,550
Then I can wait for you with hope,

76
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,500
Just like you keep telling me to do.

77
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,910
But if you really can’t,

78
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,500
Then I’ll give up.

79
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:39,030
If you still can’t forget your ex,

80
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,240
I don’t know why I’m still here.

81
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,170
I really am hurting just like you said.

82
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,170
But ever since you came into my life,

83
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,740
I can really feel.

84
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,950
Things are gradually getting better.

85
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:16,740
I might not get over it anytime soon,

86
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,340
But if I can be with you,

87
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,350
I know I’ll definitely heal.

88
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,310
Will you be with me, Plawan?

89
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,420
Yes, Chef.

90
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,320
Up until now, you still haven’t told me what you said to Kluer.

91
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,510
Is it that important?

92
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,020
I want to know.

93
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:13,040
I didn’t say anything.

94
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,830
Really?

95
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,620
Really.

96
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,810
Plawan.

97
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,320
well,

98
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,930
I have something to tell you.

99
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,600
Sorry, Kluer. My hands were wet.

100
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,320
It's okay.

101
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,240
I didn’t say anything, did I?

102
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,230
Plawan.

103
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,230
Huh?

104
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,050
It's just that...

105
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,870
It's just that I...

106
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,440
I have a terrible headache, Kluer.

107
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:15,530
Ugh, I think I'm drunk.

108
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,400
Did you pretend to be asleep the whole time?

109
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,830
Well, I didn’t know what else to do.

110
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,340
Being on a carousel like that, I couldn’t escape.

111
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,730
Besides, I didn’t want to reject Kluer outright.

112
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,870
I was afraid Kluer would be hurt.

113
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,180
You know Kluer well, Chef.

114
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,340
Do you think Kluer will be really hurt?

115
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,610
It can’t be helped.

116
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,060
But I think someone as strong as Kluer will definitely get through this.

117
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,430
Ugh, my head hurts, Kluer.

118
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,830
Anyway, you couldn’t accept Kluer’s love.

119
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,720
Because you have me.

120
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,920
Aren't you changing too quickly, Chef?

121
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,440
I can’t keep up.

122
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,460
So what?

123
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,450
Are you going to pretend to sleep again tonight?

124
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,670
That depends...

125
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,070
on what you want, Chef.

126
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,230
Do you want me to sleep or not?

127
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,800
Wait, wait.

128
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:27,840
Wait, wait.

129
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,630
What are you doing?

130
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,520
What do you think? I want to bite you too.

131
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,620
-Last night wasn’t enough?
-Not enough at all.

132
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,640
Enough already.

133
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,270
Why are you up? It’s a day off. How about sleeping in a bit more?

134
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,340
No, thank you.

135
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,840
Because someone around here has been making me wake up early for months.

136
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,330
Now I’m used to it.

137
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,660
Want to have breakfast? I can show off my cooking skills.

138
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,150
No, thanks.

139
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:58,650
Why not, Chef? Don’t you trust my skills?

140
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,320
Not really. I’ll eat anything you make.

141
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,250
Really?

142
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,490
Not really.

143
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:08,510
Oh, come on, I’m joking.

144
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,070
But today I’m visiting my master at the hospital.

145
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:14,140
I won’t be able to stay for breakfast with you.

146
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,370
Are you going to talk to Kao Suay?

147
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,790
I told you, I want to end this for real.

148
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,540
Come back soon, okay?

149
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,820
-I’m going now.
-Then go.

150
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,040
Then let go.

151
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:38,180
-I’m letting go.
-Why don’t you come with me?

152
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,420
Kao Suay.

153
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,650
Have you had breakfast? I bought some for you.

154
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,140
This is a sandwich from your favorite place!

155
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,120
I’m so happy!

156
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,550
That you still remember it, Chef Oab.

157
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,940
Shall we find a place to sit and eat?

158
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,330
I have something I want to talk to you about.

159
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,600
-Kao Suay...
-Kao Suay knows what you're going to say.

160
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:50,050
But Kao Suay doesn’t want to hear it.

161
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,150
I’m always ready to support you, Kao Suay.

162
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:58,120
But as a brother, not as a lover.

163
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,120
In the past, I might have been unsure or hesitant.

164
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,400
I’m sorry for that.

165
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,030
But now I’m certain

166
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,450
That I want to start anew with someone.

167
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,640
And that person

168
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,300
Is Plawan, right?

169
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,540
You’re so clear about it.

170
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,020
If back then, when I broke up with you before leaving to study,

171
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,110
If you had been sure and wanted to keep me in Thailand,

172
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,340
I wouldn’t have gone.

173
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,800
I might have seen you as someone to take care of,

174
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,500
Like family, from the beginning.

175
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:41,770
But my feelings for Plawan are different.

176
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:47,430
I think about Plawan more deeply than I think about you.

177
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,400
I’m distressed when he’s sad.

178
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,820
I’m anxious when he’s not around.

179
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,850
If I think about being apart for several days, I can’t sit still.

180
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,630
You saying this to me,

181
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,710
It hurts, you know.

182
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,599
I’m being this direct with you

183
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,800
So that neither of us wastes any more time.

184
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,440
I still think of you as a little sister.

185
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,150
And I want you to see me as just a brother.

186
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,040
I’m sorry.

187
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,720
I don’t blame you, Chef Oab.

188
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:42,620
I was wrong from the beginning.

189
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,860
Thank you so much, Chef Oab,

190
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,030
For being honest so I can move on.

191
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:22,960
Can you help support me?

192
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,460
My leg hurts today.

193
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,620
You need to learn to rely on yourself, Metas.

194
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,430
I can’t help you for the rest of your life. Push through it.

195
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,340
Come on.

196
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,730
Why are you so strict today? You’re not as kind as you used to be.

197
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,710
I’m still kind to you, as your physical therapist.

198
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,470
But I don’t want to just be a therapist to you.

199
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,630
We went to the movies together, remember?

200
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:54,220
I want to be in the same status as Plawan.

201
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,630
No,

202
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,210
I want to be in a different status.

203
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,030
Whatever status you want to be in, I don’t care.

204
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,340
I don’t like joking around during work.

205
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,910
Today, let’s try some light squats first.

206
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,620
So your muscles can start getting stronger again.

207
00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:21,300
Come on.

208
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,030
Walk properly.

209
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,200
That’s enough.

210
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:37,530
Spread your legs slightly wider than your shoulders,

211
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:38,950
then slowly squat down.

212
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,120
You’re good at giving orders.

213
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,930
Are you this bossy with Plawan too?

214
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,050
That’s my business.

215
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,600
Hurry up and do it.

216
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,750
If you don’t, I’m leaving.

217
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:53,530
Fine, I’ll do it.

218
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,530
Just squat halfway, that’s enough.

219
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,240
Make it a Mini Squat.

220
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,500
Come on.

221
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:08,540
Is this okay?

222
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,630
One more time.

223
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,850
One more time.

224
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,510
You’re suddenly distant.

225
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:46,670
Ouch, hey!

226
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,430
Are you okay? Sit down.

227
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:51,650
What’s wrong?

228
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,730
My butt, I’ve got a cramp.

229
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,050
-Here?
-Yes.

230
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,130
Then lie down.

231
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,230
Come here.

232
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,550
Ouch, be careful, it hurts.

233
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,120
Be gentle.

234
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,240
-Does it feel tight?
-Very tight.

235
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,120
Slowly.

236
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,330
-Does it still hurt?
-Yes, it does.

237
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,950
Be more gentle.

238
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,720
I won’t do physical therapy for you anymore
if you keep joking around with me like this.

239
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:30,510
I’m not joking with you.

240
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,920
I just don’t know why you’re so upset today.

241
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,120
You’re not yourself.

242
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:37,660
Is something wrong?

243
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:40,510
Nothing’s wrong.

244
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:42,130
It’s good that you’re better.

245
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,850
In that case, I’ll leave early today. I’m not feeling well.

246
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,810
Wait a minute.

247
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,710
Let’s talk this out.

248
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,630
Are you feeling unwell?

249
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,510
Should I get you some medicine?

250
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:58,230
You feel hot too.

251
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:00,620
You...

252
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,140
You’re sick again.

253
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,800
You don’t have to worry about me.

254
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,590
But I do care about you.

255
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,030
JJ.

256
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,220
I’ll head back first.

257
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:32,660
Wait a minute.

258
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,050
JJ.

259
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,190
JJ.

260
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,750
JJ.

261
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,130
Kluer, good luck with your competition today.

262
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,850
Thanks.

263
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,560
You’ve made it this far, so I think you all know what to do.

264
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,330
I’ll remind you, the challenge is Just Basil.

265
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,740
I’m judging primarily on creativity.

266
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,830
If you’re ready,

267
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,350
Begin!

268
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,840
Yes, Chef!

269
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,530
Ten minutes remaining.

270
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,860
Two minutes remaining.

271
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,850
Ten seconds remaining.

272
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,060
Nine

273
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,290
Eight

274
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,500
Seven

275
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,830
Six

276
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:29,530
Five

277
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,010
Four

278
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,480
Three

279
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,810
Two

280
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:34,990
One

281
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,440
Time’s up!

282
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:37,650
Everyone, hands off!

283
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:51,000
This dish is stir-fried basil with 'Four Lotuses.'

284
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,390
Each lotus represents a bite of the dish.

285
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,610
The difference between these four bites is the level of spiciness.

286
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,840
The spiciness gradually increases from mild to hot.

287
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,720
The first lotus has the mildest level of spiciness,

288
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,620
While the fourth lotus is the spiciest.

289
00:27:13,810 --> 00:27:15,640
And what’s the highlight of this dish?

290
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,050
I recommend this bite,

291
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,650
'Lotus Under the Mud.'

292
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,050
It’s the mildest.

293
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,940
On the outside, it seems the least interesting,

294
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:30,990
Which I think suits someone as foolish and simple as me, Chef.

295
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,350
Stir-fried basil with scallops.

296
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:07,230
Like a precious pearl hidden within a shell,

297
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,660
I stir-fried the scallops with basil,

298
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:13,380
And crafted a shell-shaped crust, baking it thin

299
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,710
So it wouldn’t overpower the basil aroma.

300
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,500
The center features the scallops.

301
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,140
I’ve never doubted your plating skills.

302
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,840
But it seems you’ve focused too much on appearance

303
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,210
And forgotten that the most important
aspect of running a restaurant is cleanliness.

304
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,320
There’s grit from the shell in this dish.

305
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,900
I think you’ve prioritized the wrong thing.

306
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:06,730
I’m sorry, Chef.

307
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,240
Next dish, please present.

308
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,650
Chef, have you ever wanted to have magic?

309
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:26,010
I’m going to take both chefs on a journey to a magical land.

310
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,380
Hocus pocus, hocus pocus, hocus pocus!

311
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:32,080
Hocus pocus, hocus pocus, hocus pocus!

312
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:34,760
Hocus pocus, hocus pocus, hocus pocus!

313
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,640
Presto!

314
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,310
Isn’t it cute?

315
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:21,090
It looks like an ordinary harmless steamed bun.

316
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,930
But the magic is inside,

317
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,320
Making it feel like we have real magic.

318
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,650
Enjoy!

319
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,750
What’s the filling?

320
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,030
Mala Basil Sauce?

321
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,630
That’s cool.

322
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,450
It still has the aroma of basil.

323
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:06,210
The sauce, the spiciness, and the thickness are stronger than usual.

324
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,400
The steamed bun does a good job
of absorbing the sauce and balancing the flavors.

325
00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:10,530
Not bad, Chef Oab.

326
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:15,610
It’s just stir-fried basil with mala sauce.

327
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,620
Usually, Chef Oab only takes one bite.

328
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:21,530
But this time, you took two bites.

329
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,520
It’s tasty, right?

330
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,210
It’s good.

331
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,600
Tastes great.

332
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,640
You’ve improved.

333
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,600
The results are in.

334
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,740
Chef Nab Nueng and I are in agreement.

335
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,330
And the person who must leave the competition today

336
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,920
Is Pun Sib.

337
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,930
I understand, Chef.

338
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,000
I was too focused on the presentation and missed something so simple.

339
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:19,430
A chef must never overlook the details of cleanliness.

340
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,550
But it’s okay.

341
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:29,720
You’re still young and talented.

342
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,520
The more you practice, the better you’ll get.

343
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,550
Are you really complimenting me, Chef?

344
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:39,720
Do I really have the potential to get even better, Chef?

345
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,820
You just lack experience.

346
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,150
I believe in you, Pun Sib.

347
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,530
Even if you didn’t win this restaurant,

348
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,120
I’m sure one day you’ll have your own restaurant.

349
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,410
Thank you, Chef.

350
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,830
Pun Sib is actually better than me.

351
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,400
He should’ve made it. It shouldn’t have been me.

352
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,630
I didn’t expect it to turn out this way.

353
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,630
You’ve got something special,

354
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:27,900
Or Chef Oab wouldn’t have let you through.

355
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,410
Unless he passed you for another reason.

356
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:42,470
I’m asking seriously.

357
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,830
What’s your relationship with Chef Oab?

358
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,150
I need to step outside.

359
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,060
You knew what I was going to say that day, right?

360
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:03,440
I like you, Plawan.

361
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,630
I like you as more than a friend.

362
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,639
Not just as a friend.

363
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,659
I mean...

364
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:13,909
I’m ready, Plawan. I’m ready to take it slow and develop our relationship.

365
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:18,820
If I’m right for you, you can take your time before agreeing to be with me.

366
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,340
Because right now,

367
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,630
You’re the one for me.

368
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,780
I’m sorry, Kluer.

369
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:48,850
I’ve already agreed to be with Chef Oab.

370
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,570
But it won’t affect the competition,

371
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:03,650
I swear.

372
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,420
Alright, cheers!

373
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,720
Wow, Chef Oab.

374
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:06,420
It seems like everything’s going well for you lately.

375
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,990
In matters of the heart,

376
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,250
And with the restaurant.

377
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,000
Or maybe your heart and the restaurant

378
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:15,730
Are becoming one and the same.

379
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:20,530
You’re drunk and talking too much.

380
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,800
Come on, Chef.

381
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,140
What did I say wrong?

382
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,930
I know you’ve already cleared things up with Kao Suay.

383
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,520
Yeah.

384
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:32,320
Chef Oab.

385
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,430
But there’s something that’s bothering me.

386
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,510
When Kluer talked about the 'Lotus Under the Mud,'

387
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,600
Was he referring to himself or to you?

388
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,550
Honestly,

389
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,070
I’ve never seen Kluer stand up to you before.

390
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,350
Did he take the wrong medicine?

391
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,720
No, he didn’t.

392
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:53,640
He probably hates me by now.

393
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,230
Come on, Chef.

394
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,620
Kluer is one of your closest staff.

395
00:36:58,890 --> 00:36:59,990
I don’t think so.

396
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,830
If you two have any issues,

397
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:05,130
I think you should clear them up to avoid any further tension.

398
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:08,620
If he’s willing to talk to me.

399
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,650
Are you really dating Chef Oab now?

400
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,730
Plawan,

401
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:40,340
What are you thinking?

402
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,360
Won’t this make things more complicated?

403
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,400
JJ, calm down.

404
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,330
Hear me out first.

405
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,620
I’ve got a solution for all of this.

406
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,970
What’s your solution?

407
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,880
The reason I decided to be with Chef Oab

408
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:57,150
Is because someone with my mediocre skills has no chance of winning.

409
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,940
I’m just here to support him.

410
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:02,830
So what?

411
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,530
How does that benefit you?

412
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,800
You won’t get any money that way.

413
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,100
It’s fine.

414
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,210
Between money and love,

415
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,620
I choose love.

416
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,110
Listen to me.

417
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,600
If I lose,

418
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,640
Whether I date Chef Oab or not,

419
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,260
I still have to pay back Mr. Metas.

420
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:23,450
So I plan to apply for a bank loan to pay him off instead.

421
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:29,410
It’s true that if you lose, you’ll have to repay Mr. Metas.

422
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:30,510
Right?

423
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:35,220
That’s why I decided to follow my heart.

424
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:39,110
But have you confessed to Chef Oab yet

425
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:41,450
that you’ve been a mole for Mr. Metas?

426
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,540
Have you actually said it out loud?

427
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,930
And has Chef Oab forgiven you?

428
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,920
It’s a good thing I was washing dishes, so my hands were busy.

429
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:04,710
Why?

430
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:05,860
What would you have done?

431
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:10,700
If you keep this up, I might accidentally stab you with a knife.

432
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,500
That’s too much.

433
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,550
So what’s going on? Why are you down here washing dishes alone?

434
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,410
Well...

435
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,730
I’m stressed.

436
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:25,650
Sitting still makes me overthink, so I thought I’d do something.

437
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,300
Are you stressed about the competition or something else?

438
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:34,030
About Kluer.

439
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:36,840
We talked openly,

440
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:39,010
But I don’t know if Kluer is okay.

441
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,850
I’m afraid I’ve hurt him.

442
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:44,930
Of course he’s hurt.

443
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,440
Otherwise, he wouldn’t have lashed out at me like that today.

444
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,540
Even though Kluer has always been good to me,

445
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,650
Better to me than you, Chef.

446
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:02,390
-Wow, talking like that?
-Chef, let go, it hurts!

447
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,620
You just didn’t have a choice.

448
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,720
You only have one choice, and that’s me.

449
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,320
So here’s the deal.

450
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,530
I’ll make a new dish for you.

451
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:18,810
Consider it a comfort dish. How about that?

452
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,750
What dish?

453
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:51,600
Croquettes stuffed with stir-fried basil.

454
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:54,240
This dish is just for you,

455
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,150
and I guarantee you’ll love it.

456
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,430
Haven’t heard that phrase in a while.

457
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,330
It’s so old-fashioned.

458
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,790
Worth preserving, don’t you think?

459
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,720
Better for something else—

460
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,110
Like eating.

461
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:14,950
Let’s stick to eating croquettes.

462
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,580
It’s delicious, Chef.

463
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,360
This kind of croquette must be hard to make.

464
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,870
Can you teach me how to make it?

465
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,720
I can teach you.

466
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,930
But when I do,

467
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,970
Don’t cry, okay?

468
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:55,440
I never cry when you’re teaching me.

469
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:57,520
Are you sure?

470
00:41:57,870 --> 00:41:59,240
I’m sure.

471
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:32,140
I’ll hold the final competition tomorrow.

472
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,950
The challenge for the final round is...

473
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,630
No challenge.

474
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:45,640
You can make any type of stir-fried basil dish you want.

475
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,020
But it must be delicious.

476
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,850
I’ll be judging based on taste.

477
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:51,930
And the winner

478
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,040
Will be the heir to this restaurant.

479
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,580
In that case, I won’t win the restaurant.

480
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,010
You can congratulate Kluer now, Chef.

481
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,680
There are only three of us left, and we can’t handle customers alone.

482
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,210
So I’ll close the restaurant for now.

483
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:22,080
You’ll have time to prepare.

484
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:23,360
Yes, Chef.

485
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,860
The restaurant is closed today, sir.

486
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:57,330
Mr. Metas, what are you doing here?

487
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:59,250
Who allowed you into my restaurant?

488
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:02,770
Is this how the owner greets customers?

489
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:04,490
How rude.

490
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,940
I reserve my manners for those who deserve them.

491
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:09,780
Someone like you doesn’t.

492
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,240
Now get out of my restaurant.

493
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,950
What a pity.

494
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:17,320
The restaurant’s about to close, and I haven’t even tasted your cooking.

495
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:20,630
Soon, you’ll become...

496
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,710
A legend,

497
00:45:24,290 --> 00:45:25,950
Just like your master, right?

498
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:29,540
Calm down, Chef. Calm down.

499
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,660
Get out of my restaurant before I throw you out.

500
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,400
Get out!

501
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,430
Calm down, Chef.

502
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:38,850
Calm down, Chef Oab.

503
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:04,960
JJ, answer the phone!

504
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:06,230
What’s up, Plawan?

505
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,700
JJ, your Mr. Metas is at Chef Oab’s restaurant doing who knows what.

506
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,710
What?

507
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,690
What’s he doing? Did he expose you?

508
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,120
I don’t know.

509
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,930
But Mr. Metas seems really confident that he’ll get this property.

510
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:22,750
I don’t know where he gets the idea that I’ll win.

511
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,110
Chef Oab is super angry right now.

512
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,500
What’s with these rich people? Why are they always looking for trouble?

513
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:32,220
Why can’t they just stay out of it?

514
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:33,620
And you, too—

515
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:35,010
What are you afraid of now?

516
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,010
How many times have I warned you?
Why didn’t you listen?

517
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:38,020
Damn it!

518
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,130
Hello, JJ!

519
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,750
Hello, JJ!

520
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:47,360
Damn it, you’re no help at all.

521
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:12,750
You managed to come to the clinic on your own?

522
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:15,450
Since I’m visiting a friend,

523
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:19,310
It’s not unusual to check on business myself.

524
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:27,780
You can’t escape me, you know.

525
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:56,330
Ever since you started getting better,
you haven’t stopped walking on your own.

526
00:47:57,790 --> 00:48:00,090
So you wouldn’t have to make the trip to see me.

527
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,850
Is your dedication to physical therapy

528
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,350
Because you want to walk to see me,
or to stir up trouble with Chef Oab at the restaurant?

529
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,750
Your friend brings news quickly, doesn’t he?

530
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:22,940
I’m not trying to interfere with your multi-million dollar business,

531
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:24,710
But I want to tell you

532
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,210
That people can live together, you know.

533
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,810
We don’t have to be enemies with everyone.

534
00:48:29,890 --> 00:48:31,530
Like you and me, right?

535
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:39,320
What is it?

536
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:41,220
We’re going to the movies.

537
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:45,130
A new horror movie just came out today: The Revengeful Spirit.

538
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:46,510
Don’t you want to see it?

539
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,630
Hey, you!

540
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:52,420
Don’t tell me you’ve rented out the whole theater again.

541
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:53,840
I didn’t rent it out.

542
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,740
I just bought up a few showtimes.

543
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,920
No matter what time you finish work,

544
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:59,610
I can take you to any showtime.

545
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,930
I’m not going.

546
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,550
Come on, please.

547
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,780
Or how about tomorrow? I can book a showtime for you then too.

548
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,490
Let’s go together.

549
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,440
I know you have money,

550
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:15,120
But let me ask you honestly:

551
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:19,730
Are you just lonely, trying to flirt with me,
or are you just trying to win over me?

552
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,970
If you’re trying to win, let me tell you, I’m not competing.

553
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,320
You can play your games alone.

554
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,770
I’m having another physical therapist take care of you today.

555
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,950
Wait a minute, JJ.

556
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,250
Isn’t it clear enough by now that I’m trying to court you?

557
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,940
I’m sincere about you.

558
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:38,140
What else do you need me to prove?

559
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:43,150
Then try canceling the condo project
you’re planning on Chef Oab’s property.

560
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:45,640
Are you brave enough to do that?

561
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:54,120
If you can do that, I’ll seriously consider
getting into a real relationship with you.

562
00:50:44,130 --> 00:50:44,800
Kluer,

563
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,610
What are you doing here?

564
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:04,640
I've decided that tomorrow I’ll purposely lose the competition.

565
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:06,570
I’ll find a way to pay back Mr. Metas myself.

566
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,180
It’s the final round already? Time flies.

567
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,130
Aren’t you happy?

568
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:43,440
Am I the only one who’s excited?

569
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:50,710
Of course, I’m happy.

570
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:53,840
It’ll finally be over.

571
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:09,330
Hello, Chef.

572
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:12,320
Is Chef Nab Nueng not joining us today?

573
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,120
It’s just you two today.

574
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,240
I’ll be the only one tasting.

575
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,340
It’s the final round.

576
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:22,850
Shall we start?

577
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:26,330
The winner will be the successor of this restaurant.

578
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,540
If you’ve got something good,

579
00:52:29,050 --> 00:52:30,370
Show it all.

580
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:35,430
Let’s begin.

581
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:36,620
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

582
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,410
I’ve got something to show you.

583
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,450
What is it?

584
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:22,920
I don’t know either.

585
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:25,710
But Mr. Metas seems really confident that he’ll get this property.

586
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:28,490
I don’t know where he gets the idea that I’ll win.

587
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,840
Chef Oab is super angry right now.

588
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,600
Even though I’m upset about Chef and Plawan,

589
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:44,130
I still love this restaurant.

590
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:48,520
I hope you’ll do everything right, Chef.

591
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:02,860
I’m sorry, Kluer.

592
00:54:04,490 --> 00:54:06,250
I’ve already agreed to be with Chef Oab.

593
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,750
But it won’t affect the competition,

594
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:19,870
I swear.

595
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:27,760
Stir-fried basil mixed with minced pork.

596
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,810
Stir-fried basil with long beans.

597
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,730
How do you get the kids to not overthink?

598
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:12,260
And what would you like them to do?

599
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:17,320
You don’t need to lie or do anything anymore.

600
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:19,450
Plawan, you’ve already won.

601
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:22,720
It was my mistake to deal with Mr. Metas.

602
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:25,530
But I don’t ask for much, just for Chef Oab to get in touch.

603
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:29,470
I’m really disappointed in you for valuing money more than people.

604
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,210
If I hadn’t gone back to study, I might have become a chef in France.

605
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:35,040
Once you make a decision, there’s no turning back.

606
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,980
I’ve decided that I want to open a restaurant like Chef Oab’s.

607
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,300
I plan to use the money I get from Mr. Metas

608
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:41,950
To open another stir-fried basil restaurant.

609
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,330
(Countdown to the return of 'This Restaurant Has No Long Beans')

610
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:44,940
Chef, I’m sorry.

611
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,890
(No matter how many takes, uncle keeps going.)

612
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:49,830
-Cut!
-Okay.

613
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,140
Today was all about running and carrying.
No other lines, just running and carrying.

614
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,400
-Cut!
-Cut!

615
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,500
(Embarrassed, huh?)

616
00:56:01,550 --> 00:56:02,620
(Trying to look too serious)
Get out of my restaurant.

617
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,990
Get out of my restaurant now!

618
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:05,620
(That’s off-script)

619
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,690
(Riding the Olympic wave)

620
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:13,510
Okay.

621
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:14,500
That’s enough.

622
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:15,300
Just playing around.

623
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:17,650
A kid’s toy.

624
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:19,220
Grown-ups don’t play with this.

625
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,650
You were just playing with me a moment ago.
