1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:04,470
Are you getting any better at cooking?

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:06,590
You need to hurry up and improve your skills.

3
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:08,210
Kluer?

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,420
Plawan, please don't tell Chef about this.

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:13,270
But I can't help cover for you for free.

6
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,220
What do you want, then?

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,810
Teach me how to cook.

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,970
I'll get another chance to cook?

9
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:21,650
You think one night of practice will make you a master?

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,010
Hey, you!

11
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,460
What's up? Feeling humbled now?

12
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,360
If you're going to keep annoying me like this, you can leave

13
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,730
Talking like this.

14
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,600
Are you saying you want to eat me just like you want to eat basil stir-fry?

15
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,620
This granita is delicious!

16
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:22,980
Chef Oab, can you add it to the restaurant menu?

17
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,440
Kao Suay thinks it will sell really well.

18
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,540
No!

19
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:29,710
I will make this dish only for you, Kao Suay.

20
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,110
I'm not a pastry chef,

21
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,160
but I'll make desserts only for my special person.

22
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,230
Understand?

23
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,380
Chef Oab, you are the sweetest!

24
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,530
Oh my god, what's happening?

25
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,390
Think, think, think!

26
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,840
Why are you whining?

27
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,680
It's called a K, I, SS.

28
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,780
Just a kiss, man, a kiss.

29
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,380
Chef Oab was about to kiss you but changed his mind at the last second.

30
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,090
Act like you've been kissed before!

31
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,560
Why would he want to kiss me?

32
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,800
Is he feeling something for me?

33
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,010
How would I know?

34
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,120
But if it got to the point of almost kissing,
there must be some feelings involved.

35
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,300
Maybe he was just teasing me.

36
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,200
Whether Chef Oab has feelings for you or not, I don't know.

37
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,120
But you, Wan, you're definitely feeling something.

38
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,940
Are you developing feelings for Chef Oab?

39
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:44,920
How?

40
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,920
I'm not.

41
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,120
I'm just confused, that's all.

42
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:52,040
I don't want to be played with.

43
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,720
This is crazy.

44
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,159
I don't have feelings for that chef at all.

45
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,450
But if he does have feelings for you, wouldn't that be a good thing?

46
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,980
If Chef Oab likes you, you could benefit from it.

47
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:05,800
Because it would make it easier for you
to fulfill the agreement with that Metas guy.

48
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,920
But I’m warning you, if you get swayed, this won't end well.

49
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,270
The rule of the restaurant is no returning later than 10 PM.

50
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,190
Aren't you afraid of getting points deducted?

51
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,150
Chef, do whatever you want.

52
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,390
Are you mad at me?

53
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:43,240
No,

54
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,920
I'm just annoyed.

55
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,950
I don't like unclear things.

56
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:51,220
Let me ask you directly,

57
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,120
What do you think about what happened between us on the rooftop, Chef?

58
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,120
Just think nothing happened.

59
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,870
Alright.

60
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,810
Agreed then, nothing happened.

61
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,440
I hope you'll stick to what you said, Chef.

62
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,280
How was your night?

63
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,310
Did you sleep well?

64
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,480
Yes, I did.

65
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:43,950
That's good.

66
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,090
Good morning, Chef.

67
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,970
Everyone's here, right?

68
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,380
Let's get to work.

69
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,250
Go!

70
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,090
Yes, Chef.

71
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,770
The selection day is approaching.

72
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,200
Let me remind you again,

73
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,240
everything that happens in this kitchen will be counted as points.

74
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,600
Does anyone want to try a different station today?

75
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,290
I'd like to be at the stir-fry station.

76
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,950
I'm most confident with this station.

77
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,730
I'd like to be at the frying station.

78
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,350
I want to try frying again.

79
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,360
Should I volunteer for serving, Chef?

80
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,600
Maybe Plawan can try working in the kitchen.

81
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,310
So, what do you think?

82
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,260
Anyone who has been serving,

83
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,310
do you want to try working in the kitchen?

84
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,400
I do want to,

85
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,080
but on second thought, maybe not.

86
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,950
I think working outside is best for everyone.

87
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,200
Auto, you'll be at the stir-fry station.

88
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,840
Pun Sib, you're at the frying station.

89
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,840
Kluer, you're on dishwashing duty.

90
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,150
Today's tasks are divided like this. Let's get to work.

91
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,240
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

92
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,940
Plawan, is something wrong?

93
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,650
You've been tense with Chef.

94
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,930
Is it because Chef caught you coming back late last night?

95
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:39,490
I saw you didn't come back to your room until midnight.

96
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,620
No, it's something else.

97
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,820
Oh...

98
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,220
if there's nothing, then it's fine.

99
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:48,010
Even if Chef has a sharp tongue sometimes, just bear with it.

100
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,510
Chef doesn't really mean it like that.

101
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,500
Chef Oab does things without thinking, right?

102
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,400
Besides you, who else can stay with Chef?

103
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,640
Why wouldn't there be?

104
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:02,090
Despite his personality,

105
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,650
Chef Oab is really popular.

106
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,510
He even had a serious girlfriend before.

107
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,230
What? Really?

108
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,370
Chef Oab's ex-girlfriend is named Kao Suay.

109
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,290
They were together for a long time

110
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,370
and were almost about to get married.

111
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,440
But then, out of nowhere, Kao Suay

112
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:26,970
decided to study abroad

113
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,400
and disappeared from this restaurant completely.

114
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,380
Chef Oab lost his passion

115
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,130
and decided to hand over the restaurant to someone else.

116
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,620
They must have really loved each other.

117
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,480
Just look at the decorations in this restaurant.

118
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,380
Kao Suay helped Chef Oab decorate.

119
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,340
If he had moved on,

120
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:51,910
he would have changed these decorations a long time ago.

121
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:54,100
But he can't move on,

122
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,640
so everything is still the same.

123
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,630
Because of that,

124
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:03,060
Chef Oab probably isn't thinking about having someone new anytime soon.

125
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,760
Right this way, please, dear customer.

126
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,650
Our restaurant offers a five-course menu.

127
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,040
Is there any food you are allergic to?

128
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,260
-No allergies.
-Great.

129
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,500
-Can I take a picture?
-Sure.

130
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,190
How about a selfie?

131
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,790
Can you take a picture for us?

132
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,950
Gladly.

133
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,980
Going all out, aren't you?

134
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,430
Chef, do you want to stir-fry the next dish yourself?

135
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,540
Chef?

136
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:53,640
Chef?

137
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,500
What is it?

138
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,110
The ingredients are ready.

139
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,400
Should I put them in the pan now?

140
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,720
No need, I'll handle it myself.

141
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,040
Chef seems a bit off today.

142
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,420
He never spaces out like this,

143
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,780
and it feels like he's ready to explode at any moment.

144
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,260
Auto, you better be careful being around him so much.

145
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,630
Don't you have anything to do?

146
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,940
If you're going somewhere, just go!

147
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,610
Annoying!

148
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,080
Chef, are you making the stir-fry basil sauce?

149
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,560
Yes, this is my special recipe sauce.

150
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,910
What's this technique called, Chef?
And what ingredients are used?

151
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,650
You start by stir-frying the chili and garlic until they're fragrant.

152
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,170
How long do you need to stir-fry the garlic, Chef?

153
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,750
If you're going to ask this many questions,

154
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:33,500
why don't you bring your phone and record a video next time?

155
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,340
Go prepare the ingredients for the next dish.

156
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,020
Now!

157
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,070
Yes, Chef.

158
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,890
-Plawan!
-Huh?

159
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:54,910
Are you coming to eat?

160
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:55,850
Sure.

161
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,120
What's on the menu today?

162
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,790
I've got fried pork and stir-fried vegetables. How does that sound?

163
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,720
Is it delicious?

164
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,210
Bring the rice, come on.

165
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,190
Chef Oab!

166
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,510
Join us for a meal. I'll get you some rice.

167
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,390
Hmm, okay.

168
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,620
Come on,

169
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,180
join us.

170
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,310
Hey, Plawan.

171
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,650
Where are you going?

172
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,960
I'm full.

173
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:33,300
I'll go prepare the ingredients for the next round.

174
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,070
Hey, wait, wait!

175
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,680
Kluer,

176
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:44,110
is your roommate going to be annoying like this all day?

177
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm seriously asking,

178
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:49,120
Chef Oab, did you do something to Plawan last night?

179
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,810
No, nothing.

180
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:54,850
If you didn't do anything,

181
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,440
then Plawan probably doesn't have a reason to be angry.

182
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,470
Maybe he's just irritated for some reason.

183
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,110
You don't have to worry about it, Chef.

184
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,170
Let's eat.

185
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,500
Come on, let's have our meal.

186
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:13,420
I'll take care of Plawan. Don't worry.

187
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,730
Why is he coming here?

188
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,890
Chef Oab...

189
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,710
I just ate one piece of pork.

190
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,370
I'm hungry.

191
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:38,890
Is there anything to eat?

192
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,830
No, I'm not hungry, not hungry.

193
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,550
Auto, let's go eat some food?

194
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:23,910
Auto!

195
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,140
Auto!

196
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,380
What are you doing? Are you writing something?

197
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,780
Why are you always so secretive?

198
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:39,670
Are you really that stressed about the big test?

199
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,880
I see you writing all the time

200
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:43,690
and looking so serious.

201
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,870
I'm just preparing like everyone else.

202
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,730
Are you making cooking videos or presentations?

203
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:49,810
Sure, I've made a lot.

204
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,200
Do you want to see?

205
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,720
Here, here.

206
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,330
These are some of the projects I've recorded as ideas.

207
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,390
I also found some pictures online.

208
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,620
Looking at these can give you new ideas.

209
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,490
Are you really showing your prep work to a competitor?

210
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:08,660
I don't see any problem with it.

211
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,280
I saw you were stressed and just wanted to help.

212
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,589
But I didn't ask for your help.

213
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,569
Can you stop keeping an eye on me?

214
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,819
Just sharing a room with others

215
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,400
is already making me feel uncomfortable enough.

216
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,540
The basket is here.

217
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,500
Put it there.

218
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,680
What's going on, P'Som?

219
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,350
What is it?

220
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,670
Why are you looking at me like that?

221
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,870
JJ!

222
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:57,570
What did you do to Mr. Metas, my Double VIP customer?

223
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,640
I haven't done anything yet.

224
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,590
By the way, who told you?

225
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,260
Was it that stingy Metas?

226
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,140
It was about Mr. Metas's secretary.

227
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,030
He contacted our clinic to complain.

228
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,370
He said the physical therapist we sent to take care of him the other day

229
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,650
didn't do a good job,

230
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,160
and now Mr. Metas's knee is dislocated.

231
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,760
How is that my fault?

232
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,040
I warned him, but your Mr. Metas was stubborn.

233
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:22,060
And that's not even mentioning
that I stayed to look after him during his knee surgery.

234
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,460
The physical therapist went above and beyond,
and he still has the nerve to complain about me?

235
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:26,550
Sister Som,

236
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,950
Have you ever seen me make a mistake at work?

237
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,440
I know you've always been meticulous.

238
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:35,080
But he's the one complaining, so what am I supposed to do?

239
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:36,870
Just ignore him, sister.

240
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,300
Let him be stubborn.
He'll stop on his own eventually.

241
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:40,690
Or is he going to sue me?

242
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,800
If he decides to sue, let him.

243
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,340
I have all the evidence to back up everything I've said.

244
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,790
You should also consider his reputation.

245
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:49,810
If he posts this on social media,

246
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,610
our clinic will be done for.

247
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,090
Even if we're not in the wrong,

248
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,760
once it's out there, it'll be hard to prove otherwise.

249
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,010
I think there's an easier way.

250
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,150
But you might have to bite the bullet a bit.

251
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,130
What do you mean, sister?

252
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:11,370
Sister Som, Sister Som.

253
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,020
This stuff is heavy.

254
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,760
(Dr. Akarawut Teerakitbunnakarn)
(Mr. Metas Siramongkolsawat)

255
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,130
Alright, let's do it.

256
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,770
Consider it for my future.

257
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:30,750
Let's go, JJ.

258
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,320
I already told you.

259
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,980
I'm not going to use any of those crutches or anything like that.

260
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,670
But if you don't do your physical therapy, your condition won't improve.

261
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,690
I said it already.

262
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,560
I'll pay whatever it takes,

263
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,210
but you have to help me recover
as quickly as possible without using those crutches.

264
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,100
You don't understand.

265
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,680
I have billions in business to manage.

266
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,820
If I could leave the hospital tomorrow, that would be even better.

267
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,030
But you just had surgery.

268
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,000
In that case, I'll change hospitals.

269
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,290
It would be better than wasting time with people like you.

270
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,170
Excuse me,

271
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,270
but can you please speak respectfully to others?

272
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,770
Just because you have a lot of money,

273
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,350
it doesn't mean you can belittle others.

274
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,810
You again?

275
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,760
Didn't I already send a complaint about you?

276
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,550
Why are you still here?

277
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,980
Actually, I came here to apologize to you.

278
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,840
But after seeing how you treat others,

279
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,520
I changed my mind.

280
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,660
And if you want to file a complaint about my work again.

281
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,990
Go ahead.

282
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,260
What... ouch!

283
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:44,190
You really shouldn't move around too much in your condition.

284
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,880
You should follow the doctor's advice

285
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,320
and rest.

286
00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:51,190
And stop worrying about managing your business for now.

287
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,550
Let me suggest something.

288
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,980
You should have someone to look after you.

289
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,260
If you didn't treat people so badly, maybe you would have someone around.

290
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,290
Damn it!

291
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,090
Um,

292
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,210
the food not to your liking?

293
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,020
I can order from your usual restaurant and have it delivered.

294
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:37,940
No need.

295
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,530
I'm not hungry.

296
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,190
Just make arrangements for my discharge tomorrow.

297
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:48,880
And the physical therapy plan the doctor recommended?

298
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,540
I have a place in mind already.

299
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,290
You can handle the arrangements.

300
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:56,790
Understood.

301
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,070
Let me suggest something.

302
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,270
You should have someone to look after you.

303
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,600
I'm hungry.

304
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,780
If you don't eat during the day, you might faint at night.

305
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,080
Normally, you wouldn't cook for me, Chef.

306
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,320
What capacity are you making food for me now?

307
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,970
As your boss, of course.

308
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,500
So, are you going to eat or not?

309
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,210
What's up with you,

310
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,940
inviting me for a beer all of a sudden?

311
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,730
Why? Can't I invite you anymore?

312
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,640
Huh, are you too proud now?

313
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,620
Come on, man.

314
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,640
Are you taking out your frustration with the restaurant on me?

315
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:20,320
If you're unhappy with any of the staff,

316
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,450
just call them out

317
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,030
and deal with it.

318
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,690
It's not that I'm unhappy.

319
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:27,570
It's just that there's this one person

320
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,670
who loves to argue back.

321
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,910
Now, I have to find a way to make up with them.

322
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,370
Do you have any cool ideas for that?

323
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,460
There are ways to do that,

324
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,880
but first, I need to ask,

325
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,170
in what capacity are you trying to make up with this person?

326
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:42,960
Huh?

327
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,460
A staff member in the restaurant?

328
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,920
Or someone you secretly like?

329
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,260
Oh boy, come here, Nab Nueng.

330
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,100
Come here.

331
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,890
You really haven't dropped that habit, have you?

332
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:52,890
What habit?

333
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,010
The habit of sticking your nose in and jumping to conclusions.

334
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,550
Then why are you complaining to me?

335
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,570
See?

336
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,750
You didn't deny it.

337
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:03,290
See? I'm not imagining things.

338
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,000
But a guy like you,

339
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,220
have you ever tried to make up with anyone?

340
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,100
When Kao Suay broke up with you

341
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,430
and you cried like a dog,

342
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,030
you didn't try to make up with her.

343
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,600
It's not the same at all, Nab Nueng.

344
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,490
But this is a good sign, Chef Oab.

345
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:21,210
It means you're starting to move on from Kao Suay.

346
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,030
If that's the case,

347
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,800
I would consider it a good thing.

348
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,640
But I have to tell you this.

349
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,350
If you still can't forget your past love,

350
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,080
then don't try to reconcile with them.

351
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,430
It might cause problems later on.

352
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:38,570
You need to be sure of yourself first.

353
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,890
Then...

354
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:45,110
if I’m sure of myself,

355
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,350
what should I do next?

356
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,400
Well, let's go!

357
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,980
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

358
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,900
And we go together.

359
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:57,950
Move forward and apologize,

360
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:01,040
move forward and court them, what are you waiting for?

361
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,740
Let's go,

362
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,410
let's go, let's go, let's go!

363
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,390
What song are you singing?

364
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,320
Bottoms up!

365
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,990
Bottoms up, cheers!

366
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,980
Aww yeah!

367
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,030
Yeah, that's it, go, go, go!

368
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,120
Hello?

369
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,130
Just a moment, please.

370
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,160
Go ahead!

371
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,340
Yes?

372
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,640
Damn it!

373
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:09,980
What's this technique called?

374
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:10,720
What do you use for it?

375
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,370
What are you doing, writing something down?

376
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,420
Did he write down everything?

377
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,330
Get in, get in, get in!

378
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,500
What happened, boss?

379
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:27,640
Don't tell me you got served with the lawsuit papers already.

380
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,170
What's going on, P' Som?

381
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:36,020
What's with you, JJ?

382
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:39,320
I just wanted to ask what you talked about with Mr. Metas yesterday.

383
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,620
Why did he immediately buy the special package?

384
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,960
It's fantastic!

385
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,210
Are you serious?

386
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,450
Of course, I am.

387
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,140
Well, congratulations on landing a big client.

388
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,270
Tell P' Ek, your star physiotherapist, to watch out.

389
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:59,070
That guy's mood swings are like someone going through menopause.

390
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:02,610
What? I haven't said a word about having Ek do it.

391
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,820
Oh, if not P' Ek, then who?

392
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,660
Because P' Ek has already taken care of Mr. Metas before.

393
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,380
Well, this time, Mr. Metas specifically chose you

394
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,490
What? Me?

395
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:17,290
-Huh.
-I'm not doing it.

396
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,630
No way, P' Som. Find someone else for this case.

397
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,260
I don't want to mess up your work.

398
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,040
Oh, come on.

399
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,170
No, I'm not doing it.

400
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,640
You work so well, how could you mess it up?

401
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,370
You're starting today.

402
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:33,170
Alright?

403
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,820
P' Som, P' Som!

404
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,140
(Mr. Metas Siramongkolsawat)

405
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,900
What kind of karma is this?

406
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,410
Chef, excuse me.

407
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:55,050
What is it?

408
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:56,370
Ah!

409
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,680
Well...

410
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,650
Nothing, Chef.

411
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,670
If there's nothing, then get ready.

412
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,960
The next round of the competition is about to start.

413
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,890
Yes, Chef.

414
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,920
Today is the first major test round.

415
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,350
I'll remind you of the rules again.

416
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,630
Today, one person will be eliminated.

417
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,620
If you don't want it to be you,

418
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,550
give it your best shot.

419
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:30,230
The challenge,

420
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,930
as I mentioned earlier,

421
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,880
is stir-fried basil with a perfectly round fried egg.

422
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,750
Everyone will receive one egg each.

423
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,150
If you mess up,

424
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,920
you're out of the competition

425
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,910
because there's no room for mistakes in this kitchen.

426
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,060
You have 15 minutes.

427
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:50,990
Ready...

428
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,950
Start!

429
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,210
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

430
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,520
Alright.

431
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,410
Stay focused.

432
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,780
You can do it.

433
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,060
Hey!

434
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,030
Oh no!

435
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
Hey...

436
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,860
Auto, help me out here, please.

437
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,210
Plawan

438
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,680
help me through this.

439
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,690
Pun Sib

440
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,220
I'll split the chicken eggs for you.

441
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,290
Huh?

442
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:11,310
I'll split the chicken eggs for you.

443
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,860
Plawan, what are you doing?

444
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,760
Are you crazy?

445
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,100
Come here, I'll help.

446
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,870
I'll handle it myself, I'll help.

447
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,100
This should be enough to make a fried egg.

448
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,420
Thank you, Plawan.

449
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,730
Thank you, Kluer.

450
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,590
He seems like a really nice guy,

451
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:58,430
just as you had your eye on him.

452
00:32:59,050 --> 00:32:59,880
Nab Nueng,

453
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,460
you're talking too much.

454
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,460
Time's up in 10 seconds.

455
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,360
Ten

456
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,720
Nine

457
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,080
Eight

458
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:35,490
Seven

459
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:36,930
Six

460
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,630
Five

461
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,130
Four

462
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:41,980
Three

463
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:43,460
Two

464
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,040
One

465
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,310
Time's up. Everyone, stop.

466
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,620
The flavor is spot on.

467
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,350
The seasoning penetrates the meat well.

468
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,040
The fried egg is done nicely.

469
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,500
I like the presentation of this dish.

470
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,110
It complements the braised pork basil well.

471
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,540
Thank you, Chef.

472
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,219
Auto, you did a good job stir-frying the meat.

473
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:33,050
There's a nice hint of wok hei.

474
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,530
The flavor is intense and rich.

475
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,860
Thank you, Chef.

476
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:37,389
This dish works well.

477
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:44,659
Pun Sib,

478
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,530
Your frying skills are impressive.

479
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,080
The only issue is that the fried egg is a bit small.

480
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,230
But I like your plating style.

481
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,150
It's aesthetically pleasing.

482
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:57,590
As for the egg, I think you handled it well.

483
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,860
Thank you, Chef.

484
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,810
Hey, aren't you going to comment?

485
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,840
No, it's done.

486
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,350
For me,

487
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,840
this dish is quite flavorful.

488
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,730
So, I'll make the announcement now.

489
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,500
The person who will be eliminated today is...

490
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,400
Auto.

491
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,030
Wait a minute, Chef!

492
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,930
My dish is the most perfect one here!

493
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,780
Both the basil stir-fry and the fried egg meet the criteria perfectly.

494
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,590
How can you make this decision, Chef?

495
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:02,530
When Pun Sib was struggling, what were you doing?

496
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,580
I was focusing on my own dish, Chef.

497
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,920
That's true,

498
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,430
but you must understand that in a kitchen, no one can work alone.

499
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,640
If one person makes a mistake, others must be ready to help immediately.

500
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,160
Otherwise, the restaurant won't survive.

501
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,750
I told you, I evaluate everything.

502
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,830
And another thing.

503
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:24,000
I won't let someone from Metas get through.

504
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:27,230
Someone from Metas?

505
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,000
How can you accuse me of that, Chef?

506
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,610
You’ve been sneaking out to make phone calls every night.

507
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,600
Did you think I wouldn’t notice?

508
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,110
I told you, everything that happens in this restaurant,

509
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,120
I know it all.

510
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,670
But you don’t have any evidence, Chef.

511
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,960
Then how do you explain this, Auto?

512
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,670
This isn't just exam preparation.

513
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,850
It looks like you're gathering some specific information.

514
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,200
Pun Sib, hand that over.

515
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,570
Hey, bro!

516
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,600
These are all the recipes from you restaurant,

517
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:15,590
including the cost prices

518
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:17,710
and supplier contacts.

519
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,640
Do you have anything to say for yourself?

520
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,270
I told you, I’m not really one of Metas’ people.

521
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,750
Then how do you expect me to believe you?

522
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,060
Well...

523
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,550
To be honest, my family runs a restaurant too,

524
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,480
but it’s a Chinese restaurant.

525
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,920
Our restaurant is about to go bankrupt,

526
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,530
so I had to find a way to save it.

527
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,290
Then I saw Chef’s announcement.

528
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:55,010
I thought if I could come here, learn, and note down Chef’s basil recipes,

529
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:57,430
I could use them to enhance my restaurant.

530
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,760
Maybe it would bring our customers back.

531
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,200
That’s all.

532
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,290
And what about coming out to make phone calls every night?

533
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,900
How do you explain that?

534
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,200
I was talking to my mom.

535
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:16,640
If Chef doesn't believe me, I can show you.

536
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,320
Auto.

537
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,420
Is something wrong, dear?

538
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:47,730
Why are you calling?

539
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,310
Don’t you have a test today?

540
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,730
How did it go?

541
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:53,570
Yeah.

542
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,300
I got eliminated, Mom.

543
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,290
I'm sorry.

544
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
That's okay, sweetheart.

545
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:04,940
It's just a loss.

546
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,500
Come back home to us.

547
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,550
Yes, Mom.

548
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
I'll come back soon.

549
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,590
Chef,

550
00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:26,330
Even though I might have had some hidden intentions,

551
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,200
I never had any ill will towards your restaurant.

552
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,940
I can assure you that I'm not Metas's man.

553
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,650
Besides,

554
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,390
I don't want your restaurant,

555
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,110
and I have no intention of taking it from you.

556
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,600
Auto.

557
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,730
Well, I...

558
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,390
I apologize for not believing in you.

559
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,320
It's alright.

560
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,390
I knew Pun Sib had noticed me for a long time.

561
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,360
But you didn't say anything, did you?

562
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,870
If Chef Oab hadn't brought it up,

563
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,800
you wouldn't have said anything, right?

564
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,840
Thank you very much.

565
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,830
And were you keeping to yourself

566
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,310
because you had to hide your true intentions?

567
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,820
No, I'm just like this by nature.

568
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,580
Anyway, thanks a lot for being a good roommate all along.

569
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,240
If you have some free time, I'll pop onto your IG and like your photos.

570
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,610
It's okay, Auto.

571
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,370
Let's meet again sometime.

572
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,540
Wait a moment.

573
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,320
Yes, Chef?

574
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,670
Chef, you're letting me keep this?

575
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,540
Yes,

576
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,250
but I'm not letting you copy all the recipes.

577
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,300
I believe you're talented.

578
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,260
You'll find the unique selling point of your restaurant for sure.

579
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,830
But you need to have more confidence in yourself.

580
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:50,150
And whenever you need someone to taste-test, you can always call me.

581
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:56,130
Thank you, Chef.

582
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,530
If I come up with a new dish at my restaurant,

583
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:00,830
I'll come back and invite everyone to try it.

584
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:03,640
You guys too.

585
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:04,720
Okay.

586
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,750
I'll definitely be there.

587
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:08,860
Count me in! I'll give it a 5-star review.

588
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,120
See you later.

589
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,220
See you later.

590
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,450
Finish it up quickly.

591
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,120
Okay?

592
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,430
Alright, bye.

593
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:13,110
Here, have some water.

594
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:16,860
Does Mr. Metas live here alone?

595
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,830
Or does his family live in another house?

596
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:21,900
Should I go in and greet him first?

597
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,280
The other members of his family passed away
while Mr. Metas was studying abroad.

598
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,500
It was a big news story at the time.

599
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,610
Now, it's just his secretary who stops by occasionally.

600
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:31,230
Oh, really?

601
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:33,710
I’ll go get Mr. Metas for you.

602
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:35,040
Alright.

603
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:47,130
Where are your family and your secretary?

604
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:50,670
My secretary came to sort out the insurance paperwork and then left.

605
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,120
As for family,

606
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:53,790
I don't have anyone.

607
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:11,680
(The billionaire business family tragically died in an accident.)

608
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,030
(Mr. Sutath Siramongkolsawat)
(A real estate businessman, was involved in an accident.)

609
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,960
Damn it!

610
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,260
Just like a professional physiotherapist,

611
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:26,230
arriving ahead of time.

612
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:28,580
Hello, Mr. Metas.

613
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,320
Let me help you.

614
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:35,700
Walking like this is dangerous.

615
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,210
Here, come with me.

616
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:46,580
Today, we’ll be doing physiotherapy for 45 minutes.

617
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:51,130
First, Mr. Metas, could you please change into something more comfortable?

618
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,590
What's wrong with this outfit?

619
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,290
This is the most comfortable outfit I have.

620
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:00,470
Sportswear would be fine.

621
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,940
Excuse me, ma'am.

622
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:06,850
Could you please fetch a set of Mr. Metas's workout clothes for me?

623
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,020
I'll help him change.

624
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:10,110
Sure.

625
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:15,430
Thank you.

626
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,620
Allow me to help you change your clothes, Mr. Metas.
This type of outfit makes it difficult for me to work.

627
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:24,310
Can you unbutton your shirt for me, please?

628
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:33,060
I didn't think you'd actually come here for the physiotherapy.

629
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:36,720
See? There's nothing money can't buy.

630
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:41,880
I didn't come here because of money.

631
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:44,530
I'm just here to do my job.

632
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,750
I don't want anyone else to suffer

633
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:48,650
just because you have a problem with me.

634
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,360
Do you often do things

635
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,230
that don't benefit you, just for others?

636
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:09,490
Like when you stayed with me in the hospital.

637
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:10,750
What do you want?

638
00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:12,750
Money from me?

639
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,680
Connections that can help you?

640
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,170
What makes you think that way?

641
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,820
Do I look like someone who wants something from you?

642
00:47:20,350 --> 00:47:21,350
I don't understand.

643
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:26,320
If what you're doing doesn't benefit you, then why do it?

644
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,710
Right now, you don't have to understand.

645
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,470
One day, you will.

646
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:07,460
Let's start the physical therapy.

647
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,880
Does it feel tight?

648
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:19,580
A little.

649
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,570
This is just a warm-up.

650
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:44,510
Take it easy.

651
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:06,270
Bear with it a bit.

652
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,100
Lift your knee.

653
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:12,770
Fold your leg.

654
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:13,810
Take it slowly.

655
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,690
It's okay, I'm helping.

656
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:17,830
Please be gentle.

657
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:19,560
-It hurts.
-I know, I know.

658
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:22,970
Okay, take it easy.

659
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:26,020
Ready?

660
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:29,330
Ouch, you!

661
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:37,210
Does it hurt?

662
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:39,320
I can bear it.

663
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,800
How are you feeling?

664
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,880
It still hurts.

665
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:57,170
Ouch, you!

666
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:15,090
Taking me out for a walk like this,

667
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:17,600
is this included in the physical therapy package?

668
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,830
How much extra do I have to pay?

669
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:21,260
You don't have to pay anything.

670
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,010
I'm doing this because I genuinely want to help you.

671
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,200
You're in pain and stuck at home,

672
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:28,730
probably wouldn't dare to ask anyone to take you out, right?

673
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,910
I believe that when people do things for others,

674
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:35,990
they don't always expect something in return.

675
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:51,800
It's too tight, you know.

676
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:55,090
That's the point; it will help you recover faster.

677
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,340
But why do you have to do this for me?

678
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,630
So you can be in a better mood each day,

679
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:05,700
and maybe you'll stop being so grumpy towards others.

680
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:06,890
Let me tell you,

681
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,460
the mind affects the body.

682
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,870
The more stressed you are, the slower your recovery will be.

683
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:21,910
You seem to hate me,

684
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:25,140
but every time we meet, my heart races uncontrollably.

685
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,990
If it's not racing out of anger,

686
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,560
it's racing for another reason.

687
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,920
Are you some kind of heart therapist?

688
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:33,950
What nonsense are you talking about, sir?

689
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:36,410
If you want me to stay with you,

690
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:37,510
please be quiet

691
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,960
and focus on your physical therapy so you can recover quickly.

692
00:51:40,010 --> 00:51:41,660
Then we can go our separate ways.

693
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,800
At first, I wanted to recover quickly,

694
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:47,640
but now, not so much.

695
00:51:48,510 --> 00:51:51,750
Please take care of me for a long time, Dr. JJ.

696
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,530
What?

697
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:54,990
I've told you many times,

698
00:51:55,430 --> 00:51:58,390
I'm not a doctor; I'm a physical therapist.

699
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:02,440
Alright, Mr. Physical Therapist JJ.

700
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:13,780
Kluer and Pun Sib?

701
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:18,400
They went upstairs. They were complaining about being tired.

702
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,290
Aren't you going to thank me for the basil stir-fry?

703
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:29,360
How long are you going to ignore me?

704
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,870
Here you go, Chef. I was just about to thank you.

705
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,350
Are you going to cook for me?

706
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:45,550
Yes.

707
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,990
As a thank you for making basil stir-fry for me the other day,

708
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:51,970
today I'm making basil stir-fry for you.

709
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:55,680
That sounds interesting.

710
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,860
Did you come up with this recipe yourself,
or did you get it from somewhere?

711
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:43,050
My mom used to make this dish for me.

712
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:45,080
I only remember the taste.

713
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,480
I don't know what ingredients she used exactly,

714
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:50,870
so I tried to recreate the taste from my memory.

715
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:52,350
This is the result.

716
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:57,970
Beef Basil for the One I Love.

717
00:54:07,270 --> 00:54:09,160
I named this dish for my mom.

718
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,540
It might not be as delicious as your basil stir-fry,

719
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,310
but I hope it's not too bad.

720
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:19,390
Did I say it wasn't delicious?

721
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,160
Pardon?

722
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,140
It's good.

723
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,550
You marinated the beef in milk first, so it's tender.

724
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,900
Cutting it into pieces like this is just right.

725
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,890
You used broth instead of oil,

726
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:35,110
so you toasted the chili and garlic first.

727
00:54:35,290 --> 00:54:37,450
The aroma of the chili and garlic is still there.

728
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,560
For you to make it this well,

729
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:42,770
that's impressive.

730
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:05,370
When will you finally take pride in yourself?

731
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,350
You just won today.

732
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,800
Aren't you happy?

733
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,600
Even though I'm happy, I feel guilty.

734
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,800
Auto is truly more skilled than I am.

735
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:17,840
These things require experience.

736
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,480
Your journey is just beginning.

737
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,160
There's still plenty of time.

738
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,510
But I do admire you for helping Pun Sib in the kitchen today.

739
00:55:28,660 --> 00:55:31,550
Giving me so much praise, what do you want in return?

740
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:35,600
Are you going to ask me to help plant basil again?

741
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,770
It's not that I want you to help with anything.

742
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:42,690
I just want to give you a little reward for your positive attitude.

743
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,700
Come on in.

744
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:53,240
Yes, Chef.

745
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,300
What's this?

746
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,690
Did you bring me here to eat dessert?

747
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,240
Not exactly a dessert,

748
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,540
but you could call it a sweet treat.

749
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,050
Would you like some?

750
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:28,580
Of course, I love food.

751
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,980
But Chef, can you really make desserts?

752
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,490
I didn't see any desserts on the restaurant menu.

753
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:40,790
What's this?

754
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,270
This is called granita.

755
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,240
Try it.

756
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:05,580
It's incredibly delicious, Chef.

757
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,170
Why don't you sell this?

758
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,300
I don't sell it.

759
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:14,220
This is a special menu item.

760
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,090
Or am I not the first person

761
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:22,420
you've brought up to the third floor to eat granita?

762
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:25,340
Yes,

763
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,380
you are not the first.

764
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,170
I made it only for my ex-girlfriend.

765
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,970
She was the daughter of a respected mentor of mine.

766
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:39,250
But since we broke up, I haven't made any desserts.

767
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:42,910
I only made desserts for her.

768
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,900
Then why are you telling me this?

769
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:04,330
Because you made me want to make granita again.

770
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:06,360
But with a new flavor.

771
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,840
Internal Summer.

772
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,650
The taste of summer...

773
00:58:11,370 --> 00:58:12,910
that looks just like you.

774
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:08,030
If we start,

775
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,260
I won't let you stop like last time.

776
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:04,860
(I am about to transfer another payment,
and I hope you'll stay until the final round.)

777
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,130
I slept with Chef Oab.

778
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,950
I want to know your plan for winning this competition.

779
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,220
What should I do? I don't want to do this anymore.

780
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,000
If you're going to confess your love,

781
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,870
you should confess your sins first.

782
01:00:18,890 --> 01:00:20,540
You seemed happy last night.

783
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:22,690
You can leave now.
I can take care of myself.

784
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,420
Mr. Metas, Mr. Metas.

785
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:26,680
Be careful.

786
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:33,660
P' Oab!

787
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:36,770
Kao Suay!

788
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:44,960
-Are you hurt?
-Hurt!

789
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:46,590
Just finish it.

790
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:52,090
Cut!

791
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:02,510
No, that's not right.

792
01:01:03,050 --> 01:01:06,210
When I say "Action," you need to be fully in character.

793
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,730
Don't perform like Nab Nueng

794
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:09,060
Nab Nueng is a good example.

795
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,140
A good example of what?

796
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:11,010
A good example of terrible acting.
