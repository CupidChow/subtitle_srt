1
00:00:02,930 --> 00:00:05,670
I cook food for people to eat, not for the camera, get out!

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,680
Are you serious, Chef? You're really selling the business?

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,980
I want to sell the restaurant to someone truly skilled.

4
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:12,770
Those who are just after the land to start a business,
don't bother contacting me. It's a waste of time.

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:17,050
And what do rich people eat
that makes their mouths so disrespectful to others?

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,480
This is an FC.

7
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,720
Did he really follow me all the way here?

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,830
I think you're just getting in the way here.

9
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,310
-Leave me!
-Wouldn't it be better for you to go home?

10
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,530
Chef, you don't have to get so close.

11
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,700
Aren't you a fan?

12
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,750
You should be happy,

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,130
not uncomfortable.

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,020
Are you the one Metas sent to compete?

15
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,240
Are you crazy, Chef?

16
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:43,970
How is this possible?

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,310
How did you know?

18
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,590
With a face like mine,

19
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,710
would Metas really hire me?

20
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:51,230
You've been acting suspiciously since you were following me.

21
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,230
It's clear you can't cook at all.

22
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,630
You even burnt a fried egg.

23
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,390
Just tell me the truth, I won't hold it against you.

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,480
Do you really think I'm Metas' person,

25
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,520
or are you just messing with me, Chef?

26
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,629
Last time you kicked me out of the restaurant,

27
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,220
even though I just wanted to help review and attract customers.

28
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,020
This is like punishing someone for doing good.

29
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:12,740
If you don't like me, just say so.

30
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,130
Don't make excuses.

31
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,039
I both don't believe you and don't like you.

32
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:19,130
So, you're going to kick me out of the competition

33
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,510
just because you don't like me?

34
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,230
Is that it?

35
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,250
Wow.

36
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,539
Where's your sense of justice, Chef?

37
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,830
I've identified Metas' person.

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,330
This time, I'll let you go.

39
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,910
Looking at your condition,

40
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,610
I don't need to kick you out.

41
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:41,330
You probably won't make it past this round anyway.

42
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,229
Even if the food doesn't look great,

43
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,450
I guarantee the taste will leave you speechless, Chef.

44
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:04,210
My dish is basil stir-fry with tofu, Chef.

45
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:09,360
My dish is basil stir-fry with minced pork and creamy scrambled eggs, Chef.

46
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,620
My dish is basil stir-fry with crispy century eggs, Chef.

47
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,610
This?

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,730
This is what you said would leave me speechless?

49
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,870
I'm presenting

50
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:29,020
the extraordinary in the ordinary basil stir-fry with minced pork.

51
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,050
The taste and appearance may be a bit complex,

52
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,840
but I guarantee it won't disappoint.

53
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,980
Licking the floor would taste better than this.

54
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,170
The chili and garlic are burnt.

55
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,780
The flavor isn’t complex,

56
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,220
it’s a mess of spicy, salty, and sweet clashing together.

57
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,040
It's terrible.

58
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,300
Don't take it too hard.

59
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,600
Chef Oab is harsh and serious when it comes to work.

60
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,310
Don't overthink it.

61
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,880
He's so harsh with the scoring.

62
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,120
If Chef is going to scrutinize every little detail,

63
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,920
we might as well have Gordon Ramsay
or Jay Fai compete to get a decent score.

64
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,820
Even if you come last in this round, it's okay.

65
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,020
There's still the next round.

66
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,710
If you get full marks,

67
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,740
there's still hope of being in the top three.

68
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,170
My name is Kluer.

69
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:44,740
What's your name?

70
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,659
Plawan.

71
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:48,980
Interesting name.

72
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,100
Should I call you Pla or Wan?

73
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:53,260
Call me whatever you want. It doesn’t matter.

74
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,820
So, are you going to boast when you get first place?

75
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,880
Everyone,

76
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,620
next is the final test.

77
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:06,120
But you won't be cooking.

78
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,990
Instead, you'll be tasting and critiquing.

79
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,500
Because being a chefisn't just about making delicious food,

80
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,470
it's about analyzing flavors

81
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,190
to improve and innovate.

82
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,310
Are you ready?

83
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,630
Yes, Chef.

84
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,920
This way, please.

85
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:24,990
Someone like you

86
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,320
doesn’t need to try too hard.

87
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,530
Just get ready to pack your bags and go home.

88
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,450
In front of you are basil stir-fry dishes from different restaurants.

89
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,120
Your task is to taste each one,

90
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,220
describe the flavors,

91
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,780
identify the ingredients,

92
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,420
and most importantly, determine which dish is from which restaurant.

93
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,480
Ah.

94
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,890
Do we have to name the restaurant, too?

95
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,510
Isn't that too difficult, Chef?

96
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,760
Yeah, Chef,

97
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,360
they all look similar.

98
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,010
Yes, it's difficult.

99
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:05,420
But if you claim to be basil stir-fry experts,

100
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,130
you should be able to do it.

101
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,130
If anyone thinks they can't,

102
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,720
the door is unlocked.

103
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,840
You can leave anytime.

104
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,010
Any more complaints?

105
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,710
The scores from this round will be combined with the previous round.

106
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,830
Only the top three scorers will move on.

107
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,700
You may start tasting.

108
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,720
May I answer?

109
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,020
Are you sure?

110
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,510
You only get one chance.

111
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,110
If you get it wrong, you get zero points.

112
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,670
The first dish

113
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,950
has a mild flavor,

114
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,130
slightly salty

115
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,490
due to the excess soy sauce,

116
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,810
evident from the color.

117
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,409
It uses large-leaf basil which isn't very fragrant.

118
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,800
It also has bird's eye chili and Thai garlic,

119
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,300
with a medium level of spiciness.

120
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,190
This dish has the most sauce among the three.

121
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,810
The fried egg is perfectly cooked with a runny yolk.

122
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,420
The rice is fragrant, soft, and well-separated.

123
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,450
I think this is the basil stir-fry from Khun Noo's restaurant in Siam.

124
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,290
Am I correct?

125
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,010
Go on.

126
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,250
The second dish uses red basil,

127
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:00,410
which has a strong basil and spice aroma.

128
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,310
It's a dry stir-fry, with a somewhat traditional style.

129
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,400
The egg white is crispy and the yolk is runny.

130
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,640
This must be from Jay Aor's place near Ratchawat.

131
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,710
The third dish uses wild white basil,

132
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,650
which has the best aroma for this dish.

133
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,610
It's not too overpowering, and the taste is perfectly balanced.

134
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,240
However, the fried egg is a bit too oily.

135
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,430
This must be from the Chao Krueng Basil restaurant,
just two streets away from here.

136
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,370
Is that correct?

137
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:24,290
Uh.

138
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,110
Did I get everything right, Chef?

139
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,420
What's my score for this round?

140
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,000
You scored a perfect ten out of ten.

141
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,100
Well,

142
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,650
sorry about that.

143
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,530
Turns out I won't be tossed aside easily,

144
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:48,340
like the long beans in the basil stir-fry you don't like.

145
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,520
(Round 2)

146
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,750
(Total Score)

147
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:07,360
Oh, just one spot away.

148
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,260
Congratulations to those who made it to the top 3.

149
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,820
You have proven to be skilled enough

150
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,830
to train with me for one month.

151
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,920
However, I have an announcement.

152
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,670
One of the finalists

153
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,200
has a deal with Mr. Metas or MT Group.

154
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,790
Will you confess yourself,

155
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,510
or should I reveal your name?

156
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,030
I already told you I'm not Metas' person.

157
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,830
Why are you so intent on accusing me?

158
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,460
Did I say it was you?

159
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,890
It's not me, Chef.

160
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,500
How could I be involved with someone like Metas?

161
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,430
I'm just a regular cook.

162
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,730
I don't make baseless accusations.

163
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,150
That photo is not of me, Chef.

164
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,710
I think you should leave my restaurant before I have to drag you out.

165
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,000
Go!

166
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,330
So, does that mean the next person on the list moves up?

167
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,920
The rules didn't state

168
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,910
that if someone forfeits, the next in line moves up.

169
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,530
But that's the universal rule, isn't it?

170
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,810
If there's no third place, the next highest scorer should move up.

171
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,930
But you're not the only one in fourth place.

172
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,890
Pun Sib also has the same score as you.

173
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,250
If we need to fill the spot,

174
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,420
you and Pun Sib will have to compete again to determine the winner.

175
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,290
How about that?

176
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,250
Chef,

177
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:44,290
why don't we let both Pun Sib and Plawan move on to the next round?

178
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:48,070
Since the rules didn't state that only 3 people can move on,

179
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,210
Chef just mentioned ranks 1-3.

180
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,920
If there are two people tied for third place, why not let both advance?

181
00:11:57,870 --> 00:11:58,780
That's right.

182
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,710
The rules aren't explicit,

183
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:02,330
so both of us should have a chance.

184
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,640
Chef, please reconsider.

185
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:07,240
I've worked really hard for this.

186
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,190
Did I make it?

187
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,130
Yes!

188
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:23,990
Hey?

189
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,100
I'll remind you again.

190
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,710
Chef, please reconsider.

191
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:36,330
I've worked really hard for this.

192
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,000
Or...

193
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,910
are you going to be someone who breaks your word,

194
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,010
no sense of fairness,

195
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,920
and treats competitors unfairly?

196
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,740
I can go to the press and report

197
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,130
that Chef Oab

198
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,550
is a fraud and a scam artist.

199
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,440
That would be big news.

200
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,570
Alright, what's the number?

201
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,420
Fine.

202
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,620
Both of you can go on to train with me.

203
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:09,920
-Yes!
-Oh yes!

204
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,630
Yes!

205
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,160
The training starts next Monday.

206
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,040
Be prepared.

207
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,610
Yes, Chef.

208
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,690
A fan like you,

209
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,840
if you're not serious, just step back.

210
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:42,450
People like you will never succeed.

211
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,860
Oh come on!

212
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,940
Do you think I'm scared?

213
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,660
What kind of chef is as harsh as a dog?

214
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,850
A fan?

215
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,650
Who would want to be a fan of yours?

216
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,530
We made it!

217
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,210
Money, here I come!

218
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,740
Hey, calm down!

219
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:29,050
Aren't you taking painkillers right now?

220
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,730
Don't overdo it.

221
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,220
Honestly, you shouldn't even be drinking alcohol.

222
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,130
Come on,

223
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,810
it's just once in a while.

224
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,200
I don't celebrate often.

225
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,310
After all this time, I've been auditioning for so long,

226
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,930
and this is the first time in months that I've passed an audition.

227
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,700
Just let me celebrate a little.

228
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,190
But you have to wake up early tomorrow.

229
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,790
You have to deal with Mr. Metas or whatever.

230
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,900
Are you ready for that?

231
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,410
I've got it all planned out.

232
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:00,170
I'm going to ask him

233
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:03,060
for a million baht as payment.

234
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,820
A million? That's too little. Ask for one and a half.

235
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,520
What the hell?

236
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,110
One and a half million?

237
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,610
Wow,

238
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,890
Mr. JJ,

239
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,450
you're even greedier than I am.

240
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,240
Weren't you the one who told me
not to take this job because it's unethical?

241
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,910
I'm not greedy,

242
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,950
but you never listen to me.

243
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,730
You insisted on taking this job anyway.

244
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,130
So, you might as well make the most of it.

245
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:30,870
You need to beat Mr. Metas,

246
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,830
that guy who looks down on others just because he's rich.

247
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,920
He needs to be taken down a peg

248
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,150
to understand what it's like for poor people.

249
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,630
It's so frustrating!

250
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:47,000
But do you think he'll really give me that much money?

251
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,530
What are you scared of?

252
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,320
Look at this.

253
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,840
See?

254
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,910
Mr. Metas is already taking reservations for sales spaces,

255
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:00,810
even though he hasn't bought the land from Chef Oab yet.

256
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,720
Even if you ask for more money, he'll still hire you.

257
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,790
Trust me.

258
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,100
No way.

259
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,030
I will never pay you that much.

260
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,490
Wait, Mr. Metas. We can negotiate.

261
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,490
Five hundred thousand.

262
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,990
That's all I can give you. Take it or leave it.

263
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:29,000
Ah, how can that be?

264
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:32,220
This is way less than the amount you initially offered.

265
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,410
At first, you intended to find someone to infiltrate the competition.

266
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,620
You intended to pay a million, right?

267
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,230
I'm not a foolish businessman

268
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:43,320
you can swindle as you please.

269
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:46,140
A deal from before doesn't have to be the same as today.

270
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,210
Just 500,000 baht

271
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,020
is all I'm offering.

272
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,390
You accept?

273
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,650
Money 500,000 baht

274
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,700
It's a lot of money

275
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,850
for someone struggling like you.

276
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,740
You're not getting many modeling gigs lately, right?

277
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,540
I'm helping you as much as I can.

278
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:09,839
How about 600,000?

279
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,780
Deal.

280
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,630
No!

281
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,910
No discounts!

282
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,690
Stop it, Wan.

283
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,780
You don't need to negotiate anything.

284
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:21,210
Can't you see he's taking advantage of you?

285
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,920
Seeing others struggling,

286
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,810
you lower the price even more.

287
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,319
This is not gentlemanly at all.

288
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,500
I'm a businessman, not a saint.

289
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:31,990
JJ,

290
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,070
isn't 600,000 still a lot?

291
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,530
I barely have 1,000 in my account right now.

292
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,570
If you don't get 1.5 million, don't take it.

293
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,860
No,

294
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,660
if you don't get 2 million...

295
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,320
You don't need to hire my friend for this job anymore.

296
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,220
Are you out of your mind?

297
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,080
I wouldn't even pay a million,

298
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,510
and now you're asking for 2 million?

299
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,610
Are you crazy?

300
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,830
Your people who infiltrated have all been caught

301
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,630
and kicked out, right?

302
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,800
Even if my friend seems a bit clumsy,

303
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,360
he's made it through the selection round,

304
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,250
which means he has a chance to win

305
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,150
and become the successor of the restaurant.

306
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,710
Your people couldn't do that.

307
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,720
If you don't hire Plawan,

308
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:22,150
you'll have to negotiate with the other finalists.

309
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,610
And they won't be as accommodating as the two of us.

310
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,530
This is already a very generous price.

311
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,020
Or if you don't want to pay 2 million,

312
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,790
I can take this offer to 2B Development.

313
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,900
They're your real estate competitors, aren't they?

314
00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:39,540
If I offer them a deal for 1.5 million,

315
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:41,720
they'd probably take it.

316
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,390
Then you can deal with your competitors yourself.

317
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,610
Alright,

318
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,310
but I'm still not confident in your friend.

319
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,030
I'll pay 5% upfront.

320
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,100
If he succeeds,

321
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,920
I'll pay the remaining amount in stages

322
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,510
The first 30% after the initial payment,

323
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,530
another 30% after passing the first test,

324
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:05,720
and the final 40% after securing the restaurant.

325
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,280
How can I be sure

326
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,940
your friend will win?

327
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,830
Every investment carries risk.

328
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,530
You're a businessman,

329
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,540
you know this is a basic lesson.

330
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,410
What do you say?

331
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,250
Our time is valuable too.

332
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,950
Agreed.

333
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,540
But if your friend doesn't win and can't get me the land,

334
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:35,930
Your friend will have to return every single baht to me.

335
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,280
Deal.

336
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,560
Hey, JJ,

337
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,720
how can you make such a promise to Metas?

338
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,330
Once the money's in my pocket, I'm not giving it back!

339
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:50,890
Wan!

340
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,310
(Six hundred thousand baht exactly.)
Quiet, Wan!

341
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,700
Can't you see he's writing you a check? Look over there!

342
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,100
(Six hundred thousand baht exactly.)

343
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,810
The first installment is 30% of 2 million.

344
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,130
Thank you.

345
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,650
Just signing isn't enough.

346
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:11,300
I don't trust businessmen like you.

347
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,110
Send over the contract later.

348
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,410
Thanks.

349
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,700
Sure, do it as my friend said.

350
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,120
Goodbye Metas.

351
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,180
See you.

352
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,800
JJ,

353
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:37,790
JJ,

354
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,080
-JJ.
-What?

355
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,110
how could you make a deal like that with Metas?

356
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:43,790
If I don't win, I won't have the money to pay him back.

357
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,080
We're talking hundreds of thousands here.

358
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,430
Then you just have to win.

359
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,490
Oh man,

360
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,480
just passing the first round was tough enough.

361
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:54,330
And the other three who made it to the next round

362
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,630
are incredibly talented.
There's no way I can beat them.

363
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,850
Think positive,

364
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,620
manifest it.

365
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,640
You passed the first round, didn't you?

366
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:07,620
If you try hard, you can win.

367
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:09,080
We're this far in,

368
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,790
there's no turning back.

369
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,590
And besides, Wan,

370
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:15,670
whether you win or not,

371
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,530
you have no money right now anyway.

372
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,440
So, you have nothing to lose.

373
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,090
At worst, I'll lend you the money to pay back Metas.

374
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,510
But if it comes to that,

375
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,070
we're done as friends.

376
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Alright, alright.

377
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:37,420
I have to win.

378
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,910
It's almost a million.

379
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:43,710
But does training to be the successor

380
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,500
mean I have to live in Chef Oab's restaurant?

381
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:50,220
Is the chef world really that harsh?

382
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,720
I'll be under Chef Oab's watch 24/7.

383
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,430
No personal space.

384
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,320
What if the deal with Metas gets exposed?

385
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:03,130
You’re scared before anything has even happened why you such a coward.

386
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,710
Since when did you become a coward?

387
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:07,280
Since I realized that if I lose,

388
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,850
I'll have to repay Metas.

389
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,320
Hundreds of thousands—I'll be doomed.

390
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,920
Unbelievable. You've always been like this,

391
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,230
It's lucky that I sent you the picture in time.

392
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,630
Otherwise,

393
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:25,240
you'd have one of Metas' people as a candidate.

394
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,920
If they get in, I can still kick them out.

395
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,920
Cooking requires real passion.

396
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,500
If you don't truly love it,

397
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,300
you can't fake this kind of thing.

398
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,230
I understand, Bro,

399
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,010
but you still need to be cautious.

400
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:40,420
I'm not sure

401
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:42,780
if there are more of Metas' people left.

402
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,030
My source only gave me one picture,

403
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,810
but that doesn't mean the other four finalists

404
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,420
aren't his.

405
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,000
We'll find out soon enough.

406
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,320
If Metas' people are still here,

407
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:56,920
it won't be hard to catch them.

408
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:01,850
Have you talked to Kao Suay?

409
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,210
I did.

410
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,710
I just told her to call the Master.

411
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:08,710
Just that.

412
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,800
Because no matter what,

413
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,300
the Master's surgery is the most important thing.

414
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,210
When is Kao Suay coming back?

415
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:19,300
I want the Master to get into surgery as soon as possible.

416
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:24,060
I didn't ask her that directly.

417
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,440
We have to respect the Master's decision.

418
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,890
Father and daughter need to discuss it themselves.

419
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,160
Huh?

420
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,010
Hey, over there.

421
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,580
Hey, Wan,

422
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,650
are you taking all of this?

423
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,800
Yeah, I'm going to be there for a whole month.

424
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,100
Do you know what 'laundry' means?

425
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,180
Do you know 'laundry'?

426
00:23:57,450 --> 00:24:01,430
You're going to be a chef, not walking in a fashion week.

427
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,150
Or maybe this one?
Hey, hey!

428
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,030
You shouldn't be choosing flashy clothes like this.

429
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,520
Come on.

430
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,910
No, no, none of these.

431
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:16,640
If you dress like this,

432
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,430
Chef Oab will definitely know.

433
00:24:21,130 --> 00:24:23,820
Your model aura will give you away.

434
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,520
Fine, not these.

435
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,710
And if you get the money,

436
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,190
will you still do modeling?

437
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
Hmm.

438
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,180
I don't know yet.

439
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,920
Then after this gig, you need to find a real job.

440
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,500
Running around casting for modeling gigs isn't working out.

441
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:45,030
You know you don't get big jobs often.

442
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,420
You need to think about your future.

443
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,630
You told me to find something to do,
and I've been trying to think of something.

444
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,930
But I can't think of anything.

445
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,340
If you come up with something, let me know.

446
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,020
Alright, alright.

447
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,130
We'll figure it out together. We'll find something.

448
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,470
Some people start their businesses at 40 or 50.

449
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,610
You'll have your time, too.

450
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,200
But does my business have to involve looks?

451
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,740
I'm so handsome,

452
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,600
it would be a waste not to use it.

453
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:25,020
Uh-huh, sure.

454
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:28,410
-So stylish.
-I really do waste my time worrying about you.

455
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:32,140
Having you around is like having a real kid, you know?

456
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:33,540
Damn it.

457
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,710
You're such a strict dad.

458
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,610
I humbly ask the spirits of this place to bless

459
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,700
and inspire Chef Oab

460
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,160
Oops.

461
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:51,030
To help me win this competition.

462
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,600
If I manage to sell the restaurant,

463
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,970
you’ll have someone richer,

464
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:57,290
more younger, handsome,

465
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,400
and ten times kinder than Chef Oab to look after you.

466
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,080
The guardian spirits have acknowledged it.

467
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,290
Hey, what are you shooting?

468
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,590
Who told you to film?

469
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:12,820
Delete it!

470
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,300
Okay.

471
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:20,100
You’re here.

472
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,600
Welcome, welcome.

473
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,580
You talk like it's your own restaurant.

474
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,920
Ohhh.

475
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:34,800
This outfit is quite expensive.

476
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,140
I usually dress like this,

477
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:40,390
forgot others might not.

478
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,020
It's okay, it adds some flair.

479
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:47,280
But it's expensive, so if it gets dirty, you'll regret it.

480
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,500
Next time, dress simpler. Trust me.

481
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,810
Alright, thanks.

482
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,540
Welcome, everyone.

483
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,530
Let me go over the rules again

484
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,220
in case anyone wants to back out.

485
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,210
This training isn't child's play.

486
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,460
You'll be doing real work and rotating through all tasks,

487
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:14,700
from selecting and preparing ingredients, washing and
cutting vegetables, serving, and cleaning the kitchen.

488
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,030
Every week, someone will be eliminated.

489
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,410
Every action you take will be scored.

490
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,710
From now on, you're all competitors.

491
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,900
The last person standing will be the winner.

492
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,250
Kluer, you used to work here, so handle the accommodation arrangements.

493
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,100
Yes, Chef.

494
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,760
Every minute counts.

495
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,280
Go unpack and meet me in the kitchen in 10 minutes.

496
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,420
-Yes, Chef.
-Yes, Chef.

497
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,520
Yes, Chef.

498
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,400
Follow me.

499
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:44,020
We'll give a quick tour.

500
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:48,830
The second floor has employee rooms—two in total,

501
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,310
with one shared bathroom.

502
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,520
One bathroom?

503
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,720
A shared one?

504
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,950
Yes, it is.

505
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,840
So we have to share a bathroom

506
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,710
and take turns showering?

507
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,700
It's not that bad. We just take turns showering.

508
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,350
Let's hurry and unpack so we can head to the kitchen.

509
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,130
Pun Sib, you're sharing a room with Auto.

510
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,030
This is your room.

511
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,420
Plawan, you're with me.

512
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,290
This way.

513
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,090
Alright, I'll quickly unpack before we run out of time.

514
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:18,960
You've got a lot of stuff. Keep it organized and don't clutter the place.

515
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,700
Okay, you pick your bed first.

516
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,870
Oh, and one more thing

517
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:26,530
the golden rule here is no one is allowed on the third floor.

518
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,420
Why not?

519
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:29,380
The third floor is off-limits.

520
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,290
Only Chef Oab is allowed up there.

521
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,530
If there are any other rules, send them on LINE.

522
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,620
We have less than 5 minutes.

523
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,820
Aren't you hurrying?

524
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:40,240
See you downstairs.

525
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,430
Are you an actor or something?

526
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,280
You look familiar, like I've seen you on TV.

527
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,320
You know, I do watch some TV commercials.

528
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,530
It's kind of exciting

529
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,230
being around someone famous, huh?

530
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,940
Hey, come on,

531
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,830
I'm not that famous.

532
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,530
You're just saying that.

533
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,900
Don't stress too much.

534
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,190
Even though Chef seems to be hard on you,

535
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,050
he's actually very kind.

536
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,490
You'll see in time.

537
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:40,830
Just don't make me angry and avoid mentioning certain thing, uh...

538
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,910
we're down to 1 minute.

539
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,590
Ohhh!

540
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,170
Can he not rush me on everything, just for once?

541
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,420
Go, go, quick!

542
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:50,370
Go, go, quick!

543
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,410
How much longer will you be sharpening that knife?
Start chopping already.

544
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:02,140
Yeah, Chef.

545
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,320
How can you chop with a dull knife?

546
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,110
Sharpen it again or get a new one.

547
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:07,300
Hurry up, Kluer.

548
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,110
Yeah, Chef.

549
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,510
What are you doing?

550
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:17,310
I'm chopping carrots, Chef.

551
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,590
To make the stock, right?

552
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,320
When making stock, focus on speed.
You don't need to be so meticulous.

553
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,860
We're not stir-frying or offering sacrifices here.

554
00:30:23,150 --> 00:30:25,120
So, like this?

555
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,780
Get your posture right.

556
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,590
How?

557
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,130
If you stand and chop like this, your back will be ruined.

558
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:36,900
Get ready to see an orthopedic doctor.

559
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,790
Spread your legs more.

560
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,870
Just tell me, Chef.

561
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,730
Hey!

562
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,210
Adjust to the height of the counter.

563
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,530
Hold the knife,

564
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:53,880
chop,

565
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,710
chop,

566
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,320
chop like this—three segments.

567
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,120
Stock needs to be made fresh every day

568
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,190
and must be the first thing done in the morning.

569
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:04,610
If you're this slow, customers won't get to eat.

570
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,640
Get another carrot.

571
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,480
Chop.

572
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,460
The aroma of basil smells great.

573
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,220
What's this?

574
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,320
Yes, Chef?

575
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:48,150
I'm not letting you stir-fry anytime soon.

576
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,710
Focus on prepping the ingredients properly first.

577
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,790
Got it, Chef.

578
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,640
Hurry up, there's more to be done.

579
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:54,410
Yeah, Chef.

580
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,710
Why does someone so harsh have to smell so good?

581
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,070
I want to eat, Chef.

582
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,710
Oh no,

583
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,320
I want to eat basil stir-fry.

584
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,640
Why is just prepping ingredients so exhausting?

585
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,720
And I have to wake up early tomorrow too.

586
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,820
With such a meticulous chef,

587
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:45,800
it's five times as tiring compared to other restaurants.

588
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,610
Where did you train as a chef before this?

589
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,520
I never trained seriously,

590
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,030
just wanted to give it a try.

591
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,030
Then why choose this restaurant?

592
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:01,310
Anyone who’s seen Chef Oab on TV would be scared.

593
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,450
He criticizes harshly on the show.

594
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,200
I came here once and liked the food.

595
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,420
Oh,

596
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,200
a fan, huh?

597
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:16,810
Working with your idol can be disappointing.

598
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,030
Don't get too upset.

599
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,440
Hey, Auto, want to take a picture?

600
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,440
Auto, can I get your IG?

601
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,640
I don't have an IG.

602
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,310
Oh,

603
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,790
found it!

604
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,790
Auto with five O's, right?

605
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,719
I sent a request, accept it please.

606
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:19,659
Do we have to be friends?

607
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,130
How come?

608
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:26,400
Fine, accepted.

609
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,300
Thanks.

610
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,770
Usually cook Chinese food?
I saw mostly Chinese dishes on your IG.

611
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:37,110
Just trained a bit, don’t cook it often.

612
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,409
What are you waiting for? Go ahead.

613
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:43,830
Annoying.

614
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:51,210
What the heck is going on with him?

615
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,179
Let’s check out Kluer’s profile.

616
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:56,400
Wow, famous in Khon Kaen

617
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,930
and owns a gold shop.

618
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,820
How about checking out Plawan’s profile?

619
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,220
I'm starving.

620
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,710
Why would a celebrity want to be a chef?

621
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,490
He's not that famous.

622
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,420
If he were, he'd be on TV like Chef Oab.

623
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,820
But Plawan is a real basil stir-fry expert.

624
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,200
Aren’t you curious

625
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,030
why Plawan has nothing related to cooking on his profile

626
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,850
and barely has any kitchen skills?

627
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,990
Sleep sleep sleep.

628
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,160
(Metas)

629
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,530
Investigate the restaurant's income and expenses.

630
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,090
I want to know how financially troubled it is.

631
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,700
What are you doing?

632
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,430
Uh...

633
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,000
What are you doing here so late?

634
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,990
Well, I...

635
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,590
I asked what you're doing.

636
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:45,650
I'm hungry, so I came down to find something to eat.

637
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:47,880
Hungry, huh?

638
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,530
So, what are you doing here?
Why didn't you go to the kitchen to find something to eat?

639
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,330
I didn't want to use the gas stove

640
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,940
and make a mess in the kitchen.

641
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:01,610
So I thought I'd order something instead.

642
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,100
Look,

643
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:04,120
here's my order.

644
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,920
Let me see.

645
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,920
Plawan,

646
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,750
still haven't found anything to eat?

647
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,220
Not yet.

648
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:25,420
I just opened the app to order.

649
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,200
As soon as I came down, I ran into Chef.

650
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,250
Do you want anything? I will order together.

651
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,030
Chef, do you want anything?

652
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,190
No,

653
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,900
but clean up after you're done.

654
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,240
What are you going to eat?

655
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,210
You're hungry, right?

656
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,330
I heard your stomach growling from upstairs.

657
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,130
You don't have to order.

658
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:57,920
Come on,

659
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,210
what do you want to eat?
I'll cook something for you.

660
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,020
Minced pork basil instant noodles, maybe?

661
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,650
Okay, got it.

662
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:25,410
Do you need any help?

663
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,620
Prepare the chilies and garlic for me.

664
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:30,860
Alright.

665
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,400
Done.

666
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,630
Let’s see how it tastes.

667
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,430
It smells amazing.

668
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,430
Okay, I'm going to eat now.

669
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,230
You must be really hungry.

670
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,440
Eat slowly, you might choke.

671
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,910
It's very rich in flavor.

672
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:27,330
Have you been frowning at me because you don't like me, or because

673
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,610
you were hungry?

674
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,890
I know you see me as a competitor,

675
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:39,500
but isn't it better to have friends than enemies?

676
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,110
Just so you know,

677
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,310
I don't see you as a competitor or enemy.

678
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:50,020
A restaurant can't be run by one person alone.

679
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,130
We have to work together.

680
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,300
Huh.

681
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,700
Alright.

682
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,920
Let's be friends then.

683
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,630
Consider it a thank you for making me this delicious meal tonight.

684
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,610
Just like that?

685
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,420
Alright, I'll keep eating.

686
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,650
Finish it all.

687
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,880
No problem, I can handle it.

688
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,160
Our restaurant operates on a chef's table concept,

689
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,840
serving customers in two rounds a day.

690
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:34,470
The first round of customers will be here soon.

691
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,910
For today's tasks: washing, stir-frying, frying,

692
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,930
and customer service.

693
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,040
Who's doing what?

694
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,620
-Stir-frying.
-Frying.

695
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,500
I'll handle customer service.

696
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,040
Wan, you'll be washing dishes.

697
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,080
As I said, everything is scored.

698
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:50,900
If anyone makes a mistake, don't expect to work in this kitchen again.

699
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:51,930
-Yeah, Chef.
-Yeah, Chef.

700
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:52,740
Let's start.

701
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,410
Doesn't seem hard.
I don't know why others are fighting for different tasks.

702
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,210
Washing dishes is easy.

703
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:05,600
Everyone wants to show their skills to the chef.

704
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,810
If the chef sees your skills, you might get extra points.

705
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,980
Oh, I see.

706
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,940
I read somewhere

707
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,190
that the chef orders special plates for each dish, with no spares.

708
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:22,770
If you break one, the chef will go berserk.

709
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,120
Is this the time for chit-chat?

710
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,030
Sorry, Chef.

711
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:32,330
Damn,

712
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,110
thought it would be an easy job.

713
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,120
What is the chef doing?

714
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,910
Careful with those plates.

715
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:38,940
The aroma of basil from the chef smells so good.

716
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,500
Let go.

717
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:43,130
It makes me hungry.

718
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:44,830
Leave me!

719
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,000
How can you work in a kitchen being this clumsy?

720
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,430
You forget this kitchen isn't just for you.

721
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,040
I'm warning you again,

722
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,010
if you mess up, you won't be allowed back in my kitchen.

723
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,500
Yes, Chef.

724
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,550
Sorry, Chef.

725
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:19,000
Right this way, please.

726
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,490
This table.

727
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,480
Excuse me,

728
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:49,890
our restaurant serves a set course with five dishes.

729
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,800
Are there any foods you're allergic to?

730
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,250
Is this okay, Chef?

731
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,180
It's burnt.

732
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,530
Fry it again.

733
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,850
Excuse me, sir and madam.

734
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,880
Customers pay thousands per meal.

735
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,570
Are you going to serve this half-heartedly?

736
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:14,250
If you're here to play around,

737
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,820
go home.

738
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:17,250
-Yeah, Chef.
-Yeah, Chef.

739
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:30,740
More...

740
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:39,810
Scoop it up,

741
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:44,940
plate it.

742
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,190
Yeah, Chef.

743
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,920
What are you doing?

744
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,790
What's your job?

745
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,490
Even washing dishes takes you this long?

746
00:44:58,610 --> 00:44:59,430
Yeah, Chef.

747
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:07,900
Ow.

748
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,720
Sorry, Chef.

749
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:14,930
Get out.

750
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:16,680
But I...

751
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,720
Get out.

752
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,440
I said, get out of my kitchen!

753
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,140
Whenever I'm not in the kitchen,

754
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,420
I can still smell basil from Chef Oab very time.

755
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:39,230
I get close to him, I feel weird.

756
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,960
Don't tell me you have a crush on the Chef.

757
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,310
What? No way!

758
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,840
Next time, if my physical therapist isn't available, let me know

759
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,030
so I can get a replacement.

760
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:52,090
Did you do something to make him dislike you?

761
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,930
Or maybe he hates me because I criticize him

762
00:45:53,980 --> 00:45:55,050
Someone in the restaurant?

763
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:56,590
It smells so good.

764
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,910
Talking like that, are you saying you want to eat me

765
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,770
just like you want to eat basil stir-fry?

766
00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:02,810
Why is he so cool all the time?

767
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,570
It's like he knows the camera is always on him.

768
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:06,680
How can someone be ready and handsome all the time?

769
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,330
It's incredible.

770
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:12,800
First of all, how do you feel about being on set today?

771
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,100
I'm very happy.

772
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,320
Then why the sad face?

773
00:46:15,990 --> 00:46:17,090
JJ.

774
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:17,940
Don't even start.

775
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,540
(Don't tease.)

776
00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:27,330
(Chef's just resting his eyes.)

777
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:29,180
Just tell us, Chef.

778
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:30,090
Come on.

779
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:31,870
Do it, pick it up.

780
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:33,390
Now, hold hands.

781
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,050
Okay, cut!

782
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,710
(One take, done!)
Cut!
