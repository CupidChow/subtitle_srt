00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,460
Don't you want to assassinate me?

31
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,690
Here is your chance.

32
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,960
There is no ambush.

33
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,510
Did you throw a knife at me?

34
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,760
It never crossed my mind that

35
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,140
the person I entrusted my life to

36
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:12,690
would throw a knife at me.

37
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,859
- You—
- Put away your hypocrisy!

38
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,400
Didn't you enter the palace just to assassinate me?

39
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,120
Did you yell at me?

40
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,210
How could you yell at me?

41
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,470
- Did I?
- Yes.

Don't repeat the old tricks

44

and try to get out of this by pretending to be hurt!

45
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,890
Okay, don't you want to know the truth?

46
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,650
I will show you the truth!

47
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,510
This is so nice.

48
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,160
How dare you lie to me?

49
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,470
Your Majesty, I wouldn't dare.

50
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:15,300
We had to do it just because of my infatuated daughter.

51
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:18,380
Please spare us, Your Majesty.

52
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:21,859
- Please spare us, Your Majesty.
- Please spare us, Your Majesty.

53
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:23,630
"Daughter"?

54
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:31,619
Your Majesty, these were found at Sanitation Department.

55
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,860
Liu Xuan Ming won't trust me easily

56
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,009
so we have to do two things.

57
00:04:58,009 --> 00:05:00,010
I will do the first thing.

58
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:04,739
I will ask Queen Mother to convince Liu Xuan Ming that I truly have a crush on him,

59
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:07,879
and I won't hesitate to force a marriage on him by Queen Mother.

60
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:12,870
You need to do the second thing, and the sooner the better.

61
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,320
We must finish it before Liu Xuan Ming finds out!

62
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,760
What is it?

63
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,330
Draw as many portraits of Liu Xuan Ming as possible.

64
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,399
"Portraits"? No way,

65
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:25,140
we can't draw.

66
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,990
We can't.

67
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,480
I can do it.

68
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,990
These were all drawn by San Mei before entering the palace.

69
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,790
San Mei saw Your Majesty once by chance and has been vowing to marry Your Majesty ever since.

70
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,679
Later, our family was in decline, and we entered the palace as eunuchs.

71
00:05:50,679 --> 00:05:52,920
In order to help San Mei fulfill her dream,

72
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,659
we thought of digging a tunnel to get close to Your Majesty.

73
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:59,300
Did you also arrange to let her save me that time?

74
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,090
Your Majesty,

75
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,730
we told San Mei about your traveling plan.

76
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:08,240
San Mei planned to take the opportunity to approach Your Majesty,

77
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,040
but the assassin came out of nowhere

78
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,820
so she was desperate to save you.

79
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,139
Were you also the ones hiding in the closet after drugging the guards?

80
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:21,480
Your Majesty, we wanted to dig to the bedchamber

81
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:25,289
so we tried to get into the bedchamber to find the most suitable exit.

82
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:28,980
The closet was safest and least likely to be discovered.

83
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,310
You three did such absurd things for her!

84
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,760
Your Majesty,

85
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:40,550
she is my only daughter!

86
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:45,270
Whatever she wants,

87
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,270
I will let her have at any cost,

88
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,530
even my life!

89
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:57,220
- Your Majesty, please spare us.
- Your Majesty, please spare us.

90
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,790
Dad!

91
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,040
Your Majesty, please spare us.

92
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,460
- Dad.
- Daughter.

93
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,140
- My poor girl.
- San Mei.

94
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:10,160
San Mei. San Mei.

95
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,850
Life is so harsh on us,

96
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,300
so harsh.

97
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,720
How dare you!

98
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,850
What do you think this place is?

99
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:30,709
Stop flattering yourselves. His Majesty is wise, mighty, and brave.

100
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:33,020
Numerous women lose their hearts to His Majesty.

101
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,850
You are so basic that even I wouldn't lay my eyes on you, let alone His Majesty!

102
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,730
Do you think he is blind?

103
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,660
- Yao Hu.
- Yes.

104
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,769
- Get out.
- All right.

105
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,350
How are you?

106
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,970
Water.

107
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,000
We barely survived.

108
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,460
Do you think Liu Xuan Ming believed us?

109
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:17,250
If we don't stick our necks out in the next few days, he shouldn't suspect us.

110
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,950
All right.

111
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,660
But I don't think Liu Xuan Ming is a bad person.

112
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:31,730
Could there be something hidden about our family being exterminated back then?

113
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,850
San Mei, don't be fooled by his looks.

114
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,270
Did you fall in love with him?

115
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,670
- With whom?
- With Liu Xuan Ming.

116
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,760
No way!

117
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,420
San Mei, don't forget that Liu Xuan Ming has a sworn feud with us!

118
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,490
Guan San Mei, when shall we take action?

119
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:54,740
Not now.

120
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,720
After all, Yi Yang is keeping an eye on us now.

121
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:05,900
Apparently, we can only wait until Liu Xuan Ming and Qi Meng's wedding.

122
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,140
All right.

123
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,210
- Where is Guan?
- Where is my dad?

124
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:13,120
Didn't we come back together?

125
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:16,370
He seems to have fainted.

126
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,270
Dad, Dad!

127
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,990
It must be warm-heat disease.

128
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,160
It was because he was scared!

129
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,409
- Guan.
- Dad.

130
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,470
No matter what you say, I will never believe you again.

131
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,270
I am going to tear you to pieces!

132
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,139
I have asthma. My medicine...

133
00:09:56,139 --> 00:09:59,629
You are really good at acting. Do you think I will believe you?

134
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:03,010
Please, save me.

135
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:05,410
Save me.

136
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,700
Okay.

137
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,260
I shall get you the medicine and torture you slowly.

138
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,360
This one?

139
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,910
You do have a poor memory.

140
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:44,600
I am not the one to blame this time.

141

What is wrong with you?

142
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,860
I am the best assassin in the world,

143
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,610
yet I repeatedly get defeated by you.

144
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,760
There is no point in living.

145
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,610
- Just kill me.
- Don't say that.

146
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:10,600
Think about it; you threaten me with a knife every time.

147
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,810
I am just protecting myself.

148

Do you know what this is?

00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,120
This is the face of a handsome man.

162
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,390
Of course, I know.

163
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,590
I am talking about this wet place.

164
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,190
This is a tear stain.

00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,810
When San Mei was painting,

166
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:47,230
she must have shed tears of sadness

167
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:51,400
because she missed me too much.

168
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,010
It's a little hot.

169
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,900
Okay, okay.

170
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,500
Dad,

171
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:24,360
are you feeling better?

172
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,280
Daughter.

173
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,460
Dad.

174
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,130
You are pinning me down.

175
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,740
Dad, are you feeling better?

176
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:51,890
I now feel much better, apart from wanting to go to the bathroom.

177
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,540
It is cold.

178
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,790
Thank you.

179
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,180
You don't have to say that to me.

180
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:06,180
I should thank you anyway.

181
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:12,520
Dad, I should thank you.

182
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:17,860
I dreamed several times that my father had died.

183
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:23,480
But when I woke up, I found that my father was still here.

184
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,620
Yes.

185
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:28,360
It gave me a sense of lost and found.

186
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,370
So, Dad, thank you for giving me the opportunity

187
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,420
to show you filial piety.

188
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,150
San Mei,

189
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,070
if... I mean just in case...

190
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,080
If I weren't your...

191
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,080
Look. Liu Xuan Ming gave us so much money.

192
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:55,199
Guan, money! San Mei, we are rich now!

193
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,150
What is wrong with you?

194
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,969
Get well soon. I will buy you delicious food.

195
00:15:59,969 --> 00:16:02,140
What a fortune.

196
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,630
Princess Qi Meng, are these all for us?

197
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:12,550
Of course.

198
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:18,970
Princess Qi Meng, you are so generous.

199
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:25,100
Princess Qi Meng, how could we receive these?

200
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,740
Baby, does it look good on me?

201
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,710
Mom, you look gorgeous.

202
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:33,210
Nanny Ke, you are welcome.

203
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:36,180
Brother Xuan Ming has been under your care since childhood.

204
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,980
I should show filial respect to you.

205
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,910
Thank you, Princess.

206
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,710
Miss Ke, I really treat you like my own sister.

207
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:48,700
Just take them all.

208
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,580
Otherwise, we would be like strangers.

209
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,970
Princess Qi Meng, since you have said so,

210
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,080
if I push back, I won't be generous enough.

211
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,220
Baby, does it look good on me?

212
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,530
Mom, it fits me better.

213
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,819
- It fits me better.
- It fits me better!

214
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,579
Amazing, Sister Qian Yue.

215
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:16,680
Recently, have you heard anything about Xuan Ming and San Mei?

216
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:22,239
Whenever anyone mentions her, I get really angry.

217
00:17:22,239 --> 00:17:26,690
She not only framed me, but also seduced His Majesty.

218
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:31,050
I have to find a chance to punish her!

219
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,520
Sister, don't say that.

220
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,430
I think San Mei really likes Xuan Ming.

221
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,250
We can't be jealous.

222
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,270
Princess Qi Meng, you are right.

223
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,419
- Harmony is precious. Harmony is precious.
- Nonsense.

224
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:52,880
Qi Meng, you are way too innocent and kind.

225
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,580
San Mei is just a temptress.

226
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,740
Enough, look how angry Qian Yue is.

227
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,030
Well,

228
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:06,540
recently, 1,000 war horses arrived as dowry in Tian Mu City.

229
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:10,290
Xuan Ming and San Mei will go take a look.

230
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,260
Let's also watch the fun.

231
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,760
I am not going!

232
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,740
I get angry when I see that temptress!

233
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,419
Calm down. Just go with me and have a look.

234
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:24,850
The war horses of Tian Mu City are extremely temperamental.

235
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,090
Once when my father was on an inspection tour,

236
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:31,700
someone accidentally poked a war horse,

237
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:34,820
the horse immediately went crazy

238
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,250
and even kicked an attendant to death.

239
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,500
It is amazing.

240
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,240
Princess Qi Meng, your bracelet looks so nice.

241
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,350
If you like it, it is yours.

242
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,799
- Thank you, Princess. Thank you, Princess.
- And Qian Yue.

243
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:00,500
Whatever you like, just take it.

244
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:06,620
Since you said so, it would be disrespectful for us to decline.

245
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,789
Watch out. Don't drop anything.

246
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:16,489
Baby, just forget it.

247
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,550
You are not that temptress' opponent.

248
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,080
I have a way to deal with her.

249
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,760
Mom, Tian Mu City is really rich.

250
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,560
Just take them back.

251
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:31,670
I will use them as your dowry in the future.

252
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:40,510
Lord Liu.

253
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:43,110
To express our sincerity in the marriage,

254
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:49,180
Lord Yang Cheng sent 1,000 war horses as Qi Meng's dowry.

255
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,980
Brother Xuan Ming, do you like them?

256
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:59,450
The war horses of Tian Mu City live up to their reputation.

257
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:05,720
Everyone says Tian Mu City's war horses are unparalleled in the world.

258
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,400
It is a pity I don't know how to spot (pick) horses.

259
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,479
Bo Le once wrote a book named "Art of Spotting Horses," detailing how to choose a horse.

260
00:20:14,479 --> 00:20:16,820
I will teach you the easiest way.

261
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:21,870
A good horse has a protruding forehead, eyes like those of a frog,

262
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,160
and hooves like piles of distiller's yeast (lifting).

263
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,820
Judging by that, you can choose a good horse.

264
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:33,860
Brother Xuan Ming is really talented and knowledgeable.

265
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,930
That is just the simplest way of spotting horses.

266
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:44,650
To judge whether it is really a good horse,

267
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:49,470
you observe the horse's head, eyes, ears, mouth,

268
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:55,910
nose, chest, abdomen, spine, hooves, tail, hair, tendons,

269
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,100
skeleton, and flesh.

270
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,950
It turns out San Mei also knows how to spot horses.

271
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,140
It is nothing difficult. Even fools know how.

272
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,829
These are tribute horses from Tian Mu City. How could you ride them?

273
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,130
Nice horse.

274
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:40,570
With them, Xuan Yue City will double with might.

275
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,480
San Mei, watch out!

276
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,269
- Xuan Ming, watch out!
- Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

277
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:00,940
Your Majesty!

278
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,930
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

279
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,870
Brother Xuan Ming! Brother Xuan Ming!

280
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,790
Liu Xuan Ming, find a way to make it stop.

281
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,910
Liar!

282
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:33,610
You said that the horse would stop when it was tired.

283
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,000
But it got tired in water!

284
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,600
I am so cold!

285
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,250
I just met that horse so I am unfamiliar with it.

286
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,550
You said and did everything you could.

287
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:53,020
Now you say you are not familiar with it.

288
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:56,180
Someone doesn't even know how to speak.

289
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,920
You never did what you said, never understood what you did,

290
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,260
never listened to what you understood, and made mistakes,

291
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:05,300
but you never admitted a fault.

292
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:08,860
It's all your fault!

293
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:14,720
All right, I was wrong.

294
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:17,900
Even it can't stand anymore.

295
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,940
You are hungry.

296
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,140
You are hungry!

297
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,630
You never listened to others.

298
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:09,060
Tan Rang, look what I brought you.

299
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,960
I don't think I can see.

300
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,869
I went to the imperial clinic, and the imperial doctor prescribed this to treat your eyes.

301
00:24:18,869 --> 00:24:21,650
Five Qian (25 gr) of baby tangerine and three cups of pure water.

302
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:26,090
After at least one day, at most one 1,000 days, you will be healed.

303
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:30,250
I don't think I will believe you.

304
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:32,659
I am talking seriously. I am a princess.

305
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:35,230
How could a princess lie?

306
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,770
Are you willing to believe me one last time?

307
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,890
[Auspiciousness]

308
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,560
♫ Don't know why I can't let go ♫

309
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,600
♫ Even if my heart says so ♫

310
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,310
♫ Just look how far apart we've grown ♫

311
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:29,800
♫ We're like strangers now, to love again ♫

312
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,129
Look. I picked this with a lot of work.

313
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:37,780
How beautiful it is, just make do with it.

314
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,350
Mix them,

315
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,100
and have a try.

316
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,450
Here, have a sip.

317
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,770
Does it taste good?

318
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,190
Take more.

319
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:05,540
Here.

320
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,760
Have some more.

321
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,479
- Here.
- No, no.

322
00:26:13,479 --> 00:26:15,620
Take it yourself.

323
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,809
And one more... What is wrong with you, San Mei?

324
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:29,700
San Mei...

325
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,190
It is so sunny.

326
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:44,410
The sunshine!

327
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,280
What a good-looking man.

328
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,210
Kiss.

329
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:06,450
San Mei. San Mei.

330
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:08,240
Calm down, San Mei.

331
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,079
I am very conservative. I am very conservative!

332
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:12,670
San Mei.

333
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:17,740
If you keep doing this, I will take action.

334
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:30,610
Kiss me. Kiss me. Kiss me.

335
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:33,840
San Mei, I know your feelings.

336
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,770
However, the more distracted and swoony you are,

337
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:39,810
the more you should restrain yourself, return to propriety and doctrines of Confucius and Mencius.

338
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,899
As the old saying, "Certain things gentlemen do and don't do."

339
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:45,360
"A gentleman's actions are moral."

340
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,760
"A gentleman's words must be justified."

341
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,210
"A gentleman's conduct is in line with justice."

342
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,330
"A gentleman, must be honest when poor, righteous when he is rich,"

343
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:55,350
"kind to the living, and mournful to the dead."

344
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,340
"These virtues cannot be fake, but truly possessed."

345
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,510
"His behavior is extremely humble, and his speech is very tame."

346
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:07,450
"Those who let these virtues flow freely in the limbs and skin,"

347
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:10,770
"refuse to give up before gray hair or baldness, and are likely saints!"

348
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:16,360
"As the old saying, certain things gentlemen do and don't do."

349
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,760
Your Majesty!

350
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,430
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

351
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:24,840
- Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

352
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,000
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

353
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,880
Your Majesty!

354
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,460
Liu Xuan Ming, what did you do to me last night?

355
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:51,200
Did you forget about last night?

356
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,110
What happened last night?

357
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,040
San Mei. San Mei.

358
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,560
Calm down, San Mei.

359
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,990
I am very conservative.

360
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,240
- Over there.
- Yes.

361
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,790
Let's go!

362
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,260
Don't be shy.

363
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:29,300
It is normal to be mesmerized by my looks.

364
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,709
Wow, so exciting.

365
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,840
Stop crying.

366
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,580
Yao Hu.

367
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:58,700
It will never be your turn to cry.

368
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:09,300
The tribute horses of Tian Mu City are a lavish gift.

369
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,610
Ke Qian Yue from the inner city

370
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:16,820
hurt the ponytail, disregarded law and discipline.

371
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,860
She went against law and reason and is full of evil.

372
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:27,550
According to law, she will be punished by washing thousands of horses

373
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:30,350
to serve as an example to others.

374
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:37,420
Mr. Horse, I will wash your crapper in a while.

375
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,600
Don't kick me.

376
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,570
Have you heard?

377
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,210
His Majesty and San Mei were in rags in the grove,

378
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:49,370
and they got discovered by Yao Hu and Princess Qi Meng.

379
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,210
Shall we go to the grove tonight?

380
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,870
I have a juicy story.

381
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:13,200
His Majesty and San Mei were in the grove...

382
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,250
- I am too embarrassed to say it.
- Is it true?

383
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:22,170
The birds in the forest were stunned and all flew away.

384
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:25,670
Even the nearby mountains trembled.

385
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:29,760
His Majesty and San Mei made a solemn pledge of love.

386
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,820
His Majesty promised to marry San Mei.

387
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,659
Listen. Keep it a secret.

388
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:39,710
Don't worry; my lips are sealed.

389
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:42,020
Come here. Let me tell you.

390
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:48,410
His Majesty and San Mei were having fun last night in the grove.

391
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:52,210
- Is it true?
- Their clothes were torn off.

392
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:57,090
And they were caught by Miss Ke on the spot. Don't tell anyone else.

393
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:59,500
Don't worry. I will keep it to myself.

394
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,069
Come here. Let me tell you a secret.

395
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:05,190
Don't tell anyone else.

396
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,250
It is so embarrassing.

397
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:10,660
The imperial doctor has checked on San Mei

398
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:14,450
and said she got impregnated by His Majesty.

399
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,690
Bai Lu, you bullied San Mei before.

400
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,200
You are done for!

401
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:36,540
Daughter, how could you do such an absurd thing as a girl?

402
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,950
You are embarrassing us.

403
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,720
Dad, how could I—

404
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,470
San Mei, stop making excuses!

405
00:32:42,470 --> 00:32:45,520
Now no man will be your husband!

406
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,180
It shouldn't be, but everyone knows it.

407
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,030
It is the same!

408
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:53,530
San Mei, I don't want to blame you...

409
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:56,110
But you are a girl.

410
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,640
A girl must value her good name.

411
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,389
Enough, save it.

412
00:33:00,389 --> 00:33:02,100
So embarrassing!

413
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,210
I am ashamed for you.

414
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:08,280
Gosh.

415
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,130
Domestic shame shouldn't be public.

416
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:13,570
You embarrassed the Guan Family!

417
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,999
Now the news you are pregnant has spread in the city.

418
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,830
Do you believe it?

419
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,510
Of course, I don't believe it.

420
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:12,080
How could you do such a thing?

421
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:18,169
You have no idea the exaggerated rumors in the city these days.

422
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,650
In a few days, I guess I can be a grandma!

423
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,610
Why are you laughing?

424
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,300
Isn't that good?

425
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:35,889
Haven't you noticed inner city servants are respectful to you now?

426
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:39,510
In a few days, you can walk around Xuan Yue City sideways.

427
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,769
Why should I walk in Xuan Yue City sideways?

428
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:44,760
How about flipping around

429
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,870
vertically, walking in the sky?

430
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,850
How do I walk in the sky?

431
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,020
So naïve...

432
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,630
I washed the horses all day today.

433
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:51,640
Xuan Ming and San Mei really love each other.

434
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,680
We should be happy for them.

435
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,850
"Be happy for them"?

436
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:00,960
Princess Qi Meng, you are so innocent.

437
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,940
I can't wait to kill that temptress.

438
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,130
Maybe it is my fate.

439
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:11,050
No one could manage it with effort,

440
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,140
just like some people live long

441
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,890
and others live short lives.

442
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:21,420
Some people don't die if they fall off a cliff.

443
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,020
Some people get choked to death by drinking tea.

444
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,290
I really hope that tea can choke her to death.

445
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,770
There is no poison in the tea.

446
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:39,220
How could you kill her?

447
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,279
San Mei, Miss Ke was ignorant before and offended you.

448
00:36:53,279 --> 00:36:56,340
She ordered me to make this hangover tea.

449
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,070
Please pardon her.

450
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:07,550
Snobs like you are everywhere.

451
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:11,560
I don't have enough time to be angry with any of you.

452
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:16,350
I must stay on my knees till you drink this tea.

453
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,950
Have you poisoned the tea?

454
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,400
I...

455
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,950
- I...
- I dare you!

456
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:11,190
