30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,099
His Lordship wasn't in court a long time. He must be better now.
[Bright Moon and Cool Breeze]

31
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:18,189
Even if he isn't, we should meet him at least once.

32
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:22,249
- Yes, we'd like to see His Lordship.
- Yes, we'd like to see His Lordship.

33
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:27,139
His Lordship is in poor health. Please wait a few more days.

34
00:02:27,139 --> 00:02:30,280
When he's recovered, he will surely call for you.

35
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,899
Eunuch Sun, it is rumored His Lordship is missing. Is that true?

36
00:02:34,899 --> 00:02:37,989
Don't listen to rumors.

37
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,819
We'll see if it's a rumor or not.

38
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,119
- Move aside!
- How dare you!
- Ministers.

How could you be so presumptuous at the Lord's bedchamber door?

General Jin Fu, we're worried about His Lordship.

41
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,759
We'll be assured once we see His Lordship.

42
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,730
- That's right.
- His Lordship is still recuperating.

43
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,019
Are you trying to rebel by causing an uproar?

44
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,339
General, we just want to see His Lordship once to set our minds at ease.

45
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:06,900
Yes.

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,540
I already consulted the imperial physician when I came.
[Bright Moon and Cool Breeze]

47
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,639
His Lordship is almost recovered.

48
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,230
He can meet you tomorrow.

49
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:19,760
Can't you wait even one more day?

50
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,179
General Jin Fu, we're worried about His Lordship.

51
00:03:23,179 --> 00:03:24,779
Let us see him just once.

52

Let us see him just once.

53
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,360
General, is there any news from His Lordship?

54
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,760
I mobilized all forces to search everywhere.

55

56

Where is His Lordship now?

57
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,820
His Lordship is injured and is still recuperating at the General's Manor.

58
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,200
Tomorrow, I will arrange for His Lordship to be escorted back.

59
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,180
Thank you, General.

60
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,060
It is rumored that you are disloyal to His Lordship.

61
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,940
I thought your search for His Lordship was just superficial.

62
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,309
I never expected you to be so devoted to His Lordship.

63
00:04:10,309 --> 00:04:13,059
His Lordship will surely reward you once he returns.

64
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,870
I'll clean up the place right away to prepare for His Lordship's return.

65
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,540
Arrange for San Mei to enter the palace tomorrow.

66
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,969
Are we really not seeking the Golden Seal anymore?

67
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,540
No need. With Ye Zhao Nan here, I don't need the Golden Seal anymore.

68
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:37,629
Once Guan San Mei ascends the throne and personally abdicates in favor of me,

69
00:04:37,629 --> 00:04:39,770
it will be perfectly legitimate.

70
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:42,999
General, aren't you afraid she won't listen to you after taking Ye Zhao Nan's position?

71
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:44,600
What is there to fear?

72
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:50,000
Don't forget that Ye Zhao Nan is a man, but she is a woman.

73
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,480
If we threaten her with this, she can't do anything.

74
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,330
You are so clever, General.

75
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,559
Get some valuables from the treasury

76
00:05:00,559 --> 00:05:02,529
and present them to those ministers.

77
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,490
During the handover of the throne, I will need their support.

78
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,870
Yes.

79
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,869
Why did Jin Fu ask you to impersonate Ye Zhao Nan?

80
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,830
Where did the real Ye Zhao Nan go?

81
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:22,140
The real Ye Zhao Nan is missing.

82
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,780
How did he go missing?

83
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,790
Mu Xi people are cunning.

84
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,860
It's likely not as simple as it seems.

85
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,010
Therefore, I'll impersonate Ye Zhao Nan to investigate.

86
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:36,870
But you are a woman.

87
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:44,500
General Jin Fu said that I look very similar to Ye Zhao Nan.

88
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,049
He has long intended to rebel but didn't have any legitimate reasons.

89
00:05:49,049 --> 00:05:51,529
It happened that Ye Zhao Nan disappeared.

90
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,389
So he wants me to act as Ye Zhao Nan and enter the palace.

91
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:58,760
Do you look like Ye Zhao Nan?

92
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,920
Well...

93
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,400
it's normal for people to look alike.

94
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,880
You just look like him.

95
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,740
Those who long served him will find out.

96
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,460
No way.

97
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,349
It's too dangerous. What if something happens to you?

98
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,030
Follow me back to Xuan Yue now.

99
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,759
No, Jin Fu already arranged it all.

100
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:29,999
He bribed the people around Ye Zhao Nan. I won't be found out.

101
00:06:29,999 --> 00:06:31,500
Absolutely not.

102
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,530
Please.

00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,140
Fine.

107
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,040
You're so stubborn.

108
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:24,780
If that's the case, I will stay here to protect you.

109

113
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:49,390
Envoy Guan, this is the money used to bribe the court's important officials.

114
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:54,220
As you know, General is powerful in Mu Xi City.

115
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:56,880
He has to manage some of the ministers.

116
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,180
Of course.

117
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,259
Envoy Guan, have a good rest.

118
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,690
You're going into the inner city tomorrow.

119
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:06,180
Thank you, Vice General Zhou.

120
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:19,210
To which officials will they give the money?

121
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,810
Forget it. It has nothing to do with us.

122
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:26,640
Find out which ministers are with Jin Fu

123
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:32,210
so we can gain confidential information about Mu Xi City's court.

124
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,760
What San Mei said makes sense.

125
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,789
Why are you everywhere?

126
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,480
San Mei's business is my business.

127
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,979
Don't worry, San Mei. I'll check it out for you.

128
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,650
No need to trouble Yi Yang Jun.

129
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,700
Such a large flow of accounts is sure to be recorded.

130
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,450
Leave it to me.

131
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,339
Guess whom I saw at General's Manor just now?

132
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,530
- Who?
- Liu Xuan Ming.
[Prosperity of Offspring]

133
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,670
"Liu Xuan Ming"?

134
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:09,539
He's so annoying.

135
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,849
We finally left Xuan Yue City. Why do we still have to face him?

136
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:16,300
It seems Liu Xuan Ming is the type to get infatuated easily.

137
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:20,200
Well, that's because San Mei is so attractive.

138
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:24,819
I can't stand it anymore. The smell of the corpse is getting worse.

139
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:26,429
- I can't bear it.
- What are you doing?

140
00:09:26,429 --> 00:09:28,350
You must get used to it.

141
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,220
I was just getting used to it. I can't do it.

142
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,469
- What's wrong?
- He influenced me.

143
00:09:34,469 --> 00:09:36,069
I'm still eating.

144
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,899
Then go ahead and eat with the smell. I acknowledge you.

145
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,870
Brother Zhao.

146
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,990
The rope is hurting me.

147
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,590
Could you untie me?

148
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,710
Brother Zhao, please.

149
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,250
All right.

150
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,499
I asked around. This is General Jin Fu's study.

Here, thanks for your hard work.

155

We are from Xuan Yue.

156
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:29,499
It's our first time here, and we don't know fun places in Mu Xi City.

157
00:11:29,499 --> 00:11:32,100
What do you want to do?

158
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,910
What is there?

159
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,939
If you have money, you can do anything.

160
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,819
"Anything"? Like what?

161
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:39,220
That.

162
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,340
What?

163
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,850
That.

164
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:43,900
What?

165
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,490
Who is this?

166
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,470
So ugly.

167
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,470
Stop hiding.

168
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,320
- What are you doing here?
- I'm doing something.

169
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,580
You keep hanging around me.

170
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,099
In the future, when I capture San Mei's heart and take her with me,

171
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:28,360
you couldn't see me even if you want to.

172
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,780
Why would I... want to see you?

173
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,720
How will we find it on these bookshelves?

174
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,250
The dust is thicker than snow.

175
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,230
It seems Jin Fu is a pretentious and arty person.

176
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:48,200
The more rich and powerful people are,

177
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,150
the more they fear others will mock their ignorance.

178
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:55,509
They want all to think their wealth and power comes from their talent,

179
00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:58,160
not since they are lucky.

180
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,580
Don't you need to read them one by one?

181
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,860
Goods were taken from the warehouse today so records would be updated.

182
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,280
Just look for one without dust on it.

183
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,009
No dust is on this book.
[Unspeakable Things between Me and the General]

184
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,880
I was looking for this book a long time.

185
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,740
Good for Jin Fu.

186
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,880
Indecency.

187
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,559
Pretend, pretend all you want. We are both men.

188
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:41,670
Can't you be honest about your preferences?

189

191
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,610
What are you doing?

192
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:59,229
- Let me see if this is General Manor's account book.
- There's no need.

193
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:02,789
We found it together. It shouldn't be yours alone.

194
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:10,450
Back when you and Qi Meng schemed, I spared your life.

195
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,430
You should be grateful.

196
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,099
Due to this, I accompanied San Mei all the way to Mu Xi.

197
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:18,980
Is that repaying me?

198
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,090
- Do you like San Mei?
- Yes.

199
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:24,909
- If San Mei is happy, you will be happy, right?
- Yes.

200
00:14:24,909 --> 00:14:27,120
I can make San Mei happy.

201
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,360
When San Mei is happy, you will be happy so I'll repay you this way.

202
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,920
Do you believe what you say?

203
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,060
Totally.

204
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,490
You are crazy, right?

205
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,170

[Unspeakable Things between Me and the General]

207

General, the men's clothing tailored for Guan San Mei is ready.

208
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:11,440
Also, news came from Xuan Yue City; an assassin sent to handle Tan Rang was killed.

209
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,970
Tan Rang is terrible!

210
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:16,169
If not for his inability, I would have Mu Xi's Golden Seal long ago!

211
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:21,939
Send more people. My hatred can't dissipate unless he is torn to pieces.

212
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:08,910
Princess Yun Luo, dinner is ready.

213
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,850
Coming.

214
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,850
Here.

215
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:25,870
Did you make all these?

216
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,650
Do you know how to cook?

217
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,430
I was neglected by my father since childhood.

218
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,260
So I often cook by myself.

219
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,230
You two are twins, but one is so dignified and virtuous,

220
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:44,480
and the other was so vicious.

221
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,250
But you are miserable enough as a princess.

222
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,580
Let's not mention this.

223
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,350
Try it.

224
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,179
I will eat later. You should eat first.

225
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,230
Are you worried about your lover?

226
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,699
It's getting late.

227
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,330
Could harm have happened to him?

228
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,060
Then why don't you go find him?

229
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:19,570
I heard Guan San Mei, Xuan Yue City's envoy, is now at General's Manor.

230
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,120
You can go find her.

231
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:25,620
I only heard she came to Mu Xi City for peace talks,

232
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,890
but I didn't hear she's staying at General's Manor.

233
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,819
After coming to Mu Xi City, I heard it from street folks.

234
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:35,699
Then I'll find my sister. Come with me.

235
00:17:35,699 --> 00:17:37,610
I am not going.

236
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,010
Qi Meng killed the envoy's sworn sister.

237
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,210
She...

238
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,140
she won't want to see me.

239
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,580
Never mind. You and Qi Meng are different people.

240
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,610
My sister can tell black from white.

241
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,580
I'll wait for you here in case I make her uncomfortable.

242
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,360
But...

243
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:03,380
You should go to General's Manor and speak to her.

244
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:08,000
If she doesn't bear grudges, send someone to inform me, and I will be there.

245
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,150
You are so understanding.

246
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:13,520
In that case, wait here for me.

247
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,750
[General's Manor]

248
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:31,070
I didn't expect so many ministers receive money from Jin Fu.

249
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:36,219
It shows we must not belittle Jin Fu's power in court.

250
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,809
Not necessarily. Many people follow Jin Fu due to his power.

251
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:45,179
If they think Jin Fu is powerful, the more they will side with him.

252
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:49,170
This cycle goes on and on like a snowball,

253
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,840
but this snowball may fail.

254
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,760
When a tree falls, monkeys scatter.

255
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,690
We need only defeat this tree directly;

256
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,460
those who depend on it will be useless.

257
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,930
This name list is extremely important.

258
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:07,290
At least now we know our friends and foes.

259
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:11,569
We should quickly copy it and return it, lest Jin Fu finds out.

260
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:13,789
I write fast. Leave it to me.

261
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:15,470
It will be done quickly.

262
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:19,160
I also write rapidly.

263
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,930
What are you two doing here?

264
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,160
San Mei is my future wife.

265
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,140
You don't have to concern yourself with her business.

266
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,830
You said "future."

267
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,630
No one is sure whose wife she will be in the future.

268
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,210
Yi Yang Jun!

269
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:38,060
You must be respectful when speaking to our lord!

270
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,070
Our lord is...

271
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,880
is...

272
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,980
is... is...

273
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:51,449
His skill, wisdom, looks, and courage are unprecedented (unique) in the world.

274
00:19:51,449 --> 00:19:54,220
And you are just a bit handsome.

275
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,729
If you dare disrespect our lord again, don't blame my discourtesy!

276
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,640
I'd like to see what you will do.

277
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:08,510
San Mei!

278
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,160
This...

279
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,029
- Brother, what is it?
- I just heard Tan Rang entered General's Manor

280
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:14,690
and was arrested by General Jin Fu.

281
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:15,860
What?

282
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,670
Did you see Yun Luo?

283
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,760
No.

284
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,730
Given Yun Luo's temperament, if Tan Rang came, she followed.

285
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,740
I'm going for Jin Fu now.

286
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,109
- I am also going.
- Yi Yang Jun.

287
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,180
It's awkward for you to go.

288
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,330
Yao Hu.

289
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,100
You are way too impulsive. Stay here for now.

290
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,840
Yes.

291
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,429
Please take good care of San Mei.

292
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:47,899
Yi Yang Jun, I advise you not to compete with our lord anymore.

293
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:54,180
You can't beat a talent like our lord, unparalleled in intelligence and courage.

294
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,200
He dared to disobey my orders and even returned to kill me.

295
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,720
If I don't deal with him, how can I gain authority?

296
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:12,169
He is the lover of my sworn sister, Xuan Yue City's Princess Yun Luo.

297
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:15,530
I have to save him.

298
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:22,620
If you refuse, I'm afraid I can't help you, either.

299
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,960
I didn't expect Tan Rang to end up with a princess.

300
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,860
But I hate being threatened the most.

301
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:36,459
This is Mu Xi City. Your lives are in my hands.

302
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,679
Tan Rang broke the rules of General's Manor, and he must die!

303
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,460
I am not threatening you.

304
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,480
Tan Rang is just a blind assassin now. No benefit is in killing him.

305
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,169
But if you keep him, he will have a chance to become Xuan Yue City's future son-in-law.

306
00:21:55,169 --> 00:22:00,310
There is only good for you and nothing bad.

307
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:05,160
The top priority is tomorrow's business.

308
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,140
As long as others do not suspect you,

309
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:12,110
and you follow my instructions to read the edict of abdication,

310
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:13,710
I will consider letting Tan Rang go.

311
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:16,000
I want to see Tan Rang.

312
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:21,630
Just once.

313
00:22:21,630 --> 00:22:26,150
Surely you can do me a small favor?

314
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,760
This way.

315
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:44,949
- Who's that?
- Tan Rang, it's us.

316
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,460
I can tell.

317
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,079
Yun Luo, you have come.

318
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:53,470
Your hearing is terrible.

319
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,430
I'm Guan San Mei.

320
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,730
- Where is Yun Luo?
- Yun Luo is at my house. Go look for her quickly.

321
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,949
Don't worry. We'll get you out soon.

322
00:23:01,949 --> 00:23:03,259
I'm fine.

323
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:06,920
I fear if I stay out too long, Yun Luo will look for me. Go quickly.

324
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,429
You asked us to look for her quickly, but you didn't say where your house is!

325
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,300
I...

326
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,820
[General's Manor]

327
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:22,500
Tan Rang, please don't let harm happen to you.

328
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:26,190
[General's Manor]

329
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,179
Sir,

330
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,759
please report that I'd like to see Guan San Mei, Xuan Yue City's envoy.

331
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:37,480
Who are you?

332
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,280
Tell her I am an old friend of hers from Xuan Yue City.

333
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,850
Please.

334
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,339
All right, wait here for a while.

335
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:57,360
Thank you, Sir.
[General's Manor]

336
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:06,910
Vice General Zhou.

337
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,980
You are supposed to be inside guarding the coffin. What are you doing out here?

338
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,289
Well, no one brought us food this evening.

339
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:14,609
We are hungry; I went to the kitchen to get some rice.

340
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:16,890
Who allowed you to come out without permission?

341
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:20,510
- Would you starve to death if you skipped a meal?
- No, well...

342
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:24,079
Vice General Zhou, your rank is higher than mine,

343
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:25,999
but I'm an old man.

344
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,410
I should be around your father's age.

345
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,970
Shouldn't you show me some respect?

346
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,260
"Respect"? "Respect"?

347
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:36,010
Are you taking advantage of your seniority?

348
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,220
Are you hungry? Eat it.

349
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,390
Eat it!

350
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:42,580
Go and watch the coffin!

351
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,060
You!

352
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,000
Vice General.

353
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,270
Are you rushing to a funeral?

354
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,399
A girl from Xuan Yue City is at the entrance to meet Envoy Guan.

355
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:03,690
Henceforth, if anyone comes from Xuan Yue City,

356
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:08,809
or if someone wants to meet the envoy, report to me first.

357
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:11,160
Don't just let her meet anyone,

358
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,530
as if General's Manor is the entrance of Xuan Yue City.

359
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,819
Understood. Vice General Zhou,

360
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:20,170
the girl at the entrance...

361
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,230
I'll take a look. Go.

362
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,010
[General's Manor]

363
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,040
Who wants to meet Envoy Guan?

364
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,680
I do.

365
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,560
I will take you there.

366
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,420
Miss, please.

367
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:47,240
Thank you.

368
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:57,629
Let me out. Let me out.

369
00:25:57,629 --> 00:25:59,859
What exactly is your problem?

370
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,270
I want to poo.

371
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,639
Please. I can't hold it anymore.

372
00:26:03,639 --> 00:26:08,640
As a girl, can't you be more cultured in the way you speak?

373
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,220
My butt feels like throwing up.

374
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,919
Enough. Say whatever you want, all right.

375
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,929
Listen. You wanted to run away during the day. Do you think I will trust you now?

376
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:28,759
See? I said I can't hold it anymore. Let me out.

377
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:31,610
You are so unrefined!

378
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,640
Gosh!

379
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:43,339
Just use this. There is no way I will let you out.

380
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:47,300
But I'm like this.

381
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,780
So annoying, really annoying.

382
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,389
Wait. Listen, Zhao Jing is not here now.

383
00:26:56,389 --> 00:26:59,480
If you try to escape, no one can save you.

384
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:04,799
I can't run now. Untie me.

385
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,260
[Prosperity of Offspring]

386
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:13,670
How dare he abuse his power like that!

387
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:18,410
If I get a chance one day, I will pluck all your nose hairs!

388
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:22,510
I'll let you know who your dad is!

389
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:26,920
Hurry up, I can't hold it anymore.

390
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,700
Soon. You are so annoying.

391
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,750
Come on.

392
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:46,219
How did Zhao Jing tie you up? I'm exhausted.

393
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,079
- Zhao Jing.
- Ke Qian Yue!

394
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,539
Why didn't you keep an eye on her?
[Prosperity of Offspring]

395
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,139
- Ke Qian Yue!
- Feng Lei.

396
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:02,050
- Go after her.
- Stop!

397
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:06,170
How dare you hit me? Stop!

398
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,210
Where is the envoy?

399
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:24,169
As long as you serve me well, not to mention meeting the envoy,

400
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,840
you can even meet His Lordship.

401
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,009
Calm down first.

402
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:31,580
Yun Luo is also my sister. I will look for her with you.

403
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:36,709
If anything happens to Yun Luo, I will kill Tan Rang with my own hands before Jin Fu does.

404
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,960
My Lord!

405
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,220
