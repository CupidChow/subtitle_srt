00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,200
I couldn't hold back from your handsome face!

166
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,700
You really take advantage of everything!

00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,000
Yes.

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,600
Have you ever... kissed a woman?

172
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,700
Yes.

173
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,900
Even you have experienced it?

174
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,800
It's nothing special.

175
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,500
When I was young, I once kissed...

176
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,300
Butcher Zhang... his daughter from my same village.

177
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,600
That feeling...

178
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Her lips were soft.

179
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,100
The taste was sweet.

180
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,600
It felt warm and moist.

181
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's hard to describe it.

182
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,000
Isn't it just two lips?

- Yao Hu.
- Yes.

184
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,800
- Get out!
- Yes.

185
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,700
Princess Yun Luo, we meet again.

186
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,200
Why are you here?

187
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,500
I was looking for you everywhere.

188
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,600
Are you okay?

189
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Poor Guy.

190
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,800
You are really good at pretending.

191
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,400
I am a princess.

192
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,700
Princesses never lie.

193
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,800
What... what do you want to do?

194
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,700
Do you think I'll trust you again?

195
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,000
Princess, Princess.

196
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,500
Listen carefully. Get the Wound-healing Powder ready.

197
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,700
I will come again tonight.

198
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:40,000
If you tell anyone else about this, you know what will happen.

199
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,600
Brother Xuan Ming,

200
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,800
where are Old Dowager and Princess Yun Luo?

201
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,100
Yun Luo is tired from playing today so she went back to rest.

202
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,200
Mother thinks we would be reserved and not drink our fill with her around.

203
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,800
I came to Xuan Yue City with my father when I was still a child.

204
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,800
I remember that Old Dowager took special care of me,

205
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:19,400
and you often spent time with me.

206
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,600
You even gave me a little white rabbit.

207
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:27,100
It's a pity that it drowned in the Imperial Garden.

208
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,600
Qi Meng often brings this up and is always very sad about it.

209
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,000
It seems Lord Liu should give Princess Qi Meng another rabbit.

210
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,700
Tomorrow, I will get someone to find a beautiful white rabbit.

211
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,000
You are so nice, Brother Xuan Ming.

212
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,300
My Lord, Guan San Mei has arrived.

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,900
Ask her in.

214
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,500
Ask Guan San Mei in.

"You'd find her either at Celestial Mountains peak"

216

"or on the Jadeite Terrace under a heavenly moon."

217
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:31,100
What a beauty in Xuan Yue City.

218
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,200
Sister San Mei is so beautiful.

219
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,600
It seems I should give up the title of "Beauty of the City" to you.

Restrain your temper before the envoy.

00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:35,600
how can you be so different from day to night?

232
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,200
Am I?

233
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,300
Like Princess Qi Meng, I think and act in the same way.

234

Lord Liu,

235
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,800
Qi Meng is already in Xuan Yue.

236
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:24,800
When will you fulfill your promises of ceding Er City and offering 100,000 taels of gold

237
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,400
as betrothal gifts?

238
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,500
Regarding the betrothal gifts, San Mei can represent me fully.

239
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
If that's the case,

240
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,000
what's your opinion, San Mei?

241
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,600
"Ceding the city"?

242
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,000
No, I don't want to.

243
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,400
I am so afraid.

244

San Mei, are you joking around?

245
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Not at all.

246
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:00,100
Every part of our land, no matter how small, belongs to our ancestors.

247
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,700
Our ancestors fought hard to protect the land and pass it down to our generation.

248
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:06,800
If we lose any of it, we will feel guilty toward our ancestors

249
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,200
and toward our descendants.

250
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:17,800
How dare we do something to go down in disgraceful history?

251
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,800
Lord Liu.

252
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,800
Lord Liu, you've promised to cede the land and offer gold,

253

How can we go forth with the marriage?

Then what does Yi Yang Jun think we should do?

256
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,999
You play dumb and feign innocence now!

257
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,200
What do you mean?

258
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:50,800
Yi Yang Jun, calm down.

259
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:55,700
Look at the full moon tonight... It's crescent-shaped.

260
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,100
Let's only talk of romance tonight, not political affairs.

261
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,300
Right. Romance only.

262
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,600
I really admire San Mei's overwhelming presence and confidence tonight.

263

At tonight's banquet, would you like to have a wine battle with me?

264

You two can challenge me together.

265
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,700
As long as you two defeat me, I am all yours.

266

If I win, San Mei will be at my disposal.

Brother Xuan Ming, just ignore him.

268

What about an exception today?

00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,400
- Come on.
- Come on.

332
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,800
Round One.

333
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,300
One more.

334
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,400
Come on.

335
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,300
Drink.

336
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,600
Round Two.

337
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,400
Yi Yang Jun.

338
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,800
Come on.

339
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,700
Cheers!

340
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,000
Cheers.

341
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Who's afraid?

342
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,000
Go ahead.

343
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,200
Come on.

344
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,900
Here!

345
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,700
K.O. (knockout)

346
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,300
You've lost.

347
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,900
Sister San Mei, let's just forget it.

348
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,800
One should be willing to admit defeat.

349
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,900
Do you dare to drink with me?

350
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,800
I'm going to strip you naked

351
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,700
and throw you onto the street for people to see.

352
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,500
Go away.

353
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,200
Don't move.

354
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,900
I didn't specially prepare this hangover medicine for you.

355
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,400
I just happen to have it on me.

356
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,900
Understood?

357
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,800
Yi Yang Jun,

358
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,000
how do you dare bully Liu Xuan Ming?

359
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,600
I'll make you drink till you drop.

360
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,500
All right, I know.

361
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,400
Drink till you drop.

362
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:08,500
How do you even drink like a fish?

363
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,800
M-My Lord, y-you are the lord.

364
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,000
How could you carry her? Your shoulders carry the whole city.

365
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,100
Leave her to me.

366
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
- No need.
- You are so drunk.

367
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,300
- Leave her to me.
- No need.

368
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,800
You will be tired.

369
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,000
I said, "No need!"

370
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,700
Which jerk did this?

371
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,700
How dare you!

372
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,700
How do you dare call His Lordship a jerk?

373
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,800
You!

374
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,000
My Lord, please order me at once to execute this traitor who attacked you!

375
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,700
- Yao Hu.
- Yes!

376
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,300
I'd like to have you executed at once.

377
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,100
Wait, this...

378
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,500
Th-The traitor... a-attacked you.

379
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,100
My Lord!

380
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,600
How do you dare bully Liu Xuan Ming?

381
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,800
I'll make you drink till you drop.

382
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:41,100
Brother, my... my pants are falling off.

383
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:43,400
Brother, my pants are falling off!

384
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,310

387
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,000
♫ She has forgotten all about the past ♫

388
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,070
♫ The Milky Way is far distant ♫

389

♫ That day, by some mistake ♫

390
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,700
Sorry! I couldn't hold back from your handsome face!

♫ It's unpredictable ♫

393
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
- Daughter.
- Is everything going well?

394
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,000
Yes. San Mei's plan is flawless.

395
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:40,100
I've successfully sneaked into the Tasting Room and put poison in the wine.

396
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:46,900
Then tonight is the best time for us to kill Liu Xuan Ming.

397
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,000
San Mei.

398
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,300
- Will Ke Qian Yue believe that we can enter the Tasting Room?
- That's right.

399
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:10,800
People are more inclined to believe what they want to believe rather than facts.

400
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,200
When she wants to go after me,

401
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,800
she will believe anything as long as it is against me.

402
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,800
So as long as she mobilizes the palace guards

403
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,700
and shifts all their attention to the dinner banquet...

404
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,200
My Lord, wait!

405
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,000
The wine was poisoned.

406
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,500
The defenses in other places will become very weak.

407
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,800
Big Brother.

408
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:38,200
Take the key I stole and sneak into his bedchamber to do the assassination.

409
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:42,100
After that, you will leave through the tunnel.

410
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,500
By that time, the tunnel should have filled with spring water.

411
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:50,000
You are a good swimmer. Only you can swim away.

412

Yi Yang Jun.

413
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,900
Did you slap me?

414
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,200
Yi Yang Jun.

415
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,500
Let's not forget why we came here in the first place.

416
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,100
Liu Xuan Ming, I didn't want this to happen.

417
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:54,800
I can only blame it on our fate.
