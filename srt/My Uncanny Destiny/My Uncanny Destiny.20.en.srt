General, what are you doing?

"What am I doing?"

30
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,690
Since you don't act like a lord, don't blame me for not acting like a minister!

[My Uncanny Destiny: Episode 20]

32
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,230
Vice General Zhou. What are you doing?

33
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,810
Kill this impostor.

34
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,940
Jin Fu. How dare you rebel?

35
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:42,389
Liu Xuan Ming already knew your sexual harassment of Princess Yun Luo.

36
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:45,230
He specially issued an imperial edict.

37
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:50,688
Did Liu Xuan Ming really make me his brother-in-law?
[Imperial Edict]

38
00:02:50,688 --> 00:02:53,400
But I sexually harassed his sister.

39
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,230
Liu Xuan Ming is stubborn.

40
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,280
Yun Luo and you had intimate relations.

41
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,059
He will naturally marry Yun Luo to you.

42
00:03:01,059 --> 00:03:05,359
But you're just a vice general, and you aren't good enough for Yun Luo,

43
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:10,700
unless you replace General Jin Fu.

44
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,000
Do you want to always be inferior?

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,009
But you are just a pawn of Jin Fu.

46
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,409
You idiot. You were fooled by them.

47
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,060
Am I an idiot?

48
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,890
General.

49
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:30,520
You cut off my blessed ear just like that!

50
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:34,319
You were not benevolent first. Don't blame me for being unrighteous.

51
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,570
Soon I will become the general of Mu Xi City

52
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:43,439
and the Lord of Xuan Yue City's brother-in-law.

53
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,120
What a fool!

54
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,460
I put medicine in your bean soup early in the morning.

55
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,770
Have a good sleep.

Stop talking nonsense. Drag him out.

58
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,249
Vice General Zhou. You made a great contribution today.

59
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:09,180
What reward do you want?

60
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,539
Your Majesty.

61
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:14,650
I dare not be greedy as long as you keep your promise.

62
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,430
"Promise"?

63
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,660
What did I promise you?

64
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,620
The position of the general of Mu Xi City and the Lord of Xuan Yue City's brother-in-law.

65
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,780
It's easy for you to become the general of Mu Xi City.

66
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:38,360
But why the Lord of Xuan Yue City's brother-in-law?

67
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:42,030
Did you forget?

68
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:44,090
I have Liu Xuan Ming's personal edict.

69
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,900
Show us.

70
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,769
- Present the edict!
- Yes.

71
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:55,199
Liu Xuan Ming betrothed his younger sister, Princess Yun Luo, to me and made me his brother-in-law.

72
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,719
Vice General Zhou. Louder.

73
00:04:56,719 --> 00:05:01,380
Let all Mu Xi's ministers hear what is written in it.

74
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:09,009
Liu Xuan Ming personally canonized me as the husband of the princess of Xuan Yue City.

75
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,709
Isn't this a traitor?

76
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,359
You are a traitor.

77
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,609
Traitor!

78
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:17,910
You are shameless with wild ambition.

79
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:24,739
You are the general of Mu Xi City. How dare you accept Liu Xuan Ming's canonization?

80
00:05:24,739 --> 00:05:26,659
How can soldiers of three armies in Mu Xi City

81
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,310
tolerate you, a traitor allying with the enemy and betraying the country?

82
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,520
Since you contributed to Mu Xi City,

83
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,510
you are spared a death penalty.

84
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,749
But you will be punished. Someone.

85
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:41,799
Take him to castrate.

86
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,610
I have an edict.

87
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,009
You told me that yourself. You gave it to me personally.

88
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:51,960
Don't touch me. I'm General of Mu Xi City and Xuan Yue City Lord's brother-in-law!

89
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,899
Let me go. I'm General of Mu Xi City and Xuan Yue City Lord's brother-in-law!

90
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,940
Let me go!

91
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:07,730
I found this roster of bribed ministers in the General's Manor.

92
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,410
It should be fake.

93
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,549
Yes.

94
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,849
Right.

95
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,709
It must be fake.

96
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,010
It's impossible.

97
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:25,989
It must be fake.

98
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:29,749
The past cannot be undone, but the future can still be remedied.

99
00:06:29,749 --> 00:06:32,980
The past is the past.

100
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,540
Yes, let it go.

101
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:42,720
But I hope that all of you

102
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,300
can work together with me to manage Mu Xi City well,

103
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:53,739
make it prosper and the people healthy and happy!

104
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,449
We won't disgrace our mission,

105
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:03,090
and we'll share the worries of Your Majesty and plead for the people.

106
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,379
She knows we planned all this, and she must be angry right now.

107
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:13,640
Unexpectedly, as top assassin in the world, you are so afraid of Yun Luo.

108
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,380
Yun Luo is no ordinary girl.

109
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:20,120
How about you blame me for everything?

110
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,259
Just say I forced you not to tell her.

111
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,840
No way!

112
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,080
That's not what a man will do.

113
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,880
It was San Mei who forced me.

114
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,110
I didn't want to lie to you, but she forced me not to tell you.

115
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:36,150
She said the more people knew it, the more dangerous it would be.

116
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,209
Did you know how much I worried about you?

117
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,259
I do know, I do.

118
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,440
Why did you lie to me?

119
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,559
You... you!

120
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,180
Tan Rang, what are you doing in the light of day?

121
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,460
We are not married yet!

122
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:59,800
[The top assassin in the world loves Princess Yun Luo, till death do us part.]

123
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,960
[The top assassin in the world loves Princess Yun Luo, till death do us part.]

124
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,729
I'd like to carve a couplet on your body.

125
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,699
The first line is the "top assassin in the world."

126
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,829
For the second line, I'd write, "Please return to Princess Yun Luo."

127
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:18,140
Who carved it for you?

128
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,940
It hurts.

129
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,330
Who carved it for you?

130
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,540
Well...

131
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,700
[Imperial Decree]

132
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,390
This seems to be Ye Zhao Nan's handwriting.

133
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:42,120
Why are your eyes swollen?

134
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,880
Well... I didn't wash my hands after using the toilet.

135
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,510
Did you tattoo the words on Tan Rang's body?

136
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,229
Your Grace, it was me.

137
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:58,109
Tan Rang begged His Majesty, but His Majesty ignored him.

138
00:08:58,109 --> 00:09:01,109
So I did him a favor. You can ask Tan Rang.

139
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,689
Tan Rang, say something.

140
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,269
He asked for a tattoo, and you agreed.

141
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:06,749
If he asked you to die, would you do t?

142
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,229
Yun Luo. Don't say that.

143
00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:13,570
You always said I would be first in your heart.

144
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,459
Look at you now. Have you still any place for me in your heart?

145
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:21,199
And your nonsense is exactly like San Mei's.

146
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:24,790
You must have been with her long enough to learn her flaws.

147
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,379
You only dare to blame my eldest sister in front of me.

148
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:34,179
- Do you dare to say it in front of her?
- Why not?

149
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:37,239
Even if she stood before me now, I would say the same.

150
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:39,469
She is ignorant of rules and arbitrary.

151
00:09:39,469 --> 00:09:42,859
She didn't even ask me to help deal with General Jin Fu. How dangerous it is!

152
00:09:42,859 --> 00:09:44,140
"How dangerous it is."

153
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,750
So are you blaming her?

154
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,619
I am concerned for her safety. What if anything happens to her?

155
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:54,800
Enough. I wanted to pick on you two.

156
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,040
But I failed.

157
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:24,140
I didn't expect you to solve the big trouble, Jin Fu, without my help at all.

158
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,320
No way. You wrote so many letters for me.

159
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,469
That hand of yours is even calloused.

160
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:34,060
It's nothing.

161
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,470
Even without my letters, you could fix Jin Fu.

162
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,039
Shang Dynasty women were good at commanding troops and defeated tribes in border regions,

163
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,780
which made the country prosperous in the reign of King Wu Ding,

164
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,190
and Zhong Wuyan assisted the government,

165
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,390
which increased prosperity of Qi State.

166
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:57,739
It can be seen that designing strategies within a command tent

167
00:10:57,739 --> 00:11:00,800
is not only man's specialty.

168
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,650
So you don't have to feel ashamed.

169
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:08,190
I really didn't get used to it at first.

170
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:11,819
After careful thought, how can wits and courage be related to gender?

171
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,499
If you feel jealous that the person you like is better than you,

172
00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:18,790
it will be too rude and unmanly.

173
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:22,040
A real man should take the strengths of others

174
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,000
to offset his own weaknesses and keep improving.

175
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,230
Why are you looking at me like this?

176
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,070
I'm also impressed with you.

177
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:45,700
Now, the matter in Mu Xi City has been resolved.

178
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,380
Everyone thought you were the real Ye Zhao Nan.

179
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,109
Do you want to stay in Mu Xi City or follow me back to Xuan Yue City?

180
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:58,640
I...

181
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,790
No worries. Answer me after you consider it.

182
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,449
Your Grace. Your Grace.

183
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:16,379
Sorry, Your Grace. Please spare me.

184
00:12:16,379 --> 00:12:18,729
I am still a virgin. Your Grace.

185
00:12:18,729 --> 00:12:21,659
I did it for the first time. Please forgive me.

186
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,469
Look at what you said.

187
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,940
I also did it for the first time.

188
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,639
Your Grace, no! Sorry, Grace. Your Grace.

189
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,300
Let me show how it means that evil leads to evil!

190
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,679
Yi Yang Jun. This is what I carefully prepared to welcome you.

191
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:42,670
How to eat it?

192
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:50,700
The head of the crayfish is not edible. It is poisonous inside.

193
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,970
This...

194
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:01,120
Peel off the head of it.

195
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:07,890
The head is delicious and very nourishing.

196
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:18,000
Why are you eating the crayfish's tail?

197
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,480
I leave the best to you.

198
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,249
Amazing, amazing.

199
00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:31,870
I told you.

200
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,740
Thank you.

201
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,070
Yi Yang Jun.

202
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,740
I'm really curious when you will give up on San Mei.

203
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:07,580
Liu Xuan Ming. If one day you find the Guan San Mei you like is not Guan San Mei,

204
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,790
but the person you hate the most, will you still like her?

205
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:17,510
I think what you should care about right now is not San Mei,

206
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,280
but Princess Hui Rou.

207
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,950
Don't you know?

208
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:26,110
Qian Hui Rou is here.

209
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,660
Is it Hui Rou?

210
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,120
Eunuch Sun. Can you make it?

211
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,069
Men can never say no.

212
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,899
I'm old now.

213
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,759
But my great great grandfather was a court physician.

214
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,940
I'm sure I can heal his eyes.

215
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,630
Then why did you cover his mouth?

216
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:22,609
I'm not overcharging you. It's a better deal for you if I wrap him a little more.

217
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:30,180
Don't worry. You'll be all right.

218
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:35,869
Old Guan. Feng Lei. Zhao Jing.

219
00:15:35,869 --> 00:15:39,169
You three accompanied me from Xuan Yue City to Mu Xi.

220
00:15:39,169 --> 00:15:42,320
You've made great achievements.

221
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,919
Today, I specially designate you as loyal servants of the inner court.

222
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:51,669
Each of you will be given 500 taels of gold and 200 bolts of silk.

223
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:54,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

224
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,600
Your Majesty. I'm getting old.

225
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,349
My greatest wish is to accompany my daughter

226
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,940
and fulfill my responsibilities as a father.

227
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,749
Your Majesty. My mother and I were separated so many years.

228
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:12,950
I also want to spend more time with her.

229
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,310
Don't call me that.

230
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:26,740
I still want you to call me San Mei.

231
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,600
No matter when and where,

232
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,740
you will always be my dad and my brothers.

233
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:44,089
I will give you tokens so you can enter the palace to see me anytime.

234
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:45,199
- Okay.
- Okay.

235
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,220
Zhao Jing. After we leave, San Mei will be left to you.

236
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,320
Take good care of her for us.

237
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,520
Right. If anyone dares to bully San Mei, just tell me.

238
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,459
I'll be the first to rush over to deal with him.

239
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,749
Don't worry. With me here, no one dares to bully San Mei.

240
00:17:07,450 --> 00:17:09,920
My adoptive father had the world back then,

241
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,260
but he ended up in a miserable state at his death.

242
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:19,800
My father was calling your name all the time before he died.

243
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:26,160
Maybe his biggest regret is not being able to see you for the last time.

244
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,250
After the death of my father,

245
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,650
my elder brothers fought for the throne.

246
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:38,590
Tian Mu City is not what it used to be,

247
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,980
and there is no place for us.

248
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:52,200
After this battle, I have figured it out.

249
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,480
The throne is just passing clouds.

250
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,330
Now I have only you as family.

251
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,570
Don't leave me alone.

252
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:13,860
I planned to return to Tian Mu City after helping Ye Zhao Nan regain the position of Lord.

253
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,220
"Ye Zhao Nan"? But isn't Ye Zhao Nan actually Guan San Mei?

254
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:23,020
The truth is Guan San Mei is Ye Zhao Nan.

255
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,220
What?

256
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,930
Nothing. I am just thinking that since you are

257
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:38,930
so affectionate and righteous to Guan San Mei,

258
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:42,370
why don't we stay?

259
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,660
Brother Zhao. I reflected deeply on what you said to me.

260
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,580
I finally understand what kind of woman I should be.

261
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,480
What will you do?

262
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:26,700
I am no longer who I used to be.

263
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,430
Brother Zhao.

264
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,900
You should return to who you were.

265
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,820
Brother Zhao.

266
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,239
I've been having nightmares lately.

267
00:19:38,239 --> 00:19:42,359
- What does it matter to me?
- Because dreams without you are all nightmares.

268
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:44,160
- Wait, I...
- Hush.

269
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:47,560
Brother Zhao.

270
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,620
I...

271
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,510
Brother Zhao.

272
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,620
Take this wine.

273
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,680
From then on, we will no longer be friends.

274
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,760
This...

275
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,040
Come on. Drink.

276
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,550
Drink it.

277
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,250
Brother Zhao. Brother Zhao, what's wrong?

278
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:13,340
Brother Zhao, what's wrong? Brother Zhao!

279
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,520
Liu Xuan Ming.

280
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,270
There is one thing I want to tell you.

281
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,790
Actually, I am not Guan San Mei.

282
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:25,330
I am whom you hate the most, the lord of Mu Xi City,

283
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:28,790
Ye Zhao Nan.

284
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,800
Would it be way too direct? Should I change to a more tactful way?

285
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,090
Liu Xuan Ming, do you want a surprise?

286
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,380
A big surprise!

287
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,390
- Yi Yang Jun.
- Are you worried not knowing how to confess to him?

288
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:52,860
You are such a mind reader.

289
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:58,040
The biggest trouble was General Jin Fu. Now, he's a prisoner.

290
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,040
What else is bothering you?

291
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,480
I think it would be this matter.

292
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:08,059
- Have you any good advice?
- In fact, you have the answer.

293
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:12,460
If you continue to conceal your identity, you won't have such distress.

294
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:17,780
Now you are distressed, it means you feel that it's time to confess.

295
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:23,410
What's more, you should have confidence in him.

296
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:29,840
It's really strange that you didn't take this opportunity to insult him.

297
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,250
I am leaving.

298
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,589
- Where are you going?
- I will just travel around.

299
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:45,550
Why are you leaving abruptly? Don't you want to see your ideal city?

300
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,650
Ye Zhao Nan.

301
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,200
With you, the ideal city will surely be realized.

302
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,900
After you realize the sharing of wealth and universal peace,

303
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,300
I will watch you from a distance.

304
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:43,100
- Are you sure you want to leave?
- Yes. I've already asked Hui Rou to pack her things.

305
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,850
- Are you doing this for San Mei?
- Why do you say so?

306
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:48,650
You can't leave Qian Hui Rou alone,

307
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,560
but you can't keep her by San Mei's side.

308
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,590
That's the only way.

309
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,970
I was adopted as a child by Lord Yang.

310
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,720
I can never repay him for his kindness in nurturing me.

311
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,140
I didn't protect Qi Meng, for which I'm ashamed to my adoptive father.

312
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:11,279
Now, Hui Rou is homeless. I can't leave her alone.

313
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:17,880
But I worry that she has ulterior motives.

314
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,380
Keeping her by San Mei's side may be harmful to San Mei.

315
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:27,010
The only way to do the best in both worlds is to leave with Hui Rou.

316
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,450
What? Don't you want me to leave?

317
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,530
You.

318
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:50,280
Never bully San Mei after I leave.

319
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,600
She is my woman,

320
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,030
and none of your business.

321
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,720
Liu Xuan Ming. No matter what San Mei does in the future, you must remember that

322
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:16,830
no matter how hard it is for you to accept,

323
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,340
she does it for your own good.

324
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,450
Baby, I miss you so much. I haven't seen you for such a long time.

325
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,250
Why didn't you dress up as a man?

326
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,299
No one would tell it. Right?

327
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:39,770
I'm terrified of what to do if someone finds out.

328
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:44,000
No way. Since a child, you disguised as a man and are familiar with it.

329
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,250
If you don't say it, who can tell?

330
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,710
All right. It's up to you.

331
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,040
Liu Xuan Ming. No matter what San Mei does in the future,

332
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,809
you must remember that no matter how hard it is for you to accept,

333
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,950
- she does it for your own good.
- If one day you find out I am not Guan San Mei,

334
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:07,110
but the one you hate the most, will you still like me?

335
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:12,369
Not necessarily. I also deeply like a lord.

336
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,070
Do you look like Ye Zhao Nan?

337
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,810
Almost the same.

338
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:24,370
From today onward, you are the lord of Mu Xi City,

339
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:28,360
Ye Zhao Nan.

340
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:32,340
It seems this old eunuch got bribed by Jin Fu as well. Even he didn't suspect you.

341
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,109
You are well-dressed, and you presumably are the son of an official.

342
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:38,160
How can you speak foul language here, which is inappropriate?

343
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,060
Do you know whom you are talking to?

344
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:43,130
I'm the lord of Mu Xi City,

345
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,570
Ye Zhao Nan!

346
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,370
Princess Hui Rou.

347
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,510
Don't worry. I saw with my own eyes that the man entered Lord Ye's room.

348
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,290
Really.

349
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,840
Thank you.

350
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,730
Liu Xuan Ming.

351
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:34,190
Liu Xuan Ming. Actually, there is one thing I decided to tell you.

352
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:39,560
My real identity is not Guan San Mei,

353
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,090
but...

354
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:43,900
The lord of Mu Xi City,

355
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,740
Ye Zhao Nan.

356
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,990
♫ Secretly hiding, secretly thinking of you ♫

357
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:31,060
♫ Burying my feelings for you in my heart ♫

358
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:34,700
♫ The esteemed lord ♫

359
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,160
♫ Should not show vulnerability ♫

360
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:45,220
♫ Before the people so easily ♫

361
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:52,200
♫ When you appear, when you approach ♫

362
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:59,330
♫ When someone understands that I'm not a god ♫

363
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:02,820
♫ Your words ♫

364
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:05,480
♫ Are etched in my mind ♫

365
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:12,110
♫ That tender heart of yours ♫

366
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:15,580
♫ I want to protect you while navigating the storm ♫

367
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:19,150
♫ Braving the glint and flash of cold steel ♫

368
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:26,260
♫ I want to take you to see scenery you've never seen ♫

369
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,820
♫ I really want to be with you forever ♫

370
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,260
♫ Whether we are on opposing sides or archenemies ♫

371
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:36,850
♫ Only my love for you is everlasting ♫

372
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:40,900
♫ A deep-rooted affection ♫
