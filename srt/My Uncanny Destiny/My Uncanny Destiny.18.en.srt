[My Uncanny Destiny: Episode 18]

00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,280
Quickly get up.

32
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,869
- General.
- Let me down. Let me down.

33
00:02:29,869 --> 00:02:32,469
She is my sister. She was emotionally hurt and became insane

34
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:35,840
thinking of marrying His Majesty all day long.

35
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,719
What are you saying? I wanted to marry His Majesty before. But now...

36

See? She's really insane.

37
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,680
- Leave now! Don't make a fool of yourself.
- I am leaving.

General, please forgive me. I will instantly warn doorkeepers to tighten security.

Indeed.

Are you Liu Xuan Ming's younger sister, Princess Yun Luo?

We have Lord's wife and Princess Yun Luo.

This is General's Manor, not Xuan Yue City.

So what?

105
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,950
Yun Luo is the princess of Xuan Yue City and my sworn sister.

106
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,880
Vice General Zhou sexually harassed Yun Luo.

107
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,360
So what if we kill him?

108
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,490
San Mei.

109
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:07,220
As you said, she is the princess of Xuan Yue City, not Mu Xi City.

110
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:12,250
Not to mention sexually harassing her, what if I kill her?

111

- You!
- Just take a try.

112

If Yun Luo loses even one piece of hair today,

113
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,500
I will let the entire General's Manor

114
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,910
be buried with her.

115

You've challenged me again and again!

118
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,770
Aren't you afraid that I'll crush you?

119
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,750
Just you?

120
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,990
I have thirty thousand elite soldiers in the city.

121
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,129
Can't I kill you?

122
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,529
- There seems to be a fight over there. Who shall we help?
- What's wrong with you? What do you think?

123
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:56,650
Of course, we should help San Mei. But isn't this Jin Fu's territory?

124
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,390
Who cares whose territory it is?

125
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:01,940
Whoever dares to hurt San Mei, that's whom I'll kill.

126
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,989
- Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

- Wait.
- Yi Yang Jun.

128
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:07,370
Zhao Jing, Feng Lei. Go and block the gate.

129
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,630
If they fight, don't let anyone go out to tip-off.

130
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,870
Old Guan. Go to the woodshed and prepare some wood.

131
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,560
- If they fight, burn the General's Manor.
- Okay.
- Let's go.

132
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,960
Let's go.

133

General, you don't think we came unprepared, do you?

134
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:28,680
At the border between Mu Xi and Xuan Yue,

135
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:34,100
fifty thousand soldiers of Xuan Yue are waiting for our signal.

136
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,780
Would you like to give it a try?

137
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,240
He is indeed the city's Lord. He planned thoroughly.

138
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,500
- Who are you scaring?
- Then just try!

139
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,260
San Mei. Oh, San Mei.

140
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,749
You guys have worse tempers than me, a warrior on the battlefield.

141
00:09:51,749 --> 00:09:55,679
Without a bad temper, no one would fear you.

142
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,590
All right. Okay.

143
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,180
It's getting late. Go rest early.

144
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:05,170
We have important things to do tomorrow.

145
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,570
Hold on.

146
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,179
Princess Yun Luo's business wasn't settled yet.

147
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,910
After all, Vice General Zhou failed

148
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,110
to sexually harass Princess Yun Luo.

149
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:26,630
According to what you mean, we can hold him accountable only if he succeeds.

150
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,420
If not, we can only let it go.

151
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,010
Yes. Isn't that reasonable?

152
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,679
By what you mean, when your mother conceived you,

153
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,800
if she had given birth to you, you were a human being. But if you were a stillborn,

154
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,269
- you wouldn't even be a human being?
- Guan San Mei!

00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,940
Shut up!

157
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,670
Are you satisfied now?

158
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,660
Let's go.

159
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,550
Your Majesty.

160
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,570
Let me kill him.

161
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,250
None of you should meddle in this matter.

162
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:32,940
I will definitely help Yun Luo vent this anger.

239
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,990
An old man was shepherding below the tree. He suddenly saw a tiger devouring his sheep.

00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,780
The female monkey exclaimed five words.

241

The male monkey teased the female monkey.

242
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,269
The question is what did the female monkey exclaim?

Why is there no answer in the back?

Guan San Mei. What are you doing here?

Just to have a chat with you.

It's not appropriate for me to enter the inner city

I thought I could get rid of him after I came to Mu Xi City.

252
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,360
It suddenly occurred to me that before coming to Mu Xi City,

253
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,859
you told me to pretend to be hostile in order to confuse General Jin Fu.

254
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:09,510
Looking back now, you did this to alienate me, right?

255
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:17,800
Yi Yang Jun. I see you as a confidant.

256
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,710
But even if we are confidants, the red line cannot be crossed.

257
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:28,149
Otherwise, doing shameful things in the name of confidants will tarnish the word "confidant."

258
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,120
My heart is for Liu Xuan Ming alone.

259

And you treat me well.

I cannot bear this kindness.

00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,040
I hope you will never put more emotion on me in the future.

262
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,520
Otherwise, I can only alienate you even more.

263

What are you thinking? The reason I treat you well is to let you achieve universal peace quickly.

Don't be so sentimental.

It's good this way.

266

Haven't you noticed that servants in the inner city are respectful to you now?

In a few days, you can walk around Xuan Yue City sideways.

268

- Indeed.

Enough. Save it.

271

Why are you not reconciled? Isn't it just a cat's-paw?

272
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:14,769
Why do you complain about doing this job? The unwilling should be me.

Besides, the key issue now is San Mei.

275

General Jin Fu asked us to enter the palace with San Mei and to watch her.

276
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:27,799
It seems he still has doubts.

00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:30,700
I think so, too. San Mei surely has a way.

Now we should be thankful we won't face this stinking corpse anymore. Let's just work.

I predicted it for you. Your fate is coming soon.

00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,759
- Someone, come!
- Wait!
- Yes.

322
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,139
Guan San Mei. I don't believe you dare to kill me.

323
00:25:45,139 --> 00:25:46,930
My older sister is very terrifying.

324
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:52,970
She will make you want to die more than live.

325
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,060
I haven't watched a play in a long time.

326
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:02,310
I'd like to see how long it takes for these killers to kill her.

327
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,300
This is a rare good show.

328
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:12,470
Since you said that, there must be something else hidden.

329
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:15,680
Why not be an onlooker?

330
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:18,649
Princess. What if they don't fall for it?

331
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:23,140
That's because our act is not real enough.

332
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,830
What should we do?

333
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,470
When someone dies, it's real enough.

334
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,230
So fake.

335
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,770
Do you think that sword is real?

336
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,150
It looks real.

337
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:48,970
Could the blood be fake?

338
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:51,620
It did cost a lot.

339
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:12,729
Sister. Will you really watch her die?

340
00:27:12,729 --> 00:27:15,230
It's wrong to see others die without doing anything.

341
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:18,619
But she's not dead yet. How can we save her?

342
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,760
Try harder.

343
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,750
- Save her!
- Save her!

344
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:30,030
- Come on.
- Hurry.

345
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,879
- Quick.
- Brother. The soldiers are coming.

346
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:34,320
Let's go.

347
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,090
So alike.

348
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:55,350
Listen carefully.

349
00:27:55,350 --> 00:28:00,000
Qi Meng killed my most important person so I killed her.

350
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,700
But I never regretted it.

351
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,960
If you came here to avenge Qi Meng,

352
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:12,250
I will surely let you suffer the consequences

353
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,930
and be doomed eternally.

354
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:46,540

00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:21,840
♫ When someone understands that I'm not a god ♫

361
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,310
♫ Your words ♫

362

♫ Are etched in my mind ♫

363

♫ Braving the glint and flash of cold steel ♫

366
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:48,800
♫ I want to take you to see scenery you've never seen ♫
