I don't like such a story.

167
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:22,590
Do you really think an innocent princess who seldom goes out

168
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:28,380
could fool a ruthless assassin, who wandered around the underworld so much?

169
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:36,020
Perhaps behind this story is another story.

170
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,430
When the assassin first laid eyes on the princess,

171
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,840
he fell deeply in love with her.

172
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,980
He had many chances to kill her.

173
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,200
Don't go too far. I'm afraid of this!

174
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,510
But he didn't.

175
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:58,090
Okay. I'll go get your medicine.

176
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:02,360

- I can't see anything.

178

he remained by her side.

179
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,750
There is much foolishness in this world.

180
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,820
In fact, it's all just a matter of willingness.

Tan Rang came here to assassinate me!

182
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:36,110
How could I let my beloved sister, the Princess of Xuan Yue,

183
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,390
commit herself to such an assassin?

184

Yun Luo loves Tan Rang.

Tan Rang loves Yun Luo. It doesn't matter if she's a princess or not.

188
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:53,430
- It doesn't even matter if her name is Yun Luo or not.
- Then what matters most?

Of course, it's loving each other!

Guan. San. Mei.

326
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:28,330
Letting you stay doesn't mean I approve of your love with Yun Luo.

327
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,540
I just don't want to see Yun Luo sad and upset.

328
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,370
She's only happy with you for a while.

329
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:40,260
When she tires of you, then you must leave.

330
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,870
You love her very much.

331
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:44,570
More than you.

332
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:49,840
No matter what, I'm grateful for allowing me to see Yun Luo.

333
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,880
Do you want to thank me?

334
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:57,160
Then why don't you tell me who sent you to assassinate me?

335
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:26,220
♫ Secretly hiding, secretly thinking of you ♫

336
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:33,200
♫ Burying my feelings for you in my heart ♫

337
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,800
♫ The esteemed lord ♫

338
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,350
♫ Should not show vulnerability ♫

339
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:47,350
♫ Before the people so easily ♫

340
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:54,430
♫ When you appear, when you approach ♫

341
00:27:54,430 --> 00:28:01,540
♫ When you appear, when you approach ♫

342
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,910
♫ Your words ♫

343
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,520
♫ Are etched in my mind ♫

344
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:14,290
♫ That tender heart of yours ♫

345
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:17,750
♫ I want to protect you while navigating the storm ♫

346
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,340
♫ Braving the glint and flash of cold steel ♫

347
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:28,370
♫ I want to take you to see scenery you've never seen ♫

348
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:31,910
♫ I really want to be with you forever ♫

349
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:35,390
♫ Whether we are on opposing sides or archenemies ♫

350
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,980
♫ Only my love for you is everlasting ♫

351
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:43,000
♫ A deep-rooted affection ♫
