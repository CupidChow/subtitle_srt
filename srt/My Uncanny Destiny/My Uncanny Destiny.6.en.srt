Fine! I'll tell you the truth!

81
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:04,900
It is because I have a crush on Your Majesty that I dug a tunnel

82
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,520
to peek at you.

83
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,139
I also thought you were drooling over me

84
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:13,530
so you tried your best to get close to me.

85
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,670
But this tunnel thing

86
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,310
gives me doubt.

87
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:20,940
About what?

88
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,510
You didn't think I was going to kill you, did you?

89
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,400
If I wanted to kill you,

90
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,460
why would I save you in the first place?

91
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,730
Be that as it may,

92
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:44,760
you said you dug this tunnel just to spy on me.

93
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,970
No matter what, it seems absurd.

94
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,960
That's because...

95
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,450
That's because...

96
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,860
Because you don't even know... that your handsome face

97
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,640
has reached the state of stunning all living beings.

98
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,490
Since the first time I saw you,

99
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:10,180
I have fallen into that bottomless pit of love.

100
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,210
Every night

101
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:14,450
I think about you

102
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,230
tossing and turning,

103
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,030
and I can't sleep.

104
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:26,320
So I dug this tunnel to try to peek at you.

105
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,180
Then why do you

106
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,500
sometimes treat me tenderly,

107
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,950
sometimes with humiliation,

108
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,439
and sometimes even violently?

109
00:08:40,439 --> 00:08:43,330
You don't... you don't know...

110
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:47,130
Don't you know women don't say what they mean?

111
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,319
Fine. I know you won't believe me no matter what I say!

112
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:00,460
I've treated you with kindness and respect,

113
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:05,190
but you... are indifferent and ungrateful.

114
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,490
I guess

115
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:13,130
I fell for the wrong person.

116
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,160
Your...

117
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:18,120
Calm down.

118
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:25,780
I have a blood feud with him; how could I fall for him?

119
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,470
How did my second oldest brother dig the tunnel?

120
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,140
It was all his fault.

121
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,830
Yes.

122
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,450
Being handsome surely is troublesome.

123
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,740
How I envy people with mediocre appearances.

124
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,140
Your Majesty.

125
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,390
I tried to trace the source of the tunnel, but

126
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,400
it collapsed halfway.

127
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,550
Did you get hurt?

128
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,740
How can I get hurt with my skill?

129
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,680
It's a pity I came so close to catching them.

130
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,110
This tunnel can't be dug in a short time span.

131
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,520
Go immediately and find who her accomplice is.

132
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,890
Yes.

133
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:35,220
I have muddled through with a random reason,

134
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,990
but he can't believe I dug the tunnel alone.

135
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,860
So we still have to find a way to deal with it.

136
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,820
Dad, are you all right?

137
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,120
You are actually going to assassinate Liu Xuan Ming.

138
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,910
I'm so scared.

139
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,750
Yi Yang Jun,

140
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,520
how could we assassinate His Majesty?

We are faithful

142
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,330
to His Majesty.

143
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:18,789
Really, how come the tunnel links to the Chamber of Baths?

144
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,729
Isn't it a scam?

145
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,009
What a nasty situation.

146
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:25,169
Let me tell you, if not for my quick reactions, we were all going to die.

147
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,560
This time, I heard it correctly, right?

148
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,100
Then tell us, what on Earth do you want?

149
00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,310
You want to assassinate Liu Xuan Ming. I can keep it a secret for you.

150
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:05,799
But you must wait until after Liu Xuan Ming and Qi Meng get married.

151
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:09,340
Otherwise, I will surely expose you.

152
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:13,930
Why do we have to listen to you?

153
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,800
Do you have any other choice?

154
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,000
Then when will Liu Xuan Ming and Princess Qi Meng get married?

155
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:29,459
If Liu Xuan Ming agrees to the marriage alliance conditions promised earlier,

156
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,510
it will be soon.

157
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,280
Stop right there!

158
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,710
You want to threaten me

159
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:51,180
to help you persuade Liu Xuan Ming to cede the city and offer gold?

160
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,130
It doesn't matter.

161
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,729
One minute you want to help Liu Xuan Ming, and the next minute you want to kill Liu Xuan Ming.

162
00:13:57,729 --> 00:14:02,110
Sometimes you are pretentious and sometimes straightforward.

163
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:07,030
Originally, I thought you had feelings for Liu Xuan Ming, but now,

164
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:09,890
I am relieved.

165
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,150
About what?

166
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,170
After we both finish what we must do,

167
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,720
how about you follow me back to Tian Mu City?

168
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:27,519
You see me wanting to kill Liu Xuan Ming, but don't intend to stop me.

169
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,170
It seems that your real purpose for coming here this time

170
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,410
is not for marriage.

171
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,940
What in the world are you up to?

172
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,120
Take a guess.

173
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,940
If you don't want to die, stay away from me.

174
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,960
I can't wait.

175
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,869
Stop it. I'm so scared.

176
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:54,200
You...

177
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,379
I'm getting more and more interested in you.

178
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,690
I...

179
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,540
Do you know that because of you,

180
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,979
I didn't even take part in the banquet last night and I missed tons of fun?

181
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,090
Who are you?

182
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:25,370
Why did you come to the palace?

183
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,850
Are you playing aloof with me?

184
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,730
Fine. Meet my friend,
♫ What! ♫

185
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,740
whose name is Longy.

186
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,970
Say hi to each other.

187
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,910
What will you do?

188
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,330
Who are you? Why did you come to the palace?

189
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,870
Still keeping your mouth shut?

190
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:24,220
Its name is Gray.

191
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,480
Still don't want to talk?

192
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,900
Don't go too far!

193
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,100
Its name is Big Tongs.

194
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,310
I fear this thing the most!

195
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:56,500
Will you talk or not?

196
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,279
Will you?

197
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,030
I'll talk, I'll talk.

198
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,800
I'm Tan Rang,

199
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,759
the top assassin in the world.

200
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,700
"The top assassin in the world"?

201
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,580
You?

202
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,709
Did you buy yourself the title of the best assassin in the world?

203
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:36,669
You're in such a hurry; are you going to assassinate Liu Xuan Ming?

204
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:43,450
All right, I was a bit rude last night.

205
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,290
San Mei, please be forgiving and don't take it personally.

206
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,110
What must I do to dissipate your anger?

207
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,810
My anger will dissipate if you stay away from me.

208
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,930
Don't forget that I know you want to assassinate Liu Xuan Ming.

209
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,990
And then what?

210
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,270
If I shout loudly...

211
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,850
Let me shout for you.

212
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,880
- San Mei is going to kill Liu...
- Don't.

213
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:29,480
Fine. You rule; I admit defeat.

214
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,750
There is such an interesting girl in this world.

215
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:41,230
I really can't stop thinking about her.

216
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,239
You entered the imperial palace of Xuan Yue City to find the lord of Mu Xi City.

217
00:18:46,239 --> 00:18:48,470
What do you think I am, a three-year-old?

218
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,030
Ye Zhao Nan went missing in the jungle,

219
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,960
and I heard Liu Xuan Ming brought back a...

220
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:58,630
Who are you to say my brother's name?

221
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:03,600
I heard that Lord Liu brought back a person,

222
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,450
and I thought it was Ye Zhao Nan.

223
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:10,140
She does look similar to Ye Zhao Nan, but she's a woman.

224
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,180
Are you talking about San Mei?

225
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,720
It seems to be the name.

226
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,670
How could there be such a coincidence?

227
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,830
Can you get them out now?

228
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,720
They seem to be fighting inside.

229
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:31,190
How can I get them out like this?

230
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,089
Be obedient.

231
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:38,590
After all, you are the best assassin in the world.

232
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:42,849
I will engrave a couplet on your body.

233
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,569
The first vertical line will be:

234
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:47,459
"The best assassin in the world."

235
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,939
The second vertical line will be: "Was defeated by Princess Yun Luo."

236
00:19:51,939 --> 00:19:56,310
The horizontal line will be: "How hilarious."

237
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,520
You'd better not get caught by me,

238
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,880
or I'll chop you into millions of little pieces!

239
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,120
No need to hurry.

240
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,160
Let me finish the engraving first.

241
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:33,579
My father knew you liked flowers and plants
[Palace of Eternal Longevity]

242
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,989
so he sent many flowers and plants from

243
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:39,019
Tian Mu City just before I left.

244
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,629
I appreciate the effort of Lord Yang Cheng.

245
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:45,119
Don't stand on ceremony. If it's something you like,

246
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,929
no matter how rare it is, I will find it for you no matter where I must go.

247
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,489
Qi Meng, thank you for your effort.

248
00:20:54,490 --> 00:21:00,599
Now you are in the palace, in the future, I will treat you as my own daughter.

249
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:05,090
Old Dowager, San Mei requests to see you.

250
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,510
"San Mei"?

251
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:10,380
Old Dowager, nothing good will happen whenever this little temptress shows up.

252
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,349
My Qian Yue's legs are still weak.

253
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,960
Who makes people do frog jumps all night long?

254
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,310
Don't call her a temptress.

255
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,899
If Qian Yue didn't have a bad intention,

256
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,909
how could people expose her?

257
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,579
- Old Dowager.
- Call her in.

258
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,850
Yes.

259
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:33,750
Princess Qi Meng, have you met San Mei?

260
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,000
Yes. When I entered the inner city before,

261
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,720
at the main hall I saw Sister San Mei accompanying Brother Xuan Ming,

262
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,840
and she helped Brother Xuan Ming pass the order.

263
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,520
She looked very imposing.

264
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,000
Many Tian Mu attendants who didn't know the inside story

265
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,320
assumed San Mei was the city's lord.

266
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:59,260
I really envy her, for I don't have the ability

267
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,200
to share Brother Xuan Ming's worries.

268
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,349
I am Guan San Mei. Greetings to Old Dowager. Please accept my respect.

269
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,190
You can stand up now.

270
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,310
Thank you, Old Dowager.

271
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:24,230
I've heard a lot about you, and today I finally get to meet you in person.

272
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,459
Old Dowager, you flatter me.

273
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,820
If you don't mind, you can summon me anytime.

274
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,590
Sister San Mei.

275
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,830
Princess Qi Meng.

276
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:36,969
I just heard you mention me.

277
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:40,679
Yes. I said that Sister San Mei is impressive.

278
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,980
You can't flatter people like this.

279
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:47,940
Assuming I was the lord of the city doesn't sound like a compliment,

280
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,220
but a condemnation instead.

281
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,560
Really?

282
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,529
I'm immature and my words are careless;

283
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,470
please don't take it personally.

284
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,490
San Mei, what are you here for today?

285
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,400
Old Dowager,

286
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,500
I came today not only to greet you,

287
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,930
but to ask you to give me justice.

288
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,590
What's the matter?

289
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,690
Last night...

290
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:31,260
Last night, His Majesty and I had intimate physical contact

291
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:34,980
so I hope you give me justice!

292
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,819
Liu Xuan Ming won't trust me easily

293
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,500
so we must do two things.

294
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,070
I will do the first thing.

295
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:51,319
I'll ask Old Dowager to convince Liu Xuan Ming that I truly have feelings for him,

296
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:57,430
and I'll force marriage on him using the Old Dowager.

297
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,430
You need to do the second thing,

298
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:04,739
and the sooner the better.

299
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,669
We have to finish it before Liu Xuan Ming finds out about us.

300
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:10,490
Here comes His Majesty.

301
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,259
Greetings, Mother.

302
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,930
Let me ask you.

303
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:23,800
Last night, did you make advances to San Mei?

304
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,930
Mother, it is true.

305
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,250
How did I teach you since you were a child?

306
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:45,160
How dare you be so disrespectful to a woman?

307
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,249
Do you think that as City Lord,

308
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,450
you can act recklessly and lasciviously toward women?

309
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,080
Mother, please calm down.

310
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:57,950
I grew up obeying teachings and never behaved disrespectfully toward women,

311
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,070
let alone had any illicit thoughts.

312
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,409
- San Mei...
- How dare you still lie?

313
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,850
Old Dowager, please don't be angry.

314
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,729
His Majesty's words are true.

315
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,920
He didn't make advances to me;

316
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:15,320
we both... love each other--

317
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,630
San Mei, don't be afraid.

318
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:26,720
If he did something disrespectful,

319
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,060
I will surely give you justice.

320
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,619
Old Dowager, I don't have any illicit thoughts.

321
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,040
I don't want to interfere in the marriage of His Majesty and Princess Qi Meng.

322
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,730
Sister San Mei, what are you saying?

323
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,210
Brother Xuan Ming is an elite among people,

324
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:54,760
and it's natural someone is attracted to him.

325
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,829
Also, Sister San Mei is brimming with talent and intelligence.

326
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:03,420
If you can assist Brother Xuan Ming,

327
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:07,330
then he can surely achieve supremacy.

328
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:13,260
Sister Qi Meng is really understanding.

329
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,540
Ming'er.

330
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:22,770
No matter what, you owe San Mei an explanation.

331
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,460
I understand.

332
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,989
Princess, please calm down.

333
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:34,499
With your status, no need to be angry with that lowly person.

334
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,000
[Qian Er]

335
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:45,430
Then why did Liu Xuan Ming fall for that lowly person?

336
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,110
Am I even inferior to her?

337
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,680
I thought that Liu Xuan Ming was an upright gentleman,

338
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,990
but I didn't expect he was just a lecher.

339
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:07,069
Yi Yang Jun, get rid of that wretch immediately.

340
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:11,189
Keep in mind the purpose of our trip and don't make more trouble.

341
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,610
The sooner you marry Liu Xuan Ming, the sooner we can achieve our goal.

342
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,649
I won't stop until I get my revenge!

343
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,600
Don't cause any unnecessary trouble.

344
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:28,010
You are no match for her.

345
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:34,440
I want to see if there's anyone in the world

346
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,210
that I can't handle.

[Forbidden Palace]

348
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,710
This was all planned by you, right?

349
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:52,010
First, win my affection,

350
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:55,030
then go to Old Dowager to ask for your title.

351
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,880
You're full of sophistry (deceit).

352
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,070
So that's how you think of me.

353
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,660
I'm relieved.

354
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,660
What did you say?

355
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:25,090
I said I feel a bit sick so I need to go back.

356
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,370
Liu Xuan Ming,

357
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:45,240
for the lives of my whole family, I have to do this.

358
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:49,480
If you want to blame something, blame your fate.

359
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,440
This is our destiny.

360
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,470
We can do nothing about it.

361
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,850
Why is the key here?

362
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,339
Help! There are assassins!

363
00:29:55,339 --> 00:29:56,299
Your Majesty.

00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,480
Your Majesty. There are assa-

Your Majesty, Housekeeper Ke found that someone will poison the wine.

366
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:03,760
She arranged for us to protect you.

Yao Hu.

368
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,340
Stop there!

369
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:30,440
That assassin is with her.

370
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,840
They want to assassinate me!
