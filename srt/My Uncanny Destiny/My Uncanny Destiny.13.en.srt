00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,200
Did it fall out when he fell off the cliff?

166
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,100
Now that Ye Zhao Nan is dead,

167
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,300
we can spread news in the court of the lord's death.

168
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,900
Before the Golden Seal is found, news of Ye Zhao Nan's death can't be spread.

169
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,500
Send people to look for the Golden Seal under the cliff.

170
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,300
Only in this way, I can inherit the throne legally.

171
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,200
Yes.

172
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,000
General!

173
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
General, please spare us.

174
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We wouldn't dare say a word, General.

175
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,400
- Yes, General.
- We don't dare to...

176
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,100
I only believe dead people.

177
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,300
We know so much.

178
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,000
General Jin Fu will surely kill us.

179
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,400
If you do what I say, you will escape unscathed.

180
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,800
Keep us alive.

181
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,600
General, we are of great use.

182
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,400
Yes, General. Liu Xuan Ming sent the envoy, Guan San Mei, here.

183
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,700
We served her in Xuan Yue City. She trusts us a lot.

184
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,200
We are still of use to you!

185
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,400
General, please spare our lives.

186
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:28,500
If you didn't mention Xuan Yue City's envoy, it'd be fine.

187
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,000
My sister died in Xuan Yue City!

188
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,700
Do you think I'll spare her?

189
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,800
General, General.

190
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:41,900
General, is your ambition to be only the lord of Mu Xi City?

191
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,000
Keep talking.

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,800
The envoy sent by Xuan Yue City is called Guan San Mei,

193
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:55,200
who looks similar to Ye Zhao Nan.

194
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,400
She is the future wife of the lord of Xuan Yue City.

195
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,800
Liu Xuan Ming loves her very much and obeys her in everything.

196
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,300
He even broke his marriage alliance with Tian Mu City for San Mei.

197
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,900
Controlling Guan San Mei is equal to controlling Liu Xuan Ming.

198
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,900
By then, both Mu Xi and Xuan Yue will be in your hands.

199
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,200
Yes, all we've said is true.

200
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,600
General, if you don't believe us, send someone to investigate.

201
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,000
Yes, General.

202
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,600
General, I heard Guan San Mei killed Princess Qi Meng of Tian Mu City out of jealousy.

203
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,100
It spread throughout Xuan Yue City.

204
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,700
General, spare us.

205
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,400
We are willing to follow you till death

206
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,300
and assist you in achieving great heights.

207
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes, General.

208
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,400
Will General Jin Fu really believe us in this way?

209
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,200
We need to add a strong dose

210
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,400
that will blow his mind completely.

211
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,100
General, Yi Yang Jun of Tian Mu City asks to see you.

212
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,100
Carry the coffin to the inner room.

213
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,900
You three, guard the coffin day and night.

214
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:09,600
If others discover Ye Zhao Nan's body, you will suffer a terrible death.

215
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,400
Yes, General.

216
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,700
- Invite Yi Yang Jun in.
- Yes.

217
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,700
Yun Luo, here we are.

218
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,900
This is my residence in Mu Xi City. It is well-hidden,

219
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,900
and few people know about it.

220
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,500
If we stay at an inn, I fear it will be too conspicuous.

221
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,100
Sorry to make you suffer.

222
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,400
Not at all, not at all.

223
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,300
It's just... amazing!

224
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,200
Look.

225
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,600
Look at the dust.

226
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,000
At our place, the dust can't reach such a thickness.

227
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And this chair

228
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,700
is much more comfortable than those of Xuan Yue City.

229
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,900
Yun Luo, I'm sorry.

230
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,500
After I settle the matter here, we will return to Xuan Yue immediately.

231
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,200
I'm fine.

232
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,500
I mean it.

233
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,900
Home is wherever you are.

234
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,400
Just stay here.

235
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,200
I'll find General Jin Fu.

236
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,500
- I will go with you.
- No!

237
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,100
It's way too dangerous.

238
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,900
But your eyes...

239
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,200
Have you forgotten?

240
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:45,600
Although I can't see, I can hear.

241
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,900
Then I'll clean up here and await your return.

242
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,300
I didn't expect Princess Yun Luo to have a virtuous side.

243
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,400
Of course.

244
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,200
Remember not to wander off.

245
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,700
Understood. I'm a princess.

246
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,600
Princesses are the most obedient.

247
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,100
Go take a look.

248
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,000
It's so interesting.

249
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,100
If Liu Xuan Ming knew the person he liked was Ye Zhao Nan,

250
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,000
he would go crazy.

251
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,600
Your gloating expression is really annoying.

252
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:02,400
In order not to make Liu Xuan Ming go crazy,

253
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,000
you should give me some thought.

254
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,700
My Lord, the bed has been made.

255
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,800
Please go rest.

256
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,900
- Father.
- Don't.

257
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,800
- Big Brother.
- Don't.

258
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,800
What are you doing?

259
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,289
Let's just get along as before.

260
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:33,199
- This... We wouldn't dare to.
- No way.

261
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,200
In the past, we offended Your Lordship.

262
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,100
We seek Your Lordship's forgiveness.

263
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,500
Yes.

264
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,500
All right, so be it.

265
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,600
You know San Mei's temperament best.

266
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:56,400
Do you think she will suppress you as the lord?

267
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,800
Of course not.

268
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,900
Do you still need me to ask again?

269
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,700
Of course, she wouldn't do that.

270
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,300
San Mei.

271
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,800
Exactly.

272
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:24,700
The journey back to Mu Xi City this time is extremely dangerous. It's like entering a tiger's den.

273
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,100
How can your appearance fool General Jin Fu?

274
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,200
Besides, General Jin Fu knows that Ye Zhao Nan is with us.

275
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,900
Even if we lied to him that we killed Ye Zhao Nan,

276
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,100
once we appear at the same time as you, would Jin Fu believe us after seeing you?

277
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,400
Therefore, we can't appear together.

278
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,000
You three have more important things to do.

279
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,600
- The three of us...
- We...

280
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,800
You need to convince Jin Fu that Ye Zhao Nan is really dead.

281
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
How is it, Girl?

282
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,900
San Mei, are you all right?

283
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,400
We checked. There is a back door if we go south from the corridor.

284
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,000
No one is at the back door. Just go through there.

285
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,200
I think you should directly enter the palace to confront Jin Fu

286
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,900
then expose him.

287
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,600
It's not as simple as you think.

288
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,200
First, Jin Fu controls military power in the city.

289
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:54,900
Second, the court situation is unclear. We don't know how many officials are on his side.

290
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,800
We must reassure him for now.

291
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,700
Let's decide after we know the full situation.

292
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,400
What you said makes sense.

293
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,000
Father, Brother,

294
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,900
remember to be extremely cautious.

295
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,700
Master Jin Ting,

296
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:27,000
why is Mu Xi City as deserted as a temple in the mountain?

297
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,500
Today is my sister's funeral.

298
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,200
My eldest brother, General Jin Fu, is very powerful.

299
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,500
The whole city must stand in silent tribute.

300
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,700
I see.

301
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,100
When I was in Xuan Yue City, I often heard Jin Family is the pillar of Mu Xi City.

302
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,300
You really live up to your reputation.

303
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,400
Then

304
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,700
I shall rely on you from now on.

305
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,900
Don't worry, Miss Qian Yue.

306
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,500
After you marry me, I will surely treat you well.

307
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,700
Your hands are so smooth, fair, tender,

308
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,530
and so fragrant. Let's go.

309
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,100
Master Jin Ting,

310
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,800
what is this place?

311
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,800
Why aren't we going back to General's Manor?

312
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,700
They are holding my sister's funeral.

313
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,800
It would be inappropriate for me to take a girl home.

314
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,600
Right, it would be unsuitable and disrespectful.

315
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,900
Then we can find an inn to stay at.

316
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,800
What is this?

317
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,300
Miss Bai Lu, don't you know those who get a room are indecent?

318
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,000
I am Jin Family's second son.

319
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,100
If news spread that I got a room with you two, it would be bad.

320
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,600
You are right.

321
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,700
It's also for the sake of our reputation. It makes sense.

322
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,500
Miss Qian Yue knows better.

323
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,400
Bai Lu, go get some water.

324
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,300
Let's clean this place up.

325
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
Didn't you hear what Master Jin Ting said?

326
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,600
Why are you still here? Go.

327
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,600
Miss Qian Yue,

328
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:11,900
sooner or later, we will marry. Aren't there some things we will have to do eventually?

329
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,200
Are you talking about the marriage?

330
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,800
I have to discuss this with my mother.

331
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,200
What marriage?

332
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,200
That's not what I said.

333
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,500
Darling, you pretended with me all day.

334
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
- Just stop.
- Help!

335
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,900
- Come on, Darling.
- What are you doing?

336
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,200
I will get you high.

337
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,000
Bai Lu! Bai Lu!

338
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,100
Hush. Be quiet.

339
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,900
You beast!

340
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,100
How dare you bully me?

341
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,400
Do you know who I am?

342
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,600
Back where we came from, I was very popular in Xuan Yue City.

343
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,800
If it weren't because Xuan Yue City was too small

344
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:55,800
to accommodate my ambition and world-class talents,

345
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,200
would I have come to Mu Xi City with you?

346
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,100
Listen,

347
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:03,700
you'd better let your brother Jin Fu hand over his military power

348
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,400
and let me take charge of Mu Xi City.

349
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,500
I will go back to Xuan Yue City, destroy Tian Mu City

350
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,200
and unify...

351
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,000
the whole country.

352
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,600
It's hard to unify the whole country,

353
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,200
but you can rule the brothel.

354
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,810
[General's Manor]

355
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,200
Yi Yang Jun, you didn't come all the way here

356
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,800
just to pay homage to my sister, did you?

357
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,600
You are right, General.

358
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,700
I came here to ask for someone.

359
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,500
"Ask for someone"?

360
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,000
Who?

361
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,200
Guan San Mei of Xuan Yue City.

362
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,700
You came to Mu Xi City to ask for someone from Xuan Yue City?

363
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,700
You must be jesting.

364
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:23,599
I learned that Liu Xuan Ming sent Guan San Mei to Mu Xi City as an envoy.

365
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,000
She followed Liu Xuan Ming for years and is deeply trusted by him.

366
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,100
She is haughty since she is favored. She even dared kill Princess Qi Meng of Tian Mu City.

367
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,400
I will avenge this.

368
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,600
Then why didn't you kill her in Xuan Yue City?

369
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,900
In Xuan Yue City, Liu Xuan Ming protected her always.

370
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,800
It was hard to take action.

371
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,700
Now she came to Mu Xi City;

372
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,400
I can't just let her go.

373
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:59,700
All know that Princess Qi Meng and Yi Yang Jun of Tian Mu conspired against Xuan Yue City

374
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,800
and suffered total defeat.

375
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:07,100
You don't even have a servant with you,

376
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,200
and you are all alone.

377
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,200
Why should I listen to you?

378
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,500
Because I am still Yi Yang Jun of Tian Mu City.

379
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,700
General, do you dare to disregard Tian Mu City?

380
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,600
The envoy of Xuan Yue City, Guan San Mei is here!

381
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,400
Here she is.

382
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,400
Yi Yang Jun, you may act now.

383
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,500
General, if you intend to befriend Tian Mu City,

384
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,000
why don't you do it yourself?

385
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,500
No problem.

386
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:57,000
♫ Secretly hiding, secretly thinking of you ♫

387
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,000
♫ Burying my feelings for you in my heart ♫

388
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,500
♫ The esteemed lord ♫

389
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:10,200
♫ Should not show vulnerability ♫

♫ Before the people so easily ♫

391
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:25,100
♫ When you appear, when you approach ♫

392
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:32,200
♫ When someone understands that I'm not a god ♫

393
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,800
♫ Your words ♫

394
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,400
♫ Are etched in my mind ♫

395
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:45,000
♫ That tender heart of yours ♫

396
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,600
♫ I want to protect you while navigating the storm ♫

397
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,200
♫ Braving the glint and flash of cold steel ♫

398
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:59,200
♫ I want to take you to see scenery you've never seen ♫

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,700
♫ I really want to be with you forever ♫

♫ Only my love for you is everlasting ♫

402
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,900
♫ A deep-rooted affection ♫
