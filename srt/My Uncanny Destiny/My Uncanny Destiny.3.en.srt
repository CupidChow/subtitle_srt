00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,300
I will never lose my land.

161
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:54,839
The 100,000 taels of gold are Xuan Yue's tax revenue of several years so it is extremely precious.

162
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,079
It was just a stalling measure then.

163
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:00,070
If not, how could they have sent Qi Meng here?

164
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:05,440
After they have arrived, ask someone to raise an objection.

165
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,770
By that time, I will have a reason to refuse.

166
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,039
- Who is he?
- The envoy of Tian Mu.

167
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:29,300
That is the famous Yi Yang.

168
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,339
He is really extraordinary!

169
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:35,440
I heard that Princess Qi Meng is a beautiful woman.

170
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,100
I would like to see that.

171
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,510
He is such an awesome guy.

172
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,120
[Yi Yang: Envoy of Tian Mu City]

173
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,230
Your Grace!

174
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,730
Princess Qi Meng.

175
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,850
Qi Meng, you are about to meet Xuan Ming.

176
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:09,130
Yi Yang Jun, the marriage matters will be left to you.

177
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,940
After planning for so long, we have been waiting for this day.

178
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,499
All the officials are afraid of Tian Mu City.

179
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,490
I am afraid that no one would dare to oppose it.

180
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,230
Why is the bath water a bit unusual today?

181
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,120
Is it?

182
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,490
How can it be unusual?

183
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,660
Well... it feels itchy.

184
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,260
"Itchy"?

185
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,840
It is a bit itchy.

186
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:55,710
Your Majesty, this pendant seems to belong to San Mei.

187
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,669
Go summon her.

188
00:13:58,669 --> 00:13:59,920
All right.

189
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,450
My tongue is so numb.

190
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,920
You come on to me again.

191
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,130
You are here.

192
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,850
This pendant belongs to you, right?

193
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,279
Ke Qian Yue, what are you going to do?

194
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,880
Your Majesty,

195
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,860
in this lonely chamber, the heart of night silently works to shred your sorrow.

196
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,910
- I finally know your taste.
- What?

197
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,880
Here I come.

198
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,840
So San Mei told you that I like rough, fierce women.

199
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:22,859
You temptress, how dare you lie to me?

200
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:25,119
- I...
- Ke Qian Yue!

201
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:29,130
- Step back.
- Let's go, Warrior. Let's go.

202
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,629
I like your outfit. Where did you get it?

203
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,010
Come back!

204
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,629
Why did you deceive Ke Qian Yue?

205
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:41,520
Do you want to take revenge on her

206
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,220
or on me?

207
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,169
Only a fool would ask a multiple-choice question.

208
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:48,579
- I want revenge on you both.
- You!

209
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,260
You are... a shrewish woman!

210
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,569
I rescued you!

211
00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:56,830
You are ungrateful, and you handed me over to her!

212
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:09,330
You don't know how she tortured me.

213
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,930
Don't look at me with such innocent eyes.

214
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:22,399
Remember, I like women who are wise.

215
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,220
This won't work on me!

216
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,930
What are you doing?

217
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,970
If you are dissatisfied with me,

218
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:38,900
you can openly take revenge on me.

219
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,660
I understand it now.

220
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,170
San Mei is so strong.

221
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,270
She is so crude.

222
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,410
I like her so much.

223
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:08,189
- Coming on to me again...
- What?

224
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:09,809
Coming on to you?

225
00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:12,070
I would rather come on to close stools (portable toilet).

226
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,610
Is that what you want?

227
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:14,969
- Fine.
- What?

228
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,220
Housekeeper Ke's close stool is too hard to clean.
[Sanitation Department]

229
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,309
You see; the palace is so quiet.

230
00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:32,640
You can tell that girl...

231
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,860
Well, she didn't succeed.

232
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,350
As long as she doesn't tell on us, this is better than anything else.

233
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,049
I wonder how that girl is doing now.

234
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:43,039
Aren't you a fortune teller?

235
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,759
Come on. Do it for her.

236
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:47,929
I... Let me see.

237
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:54,500
She is right here under our noses.

238
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:05,570
This is Sanitation Department where close stools are scrubbed.

239
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:09,010
From now on, you will work here.

240
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,410
I want you to know what living death feels like.

241
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,820
- Old Guan.
- Yes?

242
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:18,019
Here is a new worker for you.

243
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,690
Teach her how to scrub close stools.

244
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,750
All right.

245
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,720
Sir, how do I scrub them?

246
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,470
Although it is a rough job, it needs to be done carefully.

247
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,390
Dip some water and scrub hard.

248
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,880
Take it.

249
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:52,250
Well, I am going inside to wax it.

250
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,750
"Wax it"?

251
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,140
Sir,

252
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,260
how do I wax it?

253
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,330
Do it like this.

254
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,620
By licking?

255
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,739
I don't think you changed the bath water today.

256
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,099
How could that be? Every step was checked by me personally.

257
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:26,119
- It can't go wrong.
- But I really feel itchy.

258
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:27,550
Brother.

259
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,790
Brother, what's up?

260
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,179
Your Grace,

261
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,770
why are you here?

262
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:39,519
Brother, I already saw what happened in the Chamber of Baths just now.

263
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,340
I think San Mei is very special.

264
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,919
If you make her work for us,

265
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,499
we will surely make Xuan Yue rich and mighty,

266
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,400
take down Mu Xi City, and kill Ye Zhao Nan!

267
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,950
Brother!

268
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,929
Brother, don't ignore me. Wait for me.

269
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,090
Your Grace.

270
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,730
What is wrong?

271
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,680
Look at you; can't you be more dignified?

272
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,060
Come on.

273
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,240
I knew you loved me the most.

274
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,479
So childlike,

275
00:20:23,479 --> 00:20:25,040
when will you grow up?

276
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,819
I don't want to grow up.

277
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:28,929
I want to stick to you all the time.

278
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:30,780
Stop talking nonsense.

279
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,740
You will get married in the future.

280
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,289
At that time, you will only think about your husband, not about me.

281
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:38,919
I won't do that.

282
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:42,740
In my heart, you will always be the first.

283
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:46,329
In my opinion, you are the one who will always think about your wife.

284
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:50,019
As they say, softhearted men get manipulated by their wives.

285
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,100
Brother, why are you so weak?

286
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,420
That is not true.

287
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,330
Hold on tight.

288
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:58,199
Let's take down Mu Xi City!

289
00:20:58,199 --> 00:20:59,909
And kill Ye Zhao Nan!

290
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,459
- Come on!
- Come on!

291
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,339
Slow down, Brother.

292
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,650
Take down Mu Xi City!

293
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:14,240
Kill Ye Zhao Nan!

294
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,580
Let's go back!

295
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,059
- What do you say?
- How about me?

296
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:25,740
That is not enough.

297
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,789
- Where?
- Here, here.

298
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,340
Let me do it for you.

299
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,169
Miss, what can I do for you?

300
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:43,650
Father?

301
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,380
Big Brother?

302
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,959
Miss, you have the wrong guy.

303
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:53,789
That is right. How could she talk nonsense?

304
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:55,529
I am a eunuch.

305
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:56,909
Exactly,

306
00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:00,059
my grandfather became a eunuch at the age of eight.

307
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,249
How could I have a daughter?

308
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,140
What a nuisance!

309
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:08,810
Old Guan, Feng Lei, we must discuss the assassination of—

310
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:12,350
Liu Xuan Ming.

311
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:18,380
Well, that is over.

312
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,759
It was just a stalling measure then.

313
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,230
If not, how could they have sent Qi Meng here?

314
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:31,539
After they have arrived, ask someone to raise an objection.

315
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:33,540
By that time, I will have a reason to refuse.

316
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,199
I think San Mei is very special.

317
00:22:37,199 --> 00:22:39,829
If you make her work for us,

318
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,269
we will surely make Xuan Yue rich and mighty,

319
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:44,510
take down Mu Xi City, and kill Ye Zhao Nan!

320
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:46,300
It should be you.

321
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:51,980
It was hard to find you.

322
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,440
I thought you were guards,

323
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,030
but you are eunuchs.

324
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,660
Miss, we are sorry.

325
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:03,329
It is all our fault. In fact, we—

326
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:05,220
We shouldn't have lied to you,

327
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,460
but we had no other option.

328
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:10,349
We live with a blood feud.

329
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:16,149
If Liu Xuan Ming is not killed, we will be ashamed of our ancestors.

330
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:17,580
Wait a minute!

331
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,519
Won't you let your ancestors down by being eunuchs?

332
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,690
That is not right.

333
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,199
Old Guan, Feng Lei, Zhao Jing,

334
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:27,179
you are family, but you have three surnames!

335
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:28,509
It... it is not important.

336
00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:30,280
Not important.

337
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,840
Why is it not important?

338
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,590
Don't try to evade the question.

339
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,439
We live incognito.

340
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,719
If others knew we are a family, we would break the palace rules.

341
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:42,929
Exactly.

342
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:44,710
That's it.

343
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,579
What is my last name?

344
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:51,460
- Feng!
- Zhao!
- Guan!

345
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,879
Well, it is Guan.

346
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,840
Of course, you take my surname.

347
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,270
Exactly.

348
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,599
- Then my name is...
- San Mei!

349
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:00,130
- We are... your elder brothers.
- San Mei.

350
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:02,350
Guan San Mei, Guan San Mei.

351
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,649
But I can't remember anything.

352
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,219
I doubt what you said.

353
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,590
So how could you trust us?

354
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,199
Feng Lei, what do you want to do?

355
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,670
- Can you be gentle with San Mei?
- She is too paranoid.

356
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:15,529
Listen. I told you to bear with your little sister.

357
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,049
Why are you disobedient?

358
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,879
Father, Father,

359
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,860
c-calm down.

360
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,989
San Mei,

361
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,410
what can we do to make you believe us?

362
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,969
Right, my daughter.

363
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:28,710
Nothing but...

364
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:35,990
reminding me of the past.

365
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,330
[Sanitation Department]

366
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,249
Loud snoring, it's like killing something. Get up!

367
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:52,889
I shall show you my unique skills.

368
00:24:52,889 --> 00:24:54,190
Be quick.

369
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,380
Come on.

370
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:16,549
Does it work?

371
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,310
I don't know.

372
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,309
Is she dead?

373
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,860
I don't know.

374
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,199
She is still exhaling.

375
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,620
Then she is not dead yet.

376
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,290
Right.

377
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:46,990
San Mei, I am your father.

378
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:52,090
We lived with a big, wealthy family.

379
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,080
I love you very much.

380
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,309
Your brothers love you, too.

381
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:01,110
You are the apple of our eyes,

382
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:04,080
our baby girl.

383
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,610
We all love you.

384
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,469
Great, San Mei is great.

385
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,880
Mercy!

386
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,350
Great! San Mei is great.

387
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:32,400
I remembered!

388
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,630
You...

389
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,110
are my family!

390
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:00,270
My daughter, it is good that you remember us.

391
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,629
There are only four of us Guans left.

392
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:05,010
We must unite.

393
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:10,529
Father is right. Let's work together to kill Liu Xuan Ming and avenge our entire family.

394
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:11,750
Right?

395
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,159
Last time, we knocked Liu Xuan Ming's guards out.

396
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,149
Security in the palace must have increased.

397
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:19,320
It is more difficult for us to kill Liu Xuan Ming.

398
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,430
If there is a banquet,

399
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:27,310
we can wait for the opportunity

400
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:31,780
and fish in troubled waters.

401
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,070
It is not as easy as you think.

402
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:37,559
Liu Xuan Ming never did such things.

403
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,759
He has spent all money on wars.

404
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,330
All he wants is to attack Mu Xi City.

405
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,810
There is an opportunity now.

406
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:51,390
Liu Xuan Ming will marry Princess Qi Meng.

407
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:56,300
I heard that Princess Qi Meng arrived yesterday.

408
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:02,699
I am sure Liu Xuan Ming will hold a banquet to entertain the envoys tomorrow.

409
00:28:02,699 --> 00:28:04,150
Good!

410
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,350
It is the god-sent opportunity.

411
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:37,010
What are you doing?

412
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,259
Well, well, it is a good day today.

413
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,260
What a nice day.

414
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,890
There, there.

415
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,559
H-Hurry.

416
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,160
Don't you want to eat?

417
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,430
What are you doing?

418
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:01,250
Take a bite.

419
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,629
- Come on.
- I won't!

420
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,570
You are so ungrateful!

421
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,730
Go to Sanitation Department now to scrub close stools.

422
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,200
Quickly!

423
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,710
Who do you think you are?

424
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,210
So unappreciative.

425
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,339
My Lord.

426
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,720
What do you want?

427
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:23,279
- My Lord.
- What are you doing?

428
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,570
My Lord.

429
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,780
Help!

430
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:32,550
Where is the person His Majesty brought back?

431
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:35,349
At the Sanitation Department.

432
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:51,020
Mother, when I get back, I will treat you well.

433
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:55,079
Madam Wang, when I get rich, set me up with a nice girl.

434
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,610
How sweet...

435
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:00,219
Father, I miss you.

436
00:30:00,219 --> 00:30:01,860
My daughter,

437
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:08,410
when I accomplish the job and earn some money,

438
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,720
I will find you a decent husband.

439
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,390
Ye Zhao Nan,

440
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,810
this is where you are hiding!

441
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:14,630
♫ Secretly hiding, secretly thinking of you ♫

442
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:21,700
♫ Burying my feelings for you in my heart ♫

443
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:25,210

444
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,840
♫ Should not show vulnerability ♫

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,930
♫ When someone understands that I'm not a god ♫

00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:53,540
♫ Your words ♫

449

♫ Are etched in my mind ♫

450

♫ That tender heart of yours ♫

451
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:06,220
♫ I want to protect you while navigating the storm ♫
