Why don't you go to find Ye Zhao Nan but stay at General's Manor?

00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:39,530
General Jin Fu is the key minister of Mu Xi City,

97
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:41,840
and he is deeply trusted by Ye Zhao Nan.

98
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,049
Convincing Jin Fu is equivalent to convincing Ye Zhao Nan.

You're staying here

103
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,080
because of

104
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,440
that man, right?

105
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,689
I saw you two flirting with each other at the banquet tonight.

106
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,560

107
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,230
Are you jealous?

108
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,470
Don't forget you are a married woman.

109
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,080
When did I get married?

110
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,020
We got married.

111
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,420
Without a wedding ceremony.

112
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,810

00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,030
How can you say such irresponsible words?

117
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,100
All right.

118
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,600
Don't be angry.

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,900
I...

120
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,700
One of my best friends fell in love with someone

121
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,500
who hated her so much.

122
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,600
In order to be with him,

123
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,200
she had to conceal her identity and deceive him.

124
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,000
Do you think her lover will forgive her?

125
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,000
It depends on her purpose.

126
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,200
If her purpose is for the benefit of the two,

127
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,500
it's okay to use some tricks in the middle.

128
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,300
Her lover won't hate her, right?

129
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,000
The key is that two people like each other.

130
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,600
Even if they get hurt, they will forgive each other.

131
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,000
Attention. You two are not married yet.

132
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,200
Girl. Bad luck for you.

133
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,900
Quiet. Don't make noise.

134
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,600
- Feng Lei.
- Yes.

135
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,500
It seems you have to go to the coffin home again.

136
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,300
"Coffin home"? I-I've been there once.

137
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,900
It should be your turn.

138
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,200
Me?

139
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,500
Don't be afraid.

140
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Just treat the dead body as a sleeping person.

141
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,600
Go.

142
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,400
Look at how timid you are.

143
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,400
- How about you go?
- Old Guan, you should go.

144

Why do you stay here?

148
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,700
I must prevent you from doing anything to San Mei.

149
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,000
It's out of all reason.

150
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,200
Naive.

151
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,500
I...

152
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,100
Nothing. Go to sleep.

153

Don't you sleep!

154
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,700
You are worthy of being my daughter.

You are just like me.

157
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,200
Father, were there also two men who were jealous over you?

158
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,500
Women.

159

Back then, I was talented and elegant.

Countless women have chased and intercepted me,

161

just to take a look at me.

162
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,400
Wait... Hadn't they been to the Zoo?

163
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,700
Shut up. Watch your words.

164

00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:09,000
You don't look like a servant.

333
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,100
I am not a servant at all.

334
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:15,800
But you have to pretend to be a servant now.

335
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,300
If someone else finds out your identity, all of us will be in danger.

336
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,700
What do you want?

337
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:31,900
You should learn how to be a servant.

338
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,000
Tea, please.

339
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,600
It's so hot.

340
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,500
Your saliva...

341
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,500
What do you want?

342
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,600
Watch your attitude.

343
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,700
Dear Master, what else do you want?

344
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,300
Give me a massage.

345
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,600
Yes.

346
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,600
What should I name you?

347
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,100
As you wish.

348
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,900
Please give me a name.

349
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:34,400
I will call you Da Lao Hu.

350
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,200
Da Lao Hu.

351
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,900
Take your time. Don't choke yourself.

352
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,800
Here. Take some water.

353
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,800
After all, you are the princess of Tian Mu City.

354
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,000
Why are you so miserable?

355
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,500
"Princess"?

356
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,600
After my father's death,

357
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,600
my brothers fought for the throne.

358
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,700
I escaped by running fast.

359
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:33,800
I wanted to go to Xuan Yue City. But remembering that Qi Meng died there,

360
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,800
I could only go to Mu Xi City. Then I met you.

361
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,100
Qi Meng killed my sworn sister and wanted to seize Xuan Yue City.

362
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,100
I know.

363
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,000
I know her well.

364
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,700
What happened to her was all her own fault.

365
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,100
I just feel so sorry for you.

366
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,400
Where do you live now?

367
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,200
There is a shattered temple in the city's south.

368
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
I live there now.

369
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,000
How about you live with me?

370
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,700
I bought something today.

371
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,700
Although it's not as good as the inner city, it is better than that shattered temple.

372
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,000
How dare I bother you?

373
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm glad that you forgave me.

374
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,200
Never mind. That's a deal.

375
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,300
Yun Luo, you are so kind.

376
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,300
Boss, one more.

377
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,500
San Mei, you are brave and intelligent.

378
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,800
Have you thought about going one step further?

379
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,000
"Going one step further"?

380
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,200
Being the wife of the Lord?

381
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,300
Aren't you already the wife of the Lord?

382
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,200
You can take one step further

383
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:10,000
and be the Lord of Mu Xi City, Ye Zhao Nan.

384
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,700
What do you think?

385
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:43,600
♫ Secretly hiding, secretly thinking of you ♫

386
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:50,700
♫ Burying my feelings for you in my heart ♫

387
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,200
♫ The esteemed lord ♫

388
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,800
♫ Should not show vulnerability ♫

389
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:04,900
♫ Before the people so easily ♫

390
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:11,900
♫ When you appear, when you approach ♫

391
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:19,000
♫ When someone understands that I'm not a god ♫

392
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,400
♫ Your words ♫

393
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,000
♫ Are etched in my mind ♫

394
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,700
♫ That tender heart of yours ♫

395
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,200
♫ I want to protect you while navigating the storm ♫

396
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,800
♫ Braving the glint and flash of cold steel ♫

397
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:46,000
♫ I want to take you to see scenery you've never seen ♫

398
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,400
♫ I really want to be with you forever ♫

399
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,000
♫ Whether we are on opposing sides or archenemies ♫

400
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,600
♫ Only my love for you is everlasting ♫

401
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,100
♫ A deep-rooted affection ♫
