In the distant ancient times,

there was a city called Mu Xi.

Its lord, Ye Tang, was childless.

He was appointed Baron by the former lord.

168
00:11:14,489 --> 00:11:17,100
Please think twice, My Lord!

169
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:20,819
My Lord, I must carry on the family line. I need to...

170
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,870
Please think twice, My Lord!

171
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,269
Have mercy on me, My Lord!

172
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,789
No, no!

173
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,790
My Lord, no!

174
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,590
- Oh no, My Lord!
- My Lord.

175
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,750
The old lord of Mu Xi City has died.
[Chief bodyguard, Yao Hu]

176
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,380
Ye Zhao Nan, his son, has ascended the throne.

177
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,390
A son pays his father's debts.

178
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,120
I shall capture Ye Zhao Nan alive,

179
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,060
strip his skin and have him torn to pieces

180
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,239
so I can vent my hatred!

181
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,860
Please don't! I need to carry on the family line!

182
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:57,350
[Liu Xuan Ming, Lord of Xuan Yue City]

183
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,309
My Lord, there was a clear distinction between both genders

184
00:12:03,309 --> 00:12:04,759
and all classes since ancient times.

185
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,309
Ever since your decree was announced, confusion exists over gender roles.

186
00:12:08,309 --> 00:12:11,699
Men learn to sing and dance, while women learn martial arts.

187
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:14,709
Men do household chores, while women do business.

188
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:19,680
All of it goes against society's norms and can lead to disaster.

189
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,579
My Lord, you ascended the throne and are unfamiliar with government.

190
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:25,290
My Lord, please cancel the order.

191
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,340
Are you telling me what to do?

192
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,790
How absurd!

193
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,849
My Lord, wear it in case you catch a cold.

194
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,209
My Lord,

195
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:47,209
Liu Xuan Ming, the Lord of Xuan Yue City, is ferocious and fond of killing.
[General Jin Fu]

196
00:12:47,209 --> 00:12:49,970
He cast a greedy eye at Mu Xi City.

197
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:56,520
My Lord, please prioritize the stability of Mu Xi City and annul your order.

198
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,120
Please cancel the order.

199
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,040
My dear subjects, you're all highly educated.

200
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:13,360
May I ask where the "Four Books" and "Five Classics" (Confucius' texts) say women are inferior to men,

201
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,030
that women can't do what men do,

202
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:24,079
or men cannot do things that women do?

203
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,259
My Lord, can women be at the front line of the battlefield?

204
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,490
Official Qian, do you know

205
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,869
Fu Hao, wife of King Wu Ding of Shang Dynasty,

206
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,289
who led armies on the king's behalf?

207
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,629
Do you know Zhong Wu Yan, King Qi Xuan's queen,

208
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:49,879
who led an army expedition to save Qi State from a crisis?

209
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:55,180
My dear subjects, read more books when you're free.

210
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:04,790
My Lord, as you said, can men go through labor as women do?

211
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,480
My dear subject, do you know

212
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,109
why women can give birth while you men cannot?

213
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:15,649
There is a biological reason for this.

214
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:21,280
In my opinion, it's because females are inclusive enough to make room for you,

215
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,100
but you have no room for them.

216
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,920
If there's nothing else, you may leave.

217
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,850
Please wait a moment, My Lord!

218
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,560
My sister, Zhi Lan, has been married to you for months,

219
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,619
but you've refused to share a room with her till now.

220
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:45,299
Is there anything you find hard to disclose, as the rumor says?

221
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,640
That's right.

222
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,050
How dare you!

223
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,530
I'm a hot-blooded male. There's nothing I find hard to disclose!

224
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:57,850
My family matters shouldn't be discussed during court session.

225
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,160
- Adjourn!
- "Adjourn!"

226
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,220
Take care, My Lord.

227
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,590
Zhi Lan, you can do it.

228
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,760
Today, I must win His Lordship's favor.

229
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,309
Eunuch Sun, how was I just now?

230
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,940
You did well.

231
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,760
My Lord, I'm guilty.

232
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:38,260
I forgot you would have your period soon.

233
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:41,000
It's okay.

234
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,860
I'll go back to my room and change the sanitary towel.

235
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,799
What's been bothering me is actually Zhi Lan.

236
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,570
Why did Father arrange this marriage for me?

237
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:55,179
He was worried that after his death, General Jin Fu might be disloyal to you.

238
00:15:55,179 --> 00:15:59,759
Such an arrangement would set General Jin Fu's mind at ease.

239
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,569
But I've been avoiding her for months!

240
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,970
I can't avoid her forever.

241
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,930
I shall go hunting.

242
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,640
When we're hunting, I'll run to the cliff edge

243
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,749
while Jin Fu and Zhi Lan are off guard.

244
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:26,129
Eunuch Sun, find a trustworthy guard and disguise him as an assassin to pretend to kill me.

245
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:31,560
During that time, I can use the need to recover as an excuse to take a few months off.

246
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,510
That's a great idea, My Lord.

247
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:38,090
My charm shall take the blame.

248
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,230
[Glory and Grace]

249
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,270
Oh, it hurts.

250
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,900
My Lord.

251
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,020
Zhi Lan, why are you here?

252
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:15,460
Why are you holding the sanitary towel?

253
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:24,910
This is something I specially prepared for you.

254
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,450
Well, I have work to do.

255
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:31,250
Take a good rest.

256
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,670
My Lord, do you think I'm pretty?

257
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,130
Zhi Lan, don't... don't catch a cold.

258
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,090
My Lord.

259
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,129
Zhi... Zhi Lan, what are you doing?

260
00:18:00,129 --> 00:18:03,289
We're an official couple who has completed the marriage ceremony.

261
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,499
Why have you been avoiding me?

262
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,229
We're just a couple in name.

263
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,250
Today, shall we become a real couple?

264
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,629
Zhi Lan, calm down!

265
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,660
Be serene.

266
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:20,550
Did I do something wrong that you keep me away?

267
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,359
You didn't do anything wrong.

268
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:25,160
I'm the one at fault.

269
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,260
You won't be happy being with me.

270
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:31,750
I'll make you happy.

271
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,780
My Lord.

272
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,310
My Lord.

273
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,830
Zhi Lan!

274
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,070
My Lord.

275
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,629
You don't need to make me happy.

276
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,149
You should make yourself happy!

277
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:43,970
I'll be happy

278
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,280
as long as you are happy.

279
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,429
- No, no.
- My Lord.

280
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:50,689
- Zhi Lan! Zhi Lan! No, no, no!
- Stop running.

281
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:52,070
Zhi Lan.

282
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,150
Blood.

283
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:06,710
My Lord, do you have hemorrhoids?

284
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,200
Let me take a look.

285
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,790
No, no, no. It's due to heat!

286
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:16,660
Your brother irritated me in the morning court session.

287
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,320
Then let me cool you down.

288
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,700
Let me take you on a hunting trip.

289
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:41,730
My Lord, are you sure you don't want to take a bath in the river with me?

290
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,940
Take a bath by yourself.

291
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,190
All right.

292
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,959
My Lord, ahead is Mu Xi City's territory.

293
00:19:47,959 --> 00:19:50,369
The Tian Mu City group for a marriage alliance is on its way.

294
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:52,559
Shall we wait till Princess Qi Meng makes it to the city

295
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,429
and the marriage alliance is done before we attack Mu Xi City together?

296
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:56,219
That would be great.

297
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,320
We can join Tian Mu City to destroy Mu Xi City.

298
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,260
But I can't wait

299
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,840
to kill Ye Zhao Nan.

300
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:11,130
Killing an ignorant boy is quite simple.

301
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,639
My Lord, with your stone-skipping skills, wisdom, looks and courage,

302
00:20:17,639 --> 00:20:21,309
you're unparalleled and uniquely exceptional.

303
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:22,819
But we will be entering Mu Xi City.

304
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,849
I'm worried about your safety.

305
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:26,460
What if we...

306
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,700
My Lord, My Lord!

307
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:31,530
Wait for me, My Lord!

308
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,930
Wait for me, My Lord!

309
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,209
- Hail to the Lord!
- Hail to the Lord!

310
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:18,249
- My Lord, you are brilliant!
- Hail to the Lord!

311
00:21:18,249 --> 00:21:20,640
Hail to the Lord!

312
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:24,969
The weather today is good.

313
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,310
It's time for me to display my skills.

314
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,200
My Lord, wait for me.

315
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,980
My Lord, slow down. Wait!

316
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:42,060
Is the assassin ready?

317
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,930
I've got the top assassin prepared.
[Vice General Zhou]

318
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,359
Once Ye Zhao Nan is killed,

319
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,199
I'll order the spy planted in Xuan Yue City to kill Liu Xuan Ming.

320
00:21:51,199 --> 00:21:53,869
Chaos will break out in Xuan Yue City,

321
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,160
and you can easily take the throne as the Lord of Mu Xi City.

322
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,740
Tell the assassin to grab the Golden Seal of Mu Xi.

323
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:05,570
Only in this way can I be enthroned justifiably.

324
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,360
My Lord!

325
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:49,530
Is this the assassin sent by Eunuch Sun?

326
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,630
Why is he looking at me with such affection?

327
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,680
My good looks are enough to take a man's breath away.

328
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,349
I should quickly let him cut me.

329
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,670
Jin Fu and the rest will probably be here soon.

330
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,420
Just do it!

331
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,060
Here.

332
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,390
I saved you.

333
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:19,060
But instead of showing me gratitude, you are acting flirtatiously.

334
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:22,910
I'm tall, grand and handsome, but I'm not interested in men.

335
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,960
Sir, please mind your behavior.

336
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:35,080
Do you have some misunderstanding of the words "tall, grand and handsome"?

337
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,769
Fine, that's enough. Just come at me here.

338
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:39,109
Come on!

339
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:41,919
From how you are dressed, you must be from a reputable family.

340
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,170
How can you use vulgar language?

341
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:45,990
What a disgrace.

342
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,020
Do you know whom you're talking to?

343
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,900
[Top assassin, Tan Rang]

344
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,980
Who are you?

345
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,440
The top assassin in the world,

346
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,020
Tan Rang.

347
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,680
The assassin sent by Eunuch Sun is so good-looking.

348
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,060
Ye Zhao Nan is quite well-informed.

349
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,590
I didn't expect his assassin against me this fast.

350
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,920
Ye Zhao Nan.

351
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,310
Something is wrong.

352
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,830
How could Eunuch Sun have gotten two assassins?

353
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,520
He can't even get things done properly!

354
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,850
Jin Fu will be here soon.

355
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,820
All right!

356
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,110
You two stop fighting!

357
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,480
I'll raise your payment.

358
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,660
Come at me together.

359
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,309
How can someone be so ridiculous and shameless?

360
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:17,490
He actually wants a threesome?

361
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,790
Don't let go.

362
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,029
You're grasping me so tightly. I couldn't even if I wanted to.

363
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,330
Hang in there.

364
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,530
Watch out!

365
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,960
[General's Manor]

366
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,170
General,

367
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,860
we searched all below the cliff, but we failed to find His Lordship's body.

368
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,310
What about the Golden Seal?

369
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,529
Tan Rang didn't get it.

370
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,179
It should still be with Ye Zhao Nan.

371
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,999
The top assassin in the world?

372
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,690
I think he's useless!

373
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:29,529
Don't let this leak out yet!

374
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,120
Ensure that no officials know Ye Zhao Nan is missing!

375
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,910
Just tell them that he is unwell and needs to rest in seclusion.

376
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:40,900
Miss Zhi Lan worried about His Lordship so she went looking for him alone.

377
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:44,710
She saw little of the world and is naive.

378
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:46,850
Anything bad could happen to her.

379
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,999
Go find her and bring her back.

380
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,180
Yes!

381
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,240
Bring her back!

382
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,480
Have you prepared the spy in Xuan Yue City?

383
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,400
He assassinates Liu Xuan Ming tonight.

384
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,059
Good! Have Tan Rang find Ye Zhao Nan at once!

385
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:01,930
I must see him, dead or alive!

386
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:04,699
Most important now is to get the Golden Seal,

387
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,570
the Golden Seal!

388
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,900
Yes!

389
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,660
Don't move.

390
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,900
Don't move.

391
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,690
My shoes! My shoes!

392
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,050
My shoes!

393
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,050
Don't move!

394
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,920
Stop! Stop, stop!

395
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,089
Brother, my... my pants are falling off.

396
00:27:36,089 --> 00:27:37,840
Brother, my pants are falling off!

397
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,609
Where else can I hold besides your pants?

398
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,500
A-Anywhere else... except there.

399
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,700
Believe it or not, I can jump down with your pants.

400
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,050
Brother!

401
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:50,130
Brother.

402
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,740
Hurry. Come up.

403
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,500
Thanks, Friend.

404
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,460
My pants.

405
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,790
You pervert!

406
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,880
No wonder she was being frivolous (flirty).

407
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,070
It turns out she's a woman.

408
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,410
She has a slow but strong pulse.

409
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:51,140
When will she awake?

410
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,530
That I do not know yet.

411
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:57,229
I'll give her some medicine before I assess her condition.

412
00:28:57,229 --> 00:28:59,479
She's in this state due to me.

413
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:03,070
You must cure her no matter what.

414
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,140
Yes, I'll do my best.

415
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,309
Watch out.

416
00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:21,600
You hothead.
[Mu Xi spies: Lao (Old) Guan, Zhao Jing and Feng Lei]

417
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,280
Quiet.
[Mu Xi spies: Lao (Old) Guan, Zhao Jing and Feng Lei]

418
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,020
It's Liu Xuan Ming's carriage.

419
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:30,339
Vice General Zhou sent a letter that General Jin Fu orders us to do the job tonight.

420
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,460
All is ready.

421
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,050
We can do it at 11 p.m. when the rotation begins.

422
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,639
Great.

423
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,679
It's been five years.

424
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:41,760
I can finally visit with my mother again.

425
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,400
I can return and see my daughter.

426
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,519
Old Guan, do a fortune-telling.

427
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,179
Will we succeed tonight?

428
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,789
Free of worries,

429
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:52,199
assent from a nobleman,

430
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,610
it's an auspicious (lucky) sign.

431
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,079
My Lord, where are you? My Lord!

432
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,010
Stop there!

433
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,650
Who are you?

434
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,400
Don't run!

435
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,410
Stop! Stop!

436
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:15,290
Get her! She's from Mu Xi!

437
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,399
- Stop!
- Don't run!

438
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,030
Stop!

439
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,630
What are you doing here?

440
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,439
I-I'm here to look for my husband.

441
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,260
"To look for your husband"?

442
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:29,910
We've got someone looking for a dog,

443

someone getting lost,

444
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:35,230
someone digging wild vegetables and two eloping.

445
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,209
You Mu Xi people,

446
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:42,130
why are you running to and from Xuan Yue City?

447
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:51,800
Tonight, we can go home once we kill Liu Xuan Ming.

448
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,519
Be careful!

449
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,090
Are you being this clumsy to get us killed?

450
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,820
Liu Xuan Ming

451
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,950
is here.
