Actually, there is one thing I decided to tell you.

My real identity is not Guan San Mei,

but...

Ever since we met, you've been lying to me.

No, no, it's not like that.

I wanted to tell you.

But when I found...

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,820
when I found out that you hated Ye Zhao Nan so much, I-I...

51

I was afraid.

52

I was afraid I'd lose you if I told you.

I didn't dare say it.

54

But... but you also told me

55
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,069
that if you truly love someone, even if you are unwilling to,

56
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,510
you would forgive her, right?

57
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:46,200
So you kept lying to me.

58
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,219
Your father caused the death of my father.

59
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:59,449
Let me explain it. The truth is not as you think.

60
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:02,020
You still want to lie to me, don't you?

61
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,470
- Can you be reasonable, Liu Xuan Ming?
- Ye Zhao Nan!

62

It's you who lied to me first.

63

How can you say I'm unreasonable?

64
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,140
I didn't mean that.

65
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,290
You... I've checked.

66
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:21,269
On the day your father died, Mu Xi City didn't dispatch any troops.

67
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:23,299
That was the day I was born.

68
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,649
Because my mother was weak, she lacked strength.

69
00:04:25,649 --> 00:04:29,420
So my father ordered the whole city to sound the drums

70
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,910
to assist my mother's labor.

71

Did you think I would believe such a ridiculous reason?

No matter how angry Liu Xuan Ming is, he won't harm San Mei.

Don't you want to see them?

No. If I go see them,

100

Liu Xuan Ming would learn that I knew San Mei's identity before he did.

In that case, doesn't it mean Liu Family hated Ye Family for nothing all these years?

It doesn't matter if we hated them for nothing.

Yi Yang Jun, why should we not try to persuade His Lordship?

We need to let Liu Xuan Ming realize how much he likes San Mei and return on his own.

Otherwise, even if Liu Xuan Ming is convinced to return,

145
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,039
San Mei would think he doesn't really like her.

This is not good for her and Liu Xuan Ming.

00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,540
♫ The esteemed lord ♫

163
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,090
♫ Should not show vulnerability ♫

164
00:11:54,090 --> 00:12:01,550
♫ Before the people so easily ♫

165
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,650
We've transferred the bedchamber guards out and placed two fake assassins instead.

166
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:09,240
I hope San Mei and Brother can reconcile this way.

167
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,080
I'm sure they will.

168
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,190
Did Qian Hui Rou interact with the two assassins?

169
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:25,690
It seems she spoke a few words to them.

170
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,630
Liu Xuan Ming.

171
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,780
What did you say to them?

172
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,040
- I...
- Yi Yang Jun, what are you doing?

173
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,100
Tan Rang, go save San Mei!

174
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,210
Did Princess Hui Rou ask you to kill Ye Zhao Nan?

175
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,180
No, she didn't. She just told us to use a fake dagger

176
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,010
and not accidentally injure Lord Ye.

177
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,420
Liu Xuan Ming.

178
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,980
Hui Rou.

179
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,060
You're just like them.

180
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,630
You never trust me.

181
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,430
That's why you left.

182
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,780
It was only for the sake of San Mei.

183
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,350
You were afraid I would hurt her.

184
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,160
Hui Rou, I'm sorry.

185
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,540
You don't have to be so hard on yourself.

186
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,850
I'll leave on my own.

187
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,240
Hui...

188
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,860
Hui Rou!

189
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,350
Hui Rou, are you all right?

190
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:56,080
Why did you come back?

191
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,410
I can return if I want to. It's none of your business.

192
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,860
Then why did you save me?

193
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:08,350
Why?

194
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,620
Why? Why?

195
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,549
I can save you if I want to. It's none—

196
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:21,000
And why did you...

197
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,499
I can kiss you if I want to. That's none of your business.

198
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,210
Liu Xuan Ming, I missed you so much.

199
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,340
How is she?

200
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:53,359
My Lord, her old wounds reopened. She needs to recuperate.

201
00:15:53,359 --> 00:15:57,289
She can't get angry again. Otherwise, her life will be in danger.

202
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,419
- Thank you, Physician Chen.
- I'll take my leave.

203
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,870
Sister, Hui Rou is really pitiable.

204
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:11,930
Why don't you believe her?

205
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,700
Yi Yang Jun should know Qian Hui Rou best.

206
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,500
When Hui Rou was young, she unluckily suffered from tuberculosis.

207
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,970
The imperial physician said, "A person with this disease will die within ten days."

208
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:32,120
Her father feared she would infect others so he locked her in her room.

209
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,250
She was left to fend for herself.

210
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,650
Even her elder brothers didn't care about her.

211
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:42,100
At first, only Qi Meng brought her food secretly.

212
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,660
When her father found out, he locked her up, too.

213
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,010
Surprisingly, ten days later,

214
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,710
she miraculously recovered.

215
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:59,280
What did she eat for the next few days?

216
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,429
Rats.

217
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:18,390
Ever since, her family treated her as an alien.

218
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,880
They were not even willing to eat at the same table with her.

219
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,100
Compared to Qian Hui Rou, I am so fortunate.

220
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,699
My father loved me. My mother loves me. My brother loves me.

221
00:17:30,699 --> 00:17:33,679
My eldest sister loves me, and Tan Rang loves me, too.

222
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,240
You finally know that. You never appreciate what you have.

223
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,589
Sister, look, he's educating me again.

224
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,580
Greetings to Your Lordship.

225
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,740
What are you doing?

226
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,830
- Did you see that?
- See what?

227
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,430
Ye Zhao...

228
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,740
Lord Ye. She just ignored me.

229
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,660
Does she still hold a grudge against me?

230
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:10,520
Of course. You treated her so badly before. She must hate you.

231
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,270
What should I do then? You know, you must help me.

232
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,790
I feel so uncomfortable here now. I'm scared every day.

233
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:22,980
I'm begging you. We even had an intimate moment together. Please help me.

234
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:28,060
I've explained. It was a misunderstanding. Who wanted to kiss you?

235
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,500
Fine.

236
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,260
Zhao Jing, you dare not admit it.

237
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:39,830
Fine, I'm going to tell everyone that you kissed me passionately in the wardrobe.

238
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,230
I'll show them your true colors. Come on, everybody!

239
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,900
Don't shout!

240
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:50,990
♫ Don't know why I can't let go ♫

241
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,180
♫ Even if my heart says so ♫

242
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,470
Okay, okay, okay. I'll help you plead with the lord.

243
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,010
However, you'll have to make some sacrifices yourself.

244
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,360
All right.

245
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,020
Brother, what are you doing?

246
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,870
San Mei, remember how she treated you in the past.

247
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:21,590
Now you can pay her back with interest.

248
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,600
Let's make a deal. We'll forget it once this is done. Let's not pursue it any further.

249
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,530
Yes, I'm ready. Come on.

250
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,900
These...

251
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,610
How boring!

252
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:17,480
It's a coincidence, right? Isn't it a coincidence? The wind blew it out.

253
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,910
That's enough. I know you've changed for the better.

254
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:23,990
Be a good person from now on.

255
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,700
- Hurry and thank San Mei.
- Thank you, Lord Ye.

256
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,090
Actually, I knew you wouldn't hit me.

257
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:34,950
After all, I'll be your sister-in-law in the future.

258
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,860
How can we hold grudges when we're a family?

259
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:43,190
By the way, do I call you "San Mei" like Zhao Jing does?

260
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,650
San Mei.

261
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:48,160
- Ke Qian Yue, what are you saying?
- What's the matter?

262
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,990
-You did kiss me. Won't you be responsible for me?
- "Kiss"?

263
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:56,400
Brother, you became the palace commander only a few days ago. How could you do this?

264
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,529
No, don't listen to her. How could I be such a person?

265
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:04,459
I can testify. It did not happen the past two days. It happened in Xuan Yue City.

266
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,600
It's not as you think. I can explain this.

267
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,120
You needn't explain it. San Mei isn't an outsider. She understands, right?

268
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,670
What does she understand?

269
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:18,100
Do I understand or do I not understand?

270
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,009
- Look at her expression. That means she doesn't understand.
- She says she does.

271
00:21:21,009 --> 00:21:22,859
- Does she get it?
- Yes.

272
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:24,719
- You see?
- I'm so angry.

273
00:21:24,719 --> 00:21:26,390
- Don't be angry. Don't be angry.
- Don't touch me.

274
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:29,470
What's wrong? Why can you touch me, but I can't touch you?
- Don't touch me!

275
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,560
I can touch you. I can touch you. Touch you. Touch you.

276
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,440
Don't touch me!

277
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,879
My Lord, someone is at the gate looking for Miss Ke.

278
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,750
Me?

279
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,450
Who are you?

280
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,449
- Bai Lu!
- Miss Ke, I've finally found you!

281
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,550
Take your time.

282
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,470
All right, all right, all right.

283
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,300
Eat slowly.

284
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:40,260
I ran quite a few times, and I finally escaped.

285
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:43,739
Housekeeper Ke, you must treat me well from now on. Have you a good job?

286
00:22:43,739 --> 00:22:45,170
Don't worry.

287
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:49,860
Now I'm Ye Zhao Nan's sister-in-law.

288
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:52,730
Regard Mu Xi City as Xuan Yue City.

289
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:55,990
Later, I'll have someone find you a good job.

290
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,440
Eat slowly.

291
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,110
Take it easy.

292
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,690
Don't cry.

293
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,189
- That one. That one.
- Sure, sure, sure.

294
00:23:08,189 --> 00:23:10,110
Here you go.

295
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,880
Report! Report!

296
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,870
Secret report!

297
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,020
It's a secret message from our spies in Tian Mu City.

298
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:26,280
You sent spies to Tian Mu City?

299
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,310
I've always been suspicious of Qian Hui Rou. I have my doubts.

300
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:31,200
It's better to be cautious.

301
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,450
[Following the death of the Lord, the princes are fighting for the throne, and Qian Hui Rou escaped the city.]

302
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,100
What does it say?

303
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,330
Just as Qian Hui Rou said:

304
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,640
after the death of Lord Yang, her brothers have been fighting with each other.

305
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,710
So she escaped.

306
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,540
If that's true, Qian Hui Rou is really pitiable.

307
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:57,590
Brother, we'd better keep her in the palace.

308
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,940
Find a trustworthy maid to serve her.

309
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,410
Yes.

310
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,450
Greetings to Princess Hui Rou.

311
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,379
In the future, don't call me princess in private.

312
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,050
Yes.

313
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,410
Greetings to the lord.

314
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:04,270
Tian Mu's people are really something.

315
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,950
You were hiding in Xuan Yue City over ten years,

316
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,390
yet no one found out.

317
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,900
Liu Xuan Ming. Ye Zhao Nan.

318
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,140
They're just average.

319
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,740
Please forgive me, My Lord. It is because of my incompetence.

320
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:26,240
I couldn't poison Guan San Mei to death. Otherwise, Princess Qi Meng wouldn't have died.

321
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,430
This is itchy powder. Put it in the tea.

322
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:35,270
I'll make her embarrassed in front of everyone this time.

323
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,820
Take it.

324
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,960
Forget it.

325
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:57,110
All have their own fate.

326
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:04,080
Just like no one had thought Liu Xuan Ming would love Ye Zhao Nan.

327
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:15,490
This time, let's play it big.

328
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,120
Is everything ready outside?

329
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,930
Yes. The message has been sent to the prison.

330
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,350
Wait and see what happens.

331
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:04,950
I can't wait to see how Liu Xuan Ming and Ye Zhao Nan kill each other.

332
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:25,969
General, this is tonight's meal. You should savor it.

333
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,300
The food is good tonight.

334
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:53,909
Who made the food? Are these ribs made of metal?

335
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,990
[Hui Rou of Tian Mu is willing to work with General to kill Ye Zhao Nan and unify Mu Xi City.]

336
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,230
Ye Zhao Nan,

337
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:16,520
this time, even the gods can't save you.

338
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:57,300
♫ Secretly hiding, secretly thinking of you ♫

339
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:04,410
♫ Burying my feelings for you in my heart ♫

340
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:07,940
♫ The esteemed lord ♫

341
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,570
♫ Should not show vulnerability ♫

342
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:18,540
♫ Before the people so easily ♫

343
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:25,540
♫ When you appear, when you approach ♫

344
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:32,670
♫ When someone understands that I'm not a god ♫

345
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,100
♫ Your words ♫

346
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,750
♫ Are etched in my mind ♫

347
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:45,390
♫ That tender heart of yours ♫

348
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,980
♫ I want to protect you while navigating the storm ♫

349
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,540
♫ Braving the glint and flash of cold steel ♫

350
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:59,580
♫ I want to take you to see scenery you've never seen ♫

351
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,100
♫ I really want to be with you forever ♫

352
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,630
♫ Whether we are on opposing sides or archenemies ♫

353
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:10,140
♫ Only my love for you is everlasting ♫

354
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:14,100
♫ A deep-rooted affection ♫
