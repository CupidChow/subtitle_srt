It's just a wedding dress. How come it became like this?

38
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,239
I remember. She seemed to get pricked by a needle on a button.

Now, it seems if you are the one to rule Xuan Yue, slaughter will only increase.

00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,660
I will now inform officers and soldiers in the city to terminate this plan instantly.

If the person is too dirty,

116

What qualification does she have to perform the wedding ceremony with me?

122
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,740
You've got a good point.

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,369
- Guards.

Send Princess Qi Meng away.

Liu Xuan Ming, are you stupid?

126

You don't marry me, the great princess of Tian Mu City, but her instead?

127
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:49,220
So all the more reason for you to reflect on yourself.

128
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:53,360
I think you are the one who should reflect on yourself.

You could all have lived,

130
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,120
but now,

131
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:02,500
I'll show you what happens when you offend me!

132
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,760
First, you used the royal wedding to make Xuan Yue City lively.

133
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,869
Then you ordered Tian Mu soldiers to blend into the crowd and sneak into Xuan Yue City.

134
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:14,360
So when I walked down the street that day, I felt something was off.

135
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,830
Those jugglers and sellers carrying poles didn't look like ordinary civilians at all.

136
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,360
You brought many war horses as dowry for no reason

137
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,840
and specially assigned your hostlers (stablemen) to them.

138
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,220
You wanted Xuan Yue's cavalry replaced with your own horses;

139
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:32,880
once the city riot started, your stablemen could control all the horses, right?

140
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,080
You thought about everything.

141
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,520
What you just said is right, but so what?

142
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,350
What was sent to the sky just now was the signal that Tian Mu people took control of Xuan Yue City.

143
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,400
You will all be prisoners in no time.

144
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:28,210
Since we already guessed your intention,

145
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:31,040
how can we not prepare for it?

146
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:36,319
- Arrest them all!
- Arrest them all!

147
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,309
- Take them down.
- Yes.

148
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:56,830
You...

149
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:02,730
From the start, you never intended to unite with Xuan Yue through marriage.

150
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,130
If I guessed it correctly, you planned to attack Xuan Yue City first,

151
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,310
then use Xuan Yue City to attack Mu Xi City.

152
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,310
To take down two cities with one ploy,

153
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,800
what a good plan!

154
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,610
Don't be complacent; I am the princess of Tian Mu City.

155
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:25,070
Do you dare to kill me?

156
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:31,070
I just received the news that your father has died.

157
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,360
At this moment, your brothers are busy fighting for the throne.

158
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,250
Even if you die, I'm afraid they won't bother.

159
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:48,230
- Your Highness.
- Is my father dead?

160
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,420
Brother Xuan Ming, please forgive me for the sake that we grew up together.

161
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,050
I was instructed by my father and sister.

162
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:09,570
I didn't want to kill people; I didn't.

163
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:14,339
You changed your attitude so fast! Just now you said you would kill us all.

164
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,150
- I said that just to scare you.
- What about my second oldest sister?

165
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:21,040
What a vicious woman you are.

166
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,490
That was all done by the maid, Qian Er; I didn't know about it!

167
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,500
It was not me. It was Her Highness. Her Highness told me to do it.

168
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:31,450
Brother Xuan Ming. Brother Xuan Ming.

169
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:35,590
You know me. When I was little,

170
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:39,779
I got very sad when a bunny fell in water. I'm not such a person.

171
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:51,070
Speaking of bunnies, I guess you don't know rabbits can swim.

172
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:59,230
When I was little, I witnessed that you pressed the bunny I gave you into the water to drown it,

173
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:03,450
then you sat there and wailed.

174
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:29,369
Brother Xuan Ming, it was just a misunderstanding, just a misunderstanding, misunderstanding.

175
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,890
San Mei, I'm begging you. Please save me.

176
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,819
Save me. San Mei.

177
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:01,630
Prepare the best war horse in Tian Mu City for me at once. Quick!

178
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,240
Prepare the horse!

179
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,760
Move.

180
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,950
Don't come any closer, or I'll kill her.

181
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,600
Stay back!

00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,890
- Oldest Sister.
- With San Mei's ability,

183
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:22,049
- Move aside.
- Qi Meng can't hurt her.

184
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:24,840
Then why did my oldest sister let herself be kidnapped?

185
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:27,760
She wants to end this with her alone.

186
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,280
Go!

187
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:32,690
Go.

188
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,949
Don't be afraid. You are the one with the knife. I can't hurt you.

I ended up like this all because of you.

191
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:48,120
You are so funny.

192
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,860
Obviously, you harmed people first,

193
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,220
but now, you blame others instead.

194
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,160
Is it true that for people like you,

195
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,110
other people's lives are as cheap as grass?

196
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,900
Don't talk so much rubbish.

197
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,000

You used her to not only harm me but her as well.

Don't you fear my sister will come after you for treating me like this?

This shot is for Zhi Lan.

211
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,120
My sister is quite intimidating.

212
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,400
She will torture you until you wish you can die, but you can't.

- but we wish to d–
- Wait a minute.

227

It's too scary to die together.

228
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:57,149
It's hard to bury us all. We need to have a sequence.

229

Then who will die first?

230
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,800
I'll be the first.

You fool. What does this have to do with you?

You have tried your best.

235

You worked hard to make the people of Mu Xi City happy.

It isn't easy for you to fight alone against corrupt, outdated concepts in the first place.

The long road is dangerous, but you will reach it; keep going.

Persevere, then a bright future is worth it.

The road ahead will be more difficult; you must persevere

"Dance"?

245
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,060
How absurd! As a man, how can you learn something so feminine?

246
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,550
Come here and practice with me.

247
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,799
His Majesty decreed men's jobs are for women, and women's jobs are for men.

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,179
- No distinction is between superiority and inferiority.
- Don't mention His Majesty!

Your sister is still missing; aren't you worried about her?

00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:54,150
Thus, I will ask all my dancing friends to seek news of my sister everywhere.

This is Ye Zhao Nan's handwriting. He asked us to let the spies' family go.

- Not only is he alive,

How could it be such a coincidence?

Send them a letter; tell them to kill the person who wrote it.

00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:29,130
Otherwise, their whole family will be buried with them!

00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,580
Yes.

263
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:35,600
Act in response to the will of Heaven and by order of the lord.

264
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,870
Xuan Yue and Mu Xi were fighting fiercely a long time.

265
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,920
The civilians are miserable and helpless.

266
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,280
Form an alliance with Mu Xi.

267
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,220
If the two cities form an alliance, Tian Mu City won't dare go against them.

268
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,910
But Ye Zhao Nan and I are sworn enemies.

What is more important than righteousness of the world?

270
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,649
As the city lord, your people's well-being is most important to consider.

271
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:06,829
I heard Ye Zhao Nan always wanted to end the war between the two cities,

272
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:12,130
to strengthen each city, enrich people, and achieve great unity.

273
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,850
If you free slaves captured from Mu Xi City to show your goodwill,

274
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,920
and send me to Mu Xi City for peace talks,

275
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,110
Ye Zhao Nan will surely agree to an alliance.

eliminate lines of superiority and inferiority,

A world of great unity where people prosper together?

The peace talks between Xuan Yue and Mu Xi are the first step.

When you meet Ye Zhao Nan, tell him if he dares touch you,

319
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:43,120
I will personally lead the army to crush Mu Xi!

[Watch the Sea and Listen to the Waves]

321
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:07,320
Who are they? Where are you going?

322
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,380
They were sent by General Jin Fu to kill me.

323
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,760
- Why do they want to kill you?
- Because I failed my mission.

324
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,520
I'm going to Mu Xi City to finally settle this matter.

325
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,920
Okay, I'll go with you.

326
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,250
No, it's too dangerous.

327
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,940
I won't let you go alone.

328
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,750
No matter what, we two can't be separated.

329
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:30,570
What's more, I have two superb mounts to help us get to Mu Xi.

330
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,100
Yun Luo, what are we riding?

331
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,850
The beasts of Heaven and Earth.

332
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,140
Yun Luo, I'm scared.

333
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,300
What are you scared for? You are a mighty man.

334
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:44,960
- Are you competent or not?
- Yun Luo, why can't I control it?

335
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,190
When can we get to Mu Xi City?

336
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:49,580
Soon, soon. If we hurry, we'll get there.

337
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,490
Yun Luo!

338
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,550
I'm begging you, please. Please help me.

339
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,250
Hui Rou,

340
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,170
we are siblings.

341
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:31,010
Father has just died, and why do you...

342
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,890
Why do you kill your own siblings?

343
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,580
Father loved you all during his lifetime

344
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,970
so you all should go down to be with him.

345

The envoy of Xuan Yue City, Guan San Mei.

"Xuan Yue"?

349
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,460
Where is Yi Yang?

350
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,339
He accompanies Guan San Mei to Mu Xi City for peace talks.

351
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,510
It is

352
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,210
getting more and more interesting.

353
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,060
[Lord of Tian Mu City, Princess Hui Rou]

354
