Do you want to thank me?

29
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,000
Then why don't you tell me who sent you to assassinate me?

30
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Even if you don't tell me, I know who did this.

Was it Ye Zhao Nan from Mu Xi City?

If you have a chance, go back and tell your master that one day,

The wedding between His Majesty and Princess Qi Meng is a great joy.

They are...

101
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Two dots.

But it is said Guan San Mei would also marry His Majesty on the same day.

105
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,400
I don't know... three characters.

106
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,700
Where did that loud mouth come from?

107
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,400
Maybe she is pregnant with His Majesty's child.

108
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,300
One stick.

109

Excuse me.

110
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,600
Sister, don't be angry.

111
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,700
People nowadays like to spread gossip.

112
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,000
Just get used to it.

113
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,700
Grannies, His Majesty and San Mei really love each other,

114
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,500
and San Mei is kind and intelligent. Don't say that about her.

115
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:34,000
Sir, you don't understand that the human heart is sinister.

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,400
My cousin's niece works in the inner city.

117
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,500
She saw with her own eyes that Guan San Mei was pregnant.

118
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,600
Otherwise, why would His Majesty marry a lowly maid?

119
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,600
And he will get married to Princess Qi Meng.

120
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,000
Right.

121
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,300
She is threatening His Majesty with her baby.

122
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,900
Someone seems to be decent,

123
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,700
but they are wicked inside.

124
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,200
Am I right, Miss?

125
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,300
What you said is correct.

126
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,900
What do you think, Sister?

127
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,400
Granny,

128
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,100
you should have a sense of propriety when you gossip!

129
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,400
Do you know San Mei?

130
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,800
Do you know the relationship between San Mei and His Majesty?

131
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,700
You say nonsense without knowing anything and ruin someone else's reputation.

132
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,600
Beware of tongue-pulling hell!

133
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,000
Why are you talking so viciously?

134
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,300
Be careful or you won't get married!

135
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,900
How dare you say that?

136
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,800
I am Princess Yun Luo.

137
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,800
This is the lord of Xuan Yue City.

138
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Your Majesty.

139
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,700
Your Majesty. All blessings to Your Majesty and Xuan Yue City.

140
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,200
Stand up.

141
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,800
Thank you, Your Majesty.

142
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,200
Today, I introduce San Mei to you.

143
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,900
Liu Xuan Ming, what are you doing?

144
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,000
It is His Majesty.

145
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,100
She is the woman I will marry and love for the rest of my life.

146
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,200
There are often rumors that San Mei seduced me.

147
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,600
To be honest, I was the one who seduced San Mei.

148
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:34,300
Like you, I had a bad first impression of her.

149
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,200
I thought she was approaching me with ulterior motives.

150
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,500
But as time passed,

151
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
I realized that

152
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,000
she saved me out of her kindness.

153
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,300
Even if it wasn't me in danger that day, she would still have come forward.

154
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,300
She is a gift from God to me.

155
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,900
I hope you will respect her as much as you respect and support me.

156
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You can accuse me, belittle, criticize, and even insult me behind my back.

157
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,500
But remember not to blame her,

158
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
not even with one word.

159
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,000
Great!

160
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Amazing!

161
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,900
- She is nothing special.
- Exactly.

162
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,600
If you don't appreciate my beauty, someone will.

163
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,700
Exactly.

164
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,100
Isn't she just the wife of the lord?

165
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,200
I can go to Mu Xi City and marry Ye Zhao Nan.

166
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,900
Exactly.

167
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,800
Yao Hu lost Yi Yang.

168
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,700
He is hiding on purpose so it isn't easy to track him.

169
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,400
This proves they are really up to something.

170
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,600
It is just that I don't know what they are plotting.

171
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,200
If it was just to assassinate me, they would have done it long ago,

172
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,200
and they wouldn't wait until the wedding day.

173
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:38,900
Looking at it that way, it is indeed strange.

174
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,600
Your Highness, calm down.

175
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,800
I must kill San Mei before the wedding!

176
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,100
Your Highness, don't get angry.

177
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,500
Yi Yang said before the wedding, you shouldn't cause more trouble.

178
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,400
You have to remember who your master is!

179
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,200
Your Highness, Nanny Ke requests an interview.

180
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,300
What is that fool doing here?

181
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,800
Get out!

182
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,200
Your Highness.

183
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,000
Princess Qi Meng.

184
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,700
Your Highness.

185
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,100
Princess Qi Meng, this is your wedding dress.

186
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,200
I ordered skilled craftsmen to make it for you.

187
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,200
Thank you so much.

188
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,800
Does San Mei have one?

189
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,300
Of course.

190
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,800
I just sent it to her.

191
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,800
One for each of you, exactly the same, without any favoritism.

192
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,400
- This bracelet is for Qian Yue.
- No wonder.

193
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,100
Just let me know if you have any needs.

194
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,900
No wonder Qian Yue always tells me that Your Highness is so beautiful.

195
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,600
It would be very lucky for the one who'll marry you.

196
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm flattered, Nanny Ke.

197
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,300
Your Highness, if there is nothing else, I am leaving.

198
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I'm going to wear the same wedding dress as a lowly person!

199
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,300
Your Highness, please calm down.

200
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
Princess Hui Rou was preparing for so long.

201
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,500
When the wedding day comes, Xuan Yue City will belong to Tian Mu City.

202
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,400
By then, you can do whatever you want.

203
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I will never get married with anyone else!

204
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,600
Your Highness, that is a poisonous potion.

205
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,200
Let's apply it to tiny silver needles

206
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,600
and sew it into buttons.

207
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,000
When she puts on the wedding dress and fastens the buttons,

208
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,000
the poisonous needles will pierce her skin.

209
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,400
By then, she won't be able to get married.

210
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:18,400
But how can we sew needles into her clothes?

211
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,600
We don't necessarily have to sew them into her wedding dress.

212
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,300
This is San Mei's wedding dress.

213
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,000
What are you doing?

214
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,100
What if you ruin it?

215
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,100
San Mei should dress beautifully to get married.

216
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,000
Are we going to kill Liu Xuan Ming or not?

217
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,300
- Do you think it's that easy?
- Enough, Old Guan.

218
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,800
Save it.

219
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,900
As for the assassination of Liu Xuan Ming, San Mei has her own plan.

220
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,000
- San Mei.
- San Mei.

221
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,200
- Dad, Brothers.
- Try it on.

222
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,100
It's so nice.

223
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:58,500
No hurry.

224
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,000
How do you usually send letters to General Jin Fu?

225
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,800
Sanitation Department transports the garbage out of the city each morning.

226
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,700
We use the number of barrels to communicate if there is a message.

227
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,200
If it's ten barrels, all is fine.

228
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,600
If it's eleven barrels, it means we have news.

229
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,100
We generally place the letter at the bottom of the eleventh barrel.

230
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,300
[For General Jin Fu]

231
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,800
Send the letter to General Jin Fu's mansion.

232
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:28,000
Remember to never open it; it's private.

233
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,700
Jin Fu will surely release your family members after receiving the letter.

234
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:34,100
- Really?
- Truly?

235
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:41,700
But from now on, never hurt others again.

236
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,700
Okay, okay.

237
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,300
Fine, fine.

238
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,600
Miss Qian Er.

239
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,100
Brother Feng.

240
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,400
How is Princess Qi Meng doing recently?

241
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,000
What's wrong?

242
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,800
Forget it. Her Highness asked me to keep it a secret.

243
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,700
You can't help anyway.

244
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,900
What are you talking about?

245
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,000
There's nothing in the world I can't do.

246
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,100
Because of this small tear, Princess Qi Meng feels helpless?

247
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,600
Qian Er, how could you tell him at will?

248
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,000
Princess Qi Meng.

249
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,100
What are you talking about?

250
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,800
I'm not an outsider. You can call me Brother.

251
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,600
A brother should naturally share worries and solve problems for his younger sister.

252
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,400
Well... It is difficult for others to notice this small tear.

253
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,800
Why should you care?

254
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,100
You have no idea.

255
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,400
My childhood wish was to have a happy marriage.

256
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,300
Although the damage is subtle,

257
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,800
it is indeed my sore point.

258
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
Well, it's easy.

259
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Ask someone from Clothing Department to fix it for you.

260
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,800
It is unlucky to mend the wedding dress without wearing it.

261
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:32,100
But this small tear is hard to spot.

262
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,600
Forget it.

263
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,900
Maybe my fate is destined to be imperfect.

264
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,600
What do we do now?

265
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,800
Brother Feng Lei.

266
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:51,200
Why don't we change this wedding dress with San Mei's?

267
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Qian Er, how could you have such an idea?

268
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
You are making things hard for Brother.

269
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,400
Even if I have my own regrets, you can't do this to him.

270
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,600
Don't worry, Sister. Leave it to me.

271
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,900
I will let you have a happy marriage!

272
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,100
Brother.

273
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,800
That doesn't sound good.

274
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,000
If San Mei finds out...

275
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,900
Let's not tell her. It shouldn't be a problem.

276
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,800
You don't have to frown anymore.

277
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,100
Just get married full of coquettish spirit,

278
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,500
full of youthful spirit. It's the same.

279
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,900
Just leave it to me, okay?

280
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,500
Okay.

281
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,700
Brother. You are so nice.

282
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,800
Nanny Ke.

283
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:13,000
What happened to you on such a happy day?

284
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,300
It is easy for you to say.

285
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,000
Go ahead.

286
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,900
Your daughter married a good man.

287
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:28,400
But the rest of Qian Yue's life hasn't settled yet.

288
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,700
Good and evil will at last have their reward.

289
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,800
Don't persuade others to be kind without suffering the same.

290
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,000
My husband died young.

291
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,600
I worked hard to raise Qian Yue.

292
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,800
It's hard for me.

293
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,100
I didn't expect her to end up where she is today.

294
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,600
Poor parental love.

295
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:08,700
But then again, children who are overly spoiled don't know what love is.

296
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:15,000
What parents pass on to their children shouldn't be high position and great wealth,

297
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,100
but benevolence and kindness.

298
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,700
My family is poor.

299
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:31,400
But I have told my daughter since she was a child that one can be poor,

300
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,600
but one cannot be without virtue.

301
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Without money, you are still a human being.

302
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,700
But without virtue, you are nothing.

303
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,700
Qian Yue ended up like this.

304
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,000
As her mother, you cannot escape the blame.

305
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,400
Impulse... impulse is a devil.

306
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,400
Now something has happened, it cannot be undone.

307
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,000
Accept the reality.

308
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,800
Everything will be over.

309
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,400
Okay?

310
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,000
"The most beautiful thing is not the rainy day,"

311
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,100
"but the eaves where I escaped the rain with you."

312
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,600
It should be fine to change it, right?

313
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,400
San Mei is not a petty person.

314
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,900
Why so many congratulatory gifts?

315
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,600
They were all sent from different city-states.

316
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,100
Come, let's unwrap them together.

317
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,900
I like this.

318
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,200
What?

319
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,900
What are you doing?

320
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,300
Guess what's inside.

321
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,900
Did you fart?

322
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,200
Feces.

323
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,600
Who dares to send me feces on my wedding day?

324
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,400
Please unwrap it.

325
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,400
You, please.

326
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,900
Okay.

327
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,770
Open.

328
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,700
[Invigorating Wine]

329

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,800
"Invigorating wine."

331
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,000
It's not for you.

332
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Who is it for?

333
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,200
It's for you.

334
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,700
I don't need it.

335
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,900
You do.

336
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,200
No.

337
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,400
Don't talk nonsense. Let me feed you.

338
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,200
- Open your mouth.
- No need. Thank you.

339
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,900
I really don't need it.

340
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:24,400
Thank you, I don't need it.

341
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
City gate, tower and inner city.

342
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,000
On the wedding night, lead people to occupy the city gate.

343
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,200
Yes, Sir.

344
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,400
You lead people to control the tower.

345
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,700
Yes, Sir.

346
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,400
You lead people into the inner city.

347
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,470
Yes, Sir.

348
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,579
Tonight, we will fully control Xuan Yue City.

349
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:51,900
Remember to minimize casualties, especially don't hurt San Mei at all.

350
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
Yes, Sir.

351
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,800
We will soon realize the ideal city.

352
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,800
It's been two days.

353
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,000
But Yi Yang hasn't returned yet.

354
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,600
Is there any news that Yi Yang left the city?

355
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,200
No.

356
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,000
No?

357
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,600
It means that what he is up to is in the city.

358
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,600
Why is this just an empty box?

359
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,500
Maybe they forgot to pack something.

360
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,000
Maybe it's trying to infiltrate here.

361
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,200
If you don't take it apart, you won't find it.

362
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,600
This is called pass away the sham as the genuine.

363
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,000
Pass the sham as the genuine.

364
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,600
Unexpectedly, this acrobat's skills are so amazing.

365
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,700
You are...

366
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,300
Sorry.

367
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,100
Miss, take a look.

368
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,900
This is so interesting. Right?

369
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,500
This smell is the unique hemlock in Tian Mu City.

370
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,100
They hid their identities and sneaked into Xuan Yue City,

371
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,200
presumably they will make a big move.

372
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
Why are you so smart?

373
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,300
All right. Be good.

374
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,200
So beautiful.

375
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,200
I was also wearing such a beautiful wedding dress when I got married.

376
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,600
It's so beautiful.

377
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,600
Here.

378
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Zhi Lan.

379
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,300
Try it on.

380
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,000
Do I look good?

381
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,700
Gorgeous.

382
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,600
Look.

383
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,100
What's up?

384
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,300
Never mind.

385
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,100
- Do I look good?
- Yes.

386
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:41,300
I will wear such a beautiful wedding dress when I marry the second time.

387
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,700
No problem.

388
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:49,100
By then, I will surely use all my money to buy you the most beautiful wedding dress in the world.

389
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,800
Zhi Lan.

390
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,600
I know you are used to living an extravagant life.

391
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,900
Although I don't have the ability to give you such a life,

392
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,800
my family owns three acres.

393
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,300
I can plow during the day and work as a blacksmith at night.

394
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,600
I will never let you suffer.

395
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,000
I also know you are used to delicacies.

396
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,200
Although I can't afford to buy them, I can cook them.

397
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,800
I will make ordinary food into delicacies.

398
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,300
I know you like nice clothes, and I can't afford them.

399
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:35,300
But I can learn tailoring and customize them for you.

400
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:45,100
Zhi Lan.

401
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:49,000
If you say yes, I am willing to learn everything.

402
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,000
I can even learn to be the one you like.

403
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,800
Zhi Lan!

404
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,500
Zhi Lan, what happened to you?

405
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,900
Zhi Lan!

406
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:16,700
Zhi Lan, don't scare me. Zhi Lan, don't scare me!

407
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:41,200

408

410
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,400

♫ When you appear, when you approach ♫

413
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:16,500
♫ When someone understands that I'm not a god ♫

414
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,000
