Just one question, Your Majesty.

66

Why is that cold-looking man always staring at you?

- Your Majesty, if he stays by your side, you will be in danger.
- What?

72
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:18,710
It's fine. When he suffers an attack, I can deal with him.

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,939
Right. Princess Hui Rou from Tian Mu City got severely injured in Mu Xi City.

- Yes.

We never had anything to do with Tian Mu City.

Why did their princess come to our city?

Your Majesty, it's too dangerous here.

If they know your identity, they will surely eat you alive.

85
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:23,299
We had better go back to Xuan Yue. We should return together.

86
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,360
Jin Fu has already set heavy traps.

87
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,429
None of us can leave before the edict's announcement.

88
00:06:31,429 --> 00:06:33,900
San Mei, since we have already come in,

89
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,990
we can just kill Jin Fu when he enters the palace.

90
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:44,780
It's not simple. There are 30,000 elite soldiers in the city; you'll be in danger.

91
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,410
If we kill him rashly, it may cause chaos.

92
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,180
If we can send these elite soldiers away,

93
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,450
then we can capture Jin Fu alive at court.

94
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,770
That is easier said than done. Jin Fu is the only one who can deploy them.

95
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:03,990
Why would he send them away for no reason?

96
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,810
In fact, it isn't hard to move the elite soldiers.

97
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:15,770
Did you forget that we have Lord of Xuan Yue with us?

98
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,080
Report!

99
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,039
General, we have an urgent report from the border

100
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,679
that Xuan Yue soldiers on the border of Mu Xi may attack Mu Xi.

101
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,650
I always hated Lord of Mu Xi since I was little, and I vowed to personally kill Ye Zhao Nan,

102
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:00,210
but I never realized my wife looks so similar to him.

103
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,820
Then do you feel uncomfortable?

104
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,860
I don't.

105
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,700
I have only an indescribable feeling.

106
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,070
What is that about?

107
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,090
I have a feeling of a wonderful fate.

108
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,940
Do you remember you were cross-dressing

109
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,750
when we first met?

110
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:36,080
Of course, I do. I will never forget that in a lifetime.

111
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:42,430
I really thought you were a man, and I almost fought you.

112
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,390
I never expected we would meet once

113
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,190
and be together a lifetime.

114
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,700
I am happy that you were always with me.

115
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,040
I will ensure you're happy for the rest of our life.

116
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,230
Will you really be with me a lifetime?

117
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,700
No.

118
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,090
For ten lifetimes,

119
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,830
a hundred lifetimes, and 1,000 lifetimes.

This is what manliness smells like.

What do you know? You don't know anything.

123
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,990
Sir, we have arrived at the baths.

124

Is this how you Mu Xi people take a bath?

125
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,710
All servants bathe like this.

126
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:07,260
You should hurry and wash yourself.

127

Where is Princess Yun Luo?

128
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,540
She just went out and asked me to watch here a while.

129
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:51,930
You little temptress really look like Qi Meng.

130
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,240
What are you doing?

131
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:03,219
I can tell by her looks she is like a dung beetle who digs into a peanut. What a bad nut!

132
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,899
How could I have trusted that despicable shrew, Qi Meng, in the first place?

133
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:12,060
If I hadn't, I wouldn't have ended up like this.

134
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,979
Ke Qian Yue, let me tell you.

135
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:17,789
Even if Qi Meng hadn't been there, you still wouldn't end up better.

136
00:11:17,789 --> 00:11:19,679
Zhao Jing, how dare you say that?

137
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,400
No, it is polite enough for me to tell you like this.

138
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,599
- Have you ever self-reflected how you ended up like this?
- I...

139
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:27,849
Let me review your nature.

140
00:11:27,849 --> 00:11:33,290
You are mean, petty, possessive, dumb, and always want to frame others.

Zhao Jing. Am... am I...

142
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,439
Am I that bad?

143
00:11:40,439 --> 00:11:42,820
How can you still not realize it?

144
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,519
All right, if I really am that bad, why have you feelings for me?

145
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,929
When did I say I have feelings for you?

146
00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:51,689
If you feel nothing for me, why desperately save me despite your own life

147
00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:54,809
when Feng Lei was about to kill me at General's Manor?

148
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:57,950
Moreover, do you remember you kissed me

149
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:03,120
in the closet of His Majesty's bedchamber in Xuan Yue City?

150
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,930
It is obvious you coveted my beauty a long time.

151
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:10,240
I explained that to you several times.

152
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,040
The matter of the closet was a mistake.

153
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,940
I kissed you since Guan pushed me.

154
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,110
Besides, at General's Manor,

155
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:21,439
I would have saved any innocent person Feng Lei would kill, even if it wasn't you.

156
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,729
I know too well about you men.

157
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:30,369
You all lie about your feelings to save your pride (ego).

158
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:33,430
Admit that you have feelings for me.

159
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,650
It is...

160
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,010
- It is—
- It is not embarrassing.

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:41,910
It is embarrassing to have feelings for you.

162
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,580
- Fine, make a vow if you feel nothing for me.
- If you say so.

163
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,959
- You promise.
- I promise.

164
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,799
If you have feelings for me, then Old Guan, Feng Lei, Guan San Mei, and you,

165
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:53,870
all four family members will get struck down by lightning

166
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,619
with no whole corpses, and can never reincarnate!

167
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:59,520
Wait. Aren't you too vicious saying that?

168
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,860
See?

169
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,149
You don't dare vow that, and you have feelings for me.

170
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:07,310
Don't worry. I will accept your feelings.

171
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,319
You are so unreasonable, really.

172
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:13,280
Brother Zhao Jing. Brother Zhao Jing.

173
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,810
Brother, where are you going?

174
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,079
- Zhao Jing, don't go.
- Don't follow me.

175
00:13:36,070 --> 00:13:38,760
Enough, stop rubbing me.

176
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,670
You three old eunuchs, if you don't stop, I'll punch you.

177
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,030
Greetings, Your Majesty.

178
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,220
General, forgo formalities.

179
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:09,649
Eunuch Sun, I have political matters to discuss with the general; you may all leave.

180
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,090
Yes.

181
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,950
General, why are you in a hurry?

182
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,770
Why did Xuan Yue dispatch troops?

183
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,260
General, I don't understand why you said that.

184
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:36,499
Liu Xuan Ming deploys troops and prepares to attack Mu Xi.

185
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:38,920
What in the world are you up to?

186
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,040
General, only I and several servants are here,

187
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,040
and what kind of ploy can we have?

188
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,010
I truly don't know about Xuan Yue's dispatch of troops.

189
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:50,439
I will send a letter to Liu Xuan Ming to immediately ask why .

190
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:53,919
By the time your letter arrives, our nation will have long perished!

191
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,070
You are right.

192
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:04,349
Then in our current situation, the best option we have is to deploy troops for resistance.

193
00:15:04,349 --> 00:15:07,469
However, General, you can rest assured since I'm already in your hands,

194
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:09,090
Liu Xuan Ming will surely not act rashly.

195
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:11,170
Do you think I fear him?

196
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,739
Even if Liu Xuan Ming personally leads the army, I'll destroy him in one strike!

197
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:17,470
I advise you not to try anything funny,

198
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,890
or you will have a miserable death.

199
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:28,950
I do not dare oppose you even if I had ten times more courage.

200
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:34,870
If anything goes wrong with the abdication tomorrow, none of you will survive.

201
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,030
General, we were with San Mei this whole time,

202
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:44,689
and it seems she truly knows nothing of Xuan Yue sending troops.

203
00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:50,820
Yes, we also wonder wh-why Xuan Yue sent out the army so... so suddenly.

204
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,030
- Old Guan,
- Yes.

205
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,629
- Feng Lei.
- Yes.

206
00:15:56,629 --> 00:16:02,769
Today, I already ordered people to bring your old mom and your daughter into General's Manor.

207
00:16:02,769 --> 00:16:07,890
If Guan San Mei plays any tricks, they will definitely not survive.

208
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,440
- I...
- G-General, we...

209
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,810
I will ask you one last time!

210
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:19,390
What is behind Xuan Yue's dispatch of troops?

211
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:21,429
- General, we will tell you the truth.
- Speak!

212
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:24,229
General, they... they want to send your elite soldiers away!

213
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,369
General, spare my life.

214
00:16:25,369 --> 00:16:27,920
General, please spare my life.

215
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,420
What a ploy to lure the tiger from his den.

216
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,920
General, Guan San Mei is so sinister

217
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,309
that she uses Xuan Yue's dispatch of troops to send away elite soldiers in the city.

218
00:16:37,309 --> 00:16:39,870
Then she can capture you alive at tomorrow morning's court,

219
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,620
after which she can secure the throne forever.

220
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,920
No wonder Liu Xuan Ming likes her so much.

221
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,199
She has tricks up her sleeve (cunning).

222
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,569
- General, what is your plan? Can I kill her now?
- Stop!

223
00:16:52,569 --> 00:16:54,070
No.

224
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,750
Since she wants to play, we will beat her at her own game.

225
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:05,360
Tomorrow, I will put out news that you led the troops to the battle.

226
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:14,619
This is the tiger seal for troop movements. Keep it.

227
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:20,129
Tomorrow, you will secretly bring troops to the palace and wait in ambush outside the main hall.

228
00:17:20,129 --> 00:17:24,450
When I go to court, if Guan San Mei is against me,

229
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:28,400
you will lead the troops in to kill her.

230
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,930
Affirmative.

231
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,469
Tomorrow, I am determined to seize the throne,

232
00:17:43,469 --> 00:17:48,800
and I will rapidly abolish all who dare get in my way!

233
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,650
Why hasn't she woken up yet?

234
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:00,100
Your Majesty, although she got wounded in many places by sharp blades,

235
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,920
her heart and spleen are intact.

236
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,110
Reasonably, she should be awake by now.

237
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,840
Maybe I can stimulate her with a silver needle.

238
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:09,169
She is awake.

239
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:11,560
I will go and decoct several medicines.

240
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,800
You are awake.

241
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,020
Greetings, Princess Yun Luo and San Mei.

242
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,170
You should lie down and rest.

243
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,610
Do you know who I am?

244
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,560
When I was in Tian Mu City, a spy once showed me your portrait.

245
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,660
That is very honest of you.

246
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,480
San Mei, you are a smart person,

247
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,560
and I don't dare conceal anything from you.

248
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,759
Princess Hui Rou, you must not tell anyone that my eldest sister pretends to be Ye Zhao Nan.

249
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:53,320
Don't worry, Princess Yun Luo. I know what to say and what not to say.

250
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,860
You should focus on recovery now.

251
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,979
After your wounds heal, I will give you some money, then you can leave.

252
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:10,150
San Mei, I have been feeling guilty

253
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,030
about Qi Meng's matter.

254
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,920
So if you don't mind,

255
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:20,100
I would like to serve by your side to atone for my sister's sins.

256
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,450
Sister, how about we keep Hui Rou?

257
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:29,549
If she goes, I fear those people will hunt her down and kill her.

258
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,719
You just focus on your recovery now, and we will discuss this in the future.

259
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,510
[Gentle Plum Breeze]

260
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:53,980
Brother Zhao, I want you to be responsible for me.

261
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,610
No.

262
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:04,640
Brother Zhao, I want you...

263
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,210
[Gentle Plum Breeze]

264
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:20,529
San Mei, we just received news from General's Manor that

265
00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:23,780
Vice General Zhou led 30,000 elite soldiers of the city.

266
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:30,290
San Mei, General Jin Fu got my daughter and Feng Lei's mother into General's Manor.

267
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,070
What did you say to Jin Fu?

268
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:37,629
As per your instruction, we told Jin Fu that Xuan Yue sent troops to distract him.

269
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:39,269
Very good.

270
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:42,810
Tomorrow, outside main hall will be full of Jin Fu's soldiers; Xuan Yue's troops can't enter.

271
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:47,010
Are you sure we can succeed when we are the only ones here?

272
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,820
Nothing in this world is completely sure,

273
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,079
and most of them are partly man-made and providence.

274
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,379
If what we do is right, then providence will tilt to our side.

275
00:21:01,379 --> 00:21:03,160
Then what about our families?

276
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,870
Will they truly be all right at General's Manor?

277
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,489
Don't forget one of our own people is in General's Manor as well.

278
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:15,570
No one can hurt your families in his presence.

279
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:17,639
Are you talking about Yi Yang Jun?

280
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:22,700
No, he is far more capable than Yi Yang Jun.

281
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,339
You can rest assured he will protect your families well.

282
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:37,600
Otherwise, how could he be called "top assassin in the world"?

283
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,069
Are the elite soldiers in the city ready?

284
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:50,480
All are ready.

285
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,620
If Guan San Mei intends to harm you,

286
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,920
she will die under countless blades at my command.

287
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,600
Good.

288
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:04,649
The ministers and court officials were all bought off by me and all are my men.

289
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:10,139
Today is the day I will inherit the throne and unify Mu Xi.

290
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:12,180
May Your Majesty be bathed in blessings.

291
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:44,829
May Your Majesty be bathed in blessings. May peace be with Mu Xi City.

292
00:22:44,829 --> 00:22:49,800
May the world be stable. May people be in the best of health.

293
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,730
My deputies, please rise.

294
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,629
General Jin Fu, why are you late for today's morning court?

295
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:23,889
Your Majesty, I heard you would issue an edict of your abdication today,

296
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:27,180
and I felt only fear in my heart

297
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,440
so I was late.

298
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,910
I hope Your Majesty will forgive me.

299
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,100
An edict of my abdication?

300
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:42,020
When did I say I would issue an edict of my abdication?

301
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,960
It is well-known among the ministers.

302
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,360
You all agree with me, right?

303
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,740
Jin Fu, how dare you?

304
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,419
Rumors spread that you have a heart of disobedience,

305
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:02,130
and it seems valid (true).

306
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,510
Guards, bring up evidence of Jin Fu's crime.

307
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:15,750
General Jin Fu, you should know what is in it, right?

308
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,960
How could I know?

309
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,570
Then you should open it personally and have a look.

310
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,040
[To General Jin Fu]

311
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,820
Where did these letters come from?

312
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,470
General, why ask when you already know the answer?

313
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:52,700
[I heard of General's fame, military ability and wish to befriend you. Xuan Yue City Lord.]

314
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,609
How... how could this be?

315
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:56,930
It is unbelievable.

316
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:05,020
My deputies, do you think these letters are fake?

317
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:16,660
Your Majesty, we have seen the handwriting of Liu Xuan Ming before,

318
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,150
and we can confirm this letter was written by him.

319
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,730
It even has Lord of Xuan Yue's seal.

320
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:27,530
General Jin Fu, it seems you were secretly in contact with Liu Xuan Ming several years.

321
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:31,299
No wonder Mu Xi never won a battle with Xuan Yue.

322
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:35,699
It is because General Jin Fu was uniting with their lord, Liu Xuan Ming!

323
00:25:35,699 --> 00:25:38,590
Absurd! How absurd!

324
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:42,060
All these letters are fake.

325
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:49,690
These letters not only have Liu Xuan Ming's handwriting, but also his seal

326
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,870
so how could they be fake?

327
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:57,160
Who in the world are you, Guan San mei or Ye Zhao Nan?

328
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:02,220
I don't know what you mean.

329
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:11,650
Maybe this can resolve your confusion.

330
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,980
Impossible, this is impossible!

331
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,549
How can you have the Golden Seal? You are not Ye Zhao Nan.

332
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:20,400
You are a fake!

333
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:24,120
Officials, she is not His Majesty at all.

334
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,250
She just looks like His Majesty.

335
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:31,000
She is a woman!

336
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,370
How could that be possible?

337
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:35,879
How could His Majesty be a woman?

338
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,690
Indeed.

339
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,260
If you don't believe it,

340
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:48,140
we can verify her identity.

341
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,410
- Let's do it.
- Do it.

342
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,469
- How could it be possible?
- How dare you?

343
00:26:55,469 --> 00:27:00,300
How dare you look at His Majesty's body?

344
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:04,710
I have loyally served two generations of lords.

345
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:10,539
If you trust me, you may let me verify his identity personally.

346
00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:15,640
Eunuch Sun, I fear you have been bribed, too.

347
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,200
You...

348
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:23,190
General Jin Fu, how about letting me do the verification?

349
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,880
Sure, then we shall let Minister Zeng do it.

350
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,410
Your Majesty, please come with me.

351
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:17,250
You two despicable backstabbers will get your families killed.

352
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,740
Really?

353
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,530
I don't think so.

354
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,189
Are Feng Lei and Guan's families locked here?

355
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,530
Yes.

356
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:37,060
Minister Zeng, what did you find?

357
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,930
Officials, I have verified His Majesty's identity

358
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,090
and he is

359
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,550
indeed a man.

360
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,910
I told you so.

361
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:58,999
Why even bother? How could His Majesty be a woman?

362
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:06,420
General Jin Fu, what is your intention to frame His Majesty?

363
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:13,380
It's a boy, the future Lord of Mu Xi City!

364
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:22,160
I would never have thought loyal Minister Zeng was also bribed by her.

365
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,970
How dare you?

366
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:28,240
Guan San Mei, do you dare to vow to Heaven?

367
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,430
All right.

368
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:38,549
Today, I vow to Heaven that if I am not Ye Zhao Nan,

369
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:41,459
the flesh and blood of the former lord of Mu Xi City,

370
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,169
I will get struck down by lightning and die a dog's death!

371
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:50,440
Guan San Mei, since you are crazy enough to make such a vicious oath,

372
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,610
don't blame me for being ruthless.

373
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,150
Guards!

374
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:04,850
General, what are you doing?

375
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,710
"What am I doing?"

376
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:11,340
Since you don't act like a lord, don't blame me for not acting like a minister!

377
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:37,730
♫ Secretly hiding, secretly thinking of you ♫
