City Lord brought back a wild woman from who knows where.
[My Uncanny Destiny: Episode 2]

30
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:18,919
I see she is like a dung beetle digging its way into a peanut.

31
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,580
She isn't a good person.

32
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,170
They said she is credited for saving City Lord.

33
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:27,589
In the end, she made her way straight into Lord's bedchamber.

You are Lord's nanny,

37
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:38,189
and he was breastfed by you when he was little.

38
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:40,420
You should talk to him!

39
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,070
Baby, why are you losing control?

You are Ke Qian Yue, who is in charge of this place.

The City Lord is yours. No one can snatch him away.

42
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,859
Your father died early so I shouldered all the hardships to raise you.

Things are hard for me, too.

44

You can't rely on me for everything.

45

00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:17,020

I heard that Princess Qi Meng from Tian Mu City is coming here.

Good! You are my daughter.

How strange.

Why are there no guards at all tonight?

67

Oh, sh*t!

We almost killed the wrong person just now.

00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:56,710
Come take a look. Look.

72
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:04,100
You little temptress, your looks are nowhere near my beauty,

73
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,040
yet you're trying to seduce My Lord?

74
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,500
You are so bold and shameless.

75
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,560
Let's see how you can seduce men after I disfigure you.

76
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,099
My Lord, when the water in Chamber of Baths is ready, I'll come to report.

77
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:24,490
No, she's coming.

78
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,330
You must have known whom I was long ago

79
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,000
so you came to my rescue.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,090
Lucky for you, you've made a smart move.

81
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,660
If you're lucky to survive, I will reward you generously.

82
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,040
My Lord!

83
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,650
My Lord, the water in the Chamber of Baths is ready.

84
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,150
I see.

85
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,190
How vulgar.

86
00:07:47,709 --> 00:07:49,550
Oh my goodness.

87
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,799
It scared me.

88
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:52,780
I thought I was dead meat.

89
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,499
If they find out we drugged the next shift guards, they will surely strengthen security.

90
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:59,300
We won't find another good chance if that happens.

I want to go back to see my mom.

I miss my daughter.

Why are your hands shaking?

94
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:06,989
My hands shake for no reason whenever I feel nervous.

95
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,680
This might be what they call a "handshake."

96
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,230
Who are you?

97
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,770
Why am I here?

98
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,520
Where am I?

99
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,200
Who am I?

100
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:42,000
San Mei (Third Younger Sister).

101
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:54,420
Did you forget that we came here to assassinate the City Lord?

102
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:11,840
Ye Zhao Nan is such a sneaky b*stard that he sent out assassins to kill me,

103
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,580
as soon as I entered Mu Xi City boundaries.

104
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,499
The people of Mu Xi are cunning by nature.

105
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,919
Otherwise, the former lord would not have fallen for their trap and died in exasperation.

106
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,579
My Lord, we'd better wait for the marriage alliance with Tian Mu City before our next move.

107
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:28,240
Right, the woman who saved me...

108
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,730
We're checking her identity,

109
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:31,950
but we haven't found anything yet.

110
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,270
Why did she cross-dress for no reason?

111
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,910
Maybe she just wanted to approach Your Majesty.

112
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,619
Remember that trip?

113
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:41,819
Two women pretended to be weak and sick,

114
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:45,289
and they purposely fainted in Your Majesty's arms.

115
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:47,460
How audacious!

116
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,290
Yao Hu.

117
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,129
You have such strong hands! Why don't you work as a blacksmith instead?

118
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:01,930
I'll be more gentle, more gentle.

119
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,439
Your Majesty is so handsome and strong that women often lose control of themselves.

[Ye Zhao Nan]

00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,780
I'm your oldest brother.

122
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,330
- I'm your second oldest brother.
- What?

123
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,150
My child.

124
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,490
Dad?

125
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,719
Right.

126
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:33,930
You are San Mei.

127
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,340
City Lord listened to the slander and had our family members beheaded.

128
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,790
Our family had several hundred people,

129
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:46,340
but only the four of us survived.

130
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:50,979
So to avenge our family, we infiltrated the palace to assassinate His Majesty.

131
00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:52,300
- "To assassinate His Majesty."
- Yes.

132
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,780
My oldest brother, why did you want to kill me?

133
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,239
In order for you to get close to His Majesty,

134
00:10:58,239 --> 00:11:01,090
we arranged for you to rescue him.

135
00:11:01,090 --> 00:11:05,210
You got hurt while rescuing him.

136
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,819
We found out that you lost your memory

137
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:11,260
so your oldest brother was trying to help you restore your memory.

138
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:20,729
Since you lost your memory due to injury, we want to repeat the scenario.

139
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:22,340
Then

140
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,129
how did I save His Majesty?

141
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:27,830
It's not important, San Mei.

142
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:31,300
The important thing is that by saving him,

143
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,150
you've merited chances to approach His Majesty

144
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,590
and assassinate him.

145
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,180
San Mei.

146
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,330
Revenge for dozens of people in our family

147
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,730
- is in your hand—
- Wait!

148
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,620
You had said hundreds of people.

149
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,050
It's not important, San Mei!

150
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:02,180
The important thing is that

151
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:10,370
you mustn't fail the three of us!

152
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,579
- San Mei.
- We are counting on you, San Mei.

153
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:18,129
My daughter, avenge our whole family.

154
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:20,260
Avenge them.

155
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,610
San Mei.

156
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,350
Do you recall now?

157
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,010
Dad?

158
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,340
Dad!

159
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,660
- My poor daughter.
- Dad.

160
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,129
Old Guan, I don't want to blame you, but didn't you mention an auspicious sign?

161
00:12:58,129 --> 00:12:59,689
- Where is it?
- Nonsense.

162
00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:04,399
My fortune-telling result says nothing will go wrong with our plan and our benefactor will nod.

163
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,059
Maybe that girl is our benefactor.

164
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:07,119
What benefactor?

165
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,810
I'm afraid she will bring us trouble.

166
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:12,370
How about we head back now and kill Liu Xuan Ming?

167
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,869
Keep it down. Kill, whom do you want to kill?

168
00:13:14,869 --> 00:13:17,139
Even if something goes wrong, it has nothing to do with us.

169
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:19,009
They can't find us in such a big city.

170
00:13:19,009 --> 00:13:21,109
Besides, what she saw were three guards.

171
00:13:21,109 --> 00:13:22,219
And what are we?

172
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:25,640
We are... eunuchs.

173
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,119
See what dumb looks you have.

174
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:29,329
Don't you think what we just did is a bit unethical?

175
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:31,289
"Unethical"? Let's go.

176
00:13:31,289 --> 00:13:33,829
- Be gentle.
- Let's go.

177
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,570
Let's go. Let's go.

178
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,670
Are you awake?

179
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,720
Who on Earth are you?

180
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,570
Why did you dress as a man?

181
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,860
Report!

182
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,849
My Lord!

183
00:14:07,849 --> 00:14:11,669
Some Mu Xi people were captured outside the city, and resisters were executed on the spot.

184
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:14,580
Keep the rest in the city as slaves.

185
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,820
Yes.

186
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:23,029
City Lord listened to the slander and had our family members beheaded.

187
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:28,349
By saving him, you've merited chances to approach His Majesty and assassinate him.

188
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:36,450
You mustn't fail the three of us!

189
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,050
Those repulsive Mu Xi people...

190
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,400
Help!

191
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,490
There are assassins!

192
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,399
My Lord! My Lord!

193
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,260
There are assa...

194
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,650
Where are they?

195
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,039
My Lord, two assassins were clearly just here.

196
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:00,239
And there was a lecher who wanted to molest me.

197
00:15:00,239 --> 00:15:01,850
Ke Qian Yue!

198
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,270
Why are you hiding in the closet?

199
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,550
I...

200
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,220
happened to be passing by.

201
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:21,230
You happened to be passing by the closet in my bedchamber?

202
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,220
Well...

203
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,760
I dropped a coin by accident. What a coincidence!

204
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,530
I-I just recalled I have things to do.

205
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,290
I bid your Majesty goodbye.

206
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,189
Your Majesty. I...

207
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:00,179
- have to go.
- Come back.

208
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,150
What's the matter?

209
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:12,320
I received a secret message from our spies in Mu Xi City.

210
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,719
[Lord of Mu Xi is ill and will not hold court.]

211
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:18,950
Ye Zhao Nan is ill.

212
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,949
He is in retreat to recuperate.

213
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:26,199
We just returned from Mu Xi City, and he fell ill.

214
00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:27,780
How fishy.

215
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,020
Ye Zhao Nan. Oh, Ye Zhao Nan.

216
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:35,100
Don't you die.

217
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,640
If you die, you've got to die in my hands.

218
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,390
Well, I...

219
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,390
Come back.

220
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,030
Ask someone to clean up the study.

221
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:51,120
I'm going to sleep there tonight.

222
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,900
This lady...

223
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,540
She is injured.

224
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,590
Just let her rest here.

225
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,369
- Sleeping separately?
- Do you think she can take advantage of me?

226
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:07,078
My mistake, I am on it.

227
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:15,540
By the way, I forgot to ask your name.

228
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,310
My name is...

229
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,439
San Mei.

230
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,809
Rustic.

231
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,800
Baby, I am with you.

232
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,859
And the two of you,

233
00:18:02,859 --> 00:18:06,190
after going in, use all your strength

234
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,440
to punish that goblin!

235
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,369
See if she still dares to live in His Majesty's bedroom.

236
00:18:11,369 --> 00:18:14,419
Show her who has the final say in Xuan Yue City!

237
00:18:14,419 --> 00:18:16,039
- Understand?
- Yes.

238
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:19,030
[Toilet]

239
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,940
Baby, come here.

240
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,280
Don't worry, Mom.

241
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,860
If she dares to steal my man,

242
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:33,440
she's asking for her own death.

243
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,049
- Bai Lu.
- Yes.

244
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:36,969
- Xiao Shuang.
- Yes.

245
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:38,739
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

246
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:40,529
Oppose her to death.

247
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,070
Let's go.

248
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,700
Greetings to Nanny Ke, Housekeeper Ke.

249
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,240
Let's go.

250
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,400
Temptress!

251
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,800
Let me.

252
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,260
Get up.

253
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,889
Mom. Her saliva!

254
00:19:20,889 --> 00:19:22,349
Step aside. Let me.

255
00:19:22,349 --> 00:19:24,030
You! Leave!

256
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,789
Be gentle. Let go. Let go.

257
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:29,949
Be gentle. It hurts. It hurts.

258
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,890
How dare you be rude to Nanny Ke?

259
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,729
- Don't do this.
- Let her go.

260
00:19:35,729 --> 00:19:37,500
Nanny Ke.

261
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,000
Mom.

262
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,700
How dare you kick me?

263
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,230
Who are you?

264
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,459
Making all this noise in the morning,

265
00:19:51,459 --> 00:19:53,440
you disturbed my sleep.

266
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,039
Good for you!

267
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,420
My mother is the current City Lord's nanny.

268
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,269
Both His Majesty and Old Dowager are respectful to my mother.

269
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,910
How dare you be rude to my mother?

270
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,460
Exactly.

271
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,710
The guilty party accuses first.

272
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,079
I was sleeping here nicely. Clearly, you acted rudely first!

273
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:13,719
Is this where you can sleep?

274
00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:15,229
Exactly. Even I haven't slept here.

275
00:20:15,229 --> 00:20:16,710
It will never be your turn.

276
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:19,429
You're just an evil dog going to the toilet seeking feces (literally, courting death).

277
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:21,559
- Courting death!
- Exactly.

278
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:25,570
Tell me what you did to His Majesty last night.

279
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,430
- "Last night"?
- Yes.

280
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,960
Last night...

281
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,720
It was very dark and windy last night.

282
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,400
The lord suddenly held me down on the bed.

283
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,940
And then?

284
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:56,439
Then he took off my clothes one by one.

285
00:20:56,439 --> 00:20:57,960
Then what?

286
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:02,349
I said, "No. Stop!"

287
00:21:02,349 --> 00:21:03,599
And then?

288
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,320
He said,

289
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,640
"I want you."

290
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,900
"I want you. I just want."

291
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:17,170
Then what?

292
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,950
"Then"?

293
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:27,009
Then I fought again and again!

294
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:28,630
And then?

295
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,799
I just... failed.

296
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,340
How could you fail?

297
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:39,160
I'm also wondering why I failed.

298
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,860
What is the use of self-reflection now?

299
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:44,829
Mom. She took the virginity of His Majesty.

300
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:46,349
Baby, don't cry.

301
00:21:46,349 --> 00:21:48,660
His Majesty lost his head for the moment.

302
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,510
He was wide awake last night.

303
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,890
Shut up.

304
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,430
- Mom.
- Shut up.

305
00:21:57,059 --> 00:21:59,789
I don't want to live anymore. I am going to die!

306
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:01,499
Baby.

307
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,209
- He also told me last night...
- Shut up.

308
00:22:03,209 --> 00:22:05,419
You temptress! Just you wait!

309
00:22:05,419 --> 00:22:06,920
Baby, don't do this!

310
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,459
- Nanny Ke.
- Go away!

311
00:22:08,459 --> 00:22:10,200
- Don't do it.
- Baby!

312
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,120
Nanny Ke.

313
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,220
Baby!

314
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,910
His Majesty wants to see you.

315
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:22,120
"His Majesty"?

316
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,190
I tossed and turned last night and couldn't sleep.

317
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:36,700
I thought all night and finally knew how to reward you.

318
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:39,670
Just stay by my side

319
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,300
and rub my back for me.

320
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,459
Is rubbing your back a reward?

321
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,030
All right.

322
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,400
Don't take your unlawful gain for granted.

323
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,140
You must be happy inside.

324
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,210
Why are you still standing there?

325
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,910
Yes...

326
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,240
Left.

327
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,920
Right.

328
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,160
Haven't you eaten anything?

329
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,329
By saving him, you've merited chances to approach His Majesty and assassinate him.

330
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:15,060
We are counting on you, San Mei.

331
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,640
Avenge our whole family.

332
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,000
You come on to me again.

333
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,970
The water is very shallow.

334
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,489
I really can't give you girls any chance.

335
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:12,030
Otherwise, you try to take advantage of me!

336
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:18,450
I don't understand why you are so conceited!

337
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,700
You are not outstanding! In addition,

338
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:24,510
you are even extremely ordinary!

339
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:28,210
You have an ordinary appearance, an ordinary IQ, and

340
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,699
an ordinary figure!

341
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:33,970
Many men are better than you in the world!

342
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,170
As many as the stars

343
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,670
in the night sky!

344
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:41,609
You!

345
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:43,059
You what?

346
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,969
Don't you see yourself while taking a bath?

347
00:25:44,969 --> 00:25:49,769
Why do you think all women in the world will take advantage of you?

348
00:25:49,769 --> 00:25:51,460
How dare you!

349
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,900
You never saw how those women stared at me!

350
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:59,469
People greedy for pork don't necessarily want to marry a pig!

351
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:02,869
How dare you compare me with a pig?

352
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,440
Even the pig isn't angry; why are you angry?

353
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:10,289
Yao Hu. Hand her over to Palace Labor Department to teach her manners.

354
00:26:15,151 --> 00:26:16,659
We went to visit her out of good intentions.
[Palace of Eternal Longevity]

355
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:19,639
But when she saw us, she beat us up.

356
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:22,279
She doesn't take you seriously.

357
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:25,229
Is she really so presumptuous?

358
00:26:25,229 --> 00:26:27,790
Old Dowager. No offense,

359
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:31,269
but we don't know the origin of the goblin brought back by His Majesty.

360
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:34,820
Maybe she is the spy of Mu Xi City.

361
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,930
If she hurts His Majesty, what should we do?

362
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:43,790
Old Dowager, she might be a prostitute.

363
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:48,830
What if she passes some unknown disease to His Majesty? How atrocious would that be?

364
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:52,100
That temptress can't stay.

365
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:56,840
In any case, she did save His Majesty.

366
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,440
If we punish her unjustly, who else will dare save His Majesty in future?

367
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,169
- Old Dowager!
- Old Dowager is right.

368
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,970
She did save His Majesty.

369
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,240
We can't punish her at will.

370
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,690
Greetings to Old Dowager.

371
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:21,949
A few Mu Xi women were captured and brought here as slaves.

372
00:27:21,949 --> 00:27:26,289
In addition, His Majesty sent the girl who saved him to Palace Labor Department.

373
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:27,940
Nonsense!

374
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,910
Why was she sent to Palace Labor Department?

375
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:46,510
Qian Yue. Find her an easy job and treat her well.

376
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,840
Old Dowager, rest assured.

377
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,300
I will surely treat her well.

378
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,010
This time, you fell into my hands.

379
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:12,620
I will make your life hard and eager for death.

380
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,070
Listen carefully!

381
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:24,590
In the main city of Xuan Yue City, I have the final say.

382
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:25,890
"Have the final say."

383
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:30,109
Anyone who dares to challenge me is challenging His Majesty.

384
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,269
"Challenging His Majesty."

385
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:37,680
Also, don't wish His Majesty would lay his eyes on you.

386
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:42,370
"Don't wish."

387
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,640
His Majesty is mine.

388
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,570
"Is mine!"

389
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,470
Is Housekeeper Ke's!

390
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,900
Also, in Xuan Yue City...

391
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,540
Where are my dad and brothers?

392
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:03,179
Why did they disappear after that night?

393
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:05,170
Do you know who I am?

394
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,740
Listen.

395
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:09,200
I am Commander for the Prince,

396
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,560
granted by the former lord.

397
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,040
Now I'm in charge of all you Mu Xi people.

398
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:30,400
If you dare disobey, I will beat you to death.

399
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,529
What are you looking at?

400
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,870
Hurry and walk.

401
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,470
Hurry up!

402
00:29:53,920 --> 00:30:01,000
♫ Secretly hiding, secretly thinking of you ♫

403
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:08,070
♫ Burying my feelings for you in my heart ♫

404
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:11,620
♫ The esteemed lord ♫

405
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,250
♫ Should not show vulnerability ♫

406
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:22,230
♫ Before the people so easily ♫

407
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:29,190
♫ When you appear, when you approach ♫

408
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:36,310
♫ When someone understands that I'm not a god ♫

409
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:39,800
♫ Your words ♫

410
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,410
♫ Are etched in my mind ♫

411
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:49,120
♫ That tender heart of yours ♫

412
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,590
♫ I want to protect you while navigating the storm ♫

413
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:56,170
♫ Braving the glint and flash of cold steel ♫

414
00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:03,230
♫ I want to take you to see scenery you've never seen ♫

415
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,740
♫ I really want to be with you forever ♫

416
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,290
♫ Whether we are on opposing sides or archenemies ♫

417
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:13,850
