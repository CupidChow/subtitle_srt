28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,750
I've heard Lord Liu's Chamber of Baths is rare in the world,

29
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,410
and when I see it today, I feel that it really lives up to its name.

30
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,879
Yi Yang, you flatter me.

[My Uncanny Destiny: Episode 8]

32
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,639
When will Lord Liu fulfill your promise by ceding land and offering gold?

33
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:30,600
Yi Yang, you know many ministers are against this matter, especially San Mei.

34
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,040
How about this?

35
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,410
Our two cities will unite by marriage first, and after taking down Mu Xi,

36
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,410
we will discuss everything else.

37
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,679
Lord Liu, do you try to get something for nothing?

38
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,990
I'm not.

39
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,250
It's just that it's really too hard to persuade San Mei.

40
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,310
Yi Yang, you also know my relationship with her.

41
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,810
What relationship?

42
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,260
It spread like wildfire in the city, and didn't you hear anything?

43
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,580
But San Mei and I had a heart-to-heart talk last night,

44
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,980
and she said nothing is between you two.

45

This is my royal bath towel.

How dare you!

49
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,629
Your Majesty, San Mei died of poisoning.

50
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:45,770
San Mei, why are you like this?

51
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,459
Weren't you fine earlier?

52
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,710
Why are you like this now?

53
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,629
San Mei, wake up. You can't die!

54

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,790
Hurry and get up.

62
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,079
If San Mei is in Heaven, she wouldn't want to see you like this.

63
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,769
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

64
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:35,179
Your Majesty, why are you so sure San Mei's death is related to Bai Lu?

65
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:38,299
Yes, Your Majesty. It really has nothing to do with me.

66
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,830
Don't listen to their one-sided words.

67
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,370
Before San Mei died, she said tea poured by Bai Lu was poisonous.

68
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,940
Impossible!

69
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,549
Bai Lu served San Mei only itchy powder, which made her itchy after drinking.

70
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:54,430
How can it be lethal?

71
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,110
Did you order her to do that?

72
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,780
Your Majesty, I put only itchy powder in. Really.

73
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,599
You are still lying. Give me back my daughter!

74
00:05:05,599 --> 00:05:08,899
Your Majesty, Ke Qian Yue must have ordered Bai Lu to do so. Don't go easy on her!

75
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:11,669
- You wretched servant, do you have a say in this?
- You!

76

Enough, don't fight anymore.

77
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,120
San Mei just died. Can you show her some respect?

78
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,420
Brother Xuan Ming, don't be sad.

79
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,360
Seeing you like this really makes me heartbroken.

80
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,050
It's a pity there are no gods or magic in this world.

81
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:46,470
Otherwise, I'd rather trade my own life for San Mei's and let her live again.

82
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,760
There may be a way after all.

83
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,809
She's awake. She's awake.

84
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,250
San Mei.

85
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,100
All right, all right, I'm fine.

86
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:00,169
Did you not die?

87
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,880
Of course.

88
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,329
In the beginning, when Bai Lu offered me tea for no reason,

89
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,249
I was on guard, and I didn't swallow it.

90
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,640
So after she went out the door, I spit it out.

91
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,910
It's not itchy powder at all, but poison instead!

92
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,959
It's impossible. It really is itchy powder.

93
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:29,660
If you don't believe me, I'll drink it and prove it to you.

94
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,640
So after she went out the door, I spit it out.

95
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,759
Why did you stop?

96
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,679
Don't waste time.

97
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,460
What are you waiting for?

98
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,070
How could it be poison?

99
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,820
What I put in really is itchy powder.

100
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,030
I see.

101
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:11,120
You little temptress, it was you who switched the itchy powder to frame me.

102
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,239
- How vicious!
- You...

Ke Qian Yue!

104
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:19,939
Your Majesty, I grew up with you, and you know me.

105
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:25,269
Even if I am vicious, I will never think of poisoning someone to death.

106
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:27,680
Sister Qian Yue,

107
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,389
usually when you complained to me about San Mei, I just thought you were venting,

108
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:36,489
but how could you really do such an outrageous thing?

109
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,529
Why do you keep trying to kill me over and over?

110
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,409
What I put in is just itchy powder. Obviously, you switched the package and wanted to frame me.

111
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:48,249
You are narrow-minded and jealous, yet you blame others for it, right?

112
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,689
Your Majesty, I don't dare do that again.

113
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,250
Please spare me this time.

114
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,970
The person you must beg for mercy is not me.

115
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,770
Sister San Mei,

116
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:12,480
please forgive you for your fault this time...

117
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,860
Please forgive me for my fault this time and show some mercy.

118
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,559
Leave. I don't want to see you two again.

119
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,410
Expel them from the palace; never let them in again!

120
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,640
I...

121
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,840
What are you waiting for?

122
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,350
Leave!

123
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,710
You are the one who switched Ke Qian Yue's itchy powder.

124
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,650
Believe it or not, it wasn't me who put the poison in.

125
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,560
I know your ploys very well.

126
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,420
I repeatedly advised you against provoking her,

127
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:58,100
but you didn't listen at all.

128

You...

129
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:04,300
Yesterday, my adoptive father wrote from home, asking you to marry Liu Xuan Ming quickly.

130
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,809
If Liu Xuan Ming hesitates due to ceding land and giving gold,

131
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:10,860
we can drop these conditions and focus on the overall situation.

132
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,969
It's true, Your Highness.

133
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:15,899
These will be yours in the future anyway so why demand it now?

134
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,560
Are you teaching me how to do things?

135
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,460
I don't dare to.

[Sanitation Department]

137
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,209
How could you team up with San Mei without telling us?

138
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,019
See how sad I cried just now.

139
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,440
Yes.

140
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,710
San Mei warned me not to let any outsider know

141
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,950
- to not leak it out.
- Stop right there.

142
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,499
Are we outsiders? How can you see us as outsiders?

143
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:54,589
- That's not what I meant.
- What did you mean?

144
00:10:54,589 --> 00:10:56,949
- How can we be outsiders?
- All right.

145
00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:00,890
But when in the world are we going to kill Liu Xuan Ming?

146
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,369
I fear Jin Fu won't go easy on my mother if we wait too long.

147
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,180
I'm also worried about my daughter.

148
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,929
You should tell San Mei to hurry.

149
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:12,219
What's the rush?

150
00:11:12,219 --> 00:11:16,909
Didn't Yi Yang say we must wait until after Qi Meng and Liu Xuan Ming marry?

151
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,840
Is Yi Yang reliable?

152
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,649
It's also possible he will throw us to the wolves after the marriage.

153
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:22,769
Yes.

154
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,790
If he wanted to expose us, he would long ago.

155
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:29,880
Didn't you see how heartbroken Yi Yang was about San Mei's death today?

156
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,320
Don't worry. Yi Yang won't harm our San Mei.

157
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,280
My daughter, you came back.

158
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,720
Come here and take a seat.

159
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,120
Dad, I need to ask you something.

160

What is it?

161
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,610
In which year did Liu Xuan Ming kill our whole family?

162
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,200
Well...

163
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,600
Have you forgotten the date of death of Mom and our family?

164
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,700
No, no.

165
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,700
How could I forget something so important?

166
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,300
Your second oldest brother remembers it well.

167
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,600
Yes.

168
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,900
- I remember it happened in the Year of Bing Yin.
- That's the year.

169
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,400
"The Year of Bing Yin"?

170
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,900
- In which month?
- On the Day of Ding Mao in the Month of Ji Chou.

171
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Yes. That's the date.

172
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,200
Yes. When I'm getting old, my mind is slow.

173
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,940
On the Day of Ding Mao in the Month of Ji Chou, in the Year of Bing Yin?

174
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:24,100
On the Day of Ding Mao in the Month of Ji Chou, in the Year of Bing Yin.

175
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,500
What do we do?

176
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,500
Does she suspect us?

177
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,600
Yes. Wh-What do we do? What do we do?

178
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,000
Wh-What do we do? What do we do?

179
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,400
Don't worry, it will be fine.

180
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,800
On the Day of Ding Mao in the Month of Ji Chou, in the Year of Bing Yin.

181
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,200
What were you doing on that day?

182
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,100
Who can remember that?

183
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,500
I was less than ten years old in the Year of Bing Yin.

184
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,200
Ten years old?

185
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,000
They did lie to me.

186
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,600
But why did my dad and brothers lie to me?

187
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,200
This thing is so complex.

188
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,600
Why eat something so complex?

189
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:15,600
This is a reward for shedding tears for me during the day.

190
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,600
How absurd!

191
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,300
It was due to the wind.

192
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,500
"Wind"?

193
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,200
How can it be windy in the house?

194
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,700
- "Wind"?
- All right.

195
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,700
You can't eat the head of a crayfish. It's poisonous.

196
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,000
Delicious.

197
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,800
But it's too spicy for you to eat.

198
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,400
How is it too spicy for me?

199
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:59,100
Give it to me.

200
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,100
Okay, okay.

201
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,600
Here you are.

202
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,900
Well.

203
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,700
Crayfish is a bit of a mouthful.

204
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,600
How about we give it a new name?

205
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,600
What will you call it?

206
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,500
It's small

207
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,900
so let's call it...

208
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,500
Small

209
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,600
Red.

210
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,500
Small Red?

211
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,600
Why did my dad and brothers lie to me?

212
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,800
Could it be that they are not my family?

I'd like to ask you guys.

How dare you hide a person from Mu Xi?

218

What will His Majesty do to you if he finds out?

219

But it's fine. It's fine,

as long as you hand her to me.

I think you guys are asking for death.

224

Let me tell you, you several toilet cleaners,

225
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,000
I'll peel off your skin and pluck out your sinews!

Why did San Mei treat me to Small Reds?

It's outrageous.

Greetings to Princess Yun Luo.

My baby, look at you.

250
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,900
All my warnings fell on deaf ears.

251

How many times did I tell you to not mess with them again and again?

252
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,000
How dare you poison her?

253
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,600
Mom, for the millionth time, I didn't put poison but itchy powder in her tea.

254
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,000
It's true, Madam Ke.

How dare we poison her?

Mom, how about you go and beg Queen Mother again to let us stay?

257
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,400
My sweet baby, His Majesty is still fuming; you'd better go out and hide yourself from him.

258
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,100
After His Majesty's anger dissipates, I'll beg Queen Mother to let you come back.

259
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,600
Mom, I just wasn't careful this time,

260
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,400
and I won't give up like this.

261
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,300
I will persevere to not go to the toilet for 100 days straight,

262
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,400
and one day, I'll return for my revenge.

If you say that again, I'll get upset.

Okay. Baby, don't get upset.

I won't say that again, all right?

267

Mom, the one I most worry about is Princess Qi Meng.

268

She always treats me like a real sister,

269
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,900
but I did this kind of thing.

270

Mom, she is kindhearted and easily bullied in the palace.

271

You must take care of her for me.

00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,400
was saved by me bit by bit by gritting my teeth over the years.

275

It is enough for you to buy a house on a piece of land to get through this time.

276
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,900
I see, Mom.

277
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,800
Don't worry, with my wit, I can thrive anywhere.

Don't do that.

All right.

Look, you go find San Mei instantly and see what she's doing.

You are so knowledgeable.

The truth is I'm here to find my husband.

323
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,000
Is his name

324
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,100
- Ye...
- His name is not important.

325
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:39,600
He went missing, and I'm here to find him.

326
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,800
It is said her husband looks a lot like me.

327
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:49,700
Zhi Lan, from your story, I can see you are miserable.

328
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,900
You came a long way to find your husband, and you got caught.

329
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,300
San Mei, we must find a chance to send Zhi Lan home.

330
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,500
That's exactly what I was thinking.

331
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,900
Thank you.

332
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:10,200
It really surprises me to meet such wonderful sisters like you in a foreign city.

333
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,700
I offer a toast to you both with tea, not liquor, to express my thanks.

334
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,300
If we drink, then liquor. Why replace it with tea?

335
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,600
Tonight, let's drink until wasted.

336
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,600
- Come on!
- Come on!

337
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,200
Cheers.

338
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,100
This is so good.

339
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,100
Come on. Cheers.

340
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,600
Come on.

341
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,800
Have more.

342
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,500
It's so delicious.

343
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,800
- Cheers.
- Come on.

344
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,900
You should drink more.

345
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,600
Drink more.

346
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,600
Who are you looking at?

347
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,000
Who are you looking at?

348
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,400
I am looking at my sister.

349
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,100
I am also looking at your sister.

350
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,400
Then it's good.

351
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:30,400
I really miss my husband.

352
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,400
Why is he hiding from me?

353
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,400
Does he not love me anymore?

354
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,100
If he doesn't cherish a good woman like you,

355
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:43,800
- he should be struck by lightning!
- Yes!

356
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,500
Don't cry, don't cry.

357
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,800
We sisters shall drink and say nothing about men.

358
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:03,400
Today is the happiest day I've had in the palace in all my years.

359
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,300
Come on, let's become sworn sisters.

360
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,600
Great, let's do it!

361
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
"Become sworn sisters"?

362
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,400
In that case, won't Zhi Lan be my sister?

363
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,100
No, no, I can't let that happen.

364
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,100
Let's go; I also crave liquor.

365
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,400
Let's drink a ton, too. Let's go.

366
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,800
Yi Yang.

367
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,100
For the Heaven above,

368
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,300
I, Yun Luo...

369
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,500
I, Jin Zhi Lan...

370
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,000
I...

371
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,000
Wh-What's my name again?

372
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,500
San Mei.

373
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,000
San Mei.

374
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:43,400
I feel like that's not my name.

375
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:46,100
Forget it, that's your name.

376
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,900
Yes, let's call you by that.

377
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,100
Fine!

378
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,500
Today, we become sworn sisters.

379
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,900
We share both weal (well-being) and brother.

380
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,700
Wrong, wrong. It's weal and woe.

381
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:05,500
Right, if we shared a brother, it would be messed up.

382
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,900
We share both weal and woe.

383
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,000
We weren't born on the same day, but we wish to d...

384
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,500
- but we wish to d...
- Wait a minute.

385
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,300
It's too scary to die together.

386
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,400
It's hard to bury us all.

387
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,200
We need to have a sequence.

388
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,000
Then who will die first?

389
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,700
I'll be the first.

390
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,700
Nonsense!

391
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,000
Yes, why are you fighting for this?

392
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,100
Let fate decide.

393
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,000
San Mei, you seem older than me.

394
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,700
You be the oldest sister.

395
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,600
Which of your eyes sees me as older than you?

396
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,800
You have wrinkles.

397
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,500
Quit your nonsense.

398
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,100
Zhi Lan, you'll be the second oldest sister.

399
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,400
I want to be the youngest sister.

400
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,400
The youngest one gets the most care and love.

401
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,100
Okay.

402
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:03,300
Oldest Sister, Youngest Sister.

403
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,100
Oldest sister, Second Oldest Sister.

404
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,500
Oldest, Second Oldest Sister, Youngest Sister.

405
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,400
Kowtow.

406
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,600
Rise.

407
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,500
Kowtow.

408
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,500
Rise.

409
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,000
Kowtow.

410
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,600
Rise.

411
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,100
The ceremony is completed.

412
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,400
Now send us to the bridal chamber!

413
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,000
Bridal chamber!

414
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:43,420
Now send us to the bridal chamber!

415
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Why did you drink again?

416
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,800
I'm happy today.

417
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm so...

418
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,200
San Mei. San Mei!

419
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,600
San Mei. How are you?

420
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,500
Are you not Ye Zhao Nan?

421
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,800
What are you talking about?

422
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,700
Ye Zhao Nan?

423
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,200
San Mei.

424
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,400
San Mei.

425
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,600
May Your Majesty be bathed in blessings.

426
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,400
May peace be with Mu Xi City.

427
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,900
May the world be stable.

428
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,800
May people have the best of health.

429
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:16,000
San Mei, that place is not for you to sit.

430
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,200
Hurry and get down.

431
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,800
Liu Xuan Ming, do you know who I am?

432
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:27,200
I am the Lord of Mu Xi,

433
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,400
Ye Zhao Nan.
