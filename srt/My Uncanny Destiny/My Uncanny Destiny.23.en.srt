Liu Xuan Ming,

30
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,650
sorry for doing this, but it is for the sake of San Mei.

31

What is wrong?

32
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,600
Did you have a nightmare?

It's fine. It's fine.

Did you make all this?

Today, I am the one to serve you.

38
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,060
It is so rare for Lord Liu to serve me personally.

39
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,740
It is my honor to serve Lord Ye.

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,310
How does it taste?

It would be nice if we could live like this every day from now on.

45

As long as you like it, I will make something different for you every day from now on.

46

I find that you have became a smooth talker

after spending so much time with Yi Yang.

49
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,520
If I get serious about being a smooth talker, nothing will be left for Yi Yang to do.

50

Are you that good?

51
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,420
I can do it with ease.

52

Princess Hui Rou, have you ever heard that pupae produce silk to wrap themselves into cocoons?

133
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:56,419
Thus, an old saying goes, "Make a cocoon and trap yourself inside."

Lord Ye, as a weak girl, I don't have as much knowledge as you do.

135
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:14,900
However, I heard before that cocoons need the help of pupae

136
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,220
to break free and become butterflies.

137

It is true.

139
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:32,220
However, some pupae can break free from their cocoons and become butterflies;

140
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:37,610
some pupae become the fried pupae in front of us instead.

I was about to look for you. I have something to tell you.

144
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,080
What is it?

145

Where are the Tian Mu troops now?

They will arrive outside Mu Xi City today and are ready to invade when you signal.

Yes, some ministers at the court have already gone to release General Jin Fu.

The show is about to begin.

156

I shall see whether she will make a cocoon

157
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,930
and trap herself inside or break free

158
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,760
to become a butterfly this time.

159
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:11,130
General, Ye Zhao Nan and Liu Xuan Ming will leave the city tonight.

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,630
Whatever misunderstandings we had before, we are Mu Xi people, after all.

162
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:23,030
We must not let Liu Xuan Ming run away.

163
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:27,260
As Lord of Mu Xi, she dares to collude with Liu Xuan Ming.

164
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,850
I will cut her into millions of little pieces!

165
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,839
Order from General Jin Fu: shut the gates,

166
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,040
and capture Liu Xuan Ming, Lord of Xuan Yue!

167
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,560
Why is Liu Xuan Ming in Mu Xi City?

168
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,180
How dare he? Is he tired of living?

169
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,100
The sky is falling!

170
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,609
- The sky is falling!
- Eunuch Sun.

171
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:52,520
- The sky is falling!
-Your sky is so fragile; how come it falls again?

172
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,840
This time, it is falling for real.

173
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,729
General Jin Fu got released.

174
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:00,890
What?

175
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,230
This is really bad. Now the city is in chaos!

176
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:08,429
General Jin Fu ordered to shut all city gates and threatened to arrest the lord of Xuan Yue City.

177
00:16:08,429 --> 00:16:10,130
Hurry and do something about it!

178
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:11,690
Well...

179
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,280
[Bright Moon and Cool Breeze]

180
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,810
Eunuch Sun, summon all ministers. I will read out my edict of abdication.

181
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,820
All right.

182
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:41,660
Jin Fu has shut all the gates

183
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:44,830
so you must leave the palace and hide in my dad's house a while.

184
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:47,379
I'll find you after reading my edict of abdication.

185
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,040
What if I insist on staying with you?

186
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,520
Then I would get very angry.

187
00:16:58,270 --> 00:17:01,329
Hui Rou, pack up; we are leaving.

188
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,350
Not so fast,

189
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:13,739
the show is about to begin.

190
00:17:13,739 --> 00:17:14,740
- You...
- Yi Yang Jun.

191
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,690
Soon, both Xuan Yue and Mu Xi will be ours.

192
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:24,800
The ambition of Tian Mu City cherished for a hundred years will come true in our hands.

193
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,429
Are you glad?

194
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:28,769
You are hopeless!

195
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,710
I am Ye Zhao Man, the tenth lord of Mu Xi.

196
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:55,030
My ancestors became the city lords and inherited the throne for a hundred years.

197
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,380
Although there were occasional upheavals,

198
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,450
thanks to the spirit of my ancestors, the city survived.

199
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,680
When it was willed to me,

200
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:07,250
the former lord worried about my gender

201
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,550
so he hid my identity under the disguise of a man.

202
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,550
Since my childhood, I studied hard,

203
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:19,860
trained my archery, horse riding skills,

204
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,390
and would not dare waste time.

205
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:32,970
After the former lord passed away, I inherited the throne.

206
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,650
Late at night, rising early, I governed the city.

207
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:39,360
I didn't aim to be better than men,

208
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,380
but to be worthy of the people and my ancestors!

209
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,139
In ancient times, Yao and Shun stepped down for people of virtue to take over.

210
00:18:46,139 --> 00:18:50,830
Nowadays, you disregard virtue,

211
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,240
ignore talents,

212
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,480
only judge based on gender, and force me to abdicate.

213
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,150
Women should not feel ashamed for being treated lightly,

214
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,740
but men are shameful for doing it!

215
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,360
Today, I can abdicate my position,

216
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,880
but not my principles,

217
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,730
not my heart, and certainly not my will!

218
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:27,650
Ministers, here is the edict of my abdication,

219
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:34,430
and pay your respect to whomever you think is worthy of the great responsibility of a lord!

220
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,999
The abdication was settled, but we ask one last thing: Where is Liu Xuan Ming?

221
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:02,910
Mu Xi and Xuan Yue were hostile, holding grudges against each other, a long time.

222
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,110
As Lord of Mu Xi City,

223
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:10,020
you formed a secret relationship with Liu Xuan Ming, Lord of Xuan Yue!

224
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,369
What is your intention?

225
00:20:11,369 --> 00:20:16,650
You have disgraced us, the people of Mu Xi. You are a disgrace to Mu Xi City,

226
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:22,109
a disgrace, a disgrace!

227
00:20:22,109 --> 00:20:26,430
I can let it pass that you mind my being the lord,

228
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:29,500
but you go as far as to mind whom I like.

229
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,110
Fine, today, I shall tell all of you.

230
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,580
I do have feelings for Liu Xuan Ming, Lord of Xuan Yue. What can you do to me?

231
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,320
How dare Liu Xuan Ming come to our Mu Xi City?

232
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,079
How could we explain it to the people of Mu Xi if we let him survive?

233
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:47,350
Hand over Liu Xuan Ming. Hand over Liu Xuan Ming.

234
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,360
I refuse!

235
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,190
Kill me if you dare!

236
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,790
Well... you...

237
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:03,200
They don't dare to, but I do!

238
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,970
Ye Zhao Nan, I can't wait to pluck out your sinews and peel off your skin!

239
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,890
Ye Zhao Nan, quickly hand over Liu Xuan Ming!

240
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:23,630
We watched you grow up so hand over Liu Xuan Ming and nobody will lay a finger on you.

241
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,260
I shall see who dares to hurt me.

242
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,020
I ask you one last time. Where is Liu Xuan Ming?

243
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,560
Do you want to see Liu Xuan Ming?

244
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,240
Fine, go to Xuan Yue and find him.

245
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:39,030
He is a good cook so he can disembowel you

246
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:43,520
and cook a meal out of your organs to feed the dogs.

247
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,080
You are such a disgrace to the people of Mu Xi!

248
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,060
Pointing your sword at a Mu Xi person, you are the real disgrace to Mu Xi's people!

249
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,900
Since you court death, I shall grant your wish.

250
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,950
General Jin Fu,

251
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,230
were you looking for me?

252
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,860
It has been a long time.

253
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,380
So you are Liu Xuan Ming.

254
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,610
Why did you return?

255
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:35,830
I couldn't talk you out of it so I pretended to accept your offer.

256
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,120
I will not let you

257
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,130
face wolves and tigers alone.

258
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:45,480
Who are you calling "wolves and tigers"? Liu Xuan Ming, this is Mu Xi City.

259
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,610
How dare you be so presumptuous?

260
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:52,080
Kill him!

261
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,230
Are you still being lovey-dovey in a situation like this?

262
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,030
Guards!

263
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:11,530
Liu Xuan Ming, Ye Zhao Nan.

264
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:17,460
Now, this is the place where you two will die!

265
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,240
How dare you?

266
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:24,380
[Ye's Ancestors of All Generations]

267
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,300
Are you done?

268
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,830
The former lord is here.

269
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:48,270
Who dares to kill his daughter in his presence?

270
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,979
Why did you come?

271
00:23:55,979 --> 00:23:59,610
We are a family; how could you leave us out?

272
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,670
- Where is Yun Luo?
- Don't worry. With Tan Rang protecting her, she will be fine.

273
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:04,670
The former lord is here!

274
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:08,770
Why don't you traitors kneel down?

275
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:22,180
If the former lord were in Heaven

276
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:26,290
and saw his daughter in love with her sworn enemy,

277
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,500
I fear he'd come back to life out of anger.

278
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,850
What do you know?

279
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:37,370
Seeing his daughter happy is the greatest comfort for a father!

280
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:42,539
General, for the sake of the former lord, you must not harm Ye Zhao Nan.

281
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,080
Ye Zhao Nan,

282
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,630
I can spare your life, but if you still see yourself as a Mu Xi person,

283
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,900
and as flesh and blood of the Ye Family,

284
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:59,790
then in our presence, kill Liu Xuan Ming!

285
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,380
As the former lord,

286
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,659
I can let you go.

287
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,280
In your dreams!

288
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,450
What are you doing?

289
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,210
Do you mean you will spare her

290
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,419
as long as I die?

291
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,850
I, Jin Fu, do as I say.

292
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:07,059
- Liu Xuan Ming!
- Stop her!

293
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,329
Liu Xuan Ming, what are you doing?

294
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,130
Today,

295
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,440
I, Liu Xuan Ming,

296
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:21,129
will end my own life at the court of Mu Xi, as you wish.

297
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,130
No! NO!

298
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,619
If you dare to pursue Ye Zhao Nan again,

299
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:28,650
tens of thousands of my Xuan Yue soldiers

300
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,380
will cut you

301
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:40,310
into millions of pieces.

302
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,360
San Mei!

303
00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:00,160
Liu Xuan Ming, without my order, nobody is allowed to die!

304
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:06,590
Live on and fulfill your ambition.

305
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:10,060
Achieve a world of great unity,

306
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,770
where people prosper together.

307
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:23,200
You... you are looking at me

308
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,360
with those affectionate eyes again.

309
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,990
No.

310
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,720
Curse

311
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,200
my handsomeness.

312
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,969
Is this the assassin arranged by Eunuch Sun?

313
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,500
Curse my handsomeness. Even men fell for me.

314
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,810
♫ All that I think about is you ♫

315
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:06,300
♫ All my feelings left with you ♫

316
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,630
Liu Xuan Ming.

317
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:12,630
Liu Xuan Ming! Liu Xuan Ming!

318
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,710
Liu Xuan Ming!

319
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,720
No! No!

320
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,580
Liu Xuan Ming!

321
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,610
No! Open your eyes, Liu Xuan Ming!

322
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:26,619
No! Don't leave me.

323
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,999
Don't, no.

324
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:59,140
Wonderful,

325
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,980
truly wonderful.

326
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:08,760
However, there is a small drawback.

327
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:15,170
It would have been perfect if you killed him with your own hands.

328
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:44,990
♫ Secretly hiding, secretly thinking of you ♫

329
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:52,120
♫ Burying my feelings for you in my heart ♫

330
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,610
♫ The esteemed lord ♫

331
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:58,190
♫ Should not show vulnerability ♫

332
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:06,210
♫ Before the people so easily ♫

333
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:13,220
♫ When you appear, when you approach ♫

334
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:20,340
♫ When someone understands that I'm not a god ♫

335
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,770
♫ Your words ♫

336
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:26,420
♫ Are etched in my mind ♫

337
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:33,070
♫ That tender heart of yours ♫

338
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,540
♫ I want to protect you while navigating the storm ♫

339
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:40,150
♫ Braving the glint and flash of cold steel ♫

340
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:47,220
♫ I want to take you to see scenery you've never seen ♫

341
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,750
♫ I really want to be with you forever ♫

342
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:54,280
♫ Whether we are on opposing sides or archenemies ♫

343
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,920
♫ Only my love for you is everlasting ♫

344
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,800
♫ A deep-rooted affection ♫
