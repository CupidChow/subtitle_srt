- Your Majesty.
- Quiet!

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,400
- What's wrong?
- I am here to apologize to you.

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,900
I know I've done so many things wrong... to both you and San Mei.

32
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,390
Due to my greed, I've hurt too many people.

After experiencing so many things, I won't dare to have desires for you anymore.

You and San Mei are a perfect match.

You and I grew up together. I've always treated you like my own sister.

00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,320
I understand.

38
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,680
The truth is... I've never really liked you.

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,299
Ever since we were little, you were the only man in the inner city. So unique.

Are you reluctant to give up the title of the lord?

72
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,960
She's not lusting for power. She stays here to achieve her ambition.

But...

74
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,970
Haven't you seen these ministers? They want to eat her alive.

Apologize to us and tell us clearly.

- Apologize to us!
- How dare you!

82

Today, we will fight to the death to force Ye Zhao Nan to abdicate!

83
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,170
After all, she is still the daughter of the former lord.

84

Stop talking nonsense and tell her to come out!

How dare you! Why don't you kneel?

88
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:52,120
She's a woman! How can we kneel to a woman?

89
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,508
Don't you kneel to a woman? Don't you kneel to your mother?

90
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:58,490
No more sophistry (tricks)! She's been lying to us over 20 years.

91
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,570
Now she's been exposed; how can she still face us?

92
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,850
That's right. The crown of Mu Xi City has always been passed on to a man, never a woman.

93
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,170
It's a rule set down by our ancestors. Don't you even know this rule?

94
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:12,100
"Rule"?

95
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,960
Are they always right? There's an old rule about officials.

96
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,060
Anyone who reaches the age of 60 and is unable to serve his country will be buried alive.

97
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,260
There was even a rule of burying people alive with the dead.

98
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,720
This is not a rule.

99
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,590
It's called a bad custom!

100
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,500
As the most important ministers of Mu Xi City,

101
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,370
you don't think how to build a wealthy, strong country,

102
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:43,960
but only fuss about men and women!

103
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:47,370
Ye Zhao Nan. You're so eloquent. We can't beat your talking.

104
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,240
But a woman can't be the lord of Mu Xi City.

105
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,380
Within three days, you must abdicate. Or else...

106
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,640
"Or else"?

107
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,920
Or else what will you do?

108
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,460
Don't forget. General Jin Fu is still in prison.

109
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,580
When the Ministry of Penalty releases him, it won't be as simple as abdicating the throne.

110
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,780
Abdicate!

111
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,510
Abdicate! Abdicate!

112
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,530
Abdicate now!

113
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:17,520
Abdicate!

114
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,700
Abdicate!

115
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,460
Abdicate now!

116
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,820
Abdicate!

117
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:35,659
Abdicate now! Abdicate!

118
00:07:35,659 --> 00:07:38,480
Abdicate!

119
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,990
- Abdicate!
- Abdicate!

120
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,310
Do you have any plans for the future?

121
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,750
What... what plans?

122
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,120
If... I mean, if the three days are up,

123
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,060
and San Mei returns to Xuan Yue City with His Majesty,

124
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:28,790
will you go with them?

125
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,820
Matters of the future, we can discuss in the future.

126
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,529
Let's solve the problem at hand first.

127
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,649
Old Guan. Feng Lei. What brings you two here?

128
00:08:39,649 --> 00:08:42,350
It spreads all over the city now. What's the situation now?

129
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,129
- Old Guan.
- It's such a big deal. Why didn't you ask us to come?

130
00:08:45,129 --> 00:08:46,920
- What's the point of doing that?
- How can you say that?

131
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,190
That's my daughter. How could I ignore what happens to her?

132
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,119
Where is San Mei now? I'll go see her.

133
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:54,609
She's annoyed right now. Don't bother her.

134
00:08:54,609 --> 00:08:57,400
Don't worry. We went through much together. We'll get through it.

135
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,700
All misfortunes will turn into good luck.

136
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,370
What good luck? This isn't a difficulty but disaster.

137
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:08,970
Last night, I cast a horoscope. Mars stayed at Antares. It's a very bad omen.

138
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,360
I fear San Mei has more hurdles than lucky possibilities.

139
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,350
Wait, wait.

140
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,110
San Mei's identity was so secretive.

141
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:19,510
Only we few know it.

142
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:22,210
How did it get out?

143
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,990
Mu Xi City is in an uproar now.

144
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:47,560
They're forcing Ye Zhao Nan to abdicate within three days.

145
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,030
It's such a pity.

146
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,660
I didn't go to the court to witness it.

147
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,880
However, when Liu Xuan Ming and Ye Zhao Nan kill each other,

148
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,710
I must go to see it then.

149
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:07,980
Otherwise, I will surely regret it all my life.

150
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:16,460
Greetings, Yi Yang Jun.

151

Something happened in Mu Xi City.

152
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:23,669
I heard it from the maid. Lord Ye's identity was revealed.

153
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:25,600
How did this happen?

154
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,290
I want to send you out of the city first.

155
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,270
No. Lord Ye usually treats me well.

156
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,370
Now she is in trouble; how can I escape?

157
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,030
Then I'll go see San Mei first.

158
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,990
Brother Yi.

159
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,620
I know you like Ye Zhao Nan.

160
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,910
For her, you can even let her be with Liu Xuan Ming.

161
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,210
But today is not the same as before.

162
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:54,220
The identity of Lord Ye was revealed.

163
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,790
If she can't get a foothold in Mu Xi City,

164
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:00,170
you should find a way to take her away

165
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:02,550
instead of letting Liu Xuan Ming take her.

166
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:10,059
Yes. I know Liu Xuan Ming also likes Ye Zhao Nan and won't hurt Lord Ye.

167
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:12,410
But have you ever thought

168
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:17,520
what will happen if Liu Xuan Ming takes Lord Ye back to Xuan Yue City?

169
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,150
Mu Xi City can't tolerate her.

170
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,920
Xuan Yue City is even less tolerant of her.

171
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,349
Xuan Yue City and Mu Xi City are enemies. How many people are jealous and hate Lord Ye?

172
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,790
If they return to Xuan Yue City, Liu Xuan Ming can't protect her at all.

173
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,180
By that time, Lord Ye is doomed to die.

174
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:40,540
If you want good for Lord Ye, take her away.

175
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,499
Not me. It's really not me. I didn't do that.

176
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:53,969
If not you, who else? Yi Yang Jun wouldn't tell others.

177
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:55,590
Yun Luo and Tan Rang wouldn't say it, either.

178
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,569
Although she was a bad person, she has now reformed. It can't be her.

179
00:11:59,569 --> 00:12:03,170
Are you fooled by her beauty?

180
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,539
Is she beautiful?

181
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,639
- You—
- Are you blind?

182
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,620
Isn't she pretty enough?

183
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,579
Ke Qian Yue, you harmed San Mei so much in the past, yet she forgave you.

184
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:12,069
Why did you still hurt her?

185
00:12:12,069 --> 00:12:13,369
- I did not.
- How could you do that?

186
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,109
- I'm so angry! I must kill you!
- Let's investigate first.

187
00:12:17,109 --> 00:12:18,740
San Mei.

188
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,809
- What are you doing?
- We're seeking who betrayed you.

189
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,819
The one who told your secret must hold a grudge against you.

190
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:30,579
I really didn't do it. I already stopped hating San Mei.

191
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:34,740
Your Majesty. San Mei. Please trust me!

192
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,090
Qian Yue reformed. She couldn't have done it.

193
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,200
About this matter, I believe in Qian Yue.

194
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,630
San Mei, you cannot be so softhearted!

195
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,290
Not Qian Yue, but Qian Hui Rou has a deeper grudge against San Mei.

196
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:53,410
Has Bai Lu reported on Qian Hui Rou's situation recently?

197
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,619
But it's all about the daily chores, nothing strange.

198
00:12:57,619 --> 00:13:01,409
"Bai Lu"? Could she have already been bribed by Qian Hui Rou?

199
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,630
- Qian Yue, did Bai Lu ever tell you how she found you?
- Yes.

200
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:15,179
She said she had been caught and sent to a rich man to be his maid concubine.

201
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:18,779
She ran away several times. She finally fled from there.

202
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,590
[Glory and Grace]

203
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,680
Greetings, Lord Ye.

204
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,830
Bai Lu. You said you were caught before

205
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,060
and ran away several times.

206
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,570
Yes.

207
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,669
Then when you were caught again, would they let you off easily?

208
00:13:44,669 --> 00:13:48,880
Not only did they break my arms, they also...

209
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,670
I want to take San Mei away.

210
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,089
Where can you take her?

211
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,209
Any place is better than Xuan Yue City. You can't protect her at all

212
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:12,180
Nonsense. As long as I am alive, no one can hurt her.

213
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,819
You saw today's situation in the court.

214
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,289
If what happened today happens in the court of Xuan Yue City

215
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:20,709
and all ministers force you to kill her, how would you protect her?

216
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,830
I would kill anyone who mentions it.

217
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:28,009
So you want to kill all the ministers and citizens of Xuan Yue City?

218
00:14:28,009 --> 00:14:30,999
You are not a tyrant. You won't do things like this.

219
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,140
You're right.

220
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,800
But for her, I can give up the title of Lord.

221
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,580
Don't be naive, okay?

222
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,019
Put San Mei in my hands. I'll protect her.

223
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,809
You continue to be Lord. This is the best way.

224
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:52,909
- Any way I can be with her, that's the best way!
- Liu Xuan Ming!

225
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,459
Yi Yang Jun! In fact, our argument is pointless.

226
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,530
San Mei will not go with us.

227
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,860
Yes. She is Ye Zhao Nan.

228
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,470
How could she run away?

229
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,281
Former Lord Ye.

230
00:15:20,281 --> 00:15:23,659
Although we never met before,
[Ye's Ancestors of All Generations]

231
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:26,110
you were the father of San Mei.

232
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:28,410
I am also her father.

233
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:33,340
Now San Mei has encountered a big disaster.

234
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:38,839
I am too incompetent. I really don't know how to help her.

235
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,890
I have come to you.

236
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,390
If you know this,

237
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:53,290
please bless our poor daughter to be safe and sound,

238
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:57,260
survive this calamity, and turn calamities into blessings.

239
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,449
Please, my dear brother.

240
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,410
San Mei is a good person.

241
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,590
God will surely bless her.

242
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,069
Destiny makes fools of people.

243
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,509
Who would have thought the younger sister

244
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:16,620
wanted to kill San Mei by all means,

245
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,970
but nowadays, the older sister prays for San Mei?

246
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:31,160
My younger sister was too sinister and ruthless.

247
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,400
I always feel guilty for what she did.

248
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,170
It's a pity I am just a weak woman.

249
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,790
I can't help much.

250
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,730
I'm a sad old man.

251
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,759
What a loser I am.

252
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:52,600
What should I do to help San Mei get through this hardship?

253
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,970
If San Mei makes a magnificent contribution,

254
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,419
then wouldn't all the ministers look at her differently?

255
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,840
"Magnificent contribution"?

256
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,270
That's easy to say, but so hard to do.

257
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:13,050
San Mei is too stupid.

258
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,360
She doesn't know to think for herself.

259
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:21,050
As a lord, she should be more bold, resolute and care less about love.

260
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:24,450
If the lord were someone else, she would kill Liu Xuan Ming.

261
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:27,790
This would be a great achievement for Mu Xi City.

262
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:31,430
Unfortunately, San Mei is not this kind of person.

263
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,540
She's just too kind.

264
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,260
Xuan Yue City is behind you.

265
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,110
Remember the signal arrow I gave you?

266
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:18,170
If you want, shoot the arrow.

267
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,470
Let Xuan Yue City's army attack.

268
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,940
See who still dares oppose you.

269
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,460
No.

270
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,860
Once Xuan Yue City's army enters the city,

271
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,400
Mu Xi City's soldiers would resist stiffly.

272
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,680
I don't want to go against my belief in peace.

273
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,930
I don't want to

274
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,250
see people displaced and their families broken up again.

275
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,860
It's a son.

276
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:54,099
He is the future lord of Mu Xi City!

277
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,110
I don't want anyone else to die due to me.

278
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,480
I don't want that.

279
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,710
I want to change all this.

280
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,729
They want me to abdicate. I will never back out.

281
00:19:09,729 --> 00:19:12,260
Not even a step back!

282
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,600
I will not abdicate, and

283
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,130
I will be here to realize my own ideal.

284
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:28,040
Create a world of harmony with no hunger nor poverty,

285
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,550
no inferiority nor superiority.

286
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:36,080
People will share wealth and prosperity here.

287
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,870
I will stay with you,

288
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,380
no matter how rough the road ahead,

289
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:47,810
no matter how strong the storm.

290
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,000
[Wind in the Plum Pine Trees]

291
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,540
Old Guan, you're being sneaky. What do you want to do?

292
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,480
Let me ask you.

293
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,979
Are you closer with San Mei or Liu Xuan Ming?

294
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,490
Are you talking nonsense?

295
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,229
San Mei is our family member. How can Liu Xuan Ming be compared with her?

296
00:20:14,229 --> 00:20:16,960
I have an idea to save San Mei.

297
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,210
What ideas can you come up with?

298
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,179
- Do you want to hear it or not?
- I want to. I'll hear it.

299
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,270
Say it.

300
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:27,640
Here's the situation. All ministers oppose San Mei.

301
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,260
They look down on San Mei, right?

302
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,140
Can you focus on the key points?

303
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,529
Cut the nonsense. Get to the point.

304
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,650
I worry that even if San Mei abdicates,

305
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:42,640
the ministers may not let her go, right?

306
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,089
So we must let San Mei have a great triumph to change their minds.

307
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:50,920
Xuan Yue City and Mu Xi City have a long-standing grudge.

308
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,399
Is killing Lord Liu Xuan Ming of Xuan Yue City a great achievement?

309
00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:57,509
Of course. It must be a great feat.

310
00:20:57,509 --> 00:21:00,299
How so? You know San Mei.

311
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,239
She likes Liu Xuan Ming so much. Will she kill Liu Xuan Ming?

312
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:07,129
Don't mention Liu Xuan Ming; she won't even kill an innocent person.

313
00:21:07,129 --> 00:21:10,440
So we must do it for San Mei.

314
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,340
Good. Just do it.

315
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,710
Zhao Jing.

316
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:25,799
I fear if we do it, San Mei will hate us the rest of her life.

317
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:29,489
Even if she hates or even kills us in rage,

318
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:35,170
as long as San Mei can live in peace, it's worth doing it.

319
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,170
Don't hesitate.

320
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,080
There's little time left. Let's do it.

321
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,439
- Do it.
- Good. Let's do it.

322
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:45,010
Let's do it tomorrow.

323
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:48,020
But remember, we can't do it in front of San Mei.

324
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,299
If she witnesses Liu Xuan Ming's death, she would go crazy.

325
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,539
Listen to me. Like this, like this.

326
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,800
I knew it.

327
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,179
I knew it. Look at them sneaking around!

328
00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:08,990
No good can come of it.

329
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,150
How dare they?

330
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,179
No. I must persuade Zhao Jing.

331
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:16,660
Otherwise, they would make a big mistake.

332
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,170
How will you persuade him?
[Wind in the Plum Pine Trees]

333
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,970
They're so fierce and vicious.

334
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,280
They may silence you.

335
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,799
Impossible. They're not that kind of people.

336
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:33,539
If they are that ruthless, earlier when they tied me up, I would have been killed long ago.

337
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:36,799
Times have changed. Be prepared for an emergency.

338
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,390
Instead of telling them, why don't you go and tell His Majesty?

339
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:44,599
Maybe if His Majesty sees your initiative to make merit,

340
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:47,020
he would spare Zhao Jing's life.

341
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,420
Then I'll go tell him now.

342
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,500
[Wind in the Plum Pine Trees]

343
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,770
[Bright Moon and Cool Breeze]

344
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:09,570
Your Majesty!

345
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,840
Your Majesty!

346
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,440
Your Majesty!

347
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,600
San Mei just fell asleep.

348
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,960
We can talk tomorrow.

349
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,889
It's an emergency, a life-threatening emergency.

350
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,620
What is it?

351
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:42,379
Tomorrow, Old Guan, Feng Lei, and Zhao Jing are going to kill you.

352
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,640
It's real.

353
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,620
They said by killing you, it'll help San Mei get merit.

354
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,970
All ministers would see San Mei's ability.

355
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:55,480
However, this matter has nothing to do with Zhao Jing.

356
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,780
It was all incited by Old Guan and Feng Lei.

357
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,290
Please do not blame him.

358
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,190
Got it.

359
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:07,040
Your Majesty, what I said is true.

360
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:12,230
Didn't you just say they'll kill me tomorrow?

361
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,490
Then go back to rest.

362
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,610
Your...

363
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,610
Liu Xuan Ming behaved with unusual calmness. Ke Qian Yue then told Yun Luo.

364
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:53,920
It's finally getting messy. It's so fun!

365
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,800
So fun! So exciting!

366
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:05,250
Oh, right. After Ye Zhao Nan saw your wound, what did she say?

367
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,540
She didn't say anything.

368
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,900
She just talked to herself.

369
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,190
- "Talked to herself"?
- Yes.

370
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,620
What did she say?

371
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,370
I didn't hear it clearly.

372
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,560
Are you deaf?

373
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,549
I'm so sorry. Her voice was too low.

374
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:23,840
I really didn't hear it clearly.

375
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,640
She didn't find out, did she?

376
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,670
I don't think so.

377
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,430
Then what did she say?

378
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,460
What exactly did she say?

379
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,830
She found out.

380
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,850
Impossible.

381
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,670
Then she...

382
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,250
What exactly did she say?

383
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,720
What exactly did she say? What did she say?

384
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,700
Yun Luo, don't worry.

385
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,240
I won't let anything happen to your brother.

386
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,520
If...

387
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,230
I mean if...

388
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,160
What if something really happens? What do we do?

389
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,510
With their Kung Fu, how can they be my opponent?

390
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,970
I will protect your brother.

391
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,710
It's not that.

392
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,560
You're wrong.

393
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,370
The biggest threat is not them.

394
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:39,130
It's my brother himself.

395
00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:46,220
Once he thinks his death can help my eldest sister, he might do that.

396
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:53,570
San Mei, tonight, I just want to be with you.

397
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,120
Have a good sleep.

398
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:01,010
Tomorrow, all worries will disappear.
