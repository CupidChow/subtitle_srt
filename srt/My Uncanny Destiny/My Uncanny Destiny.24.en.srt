00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,910
However, there is a small drawback.

32
00:02:34,329 --> 00:02:38,409
It would have been perfect if you killed him with your own hands.

33
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,740
Who are you?

34
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,349
General Jin Fu.

35
00:02:45,349 --> 00:02:49,189
Did you forget the person who sent you the letter so quickly?

36
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,550
Are you Princess Hui Rou?

37
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,940
You should call her Lord Hui Rou.

38
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,210
- Is she the Lord of Tian Mu City?
- Is she the Lord of Tian Mu City?

39
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:05,720
Is the Lord of Tian Mu City also a woman?

40
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,140
Yes!

41
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,880
Your horizon is widened now.

What day is it today?

43
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:19,540
Lords of Xuan Yue City and Tian Mu City are both here.

00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,730
How convenient, three cities

45
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,960
merged into one.

46

What does Qian Hui Rou mean?

47
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,400
- Just leave it to us.
- Brother.
- Don't worry.

48
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,540
Don't you understand?

49
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,500
She disturbed Mu Xi City

50
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:01,089
and let us kill each other not just to watch the fun.

51
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:05,090
Presumably, your Tian Mu Army

52
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:08,480
has already arrived at Mu Xi City, right?

53
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,290
Tian Mu Army is coming. Tian Mu Army is coming!

54
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:22,330
Didn't you keep saying I am a disgrace to Mu Xi City?

55
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,270
The pride of Mu Xi City should go out of the city

56
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,040
with your weapons to meet the enemy head-on!

57

How can we go to the battlefield? But we don't know how to fight.

General.

59
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,210
- Get out of town and fight.
- General.

60
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,070
Mu Xi City's forces

61
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,390
are trying to compete with Tian Mu Army, aren't they?

62
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,249
General Jin Fu. You can't be so stupid, can you?

63
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,480
Destroy Mu Xi City first then Xuan Yue City.

64
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:09,310
When the three cities become one, I will make you a senior general.

65
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:14,150
By then, you won't be general of only Mu Xi City,

66
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,840
but general of the three cities.

67

General.

68
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,880
Don't do this, General.

69

General.

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,800
Ye Zhao Nan.

71
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,270
I love seeing you extremely aggressive.

72
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,890
It's a pity that I can't see it anymore.

73
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,030
Look at you now.

74
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,340
It's not fun at all.

75
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,980
- It's a signal arrow, a signal arrow.
- Tian Mu Army is coming.

76
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,360
Tian Mu Army is coming!

77
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,030
Your Majesty, what do we do?

78
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,630
Qian Hui Rou. They are innocent.

79
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:06,520
No one is ever innocent in this world.

80
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,110
Why is it with the word "Liu"?

81
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:21,610
What's going on?

82
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,910
That is Xuan Yue Army's signal arrow.

83
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:31,420
Do you really think I'd treat you to dinner

84
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,500
for no reason?

85
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:39,309
Pupae produce silk to wrap themselves into cocoons.

86
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:43,910
Thus, an old saying goes, "Make a cocoon and trap yourself inside."

87
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,749
As a weak girl, I don't have as much knowledge as you do.

88
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,130
Are you scaring me?

89
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,320
Before Tian Mu Army's arrival, I ordered someone to watch carefully.

90
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,250
There was no Xuan Yue Army ambush at all.

91
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:14,830
Xuan Yue Army went to another place first, on their way here.

92
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,040
Where?

93
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,429
News from Tian Mu City is that Tian Mu City was destroyed by Xuan Yue Army last night.

94
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,830
You came to attack Mu Xi City!

95
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:39,019
So I attacked Tian Mu City. Isn't that fair?

96
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,280
Ye Zhao Nan, do you think you are very smart?

97
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,650
The military strength of Xuan Yue City is inferior to that of Tian Mu City.

98
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:52,150
After they broke Tian Mu City, they rushed to Mu Xi City. It would exhaust them!

99
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,559
Tired soldiers are awful in war.

100
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,870
You are no match for my Tian Mu soldiers.

101
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,970
You are right.

102
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:07,110
So I put all my bets on him.

103
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,699
General. Send troops to fight!

104
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:13,700
General. Do it.

105
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,920
- General, do it.
- General. Do it.

106
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,720
Do you think he is a fool? Will he survive after I win?

107
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,400
General Jin Fu, just profit from the war.

108
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,909
I promise you, when the three cities merge as one,

109
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:35,559
you will be made a senior general.

110
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:41,369
What an honor to be the general of the three cities.

111
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:46,480
She released her signal arrow to attack Mu Xi City.

112
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,570
If she wins,

113
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:55,060
do I need to tell you what will happen to the Mu Xi people?

114
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,740
Do you know why I bet everything on you?

115
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,890
Because I know that

116
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,620
no matter how much you hate me,

117
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,600
you are a Mu Xi person.

118
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,589
Ye Zhao Nan is insidious. General, don't be fooled by her!

119
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,260
All soldiers, listen to my order!

120
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,940
Yes, Sir.

121
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:49,330
Pass my order!

122
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,390
Mu Xi Army!

123
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,080
Yes.

124
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,199
Go fight the enemy!

125
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,810
Yes, Sir.

126
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,509
Jin Fu, are you crazy? Do you want to die?

127
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:17,489
She will kill you once she wins!

128
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,770
Even if I die,

129
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,290
I am still a Mu Xi person!

130
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,809
Lunatics! You're all lunatics!

131
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:48,100
You don't want wealth, glory, or even your own lives!

132
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,150
Just to prove you are a Mu Xi person, right?

133
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,080
Lunatics!

134
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:11,140
You'll never understand that

135
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,210
there are many such people in this world

136
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:23,400
who value their nation more than their own lives.

137
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,770
They use their lives to continue the life of this nation.

138
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:32,719
It's the reason this nation can continue to prosper and grow.

139
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:35,570
You call them lunatics.

140
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,090
But we call them

141
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,580
"heroes."

142
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,100
May Your Majesty be bathed in blessings.

143
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,530
May peace be with Mu Xi City.

144
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,830
May the world be stable.

145
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:08,700
May people have the best of health.

146
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,459
Xuan Ming. Don't die. Don't die.

147
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:16,760
You have not yet married and had children for the family line.

148
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,040
My great cause depends entirely on you!

149
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,120
Xuan Ming, I am very satisfied with your fiancée.

150
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:32,030
She is as beautiful and fierce as your mother.

151
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:39,390
But Xuan Ming, be very careful about marrying such a wife.

152
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,490
Look at me.

153
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:46,190
Although your mother has a bad temper,

154
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:49,679
she is obedient to me.

155
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,390
Do you know the reason why?

156
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:57,090
Because I have the secret of how a gentleman disciplines his wife.

157
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,640
Besides, to save you from taking detours

158
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,970
and avoid immediate losses,

159
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:08,650
I will pass on the secret to you today.

160
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,619
Listen carefully.

161
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,480
In fact, it is two sentences:

162
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:22,090
One, remember what your wife says is always right.

163
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:28,760
Two, the first sentence is always true.

164
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:49,890
You can see it to think of me when I'm really dead.

165
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,989
Look at you! How could you really stab yourself with a knife?

166
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,480
It was far from the heart. I wouldn't die.

167
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:11,210
I needed to show those ministers how much you suffered due to them.

168
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:15,889
Only this way, they will feel more guilty toward you after you save Mu Xi City.

169
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,470
Yi Yang Jun is right.

170
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:23,610
You are really insidious (sly).

171
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,410
He wouldn't say anything good about me.

172
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:31,990
He said that although you had many shortcomings,

173
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,280
you were still good on the whole.

174
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,890
If I don't want to marry him,

175
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,689
it's a good choice to marry you as the second best.

176
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:45,030
He's not praising me but himself.

177
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,510
But this time, we should thank Yi Yang Jun.

178
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:56,600
Without him, I don't know how many people would have died.

179
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,089
I didn't expect Yi Yang to have such high prestige in Tian Mu Army.

180
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:03,840
Fortunately, he went in time to dissuade (advise) Tian Mu Army.

181
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:10,270
It would be a good choice to hand over Tian Mu City to his management.

182
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,289
Indeed.

183
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:13,579
Well... Go tell him.

184
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,420
Why me?

185
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,459
You two are so close. You should go.

186
00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:24,039
It is precisely because I am close to him that you should tell him.

187
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,229
It's a great favor.

188
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:30,420
If I say it or not, my relationship with him is the same.

189
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:35,380
But if you say it, he will surely look at you with new eyes.

190
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,890
Did you say I'm insidious? You are no better.

191
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:45,830
This is called "wisdom."

192
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,139
It's wisdom for you and insidious for me, right? Isn't that a double standard?

193
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:53,269
- Will you go or not?
- Yes.

194
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:55,340
But you must promise me one thing.

195
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,449
What?

196
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:59,250
We should follow through to the end.

197
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,820
So we have to finish what we haven't done before.

198
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,450
What is it?

199
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,690
Don't you know what I mean?

200
00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:14,490
I don't know.

201
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,380
Do you really not know?

202
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,219
I truly don't understand.

203
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,770
Then let me help you recall.

204
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:26,180
Recall it. Recall it.

205
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:31,970
Did I touch your wound? I'll call the physician now.

206
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,480
No need.

207
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,660
Just let me finish the unfinished business.

208
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,470
Liu Xuan Ming.

209
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,939
- What?
- You learned to lie!

210
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:41,499
No. It really hurt.

211
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:42,779
You learned to argue with me!

212
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,809
No. It really hurt.

213
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:47,260
Don't stop.

214
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,610
Pervert!

215
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,709
- Who's a pervert?
- You!

216
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:50,730
Am I a pervert?

217
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:54,989
Who was the hooligan who patted her thigh and called me over?

218
00:16:54,989 --> 00:16:56,159
Who was the hooligan?

219
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,700
Y-You!

220
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,239
I can't accept the position of Lord of Tian Mu City.

221
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:18,640
Why?

222
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,389
Have you ever thought that while I am alive, I can keep us in peace,

223
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:26,790
but who can guarantee what my son or grandson will do?

224
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:29,259
There may be another war after that.

225
00:17:29,259 --> 00:17:33,220
There is only one way to achieve permanent peace:

226
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,749
unify the three cities into one.

227
00:17:36,749 --> 00:17:41,250
Then there will be no Tian Mu people, Xuan Yue people, or Mu Xi people.

228
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,070
They will form a brand-new,

229
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,450
invincible, powerful force to fight invading foreign enemies together.

230
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,910
Then a world of great unity,

231
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:55,160
where people prosper together, will be achieved.

232
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,439
- What about you?
- Me?

233
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,780
I am leaving.

234
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:07,800
What a pity not to look around at this wonderful world.

235
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,380
When do you plan to say goodbye to San Mei?

236
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,170
I won't.

237
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,200
My meeting with you this time

238
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,460
is a farewell.

239
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,010
Are you afraid that you will cry when you say goodbye to San Mei?

240
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,970
I'll give you a treasure.

241
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,980
[Unspeakable Things between Me and the General]

242
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,210
Are you crazy?

243
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:54,419
I am the lord of a city. How could I read this?

244
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:57,679
Don't pretend. You must be happy inside.

245
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,930
Yi Yang Jun. Don't think you know me well.

246
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:05,170
I have always hated this kind of filth.

247
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:12,209
I will keep it for you first. If you want it, return to get it from me.

248
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:22,820
I gave you two very important treasures.

249
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,970
Cherish them.

250
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,280
I am leaving.

251
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,230
"Two treasures"?

252
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,680
Isn't there only one? Where is the other one?

253
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,630
Since when did you start to doubt me?

254
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:34,720
I never believed you from the first time I saw you.

255
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,029
Did you think to play the ruse of self-injury, and I'd believe you?

256
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:42,019
Did you think when the spy sent me a false secret report, I would believe it?

257
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:45,930
"A fox is a fox, even with a hundred sheepskins."

258
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:51,180
What did you say when you saw the injury on Bai Lu's back?

259
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:57,260
I should be sympathetic to her misfortune.

260
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:04,800
Then when did you find out she was the spy of Tian Mu City?

261
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,139
Was she a spy?

262
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,689
- Didn't you know?
- Now I know.

263
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:17,169
No wonder she told you in the hall that day, saying Tian Mu City was breached.

264
00:21:17,169 --> 00:21:22,339
I thought it was due to your master-servant relationship that she sent you news of Tian Mu City.

265
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:26,519
Then why did you try so hard to exchange your signal arrow with mine?

266
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,040
- You yourself–
- That signal arrow means war.

267
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,970
I gave you the chance to save your army.

268
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:35,129
Qian Hui Rou. They are innocent.

269
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:39,780
No one is ever innocent in this world.

270
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,590
Were the people you were talking about Tian Mu Army?

271
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,830
Good and evil are in one thought.

272
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:51,450
You should be extremely cautious

273
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:54,460
when so many lives are in your hands.

274
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,459
As long as you have good thoughts,

275
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,930
you will find countless innocent people around you.

276
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,420
People are born in the world

277
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,320
and use everything here.

278
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,730
We stop rivers for our own use

279
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,420
and slaughter for our own needs.

280
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,289
How can we be innocent when we shame and harm the world?

281
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,450
Have you ever slept next to a mouse?

282
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,810
Have you ever been isolated by your family?

283
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,030
A sick little girl is innocent enough, isn't she?

284
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:46,330
Then why was she still locked up by her father?

285
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:55,120
It was he who taught me that there were no innocent people in this world.

286
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,179
It is precisely because you had so much misfortune

287
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,910
that you should understand the pain of the poor.

288
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:11,109
Misfortune should be your power to help more unfortunate people,

289
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:14,370
not an excuse to create more misfortune.

290
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:18,349
Madam Ke. Madam Ke, wait for me.

291
00:24:18,349 --> 00:24:20,999
Don't worry. I heard Miss Ke and others have entered the city.

292
00:24:20,999 --> 00:24:24,229
I don't know how much she suffered outside.

293
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,149
I have to thank Lord Ye.

294
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,309
I treated her so bad back then. But she still returns to marry.

295
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:29,869
It is said Lord Ye promotes frugality.

296
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,259
The ribbons and lanterns we used last time are still there.

297
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,489
And we don't need to buy more this time.

298
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,919
I didn't expect she could be so frugal when three cities were merged into one.

299
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:38,699
Look at you. You don't understand.

300
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:42,059
Lord Ye's economy is a virtue. One must be thrifty at all times.

301
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:43,949
Yes. You are right.

302
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:45,139
Look, it's Miss Ke.

303
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,650
Mom.

304
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,899
Baby. Baby.

305
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,939
- Mom.
- I missed you so much.

306
00:24:52,939 --> 00:24:56,029
Let me take a look. Let me see you.

307
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:01,510
You are also back.

308
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,479
Yes.

309
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,310
Have you eaten anything?

310
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,979
Not yet.

311
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,769
What do you want to eat? I'll make it for you in a minute.

312
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:10,549
Mom. I haven't had anything, either.

313
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:12,539
Why didn't you ask me?

314
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,039
Look at you. Didn't you see we were talking just now?

315
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,309
What bad manners! Step aside.

316
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,449
What do you want to eat? I'll make it for you.

317
00:25:22,449 --> 00:25:24,440
Well.

318
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,160
Couple's Delight (famous Sichuan dish).

319
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:31,999
- I can also make sweetheart pastry.
- Really?

320
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:35,049
Old Guan. What about you two get married first?

321
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,729
What are you saying? I'm so embarrassed.

322
00:25:37,729 --> 00:25:39,840
Don't talk nonsense.

00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,799
Even Jin Fu stays in Mu Xi City as General.

482
00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:51,740
Aren't you better than him?

483
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,359
San Mei never appoints by favoritism.

484
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,730
She appointed Jin Fu for her reasons.

485
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:59,129
With my skills, I can deal with petty things.

486
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:02,389
What a mess if national affairs were up to me.

487
00:39:02,389 --> 00:39:05,739
Well, it makes sense.

488
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,920
Sorry, Sir.

495
00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:56,270
Father said that he left a last resort in Mu Xi City.

496
00:39:56,270 --> 00:40:01,220
I didn't expect it to be you.

[The End]

498
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:34,070
♫ Secretly hiding, secretly thinking of you ♫

499
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:41,050
♫ Burying my feelings for you in my heart ♫

500
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:44,710
♫ The esteemed lord ♫

501
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,270
♫ Should not show vulnerability ♫

502
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:55,330
♫ Before the people so easily ♫

503
00:40:55,330 --> 00:41:02,330
♫ When you appear, when you approach ♫

504
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:09,360
♫ When someone understands that I'm not a god ♫

505
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,920
♫ Your words ♫

506
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,480
♫ Are etched in my mind ♫

507
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:22,190
♫ That tender heart of yours ♫

508
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,700
♫ I want to protect you while navigating the storm ♫

509
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,250
♫ Braving the glint and flash of cold steel ♫

510
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:36,330
♫ I want to take you to see scenery you've never seen ♫

511
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:39,900
♫ I really want to be with you forever ♫

512
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:43,360
♫ Whether we are on opposing sides or archenemies ♫

513
