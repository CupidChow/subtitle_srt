Why are you so noisy in the middle of the night?

32
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,950
Are you a woman?

33
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,200
Good vision.

34
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,469
You pervert! So lascivious.

35
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:07,890
You were castrated, yet you still dare to hit on her?

36
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:12,189
Get away from me. I have practiced Mantis Fist, Eagle Claw Fist, and Tiger Crane Fist.

He's just a thief and can't hurt me.

125

Since you have no external injuries, will there be internal injuries?

126

- Someone! Ask the imperial physician here.
- I am really fine, Brother.

Don't worry, Your Majesty.

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,510
I will find the real culprit promptly.

132

147
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:39,779
and cede Er City from Xuan Yue City as betrothal presents?

148
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,630
Er City is barren and sparsely populated.

149
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:47,560
It doesn't matter... to cede it.

150
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,949
How is it not important?

151
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:51,570
Er City is a part of Xuan Yue City.

152
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,150
It's unreasonable... to give it up so easily!

153
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,070
Then what do you think I should do?

154
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,900
Of course, it cannot be ceded.

155
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,579
Tian Mu City ruled the world back then, and never took other cities seriously.

156
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:09,530
Do you dare to express your thoughts in front of the Tian Mu City envoy?

157
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,990
Why not?

158
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:12,990
Tian Mu City is nothing.

159
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:18,189
Even if they were heroic back then, they might not be heroic forever.

160
00:12:18,189 --> 00:12:20,390
If they are still powerful now,

161
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:24,369
they wouldn't stoop to enter Xuan Yue City for marriage alliance.

162
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,470
You asked him for a favor.

163
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,790
He also asked you for a favor.

164
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,130
When the two cities communicate, we can't underestimate ourselves,

165
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,560
boosting others' morale

166
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,020
and reducing our own courage.

167
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,060
You are... indeed extraordinary.

168
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,770
I'm curious

169
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:02,130
about what's on your mind.

170
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,019
- Your...
- Yao Hu.

171
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,190
Y-Y-Your Majesty.

172
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,630
What?

173
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,310
Princess Qi Meng of Tian Mu City has entered the palace.

174
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,650
Ask someone to dress up San Mei.

175
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:32,190
Let her go with me to meet the envoy of Tian Mu City.

176
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,549
Here comes Princess Qi Meng.

177
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:41,149
I am so lucky to see the Beauty of the City in person in my lifetime.

178
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:43,359
Not only can we see Princess Qi Meng, but also Yi Yang.

179
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:46,039
- So happy.
- So happy!

180
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,180
Let's go.

181
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,120
"Princess Qi Meng"?

182
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,069
Close the door quickly.

183
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,680
Don't be discovered.

184
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,490
That's all for today.

185
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,359
What are you doing? Coming out of nowhere.

186
00:14:10,359 --> 00:14:11,429
- You scared me!
- No.

187
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:13,399
Princess Qi Meng is here. Let's take a look.

188
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:14,499
L-Let's go.

189
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,119
What does it have to do with us?

190
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,879
Dig the tunnel, kill Liu Xuan Ming tonight, and we'll run away.

191
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,339
Exactly. Why join in on the fun?

192
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,979
It doesn't hurt to take a look.

193
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,829
Princess Qi Meng is known as the Beauty of the City.

194
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,470
Don't you want to take a look?

195
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,739
We're leaving tonight.

196
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,309
Don't leave with regrets, right?

197
00:14:32,309 --> 00:14:33,579
I don't know about leaving regrets or not.

198
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,979
I'm sweating from digging tunnels.

199
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,299
- Help me carry it. You're the only one not working.
- No way.

200
00:14:37,299 --> 00:14:38,879
Zhao Jing, remember to bring it with you later.

201
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,059
- Look at you. He's never serious.
- Really.

202
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:42,719
Well. Look.

203
00:14:42,719 --> 00:14:44,290
Wait for me.

204
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,349
Baby. Have you seen my little bunny?

205
00:14:49,349 --> 00:14:51,670
Its ears are that long,

206
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,899
round eyes, short tail,

207
00:14:53,899 --> 00:14:55,359
and a little mouth,

208
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:56,599
so cute.

209
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:59,430
It ran away all of a sudden.

210
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,780
I am looking for my little bunny.

211
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,110
Little Bunny.

212
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,989
- What are you doing?
- I saw it hide inside.

213
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:08,790
Little Bunny, my little bunny, my little bunny.

214
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,030
- What are you doing?
- I'm seeking my little bunny.

215
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,159
- Let me see.
- Listen!

216
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:16,019
My brother is General Jin Fu of Mu Xi City.

217
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,030
Who?

218
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,709
"General Jin Fu"?

219
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,899
I heard Princess Qi Meng is very beautiful.

220
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:22,260
Save it (be silent).

221
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,090
Didn't this girl give me the toilet paper this morning?

222
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,609
Why not say that you are the wife of Ye Zhao Nan, the lord of Mu Xi City?

223
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,149
- I...
- You're such a hypocrite.

224
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:36,520
So hypocritical.

225
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,570
Come on, Baby.

226
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:42,369
Help!

227
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,760
Come with me.

228
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,920
Don't fear, I'm not a bad person.

229
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,939
Don't you remember?

230
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,970
You gave me toilet paper this morning.

231
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,130
Look.

232
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,750
Come with me.

233
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,299
Qi Meng.

234
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:14,499
Is she here?

235
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,330
Isn't that San Mei?

236
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,990
Yes.

237
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:25,939
Good for her.

238
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,170
She is with Liu Xuan Ming in just a few days.

239
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:34,960
I think she may have deliberately approached Liu Xuan Ming to take action easily.

240
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,920
I hope so.

241
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,580
But this girl's origin is unknown.

242
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,280
We can't take it lightly.

243
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,979
It makes sense. Just take care.

244
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,509
Sister San Mei.

245
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:51,240
I am Princess Yun Luo, Brother's most beloved sister.

246
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:57,010
You captured my brother that day in the Chamber of Baths.

247
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,480
How amazing.

248
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,430
Look.

249
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,118
Your Majesty. The envoy of Tian Mu City entered the palace.

250
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,180
Hold on.

251
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,590
You are the lord, and he is the envoy.

252
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:52,909
Even if you are eager to marry her, you can't lose dignity as the lord.

253
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,100
You represent the entire Xuan Yue City.

254
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,540
If you show weakness,

255
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:05,750
Xuan Yue people can never lift their heads before Tian Mu people in future.

256
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:21,050
The famous Yi Yang is not as handsome as my brother.

257
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,720
How could a foreign envoy ride a horse in the palace?

258
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,770
Ask him to dismount and walk.

259
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,570
If he dared ride a horse in your palace today,

260
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:40,630
he will dare kill people in your inner city tomorrow.

261
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,019
It makes sense.

262
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,430
San Mei, you are amazing.

263
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:55,729
His Majesty asked the envoy of Tian Mu City to dismount and walk.

264
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,899
I am Yi Yang, adopted son of Lord Yang Cheng from Tian Mu City.

265
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:07,810
Whoever you are, outsiders have no privileges.

266
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:11,939
When you enter my territory, keeping my laws is the foundation of diplomatic relations.

267
00:19:11,939 --> 00:19:15,820
If you violate it, we will never tolerate it.

268
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,340
Is it your turn to speak on this occasion?

269
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,219
Your Majesty.

270
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,750
She did so beyond her duty and should be severely punished.

271
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:26,929
When did the lord of Xuan Yue City become a woman?

272
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,470
Lord Liu.

273
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,960
Is this your way of hospitality?

274
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,380
Yi Yang. She is my herald (spokesperson).

275
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:39,950
What she said was what I thought.

276
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,140
If you cannot obey the laws of my city,

277
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,150
please go back.

278
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:02,810
Since Lord Liu has no intention for marriage,

279
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,550
I am leaving.

280
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,150
Let's go back to Tian Mu City.

281
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,920
Let's go.

282
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,100
It's all your fault for angering the envoy.

283
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,259
If the marriage fails, how will His Majesty deal with Mu Xi City

284
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:27,309
and fulfill his grand wish of killing Ye Zhao Nan?

285
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,810
Easy.

286
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,219
The exchange between the two cities is to get what each other needs.

287
00:20:32,219 --> 00:20:34,730
If the marriage does nothing good for Tian Mu City,

288
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,180
they wouldn't have traveled thousands of miles to marry off the princess.

289
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:42,470
So they will surely come back.

290
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,029
Your Majesty. How could she be so presumptuous?

291
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:02,519
Yi Yang Jun, why did you ruin our plan due to a momentary impulse?

292
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:06,050
If we don't play tough, how could they fear us?

293
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,609
Tian Mu City is the largest city in the world.

294
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,530
How could they miss the opportunity of marriage?

295
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,570
They will definitely stop us.

296
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,549
Your Majesty. Stop the envoy of Tian Mu City!

297
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:21,659
- Wait.
- "Wait"?

298
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:23,870
They are leaving the palace.

299
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:30,800
I bet they feel the same as you now.

300
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:35,249
Walk slowly. No worries.

301
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,870
Yi Yang Jun. We'll leave the palace soon.

302
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,040
Yi Yang Jun.

303
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,120
Stop!

304
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,559
Yi Yang Jun, dismount.

305
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,990
Your Highness.

306
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,570
Dismount!

307
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,670
Princess Qi Meng is so beautiful.

308
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,560
Look at Princess Qi Meng.

309
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,780
Look at you. What a world of difference.

310
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:19,380
Qi Meng is nothing special.

311
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,400
She is not as pretty as me.

312
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:29,709
Look at you.

313
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:32,469
Come on. I am watching Qi Meng.

314
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:36,900
Qi Meng of Tian Mu City led the envoy of Tian Mu City

315
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,750
to meet the lord of Xuan Yue City.

316
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:46,700
Greetings to Your Majesty.

317
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:54,010
Greetings to Your Majesty.

318
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:05,020
I didn't expect San Mei to be so smart and brave.

319
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,440
I really underestimated her before.

320
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:20,799
Your Majesty.

321
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,710
You did a good job today.

322
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,450
What reward do you want?

323
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,480
Can I get any reward?

324
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,220
She's really into me.

325
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,960
Brother Xuan Ming.

326
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,360
Brother Xuan Ming.

327
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:26,330
Brother Xuan Ming. I miss you so much.

328
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:33,680
Here.

329
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:37,360
Is everything settled?

330
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,070
Yes.

331
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:43,709
Brother Xuan Ming, I looked forward to meeting you,

332
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,180
daily while I was still in Tian Mu City.

333
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:50,609
I finally got my wish. I am so happy.

334
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:58,640
Qi Meng, you've grown up and become more beautiful.

335
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,880
You deserve to be the Beauty of the City.

336
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,970
Stop making fun of me.

337
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,999
Those are all the world's absurd praises, and they don't count.

338
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:14,460
In my eyes, all the world's reputations

339
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,130
are not as memorable as how

340
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:21,340
you look at me.

341
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,059
She is really awesome.

342
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:36,929
Just now at the gate, you suppressed Tian Mu City with a few words.

343
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,949
Your Highness, are you angry at me?

344
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,910
Why would I?

345
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,030
I wish I can become someone like you.

346
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:49,010
There will be ample time.

347
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,440
I still have a lot to learn.

348
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,340
I'm flattered, Your Highness.

349
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,949
Well... I will leave you alone.

350
00:27:01,949 --> 00:27:05,159
I feel a bit cold, and I'd like to add some clothes.

351
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,740
I got goosebumps all over my body.

352
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,300
Qi Meng.

353
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,560
About our marriage...

354
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,190
About our marriage,

355
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:28,230
my father has long entrusted Yi Yang to handle everything.

356
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,920
I just want to be your bride obediently.

357
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,209
How dare this temptress speak when welcoming the envoy of Tian Mu City?

358
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:50,700
And His Majesty didn't punish her.

359
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,030
Temptress!

360
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,769
Forget it. We can't afford to offend her.

361
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:05,850
I don't believe I can't deal with her!

362
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:07,510
Miss Ke.

363
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,250
Here you are.

364
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,660
San Mei.

365
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,030
San Mei. How did you become a herald for Liu Xuan Ming?

366
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:27,439
Right. We were so surprised.

367
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,640
He happens to need me.

368
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,520
And I can approach him

369
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,160
to take action.

370
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,190
As I expected.

371
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:58,559
Dad. How is everything going?

372
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,060
Not that good.

373
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,269
Don't worry. I've successfully sneaked into the Tasting Room and put poison in the wine.

374
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:08,270
Good!

375
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,270
Then tonight

376
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:13,200
is the best time for us

377
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,650
to kill Liu Xuan Ming.

378
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,109
Brother. How about the tunnel?

379
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:30,610
- Not that good.
- What?

380
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:35,239
I'm messing with you. It's done.

381
00:29:35,239 --> 00:29:39,890
By the way, one more person will leave with us tonight.

382
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,139
- Who's that?
- Who's that?

383
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:42,290
Who's that?

384
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,960
Hold on.

385
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,229
What's going on?

386
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,390
What happened?

387
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,910
No idea.

388
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:53,939
- Wait...
- This...

389
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,800
Ye Zhao Nan!

390
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:33,750
♫ Secretly hiding, secretly thinking of you ♫

391
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:40,800
♫ Burying my feelings for you in my heart ♫

392
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,410
♫ The esteemed lord ♫

393
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,000
♫ Should not show vulnerability ♫

394
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:54,930
♫ Before the people so easily ♫

395
00:30:54,930 --> 00:31:02,000
♫ When you appear, when you approach ♫

396
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,040
♫ When someone understands that I'm not a god ♫

397
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,550
♫ Your words ♫

398
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,100
♫ Are etched in my mind ♫

399
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:21,930
♫ That tender heart of yours ♫

400
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,400
♫ I want to protect you while navigating the storm ♫

401
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,000
♫ Braving the glint and flash of cold steel ♫

402
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:36,000
♫ I want to take you to see scenery you've never seen ♫

403
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,610
♫ I really want to be with you forever ♫

404
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:43,080
♫ Whether we are on opposing sides or archenemies ♫

405
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,630
♫ Only my love for you is everlasting ♫

406
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,900
♫ A deep-rooted affection ♫
