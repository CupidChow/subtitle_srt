It's very likely he will kill you to please Tian Mu City.

31
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,000
He won't.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,010
Because he thinks he is smart.

33
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:31,690
She is the enemy of Tian Mu City.

34
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,210
Yi Yang Jun, why don't you kill her by yourself, but ask me to do it instead?

35
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:39,590
Is it that you want Mu Xi City and Xuan Yue City to start a war again

36
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,470
so Tian Mu City can reap the benefits?

37
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,490
General is really smart.

38
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:49,239
It is known that General Jin Fu is a key minister of Mu Xi City.

General, do you also fancy her? She followed Liu Xuan Ming for many years.

General, be careful not to be fooled by her.

Yi Yang Jun, what are you saying?

48
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,810
Yi Yang Jun is an important official of Tian Mu City. San Mei is the envoy of Xuan Yue City.

Both of you are my distinguished guests.

What did you call my sister just now?

59
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,140
When Zhi Lan first arrived in Xuan Yue City,

60
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:12,280
I met her in the inner city and we bonded instantly.

61
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,560
She often said I looked much like her husband.

62
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,401
We became sworn sisters with Princess Yun Luo.

It's indeed Zhi Lan's handwriting.

66
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,900
You just said that you look similar to Zhi Lan's husband.

67
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,800
San Mei. Could you take off your veil?

68
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,220
Yes, I can.

69
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,790
It is common for people in the world to look alike.

70
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:12,300
When Zhi Lan saw me at that time, she had the same expression.

71
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,980
General. General.

72
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,560
General!

73
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,870
You joined Liu Xuan Ming in Xuan Yue City, and now you came to Mu Xi City to join the General.

74
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,520
General, be careful.

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,140
- Vice General Zhou.
- Yes.

79
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,999
Take them to rest first.

Vice General Zhou. Thank you.

87
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:13,330
If you have any needs, just let me know.

88
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,430
General Jin Fu. I have something to tell you.

General Jin Fu. How dare you?

93
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,160
I want to discuss with you again about San Mei.

94
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,270
But you neglect me so much.

95
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,070
Not to mention,

96
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:57,080
even our lord and Liu Xuan Ming respect me.

97
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:02,280
This is Mu Xi City, not Xuan Yue City, let alone Tian Mu City.

98
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,070
The last person who talked to me like that,

99
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,160
I cut off his head and stuffed it in his butt.

100
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,870
If you want to die,

101
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,360
I can fulfill your wish.

102
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,300
Ye Zhao Nan, for you, I'm giving it my all.

General, you are really mighty.

106
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,350
I just admire a man like you.

107
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,860
Yi Yang Jun. Are you crazy?

108
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,770
General Jin Fu.

109
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,350
General.

110
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:41,640
You have no idea.

111
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:46,059
When I was in Tian Mu City, I heard there is a brave general,

112
00:07:46,059 --> 00:07:50,130
courageous and skillful in battles in Mu Xi City.

113
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,260
I have longed for you for many years.

114
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,980
I came to Mu Xi City this time,

115
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,970
on the one hand, to solve the matter of Guan San Mei.

116
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:07,480
On the other hand, I'd like to see you in person.

117
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:15,090
You are really extraordinary.

118
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,509
Someone! Catch him.

119
00:08:19,509 --> 00:08:21,520
You crazy man.

120
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,360
Someone come and catch him!

121
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,330
Come, come, come!

122
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,130
- Come on.
- Stop!

123
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,460
- Catch him!
- Quick! Catch him!

124
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,789
Don't run.

125
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,470
Come on.

126
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,790
Catch him!

127
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,140
I didn't catch him.

128
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,200
Stop!

129
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,170
Jin Fu! Jin Fu!

130
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,150
You three, leave.

131
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,030
Get out!

132
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,670
General. We got the belt back.

133
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,540
Zhao Jing, come with me.

134
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,839
- He is...
- It's fine.

135
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,830
How did you know Guan San Mei, and how did you know Ye Zhao Nan?

136
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:50,369
Two people who look so similar were in the inner city at the same time, but no one knew?

137
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:55,439
We met Guan San Mei in the inner city and Ye Zhao Nan in the outer city.

138
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:57,600
So no one in the inner city knows.

139
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,519
Here's the thing. We were usually in the inner city and knew the supervisor.

140
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,749
Sometimes we helped the supervisor to purchase outside.

141
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:10,310
Once we went out to do some shopping.

142
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:13,910
It was about one o'clock in the afternoon.

143
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:19,620
We suddenly met a man who looked exactly like San Mei.

144
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,289
My gosh. Don't mention it. It spooked us quite a bit then.

145
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:28,319
Before we only heard of people and things looking similar in the world.

146
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,870
But we had not seen it with our own eyes. We gained experience.

147
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,810
They look so much alike, almost identical.

148
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,419
At that time, he claimed to be Master Ye.

149
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,210
We didn't know until later that he was Ye Zhao Nan.

150
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,509
It should be three o'clock in the afternoon. We met Master Ye at that time.

151
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:48,959
He seemed injured and was buying medicine at the store.

152
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,309
We found he looked too much like our San Mei.

153
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:54,929
So I chatted with him.

154
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:58,859
Only after this talk, we knew Master Ye was also from Mu Xi City.

155
00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:02,500
We thought he was our fellow countryman.

156
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,330
As the old saying goes, "Fellows are always excited when they meet."

157
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:10,229
We told San Mei about it when we went back.

158
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,069
We thought at first he was her twin brother or something.

159
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,939
But San Mei said she has no brothers.

160
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,979
Maybe there is such a coincidence in the world.

161
00:14:17,979 --> 00:14:20,479
We visited him each time we went shopping.

162
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,270
Until he learned from us that we work for the general.

163
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:28,659
So he wrote a letter and asked us to deliver it to you.

164
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,429
We were skeptical at that time.

165
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,919
In order to dispel our concerns, he told us his real identity.

166
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,710
You know what happened afterward.

167
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,570
[Porcelain]

168
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,779
Stop! Stop!

169
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,349
- Help!
- Stop!

170
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:52,890
Stop!

171
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,010
Stop!

172
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,179
I can't stay in this house any longer.

173
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:01,660
Rebels and traitors, sooner or later, I will be implicated by them.

174
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,520
Who is she?

175
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,540
Forget it. Why should I care?

176
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,069
I asked you to stop.

177
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,729
Kick her. Kick.

178
00:15:46,729 --> 00:15:48,490
I asked you to stop.

179
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:53,680
- This... No breath.
- That's good.

180
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,699
- Why were you hitting so hard?
- I... I didn't.

181
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,510
We killed someone. Run!

182
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,340
Run!

183
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,020
Are you new here? How dare you laze on the job?

184
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,799
- Go work in the kitchen.
- It hurts.

185
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,789
- Listen, General Jin Fu...
- Who are you?

186
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,800
Let go of me.

187
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,969
General Jin Fu will entertain noble guests tonight. Quit acting. Let's go!

188
00:16:16,969 --> 00:16:18,710
Let go of me!

189
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,089
How dare you be idle for such a grand event? Work!

190
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,739
What are you standing here for? Get to work!

191
00:16:26,739 --> 00:16:28,730
But I can't do anything.

192
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,820
You are so stupid.

193
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,310
Let me teach you. Just do this here and there.

194
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:36,489
Just carry it there. Understood?

195
00:16:36,489 --> 00:16:38,160
- So stupid.
- What?

196
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,619
- Come here, teach her.
- Okay.

197
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:42,649
Ma'am. Ma'am.

198
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:46,699
Who you calling Ma'am? I am not married yet.

199
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,910
- Young Lady. May I ask something?
- Say it.

200
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,679
Please have mercy, Young Lady; let me go. How much do you want?

201
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,500
I have money. I can give it all to you.

202
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,490
- You have money?
- Yes.

203
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,549
I do.

204
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,909
Look how poor you are! Get to work!

205
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:07,560
Keep an eye on her. Hurry up!

206
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,170
Hurry and work.

207
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:28,088
Wrong, wrong. It's over that way. How stupid are you?

208
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:31,320
Why are new servants in General's Manor all so stupid?

209
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:35,729
You're wrong again.

210
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,889
I asked you to put it over there. Why did you put it here?

211
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:41,689
Which side is it? I quit. I won't do anything.

212
00:17:41,689 --> 00:17:44,530
- Are you doing it or not?
- I won't do anything.

213
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:46,519
- Are you doing it or not?
- What?

214
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:49,189
I don't believe you dare to hit me.

215
00:17:49,189 --> 00:17:52,850
I... Don't I dare to hit you?

216
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,820
You are so unruly.

217
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,079
I was in the kitchen twenty years. How dare you challenge me?

218
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,779
Ma'am. Stop it.

219
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,630
Waiter.

220
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,949
- Sirs. What do you want?
- Some donkey meat.

221
00:18:16,949 --> 00:18:19,679
Got it. Please hold on.

222
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,139
Girls, hurry. We must rush to General's Manor tomorrow.

223
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:26,999
If we delay the general's affairs, we can't afford the consequences.

224
00:18:26,999 --> 00:18:30,139
Chief. We are going to the toilet.

225
00:18:30,139 --> 00:18:32,529
Lazy People, go.

226
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,650
Girls.

227
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:47,790
This... We give up this place to you.

228
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,740
- We are leaving.
- No. Girls.

229
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,540
I want to ask you something.

230
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:57,460
Are you going to the mansion of General Jin Fu?

231
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,429
Yes. General will host a banquet for the Xuan Yue envoy

232
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:03,680
and Yi Yang Jun of Tian Mu.

233
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,520
We will dance to entertain. Let's go.

234
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,390
Why do you keep grabbing us? We hurry to go to the toilet.

235
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,819
Yes. What are you doing? We're letting you have this place.

236
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,319
- Let's go.
- Wait. Girls.

237
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,890
I wonder if you want to make some money?

238
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,979
We hurry to go to the toilet. Let's talk later.

239
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,060
We can hold on.

240
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:54,190
Your Majesty, you are a born beauty. You look even more beautiful in this dress.

241
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,760
But do we have to dress like this?

242
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,030
Why don't we say we are messengers from Xuan Yue City,

243
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:02,860
then visit San Mei in the General's manor openly?

244
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,480
I...

245
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,040
I want to surprise her.

246
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,170
Will we be discovered like this?

247
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:13,040
After they leave in a while, we'll sneak in with them.

248
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:18,450
But I'm not feeling well.

249
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,740
Aren't you feeling well?

250
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,810
If you're not well, return to Xuan Yue City.

251
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:30,189
I'm feeling well suddenly, very well.

252
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,700
Thank you, Madam Zhao.

253
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:59,779
You are welcome. If you have any needs, just tell me.

254
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,280
Yi Yang Jun.

255
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,680
What are you doing?

256
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,619
I dare not go through the main entrance, lest people of General's Manor see me.

257
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,920
How long have you been inside?

258
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,960
It's been a while.

259
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,450
It's...

260
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,900
Did you see something?

261
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,050
What should be seen and shouldn't, anyway, I just... Well...

262
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,900
- I...
- Just jesting.

263
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,999
I didn't see anything.

264
00:22:04,999 --> 00:22:06,740
Let me tell you something serious.

265
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:11,510
General Jin Fu interrogated Zhao Jing and the others as you expected.

266
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,110
How did they respond?

267
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:18,280
When you interrogated Zhao Jing and the others just now, I found their loopholes.

268
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,510
They said the time when they met Ye Zhao Nan differently. Old Guan said it was one in the afternoon.

269
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,220
It was about one o'clock in the afternoon.

270
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,730
Feng Lei said it was three o'clock in the afternoon.

271
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,149
It should be three o'clock in the afternoon. We met Master Ye at that time.

272
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:36,270
They all deliberately said the wrong time by your arrangement.

273
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:48,300
The difference proves they didn't seek unity in matching their statements.

274
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,850
It was long ago. A problem is if they say the same thing.

275
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:55,920
It's just Yi Yang Jun's actions...

276
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:01,130
Is it as Yi Yang Jun said that he admired you a long time?

277
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:06,770
Then why did he act so calm when he entered here just now?

278
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:12,260
Maybe you were in the mourning hall just now; such behavior is undignified.

279
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,930
Is it dignified in the hallway?

280
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:18,040
Maybe... it's exciting.

281
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,009
Forget it.

282
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:25,480
Right now, finding the identity of Guan San Mei is most important.

283
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,010
Madam Zhao took a good look at her while she was taking a bath.

284
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,080
She is absolutely a woman.

285
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:40,240
Just to be sure, let's do one more thing.

286
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:46,460
[Room of Elegance]

287
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,210
Envoy Guan, some of your old friends want to see you.

288
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,170
"Old friends"?

289
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:57,730
- Why did they ask us here?
- Who knows?

290
00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:00,580
Just wait and see. Don't worry.

291
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,980
- San Mei. San Mei. San Mei.
- San Mei. San Mei.
- It's us.

292
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,790
You are...

293
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:08,900
You are... are... that...

294
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,350
Zhao Jing. Feng Lei.

295
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,520
Right, right!

296
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,860
Old Guan!

297
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,240
She remembers you!

298
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,460
San Mei. Long time no see. I didn't expect you to become an envoy.

299
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:24,989
- Exactly.
- Your clothes changed, and I almost didn't recognize you.

300
00:24:24,989 --> 00:24:28,719
Look at you. Why didn't you tell me when you left Xuan Yue City?

301
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:33,110
I asked around for news of you. But those palace people didn't know where you went.

302
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,800
We left in a hurry. San Mei, don't blame us.

303
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,380
San Mei? Be careful what you call her.

304
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,130
- You should call her Envoy Guan.
- What are you looking at? Quickly, get to work.

305
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,320
No. We should call San Mei, the wife of the lord.

306
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,560
- Right, right.
- Right.

307
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:52,320
When we were in the palace, we took care of each other, with no lowliness or nobility.

308
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,140
Just call me San Mei.

309
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,670
San Mei keeps old friendships in mind.

310
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,950
So rare.

311
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:04,170
By the way, why are you here?

312
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,130
- We...
- We...

313
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,640
- Well, we...
- We... we...

314
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,820
- We are actually Mu Xi people.
- What?

315
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,829
- Right, right.
- Right. Mu Xi people.

316
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:13,250
Right, Mu Xi people.

317
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,530
We left Xuan Yue City to make a living here.

318
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,859
- Right?
- Well.

319
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:18,490
We got a job at General's Manor.

320
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:21,930
Work at General's Manor should be easier than in the palace.

321
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:26,530
Later, I will ask General Jin Fu to give you an easy job

322
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,440
and a monthly pay increase.

323
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,540
- Great!
- That's so great.

[Bamboo Pavilion]

325
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,850
General, is anything wrong?

326
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,320
Their speech and behavior are quite natural.

327
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,280
When San Mei asked those three why they are here,

328
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:52,500
they panicked, then made an ambiguous statement that they got a job here.

329
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:58,950
It is clear these three people are not good at lying.

330
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,760
Once they lie, they will instantly show their slips.

331
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,760
General, you are right.

332
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,890
The most beneficial thing is when Envoy Guan was taking a bath,

333
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:12,920
Madam Zhao confirmed that she's a woman. Now you should be relieved.

334
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,040
Do one last thing.

335
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:20,530
After this matter is done, I will know her identity immediately.

336
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,689
Vice General Zhou. Where are you taking me?

337
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:28,719
Don't worry. You'll know when we get there.

338
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,640
What to do? What to do?

340
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,280
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

341
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:55,100
- Why are you here so late?
- Girls, hurry!

342
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:02,020
Please.

343
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,210
General.

344
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:13,920
San Mei.

345
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,700
Didn't someone say you look like Ye Zhao Nan?

346
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:27,110
Today I will let you meet Ye Zhao Nan.
