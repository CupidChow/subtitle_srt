San Mei.

33
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:36,760
Didn't someone say you look like Ye Zhao Nan?

34
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,600
Today, I will let you meet Ye Zhao Nan.

35
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,430
General, you must be joking.

36
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,599
How could Ye Zhao Nan, Lord of the city, be in that coffin?

37
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,850
It is not a joke.

38
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,359
If you open it, you will know.

39
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:06,480
I just got here, and you are asking me to look at a body.

40
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,350
Isn't that unlucky?

41
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,500
San Mei, you are so superstitious. The saying goes, "Seeing a coffin will make you rich."

42
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,130
It is good to see the coffin.

00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,540
Open the lid yourself.

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:26,640
General,

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,200
if it is true, as you said, that there is a body inside,

46
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,750
then as a woman,

47
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,200
I dare not open it.

48
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,940
You even dared to kill Princess Qi Meng; how can you be such a weak woman?

49
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,100
Since you don't want to open it, I shall do it for you.

50
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:52,670
Today, I will let you meet Ye Zhao Nan who looks just like you.

51

It turns out that General really killed the lord.

52
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,350
You not only killed Lord,

53
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:03,740
but also put his body in this mansion.

54
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,170

General, what are you saying?

58
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,750
I have long wanted to meet Ye Zhao Nan.

59
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,110
I heard Mu Xi City became quite prosperous under Ye Zhao Nan's rule.

60
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,730
He especially claimed equality between men and women,

61
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,950
and advocated equal access to employment for both.

62
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,730
So he was deeply loved and esteemed.

63
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,220
Since I can't see him alive, I should at least see his corpse.

64
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,608
General, open this coffin and let me look.

65
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,340
Yi Yang Jun, you must be joking.

66

How could Ye Zhao Nan, Lord of the city, be in this coffin?

67
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,760
I just heard it clearly outside the door.

68
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,849
You said Ye Zhao Nan was in this coffin.

69
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,080
Are you trying to stir up trouble?

70
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,420
Or is it....

71
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,330
that you want to confirm the fact that

72
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,430
the general killed the lord

73
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,280
and then spread rumors

74
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,770
to cause chaos in Mu Xi City,

75
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,159
letting officials and people fight against the general

76
00:05:30,159 --> 00:05:33,560
so Tian Mu City could take advantage of it?

77
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,590
Your plan to seize Xuan Yue City failed; now you will target Mu Xi City.

You never give up on destroying other cities.

There is no use discussing it. I will meet Ye Zhao Nan today!

81
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,870
General, will you allow Yi Yang to be so presumptuous?

82
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:53,670
The general isn't even saying anything; why are you meddlesome?

83
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:56,979
Since the general allowed it, Yi Yang, please open the coffin.

84
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:59,370
- All right then.
- Open it!

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,020
- I am on it.
- Let's do it together.

You had better not make fun of me like Liu Xuan Ming!

As long as I am here, never think to plot against Mu Xi City!

In this coffin lies only my deceased mother.

91
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,510
San Mei is Zhi Lan's sworn sister so I brought San Mei to honor my mother.

Please return to your room and rest first.

- Vice General Zhou.
- Yes.

95
00:06:49,429 --> 00:06:53,909
Seal the coffin. Don't let others see Ye Zhao Nan's body.

96
00:06:53,909 --> 00:06:56,930
- Let Zhao Jing and the others guard the coffin day and night.
- Yes, Sir.

I almost fell for Yi Yang Jun's tricks.

98

Will Jin Fu open the coffin?

99
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,339
No, presumably he now wishes to seal up the coffin forever.

100
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:13,590
The coffin will always be a threat.

101
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,540
I need to find a way to burn it.

102
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:23,510
Burning it suddenly may arouse Jin Fu's suspicion.

103
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,390
The best way right now is to find a body who died around the same time.

104

With the current weather, within a few days,

105
00:07:31,579 --> 00:07:34,240
the corpse would rot beyond recognition.

106
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,320

no matter what grievances you two have, after leaving Mu Xi City,

you can settle it casually, and I won't care.

But in Mu Xi City, you should at least

make peace for my sake.

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,060
Don't hide.

163
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,540
You!

164
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,300
I am talking to you.

165
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,100
Don't hide.

166
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:35,010
No one can stand in your way.

167
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,630
Come here.

168
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,740
You.

169
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,840
Yes.

170
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:00,999
I love fair, clear ones.

171
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:03,449
And you, go.

172
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:08,060
Wait.

173
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,220
That girl,

174
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,390
come to me.

175
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,369
Come on, Girl.

176
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,870
And you.

177
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,899
Come here, this way.

178
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:21,459
Yes, I am talking to you.

179
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,190
Why are you still standing there?

180
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,780
Hurry.

181
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:32,279
He is calling you. Go.

182
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,970
Go.

183
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,229
Why were you trying to be brave? Do you dare go to the coffin home?

184
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,060
What do I do?

185
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,039
God, it would be great if a corpse fell from the sky right now.

186
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:16,980
Who is sleeping on the street at night?

187
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,320
A dead person.

188
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,620
A dead person...

189
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,980
A dead person!

190
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,490
I got what I wanted.

191
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,930
I don't have to go to the coffin home. This is help from Heaven.

192
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,370
Zhao Jing, Zhao Jing, Zhao Jing!

193
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,760
Where is he?

194
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,430
I must depend on myself.

195
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,410
Go.

196
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,160
This...

197
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,679
Where am I?

198
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,930
Why am I still at General's Palace?

199
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:10,500
I swear I will leave this place.

200
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,070
Here you go.

201
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,319
Yi Yang Jun,

202
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,950
did you take a liking to that dancer?

203
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:27,599
Such beauty is what I wish for.

204
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,889
This beauty seems to be an old friend of mine.

205
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,780
Here, let's drink.

206
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,740
Yi Yang Jun, don't go too far.

207
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,329
You came to me yourself.

208
00:15:44,329 --> 00:15:46,200
How can I waste the chance?

209
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:51,559
Besides, it is better to be with me than with General Jin Fu.

210
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,360
What a face,

211
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,800
so compact...

212
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,870
Your face is so tender.

213
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,750
By the way, Lady Envoy,

214
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,900
I also prepared something for you.

215
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,130
You three, go drink with Lady Envoy.

216
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,750
All right.

217
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,810
Lady.

218
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,949
- Have a grape.
- I can do it myself.

219
00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:41,300
Lady, have some wine.

220
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,240
Have a banana.

221
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,739
Envoy Guan, this is Mu Xi City, not Xuan Yue City.

222
00:16:50,739 --> 00:16:51,980
Just have fun.

223
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,829
That fool, Liu Xuan Ming, won't know.

224
00:16:54,829 --> 00:16:57,149
General, I don't think so.

225
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:00,299
He is well-informed.

226
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:02,160
So what?

227
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,489
If he dares to annoy you, let's work together to destroy Xuan Yue City.

228
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,059
The beauty drank too much.

229
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:18,689
Why did she drink so much before we started?

230
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,530
Come on.

231
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:27,089
It is boring to just drink.

232
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:29,910
- Let's play a game.
- Sure.

233
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:32,639
What about a poetry competition?

234
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,949
Those are out of fashion.

235
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,010
Let's play a game called, "You don't have what I do,"

236
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,500
with Vice General Zhou.

237
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,719
Each of us tells something that happened to us.

238
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:47,519
Anyone who fails to do so must drink.

239
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,799
This sounds interesting.

240
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,040
Okay,

241
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,680
let's start with me.

242
00:17:54,680 --> 00:18:00,649
I have been on the battlefield and killed hundreds of enemies. Have you?

243
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,269
I once fought with General on the battlefield.

244
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:07,639
I also have killed hundreds of enemies.

245
00:18:07,639 --> 00:18:12,660
Well, I really haven't done this.

246
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,500
Good for you.

247
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:20,410
San Mei, it is your turn.

248
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:22,080
I...

249
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,820
I once wore a wedding dress.

250
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:35,109
It would be strange if we had done that!

251
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,629
Well, I will drink.

252
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:44,050
I once bathed with a lord.

253
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:57,209
I also bathed with our lord Ye Zhao Nan once.

254
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:04,680
General, you must be conscientious when playing games.

255
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,179
Just joking, I will drink.

256
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,380
San Mei, why did you drink, too?

257
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,119
I heard Liu Xuan Ming likes to take a bath.

258
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:21,769
Have you two never bathed together?

259
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:25,780
Well, not really...

260
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,410
My turn.

261
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:34,240
My tongue can curl.

262
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,920
Take a try.

263
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,610
Drink!

264
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:56,200
This time, I will say an experience that you will never have.

265
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,400
I killed a lord.

266
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,059
General, are you joking?

267
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,639
Back then, the lord of Sunset City personally led an army to attack Mu Xi City.

268
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,499
In the end, I cut off his head myself.

269
00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:13,140
Have you ever done that?

270
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,209
No! Drink!

271
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,680
San Mei, say something special.

272
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,420
I have loved a lord deeply in my heart.

273
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,880
This is indeed an experience unique to San Mei.

274
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,620
Not necessarily,

275
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,330
I also have loved a lord deeply in my heart.

276
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,430
What is going on?

277
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:59,250
Could it be that Yi Yang Jun and Guan San Mei

278
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,450
are rivals in love?

279
00:21:03,810 --> 00:21:05,920
I see.

280
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,559
- So alike.
- The two idiots.

281
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,970
So alike.

282
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,110
I miss you so much.

283
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:53,640
♫ All my feelings left with you ♫

284
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,340
Try harder.

285
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,639
It doesn't work. Watch me.

286
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,360
♫ Rain is crying in my stead ♫

287
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,819
I can plow during the day and work as a blacksmith at night.

288
00:22:06,819 --> 00:22:09,040
I will never let you suffer.

289
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,700
If you say yes, I am willing to learn anything.

290
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:21,280
I want to wear a wedding dress once again.

291
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,970
You will.

292
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,420
Zhi Lan!

293
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:36,980
♫ Just to see you once more, to tell you this one sentence ♫

294
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:49,800
M-More wine.

295
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:54,329
- Drink with me.
- Don't ruin the plan.
- I don't need your reminder.

296
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,880
Come on.

297
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,350
More wine, fill it up.

298
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,490
But I can't stand it anymore.

299
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,970
Cheers.

300
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,880
Nice wine.

301
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,139
The fine wine makes this beauty drunk;

302
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:15,250
every twinkle and smile is charming and moving.

303
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:21,680
General, how about bestowing this burly beauty on me?

304
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,809
Except for me, you can pick anyone you want.

305
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:28,960
Okay, I want her.

306
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,589
Every minute of the night is precious.

307
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,980
I am leaving.

308
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:36,380
Have fun.

309
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,900
Let's go.

310
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,419
Baby, let's drink.

311
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:45,850
Cheers.

312
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,650
Why are you taking me out?

313
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:53,899
I did it for your own good.

314
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,119
If your identity is revealed and Jin Fu knows you're Lord of Xuan Yue City,

315
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:58,639
the result will be disastrous.

316
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,179
But three men's closeness to San Mei just now exceeded my patience limit!

317
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:03,599
San Mei has a sense of propriety.

318
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,189
She is very smart. How could she suffer?

319
00:24:06,189 --> 00:24:09,900
Don't worry. Just sleep peacefully tonight.

320
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,489
I will protect you.

321
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,490
It feels so strange.

322
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,830
Where are they?

323
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:34,030
They lazed on the job again. It's up to me.

324
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,059
- You are back.
- Come on! What are you doing, lying there?

325
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:43,959
I have no place to sleep. I am fine lying here.

326
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,659
Is anything up? Otherwise, I will sleep a while.

327
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:48,209
- Wait.
- No, you've had plenty of time lying inside.

328
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:50,729
Get up. Do me a favor.

329
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,599
Nail it tight this time. I wish he would never open it.

330
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,649
In two days, the body will be completely decomposed.

331
00:25:08,649 --> 00:25:10,940
We will be at ease then.

332
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,689
Shall we sleep by its side tonight?

333
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:17,350
Well, aren't you afraid?

334
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:19,009
How could I be afraid?

335
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:22,250
It's just a dead body.

336
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,369
You scared me!

337
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,199
Watch carefully. He is one of us.

338
00:25:28,199 --> 00:25:30,019
Okay, get up.

339
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:31,330
It's okay.

340
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:33,490
Look at how cowardly you are.

341
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:51,200
Boring.

342
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,200
Cheers, San Mei.

343
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,480
General, I can't drink anymore.

344
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,380
You must practice your drinking capacity.

345
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,000
General,

346
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,620
I am leaving.

347
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,770
Here, let me help you.

348
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,280
[General's Manor]

349
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,149
Your Majesty, we have arrived at General's Manor.

350
00:26:51,149 --> 00:26:54,459
Guan San Mei is right inside. Do you want me to knock on the door?

351
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:56,320
It's fine.

352
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:03,250
I'll have fun as slowly as possible.

353
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,260
[General's Manor]

354
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,850
San Mei, you are such a poor drinker.

355
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:10,100
♫ Secretly hiding, secretly thinking of you ♫

356
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:17,200
♫ Burying my feelings for you in my heart ♫

357
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,710
♫ The esteemed lord ♫

358
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,380
♫ Should not show vulnerability ♫

359
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:31,350
♫ Before the people so easily ♫

360
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:38,300
♫ When you appear, when you approach ♫

361
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:45,410
♫ When someone understands that I'm not a god ♫

362
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:48,880
♫ Your words ♫

363
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,510
♫ Are etched in my mind ♫

364
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:58,300
♫ That tender heart of yours ♫

365
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:01,750
♫ I want to protect you while navigating the storm ♫

366
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:05,340
♫ Braving the glint and flash of cold steel ♫

367
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:12,470
♫ I want to take you to see scenery you've never seen ♫

00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:15,860
♫ I really want to be with you forever ♫
