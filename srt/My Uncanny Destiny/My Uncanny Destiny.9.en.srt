Come on. He must have been bewildered by Zhi Lan again.

As soon as he sees a woman, he forgets about business!

Yes.

73
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,240
San Mei has a good brother.

74
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:52,330
I am so envious.

I'm flattered, Princess Qi Meng.

76
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:59,319
You have many elder brothers, and they are all much better than me.

77
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:06,250
My elder brothers only think of fighting for the throne day and night.

78
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,280
They've never cared about brotherhood.

79

Only my sister, Hui Rou, treats me with sincerity.

80

I've always dreamed of having a brother like you.

If you don't mind,

82
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,610
I'd like to

83
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:32,270
call you "Brother" as San Mei does.

84
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,829
I'm flattered, Your Highness.

85
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,659
But I'm not worthy of this.

86
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,779
Brother, do you dislike me?

87
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,429
Not at all. I'm just afraid I don't deserve this.

88
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,730
I treat you sincerely,

89
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,140
and I only ask you to treat me the same way.

90
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,420
Of course, I will.

91
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,390

96
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,370
Father! Father!

97
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,690
It must have been tough on you.

98
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,790
Father, I am useless.

99
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,540
How could that be?

100
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,420
You are stronger than I thought.

101
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:10,820
It's my fault for only thinking of passing on the throne back then.

102
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:15,590
My lie ruined your happiness.

103
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,360
I'm really sorry toward you.

104
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,890
I'm really sorry.

105
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,450
Father.

106
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,170
Father!

107
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,679
If he knew I am Ye Zhao Nan, how would he react?

108
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,650
Would he still treat me like this?

109
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:01,660
Or would he kill me?

110
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:05,190
Should I tell him who I really am?

111
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,160
I seem to have told him last night that I am Ye Zhao Nan.

112
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,530
Good morning.

113

Are you okay?

115
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,800
I'm fine.

116
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:00,590
Do you remember what I told you last night?

117
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,500
In the future,

118
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,109
don't use Ye Zhao Nan to joke with me anymore.

119
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,510
Yes.

120
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,060
Whenever I hear that name,

121
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,830
I can't help but feel disgusted and angry.

122
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,560
If I catch Ye Zhao Nan,

123
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,320
he will be skinned, beaten, and torn into pieces!

124
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,710
Where is my pendant?

125
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,990
This one?

126
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,950
Is it very important to you?

127
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:45,200
My father left this to me before he... He left me this object.

128
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,600
Brother Xuan Ming.

129
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,819
Brother Xuan Ming,

130
00:12:54,819 --> 00:12:58,190
I specially made soup for you.

131
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,270
I didn't know Sister San Mei was here so I made only one.

132
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,910
Brother Xuan Ming,

133
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:08,520
take a sip.

134
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:10,520
Here.

135
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,160
I can't say who I really am yet.

136
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,250
If their marriage alliance succeeds,

137
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:22,480
the people in Mu Xi City will suffer.

138
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,210
Never mind.

139
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,190
Go ahead.

140
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:36,430
Yes. Brother Xuan Ming, take a seat.

141
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,800
Come here.

142
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,080
Let me feed you.

143
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,270
Open your mouth.

144
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:51,199
Open it wide.

145
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,669
Sister San Mei, don't get me wrong.

146
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,580
The marriage of the two cities is just a practical measure.

147
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,580
I regard Brother Xuan Ming as an elder brother.

148
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,119
Don't be angry with me.

149
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:11,669
How could I be so petty?

150
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,150
I am happy

151
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,370
to have a younger sister like you.

152
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:23,610
But there is one thing a younger sister should not do,

153
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,240
such as...

154
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,640
feeding him soup.

155
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,910
Here.

156
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,700
Brother Xuan Ming,

157
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,190
open your mouth.

158
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,269
It tastes good.

159
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:44,539
Sister Qi Meng, you cook well.

160
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,929
It's a shame you're not a cook.

161
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,560
Make some more tomorrow.

162
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,980

163
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,540
drink it.

164
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,739
Brother Xuan Ming,

165
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,290
why did you accidentally get soup on your mouth?

166
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,419
Sister, we're done.

167
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:25,700
Please clean it up.

168
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:35,430
Come on.

169
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,760
Open your mouth wide.

170
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,850
Zhi Lan.

171
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,820
San Mei.

172
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,609
No, I should call you "Big Sister."

173
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,680
Zhi Lan,

174
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,280
I'm sorry you went through all this.

175
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,959
Big Sister, what are you talking about?

176
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:39,870
I'll find how to send you out of the palace.

177
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,759
After leaving the palace, return to Mu Xi City and find someone who truly loves you.

178
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,599
Don't think of your husband anymore.

179
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,770
He doesn't love you at all.

180
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:51,460
Why do you say that?

181
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,479
I saw my husband last night.

182
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,760
He is in the city.

183
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,209
Last night? Where did you see him?

184
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,670
Right here.

185
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:05,619
He even kissed me.

186
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,839
He kissed...

187
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,630
We all drank last night.

188
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:17,409
Was it because you were drunk?

189
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,209
I was drunk.

190
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:22,580
But it felt so real; I was definitely not dreaming.

191
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:27,918
Big Sister, I tell you since I trust you.

192
00:17:27,918 --> 00:17:30,690
My husband is no ordinary person.

193
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,470
It might surprise you.

194
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,080
He's the Lord of Mu Xi City, Ye Zhao Nan.

195
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,929
Big Sister, aren't you surprised?

196
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,559
What a surprise.

197
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,650
I said it would surprise you.

198
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,329
I'm going to wait for him here.

199
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,019
Since he knows I'm here, he will surely come to get me.

200
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:12,440
I saw Princess Qi Meng taking a bath last night.

201
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,149
You have no idea.

202
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:16,359
Listen.

203
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,630
I made physical contact with Zhi Lan.

204
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,329
You are so amazing.

205
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:23,889
Enough. Stop talking nonsense.

206
00:18:23,889 --> 00:18:25,529
I did a fortune reading last night.

207
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:28,500
I got an ill omen. Something bad may happen.

208
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,520
When has your fortune-telling ever been accurate?

209
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,270
What are you saying?

210
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,919
If San Mei suspected us, she would have come to us long ago.

211
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,800
Exactly.

212
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,800
Daughter, you are back.

213
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,830
Come over.

214
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:58,180
What did you do to Zhi Lan last night?

215
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:00,259
San Mei, calm down.

216
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:01,640
Relax.

217
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,410
Last... last night, Zhi Lan was drunk and mistook me for her husband.

218
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,969
- So you took advantage of it?
- No.

219
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:12,970
At first, I thought she really liked me.

220
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,769
But when she called me "Husband," I pushed her away.

221
00:19:15,769 --> 00:19:17,419
Nothing happened.

222
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,280
You kissed her!

223
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,299
I... I am serious. I will take responsibility for her.

224
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:25,759
You are just a eunuch. How can you be responsible for her?

225
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,240
I'm actually not a eunuch.

226
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:36,209
Before we entered the palace, we bribed the Castration Department's people.

227
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,810
So I a-am still a normal man.

228
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,720
Stop.

229
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:53,570
You better be responsible toward Zhi Lan.

230
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:58,130
Otherwise, I will never let you off.

231
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,720
San Mei, don't worry.

232
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,550
I will treat her well.

233
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,180
Zhi Lan is so nice.

234
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,829
Her husband didn't cherish her

235
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:08,049
and caused her to travel all the way here to suffer such hardships.

236
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,519
Her husband should have already been murdered, beheaded, disemboweled,

237
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:15,910
and dead without a whole body.

238
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,630
I don't think there's a need to go to that extent.

239
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,549
I want to marry Liu Xuan Ming immediately, the sooner the better!

240
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:32,020
I cannot wait anymore!

241
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,620
As you wish.

242
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,590
An urgent secret letter came from Tian Mu City.

243
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,290
Is Father seriously ill?

244
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,979
If anything happens to my adoptive father,

245
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,479
I fear your brothers will start a fight for the throne with no time for our plan.

246
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:57,179
What does my sister think?

247
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,459
Princess Hui Rou agrees with me.

248
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,020
We hope you can marry him promptly.

249
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,510
I'd love to.

250
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:07,400
But Liu Xuan Ming keeps delaying.

251
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:11,320
It's Guan San Mei who's placing obstacles in the way. I must get rid of her.

252
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,210
Don't create more trouble.

253
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,620
Princess Hui Rou and I have devised a solution.

254
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,840
Within a day, Liu Xuan Ming will be eager to marry you.

255
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,880
But before that, you can't touch San Mei.

256
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:31,460
If anything happens to her, I won't let you go.

257
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,490
Do you like her?

258
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,000
It seems Yi Yang Jun really likes her.

259
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,840
I'll definitely kill Guan San Mei!

260
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,130
Urgent report!

261
00:22:04,709 --> 00:22:05,920
My Lord,
[Tian Mu sent an envoy to Mu Xi to discuss Qi Meng marrying Ye Zhao Nan.]

262
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,159
did anything happen in Mu Xi City?
[Tian Mu sent an envoy to Mu Xi to discuss Qi Meng marrying Ye Zhao Nan.]

263
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,359
Tian Mu sent an envoy to Mu Xi to discuss a marriage alliance.

264
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:20,160
They want to marry Qi Meng to Ye Zhao Nan.

265
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,830
Ye Zhao Nan won't marry her.

266
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,039
You are not Ye Zhao Nan; how can you know his thoughts?

267
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,260
Of course, I know his...

268
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:33,880
his...

269
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,640
All right.

270
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,960
All in all, we can't take that risk.

271
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,150
Tian Mu City has a strong military force.

272
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:48,679
To use the forces of Tian Mu City to annihilate Mu Xi City, I had to agree to many conditions.

273
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,670
They can't join forces now.

274
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:55,490
Otherwise, the people of Xuan Yue will suffer.

275
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,660
So...

276
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:03,690
are you going to marry Qi Meng?

277
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,709
Were you afraid I would be sad

278
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:11,219
so you took me to your father's memorial tablet to reassure me?

279
00:23:11,219 --> 00:23:12,509
[Memorial Tablets of Liu Family's Ancestors]

280
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:14,380
Father,
[Memorial Tablets of Liu Family's Ancestors]

281
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,520
this is San Mei.

282
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,530
She is someone very important to me.

283
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,300
It seems you don't need me to reassure you.

284
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:49,840
Do you think it is possible this news was released by Tian Mu City itself?

285
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,139
Maybe they are trying to hasten the marriage alliance between Xuan Yue and Tian Mu.

286
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,649
You'll know if they have ulterior motives or not with just one test.

287
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,150
Qi Meng,
[Virtue and Preservation]

288
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:07,850
I've decided to marry you later this month.
[Virtue and Preservation]

289
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,840
Really?

290
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,280
I am so happy.

291
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,620
But... I have one condition.

292
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,869
Is it about ceding the city and gold?

293
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:26,189
I already wrote to my father that

294
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:31,179
I really like you and hope he doesn't mind it.

295
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,939
- My father has agreed.
- I don't mean this.

296
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:37,009
You can make a very unreasonable request.

297
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:42,299
If they agree, it will prove they came this time with ulterior motives.

298
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,860
I've actually thought of one,

299
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:50,990
and it's something I've always wanted to do.

300
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,109
What is it?

301
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:59,610
On our wedding day, I will marry San Mei as well.

302
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,690
We three will get married together.

303
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:11,890
As long as you are happy, I am willing to do anything.

304
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,240
You even agreed to this condition,

305
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,810
which is enough to prove that

306
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,770
you are really considerate.

307
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,740
[Watch the Sea and Listen to the Waves]

308
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,969
We're an official couple who completed the marriage ceremony.

309
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,590
Why have you been avoiding me?

310
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,949
We're just a couple in name.

311
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,590
Today, shall we become a real couple?

312
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:50,159
Did I do something wrong that you keep me away?

313
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,889
You didn't do anything wrong.

314
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,700
I'm the one at fault.

315
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,200
You won't be happy being with me.

316
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,330
My Lord.

317
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,980
- My Lord.
- Stop there!

318
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,259
My Lord, I've been looking for you so hard.

319
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:16,929
- Why are you here?
- Stay away from me!

320
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,780
Zhi Lan loves her husband deeply.

321
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,190
I'm afraid she won't accept me.

322
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:29,900
Her husband abandoned her and doesn't love her at all.

323
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,780
I will persuade her to recognize her husband's true colors.

324
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,990
Jin Zhi Lan, listen carefully.

325
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:39,550
I never liked you.

326
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,659
The marriage between us was ordered by my father.

327
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:45,100
I was forced to marry you.

328
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:49,210
You don't need to abide by a bonded marriage,

329
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:53,900
and you don't need to like someone who doesn't deserve your love.

330
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:58,801
So from now on, we are no longer a couple.

331
00:26:58,801 --> 00:27:01,999
Go find your own happiness.

332
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,160
My Lord...

333
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,390
Ye Zhao Nan, I've finally found you!

334
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:08,520
♫ Secretly hiding, secretly thinking of you ♫

335
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:15,550
♫ Burying my feelings for you in my heart ♫

336
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:19,100
♫ The esteemed lord ♫

337
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,700
♫ Should not show vulnerability ♫

338
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:29,730
♫ Before the people so easily ♫

339
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:36,710
♫ When you appear, when you approach ♫

340
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:43,800
♫ When someone understands that I'm not a god ♫

341
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,290
♫ Your words ♫

342
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,880
♫ Are etched in my mind ♫

343
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:56,560
♫ That tender heart of yours ♫

344
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,130
♫ I want to protect you while navigating the storm ♫

345
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:03,710
♫ Braving the glint and flash of cold steel ♫

346
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:10,750
♫ I want to take you to see scenery you've never seen ♫

347
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,240
♫ I really want to be with you forever ♫

348
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,770
♫ Whether we are on opposing sides or archenemies ♫

349
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:21,370
♫ Only my love for you is everlasting ♫

350
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:25,460
♫ A deep-rooted affection ♫
