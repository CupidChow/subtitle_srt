00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,340
8th April, 2019

2
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,360
Sir,

3
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,560
I'm here because I ate enough super duper fast.

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,900
It's wrong.

5
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,640
That's totally wrong!

6
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,340
Aren't you the one scary...

7
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,640
because you're possessed by me?

8
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,220
I said something.

9
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,140
Let's go.

10
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,300
What's wrong?

11
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,840
I told you before...

12
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,260
we wouldn't die if there's anwald one day.

13
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,260
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:06,260
Cheng Tianshuang.

15
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,260
Did you hear what I said?

16
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,260
Uncle Xu.

17
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,260
I think my current situation

18
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,260
can't be stopped by the service anymore.

19
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,260
Tian Liang.

20
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,260
My good brother.

21
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,260
It's been two years.

22
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,260
I thought everything was over.

23
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,260
For you, I can live well.

24
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,260
But I'm really sorry.

25
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,260
I've been working so hard for so long.

26
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,260
I messed up.

27
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,260
It's like a nightmare.

28
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,260
You thought he disappeared.

29
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,260
But he accidentally

30
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,260
came to me from the secret place at any time.

31
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,260
I found that

32
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,260
I may not be able to get rid of him in this life.

33
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,260
Is there a problem?

34
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,260
I have a problem.

35
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,260
What's the problem?

36
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,260
Tell me.

37
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,260
How can I help you?

38
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,260
I saw Lin Yoning die in front of me.

39
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,260
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,260
Who did it?

41
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,720
The

42
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,260
person who killed Tian Haimeng

43
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,260
said it was an order from Anluo.

44
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,260
I'll check it when I get the news.

45
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,260
I see.

46
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,260
What's next?

47
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,260
It's okay.

48
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,260
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,260
You're always so busy.

50
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,260
What's wrong with you?

51
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,260
Are you sick?

52
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,260
I'm fine.

53
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,260
Are you having a fever?

54
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,260
Let me see.

55
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,260
You're not burning.

56
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,260
Why are you like this?

57
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,260
I feel a little uncomfortable.

58
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,260
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,260
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,260
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,260
I feel a little uncomfortable.

62
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,260
Is there something wrong with you?

63
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,260
Tell me what's wrong.

64
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,260
Don't hold back.

65
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,260
Nothing.

66
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,260
Are you afraid that I'll tell others?

67
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,260
Don't worry.

68
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:38,260
Whatever you tell me is our secret.

69
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,260
Say it.

70
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,260
If you really don't want to say it,

71
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,260
I'll stay with you for a while.

72
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,260
I'll wait for you.

73
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,260
I'll wait for you.

74
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,260
I've been having a nightmare.

75
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,260
In my dream,

76
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,260
I'm a superman who can do everything.

77
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,260
I catch bad people and beat bad people.

78
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,260
That's why

79
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,260
I put myself and others in danger.

80
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,260
How can you have such a dream?

81
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,260
Did you have one before?

82
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,260
I haven't had one for a long time.

83
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,260
It's started again recently.

84
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,260
I'm fine.

85
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,260
It's all my choice.

86
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,260
But every time I dream,

87
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,260
my friends and relatives around me

88
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,260
will be because of me.

89
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,260
Have you ever thought about

90
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,260
changing your life in your dream?

91
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,260
For example,

92
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,260
not doing those dangerous things.

93
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,260
I really did that.

94
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,260
But...

95
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,260
Did you meet

96
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,260
something dangerous recently?

97
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:17,260
Nothing.

98
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:18,260
It's just a dream.

99
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,260
It's nothing serious.

100
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,260
I was a little low-key just now.

101
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,260
I'm back to normal now.

102
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,260
It's good that you're fine.

103
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,260
But dreams are a person's subconscious.

104
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,260
You have to treat them well.

105
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,260
Don't be unhappy.

106
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,260
If you have any worries in the future,

107
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,260
just tell me.

108
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,260
It's okay.

109
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,260
Let's have dinner at home.

110
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,260
Why are you still crying?

111
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,260
Smile.

112
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,260
Look how cute you are.

113
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,260
Smile.

114
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,260
Xiao Zhuang.

115
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,260
You're back.

116
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:18,260
Yes.

117
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,260
Let's go.

118
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,260
Here.

119
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,260
Sir,

120
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,260
do you know what I said to Brother Peng

121
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,260
when you first came here?

122
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:40,260
I think you're born to talk like this.

123
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,260
Why did you ask me to come here?

124
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:44,260
People who are in the mixed world

125
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,260
are usually divided into two kinds of people.

126
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,260
The first kind of people

127
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,260
are very righteous and righteous.

128
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,260
They are often divided into two kinds of people

129
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,260
as brothers.

130
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,260
But they are easy to be fooled.

131
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,260
They are like Ah Ming.

132
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,260
There is also a kind of person

133
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:00,260
who is very flexible and smart.

134
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,260
When they encounter something,

135
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,260
they often seize the opportunity.

136
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,260
But people like this

137
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,260
are willing to share the same happiness

138
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,260
and not want to share the same difficulties.

139
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,260
They are like Olin.

140
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,260
Which kind am I?

141
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,260
You are the third kind.

142
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,260
Do you know what you like about

143
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,260
Brother Xiu?

144
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,260
He is good at playing the horse.

145
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,260
When you first joined the alliance,

146
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,260
do you know what you fooled Ah Ming into?

147
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,260
He was bitten by a snake for ten years

148
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,260
and was afraid of the police.

149
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,260
But he didn't have much time

150
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,260
to be your brother.

151
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,260
I rarely see people like you.

152
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,260
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,260
You are so smart.

154
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,260
It's useless to encounter something.

155
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,260
Come on.

156
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,260
Is this the first time

157
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,260
you have encountered something like this?

158
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,260
The second time.

159
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,260
The second time?

160
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,260
Last time,

161
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,260
you were my best brother.

162
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,260
Come on.

163
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,260
To your brother.

164
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,260
Yanshuang.

165
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,260
If you want to leave,

166
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,260
I can understand

167
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,260
what happened today.

168
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,260
But I want to tell you

169
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,260
that this world

170
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,260
is not as horrible as you think.

171
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,260
It's really rare

172
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,260
to see something like this.

173
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,260
It's normal to know each other

174
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,260
among the gangs.

175
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,260
And you are a businessman.

176
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,260
You rarely can do things

177
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,260
without saying hello

178
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,260
to each other.

179
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,260
I rarely see this.

180
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,260
Then I met him today

181
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,260
because he offended An Le.

182
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,260
Who is An Le?

183
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,260
Tian Haimen

184
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,260
is Taiwan's first gang.

185
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,260
As the second person

186
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,260
in the general security law,

187
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,260
An Le is known for

188
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,260
his ruthless ways.

189
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,260
He killed the other person

190
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,260
without saying hello.

191
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,260
I have seen this many times.

192
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,260
He is not afraid of taking revenge

193
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,260
for others.

194
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,260
Although An Le is cruel,

195
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,260
he won't do anything rash.

196
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,260
Before he does anything,

197
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,260
he will clearly let the other person know

198
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,260
the reason why he did it.

199
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,260
He can also meet

200
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,260
the reaction of other people.

201
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,260
The gang of the gangsters

202
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,260
look fierce.

203
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,260
But they are actually

204
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,260
in the middle of a misunderstanding.

205
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,260
They are nothing

206
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,260
after Aolin's death.

207
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,260
Really?

208
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,260
Do you want to revenge?

209
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,260
Who will?

210
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,260
An Le is not a gang.

211
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,260
Who will?

212
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,260
An Le rarely appears.

213
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,260
No one knows his identity.

214
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,260
Even if you go to revenge,

215
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,260
who will you find?

216
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,260
An Le is really not easy.

217
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,260
Brother Ai Qiu,

218
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,260
is there any contradiction

219
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,260
between us five gangsters?

220
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,260
Not yet.

221
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,260
I didn't see

222
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,260
that Uncle Zai

223
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,260
would cooperate with us today.

224
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,260
But I can't guess

225
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,260
what kind of cooperation it is.

226
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,260
But I always feel

227
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,260
that this kind of cooperation

228
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,260
is not very peaceful.

229
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,260
What should we do?

230
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,260
We will work together

231
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,260
when the day comes.

232
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,260
You said it, Brother Ai Qiu.

233
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,260
You have to cover me.

234
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,260
So,

235
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,260
you want to stay?

236
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,260
I didn't say I would leave.

237
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,260
Come on.

238
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,260
Brother Ai Qiu is right about you.

239
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,260
Cheers.

240
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,260
Sister, why did you drink so much?

241
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,260
Why did you give me a pillow?

242
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,260
I'll wipe your floor, okay?

243
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:03,260
Sister,

244
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,260
why don't you drink with me?

245
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,260
Why is it so fragrant?

246
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,260
Did you drink some water?

247
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,260
What are you doing?

248
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,260
What? You drank too much?

249
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,260
You can't sleep?

250
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,260
Don't tell me

251
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,260
you didn't notice it

252
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,260
even after you came in.

253
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,260
Did you do it on purpose?

254
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,260
It was a little dark just now.

255
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,260
Brother Shuang, don't explain it to me.

256
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,260
I won't believe it.

257
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,260
You didn't tell me

258
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,260
even when you saw it.

259
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,260
Why are you so fierce?

260
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,260
What is this?

261
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,260
For you.

262
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,260
I complained to you before.

263
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,260
You slept

264
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,260
and you were snoring and turning over.

265
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,260
I was worried about you.

266
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,260
But my sister said

267
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,260
you slept well in my house.

268
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,260
So I brought you the pillow today.

269
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,260
Listen,

270
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,260
you have to take good care of the pillow.

271
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,260
Don't make it dirty.

272
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,260
Wash your hair and sleep.

273
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,260
I'll treat her

274
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,260
like I treat my girlfriend.

275
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,260
Oh my god.

276
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,260
It's disgusting.

277
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,260
Can you hug me again?

278
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,260
You guys are so nice.

279
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,260
Brother Shuang,

280
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,260
just a pillow is not enough.

281
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,260
It's enough.

282
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,260
Brother Tian,

283
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,260
I heard you were in a bad mood.

284
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,260
I brought you some fruit.

285
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,260
God.

286
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,260
Have fun.

287
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,260
You guys continue.

288
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,260
I won't disturb you.

289
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,260
Brother Peng, it's a misunderstanding.

290
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,260
It's none of your business.

291
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,260
Let's continue.

292
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,260
Hello, Brother Mi.

293
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,260
It's me.

294
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,260
Are you okay?

295
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,260
Tian Haimen did it.

296
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,260
He did it.

297
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,260
I understand.

298
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,260
I'll be prepared.

299
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,260
Do you remember

300
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,260
the boy I mentioned last time?

301
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,260
He is a good guy.

302
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,260
Yes.

303
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,260
But I want to observe him again.

304
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,260
Don't worry.

305
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,260
I can still hold on.

306
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,260
I won't get in the way.

307
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,260
Take care.

308
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,260
Good night.

309
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:25,260
Brother Peng.

310
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:27,260
It's a public event.

311
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,260
Don't smoke.

312
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,260
Say it.

313
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,260
After O-Lin left,

314
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,260
I called all the brothers

315
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,260
who were dissatisfied with him.

316
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:41,260
Of course,

317
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,260
they didn't know.

318
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,260
I told them to go to the hospital.

319
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,260
I told them to go to the hospital.

320
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,260
I told them to go to the hospital.

321
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,260
I told them to go to the hospital.

322
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,260
I told them to go to the hospital.

323
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,260
Of course,

324
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,260
they didn't know.

325
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,260
O-Lin will never come back.

326
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,260
Have you ever thought

327
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,260
that if

328
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,260
I was just an assumption

329
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,260
and O-Lin was not there

330
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,260
one day,

331
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,260
you would be willing

332
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,260
to let that bastard

333
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,260
take over

334
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,260
and ride on your heads

335
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,260
like his father.

336
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,260
He has a bad temper

337
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,260
and he doesn't have the ability to be O-Lin.

338
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,260
No matter how he is willful,

339
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,260
we have to wipe his ass.

340
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,260
Or you are more willing to

341
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,260
take over your own life.

342
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,260
It's a smart thing

343
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,260
that you can trust

344
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,260
and rely on.

345
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,260
O-Lin, I...

346
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,260
What's wrong?

347
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,260
The End
