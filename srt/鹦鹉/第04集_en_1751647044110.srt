1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Garlikowoo

2
00:00:35,760 --> 00:01:00,760
Turning in Phoenix

3
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,760
Episode 10

4
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,760
I've sorted out the information you need.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,800
Brother Yun, I have an idea.

6
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,920
A businessman from the mainland

7
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,560
suddenly came to Taiwan to join the gang.

8
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,680
It's a bit strange.

9
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,600
We need to be more natural

10
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,200
and be more careful.

11
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,600
Do you have a plan?

12
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,040
Brother Yun, don't mess with me.

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,640
According to your information,

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Old Yu is used to his relationship with the gang

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,960
and is usually arrogant.

16
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,600
When I go to see him,

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,240
I just need to find some tea and change my file.

18
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,040
Then he'll think

19
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,480
I'm from the mainland and I don't have a backer.

20
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,720
He'll let the gang deal with him naturally.

21
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,600
Wait!

22
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,520
I'll go to the police station and sue you!

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,720
You're arrogant!

24
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:45,880
Go away!

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,520
Girl.

26
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,200
What?

27
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,480
Do you have cosmetics?

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,520
Yes.

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,400
Officer.

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,200
Report!

31
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,440
The report failed.

32
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,600
The average person is also arrogant.

33
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,320
I have to leave a impression

34
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,000
that I can't swallow.

35
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,960
And the witnesses

36
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,960
should come from the Five Lakes Alliance.

37
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,240
I'll cooperate with you then.

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,400
Here he is.

39
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,160
Here he is.

40
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,440
Come here.

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,160
Black Lotus Gang.

42
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,080
Brother,

43
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,160
I have a question.

44
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,000
Is there any other gang in Lin Anzhen?

45
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,640
There's also the Five Lakes Alliance.

46
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,680
I heard they've been recruiting people.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,080
Five Lakes Alliance?

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,160
Young people

49
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,680
shouldn't be so arrogant.

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
The matter is settled.

51
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,040
Then we have to make things bigger.

52
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,040
But we can't be reluctant.

53
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,240
We have to be more natural.

54
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,240
For example,

55
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,960
if you happen to meet two younger brothers of Black Lotus Gang,

56
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,120
but you don't know that they are the Crown Prince,

57
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,080
and this Lin Ping He

58
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,400
goes to the same place every afternoon.

59
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,040
Are you going to beat him up?

60
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,280
If I can't do it,

61
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,440
I have to be more tough.

62
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,960
It's not enough to just know about Black Lotus Gang.

63
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,320
The Five Lakes Alliance also has to know.

64
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,280
It's best to spread the whole of Lin Anzhen.

65
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,160
ozone

66
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,080
You said that stance is less than 30 years old.

67
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
Don't you know that?

68
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,360
Pants, yellow, shorts and white shoes?

69
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,920
An accesory frame from Black Lotus Gang.

70
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,000
On the card that says it's a bananabrain.

71
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,760
You guys are both wearing fleece pants.

72
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,600
Let go!

73
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,960
Stay down!

74
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,840
Let go!

75
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,880
I've changed recently.

76
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,440
Besides, I'm lucky.

77
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,600
Go inside, please.

78
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,200
Hurry up.

79
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,960
Please, I beg you.

80
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,400
I'll just hide and leave in a while.

81
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,960
Okay?

82
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:12,960
Please.

83
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,160
What?

84
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,920
You're a traitor.

85
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,960
Because of the accident of A'Pen and Wu,

86
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,920
the five-lake alliance is recruiting.

87
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,640
And you...

88
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,240
Just arrived at night.

89
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
The test of the five-lake alliance.

90
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,600
We're from the mainland.

91
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,800
Why are you afraid of the test?

92
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,200
Hi.

93
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,000
We met again.

94
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:41,880
God.

95
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,280
How dare you come here?

96
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,880
Don't talk like that.

97
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,920
I'm not afraid of you.

98
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,120
I'm just afraid of you.

99
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,080
I'm afraid of you.

100
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,080
I'm afraid of you.

101
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,080
I'm afraid of you.

102
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,080
I'm afraid of you.

103
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,080
I'm afraid of you.

104
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,720
Don't talk like that, okay?

105
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,720
You're so fierce.

106
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,920
You're happy to see me.

107
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,960
I wish I could teach you a lesson.

108
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,320
You're so ungrateful.

109
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,240
You'll be ugly.

110
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,280
Thank you for your hard work.

111
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,680
Let me introduce myself.

112
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,280
I'm A'Pou, the leader of the five-lake alliance.

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,560
Thank you for your traditional and ideas.

114
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,000
And for your support.

115
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,960
Why does he sound like a tour guide?

116
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,160
The business of the five-lake alliance is the tourism industry.

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,320
Relax.

118
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,800
Don't be so nervous.

119
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,960
Get to know each other.

120
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,880
Relax.

121
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,200
Relax.

122
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,320
First, please take off your clothes.

123
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,000
Take off our clothes?

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,760
Why?

125
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,560
Why?

126
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,840
Why?

127
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,760
Take off.

128
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,120
Okay.

129
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,360
Take off.

130
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,040
Take off.

131
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,920
Take off.

132
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
Take off.

133
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,800
Take off.

134
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,600
Take off.

135
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,040
Take off.

136
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,280
Continue.

137
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,000
Do I have to take off everything?

138
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,200
I think so.

139
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,880
It's not real.

140
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,120
I'm a little embarrassed.

141
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,880
I'm done.

142
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,560
Can I marry you?

143
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,160
It's you.

144
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,280
I'm a poor boy.

145
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,200
I'm so embarrassed.

146
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,160
Next, we'll have the first test.

147
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,000
It's really a tour.

148
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,040
A whole snail.

149
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,680
How do you feel?

150
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,960
The traditional and the traditional.

151
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,200
It's one of the characteristics of the five-lake alliance.

152
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Next, we'll take you to another project.

153
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,560
Is there anyone willing to try the first one?

154
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,440
You want to be the first one?

155
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,040
He wants to.

156
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,440
When did I...

157
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,680
You took off your clothes faster than you.

158
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,880
Are you not happy?

159
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,560
Give you a chance, right?

160
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,840
Come on, let's give him a round of applause.

161
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,000
Give him some encouragement.

162
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,200
Give him some encouragement.

163
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,040
Yeah.

164
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,960
You're the best.

165
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,960
Brother Dong Tian.

166
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,320
You're so generous.

167
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,680
We're friends.

168
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,880
Call me Brother Song.

169
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,080
Song.

170
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,200
What are you looking at?

171
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,000
Sit down.

172
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,720
You've been working so hard.

173
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,760
Let me do it.

174
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,760
Do you need to thank our owner in person?

175
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Sure.

176
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,760
Can you tell which one is our owner?

177
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,760
Don't just look at it.

178
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,440
Talk to them.

179
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
No need.

180
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,640
They're not.

181
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,640
They're not?

182
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
You're the one.

183
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
Thank you.

184
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:41,040
This features 해

185
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
You can't just say it.

186
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,520
You don't have any sense of humor.

187
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
You hired him, right?

188
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
How can you tell?

189
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,520
There's no way.

190
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
I'm a natural.

191
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
You must have learned it somewhere.

192
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,520
You're a student of the school.

193
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,520
I'm a student of the physical education.

194
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,520
Physical education?

195
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,520
Do you still call it that?

196
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
No, it's just a sense of intuition.

197
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
It's very simple.

198
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,520
You can lie to people by talking.

199
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,520
People won't lie to people by their actions.

200
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,520
You can tell by observing them.

201
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,520
What did you learn in school?

202
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,520
Secret.

203
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,520
Chao, I'm sorry.

204
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,520
You've been eliminated.

205
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,520
I really can't do it.

206
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,520
It's okay, Chao.

207
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,520
If you can't do it, then next time.

208
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,520
If I can't do it next time, then next time.

209
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,520
Then next time.

210
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,520
Men are going to do it.

211
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
You're not going to do it.

212
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,520
You're not going to do it.

213
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,520
You're not going to do it.

214
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,520
I'm going to do it.

215
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,520
The world is changing.

216
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,520
You've tried your best.

217
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,520
There's nothing to regret.

218
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,520
What are you talking about?

219
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,520
I told you.

220
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,520
The five-tie alliance has rules.

221
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,520
Brothers can't fight.

222
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,520
I didn't fight.

223
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,520
We're not kids.

224
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:08,520
If you don't fight each other,

225
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,520
I can't do it.

226
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,520
I can't do it.

227
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,520
Brother Xue, you mean

228
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,520
I can beat him now, right?

229
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,520
I can beat him now, right?

230
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,520
It's a good idea.

231
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,520
Brother Ming, Brother Shuang, you have to make a decision.

232
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,520
What do you mean?

233
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,520
Just pick one.

234
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,520
What's there to pick?

235
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,520
You're afraid of him, aren't you?

236
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,520
I'll tell you again.

237
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,520
Don't be afraid.

238
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,520
Be civilized.

239
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,520
Be civilized.

240
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,520
I'll do whatever you want.

241
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,520
Don't mention my mom.

242
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,520
What do you want to do?

243
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,520
Come on.

244
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,520
Do you dare to bet?

245
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,520
Who loses today?

246
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,520
Tonight, let the other party

247
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,520
get up and climb out of this door.

248
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,520
Climb!

249
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,520
You're the best fighter in the Five Lakes Alliance.

250
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,520
You're going to fight against the two kings,

251
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,520
A Ming and Black Lotus.

252
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,520
You're going to fight against the two kings, A Ming and Black Lotus.

253
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
It's time to fight.

254
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
You can't be angry if you lose.

255
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,520
You can't be angry if you lose.

256
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,520
Come on, let's fight.

257
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Pretend to pay for the game.

258
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
A Ming, face it.

259
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,520
It's expensive. Slow down.

260
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,520
I told you to fight.

261
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,520
I told you to fight.

262
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,520
I...

263
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,520
Don't be innocent.

264
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,520
Come on.

265
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,520
You're going to fight?

266
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,520
You're not going to hide?

267
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,520
I don't know how to hide.

268
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,520
You're very clever.

269
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,520
Don't come over.

270
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,520
Come on.

271
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
Don't hit me.

272
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,520
You're going to fight.

273
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
What the...

274
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,520
Do you know that?

275
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,520
Did the game end in a minute?

276
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,520
Are you sure?

277
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,520
You're shy, aren't you?

278
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,520
You're shy, aren't you?

279
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:30,520
Get down.

280
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,520
Get down.

281
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,520
I'm not kidding!

282
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
He's really a good player!

283
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
He's a good player!

284
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
He's so good!

285
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
Don't be so mean!

286
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Xiu Pai!

287
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
You can't play like this!

288
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,520
Hey!

289
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
Ah!

290
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,520
Ah!

291
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
Ah!

292
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Ah!

293
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
Ah!

294
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,520
Ah!

295
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
Ah!

296
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,520
Ah!

297
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
Ming Ge!

298
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Oh, shit!

299
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Oh, shit!

300
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
Oh, shit!

301
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
Oh, shit!

302
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:54,520
Oh, shit!

303
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,520
Oh, shit!

304
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Oh, shit!

305
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Come on!

306
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Come on!

307
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
Come on!

308
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Come on!

309
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Come on!

310
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Ming, no matter what you say,

311
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
you have to break through!

312
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
How can you deal with it?

313
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,520
I'm sorry!

314
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
You're a real man!

315
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
From now on,

316
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
I won't play hard to get!

317
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,520
I want to be like you,

318
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
a real man!

319
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
Is it fair now?

320
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,520
Sure!

321
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,520
We'll fight to the end today!

322
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,520
Is this the star-like game between men?

323
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
It didn't count before.

324
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
From now on,

325
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
let's do it again!

326
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
Okay.

327
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
You don't believe me.

328
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,520
I can understand.

329
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,520
Then come on.

330
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
No.

331
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
I believe you this time.

332
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Thank you for trusting me.

333
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
I'm very happy to fight with you.

334
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,520
Oh, my God!

335
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,520
What a touching scene!

336
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,520
The screen is getting bigger.

337
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,520
But don't get me wrong.

338
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
It's really a 100% real man's love!

339
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
But we're still rivals now.

340
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
Don't forget our bet.

341
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
You're right.

342
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,520
Don't be so serious when you're done.

343
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
Don't be so serious when you're done.

344
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,520
I'll kill you!

345
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,520
The End

346
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
The end.

347
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,520
The battle at the local meeting finally has a result.

348
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
Brother Shuang used the despicable and despicable

349
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
to win the battle.

350
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,520
He always scolds me, Master Tang.

351
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,520
Just call me Brother Ah-qiu.

352
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,520
Brother Ah-qiu.

353
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,520
I'm a little confused now.

354
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,520
I'm smart and a little clever.

355
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
It's not a skill.

356
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,520
But you can cheat on the other person over and over again.

357
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,520
It's also a kind of wisdom.

358
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
Brother Ah-qiu has a taste.

359
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,520
Who?

360
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
Lu Qing!

361
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
Brother Ah-qiu!

362
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
Brother Ah-qiu!

363
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
Come and help me!

364
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
What are you doing?

365
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
Okay, let go.

366
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,520
What the hell are you talking about?

367
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
It's stimulating.

368
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Xie Ying is still strong.

369
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Brother Ah-qiu, stop pretending.

370
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,520
Get up.

371
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,520
What?

372
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
Let me introduce you.

373
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,520
This is our financial director, Brother Peng.

374
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,520
You recognized me as soon as I came in?

375
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
No.

376
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,520
I was also shocked when you first came in.

377
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
Then I saw you holding a gun for a long time and not shooting.

378
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,520
I felt very strange.

379
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,520
Then I took off your mask and I was sure.

380
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Isn't this the big brother in my sauna room?

381
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
You're pretty smart.

382
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,520
So the sauna room is just a cushion.

383
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,520
The real test is in a dangerous situation.

384
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,520
Can you remember the previous appearance?

385
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,520
Right?

386
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,520
Brother Chuang, you're great.

387
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Yingshuang, congratulations on joining the five-man alliance.

388
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
This is joining?

389
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,520
Ah-ming, I also welcome you to join the five-man alliance.

390
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
Me?

391
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
I...

392
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
Didn't I just lose?

393
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
Win or lose is a matter of common sense.

394
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,520
You can stand up when you're in danger.

395
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,520
You deserve the five-man alliance.

396
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
Brother Ming, I agree.

397
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
Not bad.

398
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
Brother Ming, I'm going to go to the bathroom.

399
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,520
I'll be back in a minute.

400
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,520
We were opponents just now.

401
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,520
We'll be brothers in the future.

402
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,520
Be more responsible.

403
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,520
You're so stubborn.

404
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,520
I said don't be so stubborn.

405
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,520
The End
