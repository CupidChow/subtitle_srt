00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
music

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
music

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
music

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
music

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
music

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
music

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
music

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
music

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
music

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Baby, why are you so late?

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Don't you like to follow me?

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Then you can stay here all night.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
No, let me go.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'll be a good boy for you.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Let me have some fun, okay?

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Ye Sheng, I hate to be noisy.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'll take a shower first.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Wait for me.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Brother Fang, what happened?

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Lin Ping He just took office.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Black Lotus Gang invited us to their annual party.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Black Lotus Gang's annual party?

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They invited us?

26
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Will they go there in the evening?

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Of course not.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But he said Brother Ah Xiu would attend.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
And he said he would announce some important decisions.

30
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Brother Ah Xiu is in Black Lotus Gang's hands.

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Is Brother Shuang there too?

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I don't know what the situation is.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But it looks like it's definitely a red night.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Damn, we have to go too.

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's right.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So you have a good rest tonight.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll let you have a big party tomorrow.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Okay.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Bye.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Brother He, I got a reply from the O.M.O.

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
They'll be here tomorrow.

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
My dad and O.M.O. have been together for so many years.

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They have to do everything they can.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
But starting tomorrow,

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Lin En Zhen will be the only one who can help the gang.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But even if Brother Ah Xiu is in our hands,

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
O.M.O. won't just do whatever he says.

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm afraid they'll start a fight tomorrow.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Afraid of a fight?

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You're wrong.

51
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What I want is for them to start a fight.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Brother He, aren't you planning to...

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
O.M.O. died.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Their mother doesn't understand human language.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Since she doesn't understand human language,

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
we'll send them away.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Brother He,

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
you really don't have a way back.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't have a way back!

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
How did my dad die?

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
How did he survive the farewell ceremony?

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You have to be more cruel than anyone else.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Only then can you survive!

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No, it's not like that.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You let me survive because I saved you.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I saved you because you're my brother.

67
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Not because you're cruel.

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Brother He,

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'll ask you one last time.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Do you really want to find your way back?

71
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't have a choice.

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No, no, no!

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Are you scared?

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Baby,

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
you really lost your knife.

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What if you lose it?

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Then you can hide.

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
How can I hide from you?

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Didn't you say that you like everything I do?

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Like?

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You tied me up and lost my knife.

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Can't you change to a more gentle project?

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I promised Lin Ping He

84
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
that I'd give you to him tomorrow.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
How can we not be quiet?

86
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What?

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't!

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm still waiting for you to develop.

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's a pity that you don't develop.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Then let's change the way.

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Okay, let's change the way.

92
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'll cooperate.

93
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What's this?

94
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Pink is cute.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
How do you play this?

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What project is this?

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't go behind, come in front.

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
What are you doing?

99
00:06:46,000 --> 00:07:12,440
Feel his sense of

100
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
pain.

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I brought you people.

102
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Don't forget what you promised me.

103
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Gu Bo He.

104
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Lin Shao, I'm going in.

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Say hello first.

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Wait for me to finish my work.

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll treat you later.

108
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Chao.

109
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You should know what you're going to say, right?

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I know.

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm curious.

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If your friends know you're going to surrender,

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
what kind of reaction will they have?

114
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Enough.

115
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You're angry.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Don't joke about your own background.

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Be careful of your rotten hands.

118
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Baby, goodbye.

119
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You made me feel very happy yesterday.

120
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Be good.

121
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What do you mean by happy?

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You've been playing well these days.

123
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
No, no.

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Why are you squatting?

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Why aren't you sitting?

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'm thinking.

127
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Wei.

128
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Brother Lin.

129
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Where are the people from the Five Lakes Alliance?

130
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I just called them. They're almost here.

131
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Tell the guys to get ready.

132
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay.

133
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Brother, what did Jia mean?

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Nothing.

135
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I just pretended to be nice to them.

136
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I should have sold the Five Lakes Alliance.

137
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Pretend?

138
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What else?

139
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You think I would betray my brothers?

140
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
That's not what I meant.

141
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Do you have any problem with them?

142
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
What problem do I have?

143
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I told you.

144
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Jia and I had a problem.

145
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm not talking about this problem.

146
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Which one?

147
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Are you hiding something from me?

148
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Why would I hide it from you?

149
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't have a problem with that.

150
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I believe you, Brother Xiu.

151
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The most important thing now is

152
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
to find a way to get out.

153
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Brother, everything's ready.

154
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Let's go.

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Who are you?

156
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Tianhai Gate.

157
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It's a dead end.

158
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Don't be nervous.

159
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm not mean to anyone.

160
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
At least not today.

161
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The Five Lakes Alliance is here to help the Black Lotus Gang.

162
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You're just a step away from Tianhai Gate.

163
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What do you mean?

164
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Black Lotus Gang?

165
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Where is it?

166
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's it.

167
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Really?

168
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Xiu.

169
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't move!

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Sit down!

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I said sit down!

172
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What's going on?

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's right.

174
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Alright, let's go.

175
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Alright, let's go.

176
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
If the Black Lotus Gang is here, it's over.

177
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But our leader might still be inside.

178
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
If he's lucky,

179
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
he should be able to get out.

180
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Let go.

181
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Don't be so impulsive.

182
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
If you go in now,

183
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
the people inside won't know who they are.

184
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Let's go.

185
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Put the gun down.

186
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Is that right?

187
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Let's go.

188
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Let's go.

189
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Wei!

190
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Wei!

191
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Wei!

192
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He Ke!

193
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Xiu!

194
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Hurry up and go!

195
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Wei, sit down!

196
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He Ke, the outside is all blown up.

197
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Why are you watching us? Hurry and run!

198
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Sit down first!

199
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Do you hear me?!

200
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,800
Keep it.

201
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,500
No, no!

202
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,220
No, Paz!

203
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,880
No, explain please.

204
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,700
Stay where you are!

205
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,640
off

206
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:25,760
your

207
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,760
Thank you.

208
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,760
It's my honor to work with Tian Haimen.

209
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
You've been working with them for a long time.

210
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,760
To be honest,

211
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,760
it's quite tough to betray them.

212
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,760
Will you ever worry about us?

213
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,760
I'm a lawyer.

214
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,760
I work in the traffic department.

215
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,760
I wanted to establish a relationship with the military.

216
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Why didn't I work with Tian Haimen?

217
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,760
I'm sorry.

218
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
To be honest,

219
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,760
I was surprised when you contacted me.

220
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,760
I thought you killed Lin Yongning

221
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,760
for Li Wei.

222
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,760
But I didn't expect

223
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,760
you're still a businessman.

224
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,760
As long as you're a high-class painter,

225
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,760
you can quit your job.

226
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,760
Who said I can quit my job?

227
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,760
What do you mean?

228
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,760
Let go of me!

229
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,760
You've gone too far.

230
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,760
You've met a ghost.

231
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,760
I'm still grateful to you

232
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,760
for making it so easy for me.

233
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
Besides doing business,

234
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,760
I know a key secret.

235
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,760
You'll be useful in the future.

236
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,760
Jiang An?

237
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,760
Take me to Jiang Anle.

238
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,760
I'll talk to him in person.

239
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,760
When a name is buried in dust,

240
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:48,760
it still has the heartbeat calling me.

241
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,760
If the ending doesn't have a long life,

242
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,760
at least the shadow still occupies the person.
