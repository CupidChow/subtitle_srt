00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,900
theme from Orpheus

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The King of Games

3
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
How was your conversation with your dad?

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It was the same.

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He was so nice.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But it was also the first time I talked to him after I left home.

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Did he ask you to go home?

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He said, he has me in this home, and I have him in mine.

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's what we agreed on.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Why are you still so stubborn?

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But he also said, if he's not here, I should go back and he doesn't care.

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Or I should say hello to him in advance, and he'll leave the house to me.

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's good.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's better to be stubborn than to be a good son.

15
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Right?

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes.

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But I still have to thank you.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You don't have to thank me.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Your sister has already thanked me.

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Are you trying to hit on my sister?

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Am I?

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Can't I?

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's not impossible.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It depends on whether you can do it.

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I can't do it.

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's go out together tomorrow, okay?

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's not a work.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
He asked me to go.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Tomorrow?

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Tomorrow.

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But tomorrow, Brother Ah Xiu said we should go to the south side to check.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He said that the gang might have an action.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Tomorrow?

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What action?

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It must be some little damage.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Leave it to me.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'll go by myself.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'll tell you what it is when I come back.

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's you.

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Get out of here.

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
It's disgusting.

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll change it.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
If you dare to bully my sister, I won't let you go.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You're too high-minded.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
She's the one who bullied me.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
How can I bully her?

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Qi Qi.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Qi Qi.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Watch out.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Qi Qi.

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You're so beautiful today.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Thank you.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Are you free today?

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Let's go out for dinner.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Next time.

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Is that okay?

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's okay.

59
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm fine.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Do you like this style today?

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I love you.

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What are you doing?

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Say bye to your sister.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I like it.

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You should cherish it.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
She's so busy.

67
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
She doesn't have time to dress up.

68
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Hi, Qi Qi.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hi, Qi Qi.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You're so beautiful today.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's go.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Let's go.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Hi, Qi Qi.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Hi, Qi Qi.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
This guy is so ugly.

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Who is he?

77
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Look at his face.

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He's a real man.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Look.

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Take a picture.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Which one would you like?

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm fine with both.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Give me the one you don't want.

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Have this one.

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I don't want the sweet one.

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You don't want the sweet one?

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's sweet enough.

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why do you want it so sweet?

90
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What?

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You don't want it?

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't want it.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Are you happy today?

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I feel like

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I've been fooled more than once today.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What?

97
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're not mad?

98
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
No.

99
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Are you really

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Lin An Jin's girlfriend?

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What girlfriend?

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm so jealous.

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Why do they all

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
look down on me?

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This is not a big deal.

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Everyone knows each other.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
They're close.

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Not only that.

109
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That's true.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The mayor's election last time

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
was my fifth.

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You're the real one.

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Are they kidding?

114
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The third one is Bo Bo Yu.

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm still a little jealous.

116
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
If you're in the official circle,

117
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
won't you have a lot of fans?

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What?

119
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Are you scared?

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're really thinking about it.

121
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'm kidding.

122
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What's wrong?

123
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What's wrong?

124
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Nothing.

125
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Why do you look unhappy?

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I feel like I've been through too much today.

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That's not the next time.

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Really?

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
When?

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
When I'm free.

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You're free.

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If you're free, I'm free.

133
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Let's meet next time.

134
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Come over for dinner when you're free.

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay.

136
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll be here for you.

137
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay.

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Bye.

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Hello, brother.

140
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Where are you?

141
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm by the sea.

142
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Something happened to Ming.

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Ming was acting yesterday.

144
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's fake.

145
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Today.

146
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Today?

147
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
How did I lose to Cheng Cheng?

148
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Did you do it with the company?

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What the hell?

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I just ran into them.

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But it's okay.

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't tell my sister.

153
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's not about telling your sister.

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Did I ever tell you to calm down when you meet a person?

155
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Did you do it yourself?

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I didn't.

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Didn't Brother Shuang say before

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
that you must leave evidence when you do things?

159
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I was just taking pictures with my phone.

160
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And they found out.

161
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I got hit twice.

162
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You got hit twice?

163
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You got stabbed in the chest.

164
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You'll die if you go deeper.

165
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm fine.

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's just an external injury.

167
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
An external injury?

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're not that weak with this.

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm telling you.

170
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Don't think about playing basketball and throwing a basket.

171
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I still have one hand.

172
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm fine with it.

173
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's okay.

174
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Brother Shuang.

175
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
They just agreed to the fight.

176
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Now they're going to do something.

177
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What should we do?

178
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Last time they hit me in the chest.

179
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This time, A Mi got hit twice.

180
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What about next time?

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
They'll definitely get worse.

182
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We must let the Black Lotus Gang know.

183
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We are the five foxes.

184
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We follow the rules.

185
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But it's not easy to bully them.

186
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If they hurt our people,

187
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
they will be punished.

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Brother Shuang, you're the leader.

189
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'll listen to you.

190
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
These people are so loyal.

191
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
They're so stubborn.

192
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
They're going to kill A Mi like this.

193
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
This is definitely not over.

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But now that we've said it,

195
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
we can't just come.

196
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's meaningless to fight against them

197
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
for a little bit of confidence.

198
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I have an idea.

199
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm going to get a little angry.

200
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm going to get a little angry.

201
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I have an idea.

202
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The method is very simple.

203
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It can mainly vent.

204
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You said you hit him twice.

205
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But he still got hit.

206
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Or did he get hit by someone's hand?

207
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Did he get hit?

208
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I...

209
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't think so.

210
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You should.

211
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But you don't know.

212
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Leader,

213
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll deal with this first.

214
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If things were so messy back then,

215
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
it wouldn't have been a big deal.

216
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You can rest assured.

217
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Brother,

218
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
listen to me.

219
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Be careful.

220
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Leader,

221
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
don't do anything stupid.

222
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't do anything stupid.

223
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't do anything stupid.

224
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Just pretend you didn't see it.

225
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Fan,

226
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
if you have a wife

227
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
who is very beautiful,

228
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and she has a good heart,

229
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
what would you do

230
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
if you wanted to be her wife?

231
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
If it were me,

232
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I would rush over and take her.

233
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
She has a good heart.

234
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
She's a good person.

235
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Take her as your neighbor?

236
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
She'll be a burden to you.

237
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
If I can't do it,

238
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I can only threaten her with her husband.

239
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
She treats you like a bad person.

240
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
How can she be your wife?

241
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You're right.

242
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You have to let her uncle

243
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
get out of your hand first.

244
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I understand.

245
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The same goes for the five-pot.

246
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's just that today's matter,

247
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
they'll take the initiative to come to us, right?

248
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Then we can take the opportunity

249
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
to take the five-pot.

250
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The opportunity is not wrong.

251
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But not now.

252
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes.

253
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
But...

254
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
The five-pot will be in big trouble soon.

255
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It was a good time back then.

256
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
But now...

257
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Yes.

258
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I really don't know what you're planning.

259
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The new Chen Tianshuang

260
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
that the old man gave you

261
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
was taken to the sea by a car.

262
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Did you arrange it for Ah-Hou?

263
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Why didn't you tell him?

264
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I think it's such a small matter.

265
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't have to tell you.

266
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I've told you before.

267
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Don't destroy it yet.

268
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
And don't let it get to the head of the family.

269
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Right?

270
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Yes.

271
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I know I was wrong.

272
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But I did it

273
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
for the sake of the company.

274
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Ah-Huan.

275
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You know me.

276
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't have to be so strict.

277
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Do you think you can make me feel better?

278
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Yes.

279
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm getting better.

280
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
So?

281
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Are you scared?

282
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Do you think I'll help you?

283
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'll help you.

284
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll help you.

285
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Ah-Huan.

286
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Don't be so stupid.

287
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Yes.

288
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
There won't be another time.

289
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'll help you.

290
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You brought Olin to the hotpot restaurant?

291
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes.

292
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Just like the last time you met.

293
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Olin, right.

294
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You've gotten handsome again.

295
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I've booked a hotpot restaurant for you a week in advance.

296
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Don't make the atmosphere too serious.

297
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Relax.

298
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And then talk about what happened recently.

299
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Olin.

300
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I heard that

301
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
two of my new friends

302
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
had a problem.

303
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Do you know?

304
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
At this time,

305
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll add two dishes to it.

306
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's the feeling of being fake and relaxed.

307
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
But it's really rough.

308
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It makes him feel like you want to say something.

309
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
But the bottom can't be too rough.

310
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
In this case,

311
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
whether my plan can be successful,

312
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
at least you can show an attitude.

313
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Are you sure?

314
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Are you kidding?

315
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
How can I be kidding?

316
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm just pointing out the evidence.

317
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
After all, his son Lin Shao

318
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
is not an ordinary person.

319
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Hello, sir.

320
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Do you want to get a massage?

321
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What are you doing?

322
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You're off work early today.

323
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's none of your business.

324
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
All right.

325
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Don't be angry.

326
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Don't be angry?

327
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Let me ask you.

328
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Who is your boyfriend?

329
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Of course it's your boyfriend.

330
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You know that?

331
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Then why did you come to my date

332
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and ask me to come to your date?

333
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm not your boyfriend.

334
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Then why did you come to my date

335
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and ask me to come to your date?

336
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Tao Tao, we're brothers.

337
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
We grew up together.

338
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What a strange brother.

339
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You're stuck together all day.

340
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Say it.

341
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't know.

342
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
He has a problem with his personality.

343
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
If I'm not by his side, something will happen.

344
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
All right.

345
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Then you go with him.

346
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Don't look for me.

347
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So I'm not here to apologize to you.

348
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Look.

349
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What's this?

350
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The movie tickets for tonight.

351
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Come with me, okay?

352
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's open.

353
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I promise you.

354
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Even if he calls tonight,

355
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I will never answer.

356
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Okay?

357
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Wait.

358
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'll turn it off now.

359
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's off.

360
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Let's go.

361
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
What are you doing?

362
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Aren't you that guy?

363
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I've washed your bag.

364
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Why are you so afraid of me?

365
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm not afraid of you.

366
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm practicing martial arts.

367
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What's this?

368
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
A strategy for your brother.

369
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Tell your brother that

370
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
no matter where he comes from,

371
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'll wait for him.

372
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Do you hear me?

373
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm leaving.

374
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Don't talk nonsense.

375
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You're watching it so closely.

376
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Tangtang, you can watch the movie tonight.

377
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Special situation.

378
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Special situation.

379
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I promise you.

380
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Why didn't you come back?

381
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Brother He.

382
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You won't knock on the door.

383
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Brother He, look.

384
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Are you mad?

385
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You'll see.

386
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Chen Tiansuang?

387
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You met him?

388
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
He said that

389
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
no matter where you go tonight,

390
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
he'll wait for you in the same place.

391
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Chen Tiansuang?

392
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
His brother was killed.

393
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And he's single again.

394
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
He's using a cold weapon.

395
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Brother He,

396
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
are you really going?

397
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Of course not.

398
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I was so angry last time

399
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
when I didn't drown him.

400
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I thought I could handle it myself.

401
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's why I'm so angry.

402
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I thought I could handle it myself.

403
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
That's why I'm so angry.

404
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
We couldn't beat him last time.

405
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
He even tied us on the tree.

406
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You...

407
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Last time, he was attacked.

408
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I didn't notice.

409
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I was fooled twice.

410
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm ready this time.

411
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
How about we all be the one?

412
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's the rule of the world.

413
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Single.

414
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Do you understand?

415
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Stupid.

416
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You...

417
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Don't tell anyone about this.

418
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Especially my dad.

419
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But even if I don't tell him...

420
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Shut up.

421
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I've made up my mind.

422
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Revenge...

423
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
is tonight!
