I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

18
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:51,180
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

19
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,180
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

20
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:55,180
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,180
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

22
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,180
Sorry about that

23
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,180
Sorry about that

24
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,180
Sorry about that

25
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:36,180
Thanks for the help

26
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,180
Is everyone the same?

27
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,180
No

28
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,180
There are 6 bags inside

29
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,140
New clothes?

30
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,140
I'm not a thief.

31
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,140
Then why did you take my clothes?

32
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,140
You pervert!

33
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,140
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,140
There's a gang chasing me.

35
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,140
A gang?

36
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,140
I'm sweating.

37
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,140
I'm not doing it on purpose.

38
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,140
How do I know if you did it on purpose?

39
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,140
Pervert.

40
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,140
Be careful or I'll call the police.

41
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,140
Don't.

42
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,140
Don't come near me.

43
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,140
I'm not a thief.

44
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,140
I'm not a thief.

45
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,140
I'm not a thief.

46
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,140
Don't.

47
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,140
Don't come near me.

48
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,140
I'm just here for a trip.

49
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:30,140
I don't know how I got there.

50
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,140
I saw a window open and I turned around.

51
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,140
I don't know how the gang got them.

52
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,140
They chased me and ran away.

53
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,140
I'm not a bad person.

54
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,140
Can you let me hide?

55
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:44,140
You don't believe me?

56
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,140
You're from a big country.

57
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,140
Why did they chase you?

58
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,140
Come out!

59
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,140
I know you're hiding inside.

60
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,140
Please.

61
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,140
I'm begging you.

62
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,140
I'll hide and leave in a minute.

63
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,140
Please.

64
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,140
What are you doing?

65
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,140
You're a pervert.

66
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,140
You're here in broad daylight.

67
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,140
You're a pervert.

68
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,140
We're chasing people.

69
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,140
Who?

70
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,140
What do you mean?

71
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,140
A 20-year-old man in a white shirt.

72
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,140
You're just a normal guy.

73
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,140
You broke my shop.

74
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,140
You're a pervert.

75
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,140
I'm a thief.

76
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,140
What?

77
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,140
You're a pervert.

78
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,140
I'll call your parents and take a picture.

79
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,140
Let's go.

80
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,140
Don't worry.

81
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,140
They're all leaving.

82
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,140
You're amazing.

83
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,140
You scared them away.

84
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,140
I'm doing this to help them.

85
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,140
I don't usually do this.

86
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,140
Thank you.

87
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,140
I won't bother you.

88
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,140
I'll go now.

89
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,140
Why did they chase you?

90
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,140
I'm here for a trip.

91
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,140
I was on my way to ask about the gang.

92
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,140
I asked the black-lion prince.

93
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,140
He stabbed me.

94
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,140
I couldn't stand it.

95
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,140
I beat him up.

96
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,140
Then they wanted to arrest me.

97
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,140
You must be tired.

98
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,140
Have some milk.

99
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,140
Try it.

100
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,140
How is it?

101
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,140
It's good.

102
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,140
Of course.

103
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,140
Our milk is famous.

104
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,140
I drive every day.

105
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,140
I deliver the goods.

106
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,140
What's wrong?

107
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:56,140
Nothing.

108
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,140
I just thanked you.

109
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,140
I said so much.

110
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,140
I thought I didn't say it clearly.

111
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:04,140
I didn't expect you to believe me.

112
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,140
You don't look like a bad person.

113
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,140
Am I?

114
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,140
I can be a bad person.

115
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,140
I know.

116
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,140
Boys should choose their bad side.

117
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,140
I have a brother.

118
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,140
Really?

119
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,140
I'm not used to black-lion people.

120
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,140
They don't follow the rules.

121
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,140
They are not big or small.

122
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,140
They are gangsters.

123
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,140
The five-tongueed fox is much stronger.

124
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,140
You know the five-tongueed fox?

125
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,140
Why are you looking for them?

126
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,140
I offended the black-lion gang.

127
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,140
I want to find a backer.

128
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,140
You came all the way here.

129
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,140
You are a gang.

130
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,140
Do you know?

131
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,140
You go to the police.

132
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,140
You go to the police.

133
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,140
No, I can do it myself.

134
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,140
Go.

135
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,140
This is...

136
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,140
I have some milk to give you.

137
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,140
I just helped you deal with the black-lion gang.

138
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,140
You help me.

139
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,140
Why are you standing there? Get in the car.

140
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,140
Okay.

141
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,140
Stop.

142
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,140
Let's go.

143
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,140
Stop.

144
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,140
I'm sorry.

145
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,140
Are you tired?

146
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:06,140
Are you rewarded?

147
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,140
You are beautiful.

148
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,140
Let's go to the police station together.

149
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,140
Okay.

150
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,140
Wherever you go.

151
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,140
I'm the black-lion gang.

152
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,140
I'm the black-lion gang.

153
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,140
I'm the black-lion gang.

154
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,140
How long?

155
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,140
Be careful.

156
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,140
Be careful.

157
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:41,140
Hello, Mr. He.

158
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,140
Mr. He.

159
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,140
Dad.

160
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,140
You are the one who told the police to go to the police station?

161
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,140
Yes.

162
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,140
Go out.

163
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,140
Dad.

164
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,140
What if he tells the police?

165
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,140
We will be scared.

166
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,140
If he tells the police, I will beat him up.

167
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,140
I will bring him back.

168
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,140
I will beat him up.

169
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,140
Do you know how dangerous it is to be in a big situation?

170
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,140
No, Mr. He.

171
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:20,140
Everyone knows about us.

172
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,140
If we don't do something, we will be in trouble.

173
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,140
Wait a minute.

174
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,140
Let them know what you have done.

175
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,140
Did you pass by the Five Lakes Alliance?

176
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,140
How do you know?

177
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,140
I saw the map.

178
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,140
I think it's around there.

179
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,140
You are quite good.

180
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,140
I'm not good at these things.

181
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,140
What are you doing?

182
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,140
You are not going to teach me?

183
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,140
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

184
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,140
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

185
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,140
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

186
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,140
What are you doing?

187
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,140
You are bullying a young man.

188
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,140
Shut up.

189
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,140
What are you doing?

190
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,140
What are you doing?

191
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,140
Get off the car.

192
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,140
Is this him?

193
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,140
Yes, it's him.

194
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,140
I want to see the police.

195
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,140
Stop.

196
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,140
What are you doing?

197
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,140
I'm here to see you.

198
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,140
Stop.

199
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,140
Stop.

200
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,140
Stop.

201
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,140
Stop.

202
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,140
Stop.

203
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,140
Where is he?

204
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,140
Is this the police?

205
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,140
Come on, get ready.

206
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,140
Let's go.

207
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,140
Let's go.

208
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,140
Hey.

209
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:55,140
Why are you hiding at the door?

210
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,140
Are you crazy?

211
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:59,140
Get in.

212
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,140
Get in.

213
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,140
Please come in.

214
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,140
Please come in.

215
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,140
Are you trying to scare me?

216
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,140
Huh?

217
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,140
The police?

218
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,140
What police?

219
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,140
You don't know.

220
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,140
There is a police officer in the Black Liang.

221
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:25,140
He is a police officer.

222
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,140
He is a police officer.

223
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,140
You are the criminal.

224
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:31,140
I should change my clothes.

225
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,140
The men said you are the black gang.

226
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,140
You are a thief.

227
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,140
You are a thief.

228
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,140
You are a thief.

229
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,140
The whole gang is after you.

230
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,140
I want to show you my colors.

231
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,140
It's very cool.

232
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,140
Is it cool?

233
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,140
Yes, it is.

234
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,140
I want to take a photo.

235
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,140
Why are you here?

236
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,140
Why do you come?

237
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,140
You are a thief.

238
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,140
So you are here to help the Black Liang.

239
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,140
You want to help the Five Lakes Alliance?

240
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,140
My name is Ah Chiao.

241
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,140
Ah Ming, please watch me.

242
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,140
Chen Tianshuang.

243
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,140
Tianshuang.

244
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,140
Are you crazy?

245
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,140
You are a thief.

246
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,140
What are you laughing at?

247
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,140
I warn you.

248
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,140
Get out of here.

249
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:25,140
I don't welcome you.

250
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,140
When I first came here,

251
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,140
I thought it was normal.

252
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,140
But after I met you,

253
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,140
I don't want to leave.

254
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,140
Okay.

255
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,140
You should be careful.

256
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,140
You will regret it.

257
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,140
Ah Chiao.

258
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,140
Morning.

259
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,140
Tong Qi, come on.

260
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,140
Ah Chiao.

261
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,140
Tong Qi.

262
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,140
Boss.

263
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,140
Hello.

264
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:39,140
Hello, Zai Dan.

265
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,140
What's the menu?

266
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,140
Do you want to eat food?

267
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,140
Only pigeon soup.

268
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,140
Do you want it?

269
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,140
You're a good guy.

270
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,140
I'm a good guy.

271
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,140
I'm the contact in Taiwan.

272
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,140
Call me Long Guo.

273
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,140
My name is Chen Tianshuang.

274
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,140
Xu Chuze has told me about you.

275
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:20,100
But then you quit.

276
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,140
Why did you give up again?

277
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,100
I was too busy.

278
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,180
Same here.

279
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,140
When I first came to Lian'an Town,

280
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,340
I was always on the lookout.

281
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,140
I was the first to suffer the disaster,

282
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,140
and the second to suffer the punishment.

283
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,540
Mr. Xu told me

284
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,460
not to rush to investigate

285
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,660
after you came.

286
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,740
He wanted to learn from you

287
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,100
and integrate the local life.

288
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,340
For people who come from the mainland,

289
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,060
the Bureau of Criminal Investigation will be more vigilant.

290
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,660
Besides, you have to mix with gangs.

291
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,740
It's not normal to hear that.

292
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,260
Once you're suspected, it's troublesome.

293
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,620
But Mr. Xu told me

294
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,420
that you have many advantages.

295
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,140
For example, you're greedy for money and money.

296
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,860
You like to take advantage and play smart.

297
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,940
So as long as you live like you usually do,

298
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,780
and pretend to be a businessman,

299
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,980
it shouldn't be a problem.

300
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,060
Remember,

301
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,700
don't be too biased.

302
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,620
I understand.

303
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,420
Also,

304
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,300
if you're in danger...

305
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,060
I understand.

306
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,940
I'll keep an eye on you

307
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,700
and help you get rid of the time.

308
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,700
Don't tell anyone that you know me.

309
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,060
But don't worry.

310
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:10,740
Once you're in danger,

311
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,340
the organization will think of a way to save you.

312
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:13,620
I know.

313
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,500
My heart still beats fast.

314
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,580
If the ending is not long,

315
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:31,660
at least the shadow still occupies the person.
