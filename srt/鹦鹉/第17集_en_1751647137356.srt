S

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Fire!

4
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Let's go.

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Fire!

6
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Brother, we're not the target.

7
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Don't run away.

8
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Fire!

9
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't be so impulsive next time.

10
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Maybe.

11
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's okay, Brother Xiu.

12
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's okay.

13
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Okay, okay.

14
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Who was the one who shot us?

15
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Wasn't it our own people?

16
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It was the sniper.

17
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We don't have this equipment.

18
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's definitely not.

19
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't know.

20
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Was it the enemy of Tianhai Gate?

21
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I don't care.

22
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's go back.

23
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Brother, are you okay?

24
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Chen Tianshuang!

25
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll kill you!

26
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Brother, Brother He!

27
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Forget it!

28
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Brother, Brother He!

29
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Brother He!

30
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Brother He!

31
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Brother He!

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Brother He!

33
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Brother He!

34
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Brother He!

Brother He!

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Brother He!

37
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Brother He!

38
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Brother He!

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Brother He!

40
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'll kill you!

41
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Brother He!

42
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Brother He!

43
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm begging you!

44
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let Brother He go!

45
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He has nothing left!

46
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll kill you!

47
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Brother He!

48
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Brother He!

49
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Brother He!

50
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Brother He!

51
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Brother He!

52
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Brother He!

53
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Brother He!

54
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Brother He!

55
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Brother He!

56
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Brother He!

57
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Brother He!

58
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Brother He!

59
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Brother He!

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Brother He!

61
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Brother He!

62
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Brother He!

63
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Brother He!

64
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Brother He!

65
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Brother He!

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Brother He!

67
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Brother He!

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Brother He!

69
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Brother He!

70
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Brother He!

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Brother He!

72
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Brother He!

73
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Brother He!

74
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Brother He!

75
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Brother He!

76
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Brother He!

77
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Brother He!

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Brother He!

79
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Brother He!

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Brother he!

81
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Brother he!

82
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Brother he!

83
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Brother he!

84
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Brother he!

85
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Brother he!

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Brother he!

87
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Brother he!

88
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No!

89
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,380
No!

90
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,200
I don't street biscuit.

91
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,220
Brother Dosh!

92
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,540
Brother Natsuo.

93
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,540
I released him today.

94
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,540
Do you think I did the right thing?

95
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,540
He's dead.

96
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,540
His father is dead.

97
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,540
He's now the only child of our family.

98
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,540
He did the right thing.

99
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,540
An Le Han.

100
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,540
He's so cruel.

101
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:32,540
He's such a big black-faced guy.

102
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:33,540
He'll kill us if we kill him.

103
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,540
You think the police wouldn't care

104
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,540
if he's so big?

105
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,540
Accident, fire, gang fight, bomb explosion.

106
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:43,540
I guess they've thought of a reason

107
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,540
before they took action.

108
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:45,540
If there's no accident,

109
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,540
all the cameras would be turned off.

110
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,540
Then we can't find any clues.

111
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,540
There are so many people.

112
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,540
None of them survived.

113
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,540
Do you have any evidence to call the police?

114
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,540
Even if you don't want to die,

115
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,540
what about your family and friends?

116
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,540
Aren't you afraid they'll be scared?

117
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,540
But...

118
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,540
But what?

119
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,540
There must be a way to the mountain.

120
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,540
We'll find a way.

121
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,540
Today is the last day of our lives.

122
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,540
Get some rest.

123
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,540
We'll talk about it later.

124
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,540
Sorry, brother.

125
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,540
You're hurt.

126
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,540
It's just a scratch.

127
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,540
Don't worry about it.

128
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,540
But I guess my leg has been unwell lately.

129
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,540
I'm sorry for your hard work.

130
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,540
I don't like to go out.

131
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,540
I can just lie down

132
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,540
and get a good rest.

133
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,540
You've helped me a lot.

134
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,540
Come on.

135
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,540
We're just in danger.

136
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,540
Anyway, we've made it.

137
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,540
Good luck.

138
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,540
Okay.

139
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,540
If you didn't shoot,

140
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,540
my uncle would have told me.

141
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,540
You're my son.

142
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,540
You deserve it.

143
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,540
I didn't expect it to be so big.

144
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,540
What did the news say?

145
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,540
An accident.

146
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,540
An accident?

147
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,540
Just here?

148
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,540
The Military Police Department must have told you in advance.

149
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,540
Tianhai Gate and this kind of trick.

150
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,540
You're afraid of the future.

151
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,540
What should I do?

152
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,540
I haven't figured out how to fight them yet.

153
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,540
You can't do it alone.

154
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,540
It depends on whether there's a chance.

155
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,540
But there's good news.

156
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,540
Black Face Gang is gone.

157
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,540
Not only that,

158
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,540
but also this time,

159
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,540
Brother Aqiu really treats me like a brother.

160
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,540
If I mention the meeting in the future,

161
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,540
he'll definitely take me there.

162
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,540
Then we'll be one step closer to the underground traffic line.

163
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:50,540
Don't be too self-conceited.

164
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,540
Don't reveal your purpose.

165
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,540
And don't make me talk.

166
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,540
I understand.

167
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,540
What are you doing there?

168
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,540
Give me a kiss.

169
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,540
What's wrong with your butt?

170
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,540
Did you get hurt?

171
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:11,540
It's on fire.

172
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,540
It's okay.

173
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,540
It's on fire.

174
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,540
Why is it on fire all of a sudden?

175
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,540
I'm a little tired.

176
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,540
I'm going to sleep.

177
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,540
I'll sleep.

178
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,540
I'll sleep.

179
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,540
I'll sleep.

180
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,540
I'll sleep.

181
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,540
I'll sleep.

182
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,540
I'll sleep.

183
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,540
I'll sleep.

184
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,540
I'm a little tired.

185
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,540
Then why did you put the ice cream on the ice?

186
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,540
It's more comfortable this way.

187
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,540
Slow down.

188
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,540
Are you okay?

189
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,540
It's too cold.

190
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,540
It's okay.

191
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,540
You've been working hard lately, haven't you?

192
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,540
I'm okay.

193
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,540
It's dangerous, isn't it?

194
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,540
I've seen the news.

195
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:10,540
I won't tell my dad about Ami like that.

196
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:13,540
Tell him what to do.

197
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,540
What not to do.

198
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,540
I don't think that's going to work.

199
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,540
I don't think that's going to work.

200
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,540
I don't think that's going to work.

201
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,540
I don't think that's going to work.

202
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,540
Everyone's path is still their own choice.

203
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,540
But I hope you don't force yourself so much.

204
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,540
How can I?

205
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,540
I'm so good at using the wind.

206
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,540
It doesn't matter if I'm not so good at it.

207
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,540
Xie Xie.

208
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,540
What?

209
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,540
You're so nice.

210
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,540
I know.

211
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,540
I know.

212
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,540
Chen Qian Shuang.

213
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,540
Why do you have a strawberry again?

214
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,540
Where is it?

215
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,540
Let me see.

216
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,540
There's more here.

217
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,540
No, no, no.

218
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:07,540
You're so happy.

219
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,540
It's not what you think.

220
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,540
It's...

221
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,540
You dare say that it wasn't that woman who did it?

222
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,540
Yes, but...

223
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,540
But you...

224
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:17,540
Let me see.

225
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,540
Yes.

226
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,540
He tied it up.

227
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,540
What else do you have to say?

228
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,540
He tied it up with a black bag.

229
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,540
Bullshit.

230
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,540
That's how you tie a black bag.

231
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,540
You know how to tie a black bag?

232
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,540
Chen Qian Shuang.

233
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,540
You're so happy every day.

234
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,540
I thought something was wrong.

235
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,540
Qi Qi.

236
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,540
I'm innocent.

237
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,540
Chen Qian Shuang.

238
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,540
You can't do this to Lin An Zhen.

239
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,540
I'm very sad.

240
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,540
I know you just got here.

241
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,540
Your mind is on business.

242
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,540
You're just trying to get into a relationship with the gang.

243
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,540
I've been watching you all these days.

244
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,540
I've been testing you.

245
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,540
You've done a lot for the Five Reds.

246
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,540
It's all thanks to you.

247
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,540
It's gone.

248
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,540
The Five Reds can't live without their leader.

249
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,540
If...

250
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,540
If you're willing to...

251
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,540
You're a good leader.

252
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,540
You're a good brother.

253
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:39,540
If Brother Xue is gone one day...

254
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,540
I believe you can take care of my brothers.

255
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,540
You can take care of this town, right?

256
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,540
Brother Xue.

257
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,540
I can't answer you now.

258
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:58,540
After all, I came here...

259
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,540
To be a good brother.

260
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,540
I don't want to walk all the way to the dark.

261
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,540
I understand.

262
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,540
It's okay.

263
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,540
I'm kidding with you.

264
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,540
I'm not going to do it.

265
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,540
After all, we've been through life and death.

266
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,540
Right?

267
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,540
You're still here.

268
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,540
I'll be with you when you're here.

269
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,540
Just like you said.

270
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,540
The sky will fall.

271
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,540
We'll take the exam together.

272
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,540
Good.

273
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,540
I'll take it later.

274
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,540
But I have to say something first.

275
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:42,540
I'm a businessman with principles.

276
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,540
I know how much the benefits are.

277
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,540
I know what you're thinking.

278
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,540
It's just a channel.

279
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,540
The Five Red Alliance is about to start.

280
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,540
Brother Xue will take you to the alliance.

281
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,540
Really?

282
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,540
You're not going to drink today and not take the bill tomorrow, are you?

283
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,540
Don't worry.

284
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:09,540
But I'm going to take the lead.

285
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,540
I'll give you a way.

286
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,540
They don't know if they can give you business.

287
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,540
I don't have that much face.

288
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,540
That depends on yourself.

289
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,540
Brother Xue, I'm dry.

290
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,540
Tomorrow.

291
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,540
When people are here.

292
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,540
I officially announce you.

293
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,540
Is my successor.

294
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,540
No.

295
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,540
It's my successor.

296
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,540
Don't be so high-profile.

297
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,540
I'm a new person.

298
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,540
It's not appropriate.

299
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,540
Stop pretending.

300
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,540
What do you think?

301
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,540
I don't know.

302
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,540
I'm working so hard.

303
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,540
I don't care about my own business.

304
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,540
I've been born and died several times.

305
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,540
Everyone looks at you.

306
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,540
I'm convinced.

307
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,540
Then I'll just do my best.

308
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,540
Brother Xue, I'm tired.

309
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,540
Let's start.

310
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,540
The day you were last time.

311
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,540
You're really my boss.

312
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,540
Brother Xue, did you drink too much?

313
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,540
Be gentle.

314
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,540
I'll beat you to death.

315
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,540
I found you with a big tongue.

316
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,540
When did you hit me?

317
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,540
You can't do it later.

318
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,540
You keep saying that.

319
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,540
Okay.

320
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,540
Are you crazy?

321
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,540
You're angry.

322
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,540
I'm so annoyed.

323
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,540
I tell you.

324
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,540
I'm telling you.

325
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,540
You have to remember.

326
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,540
Did you hear me?

327
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,540
Remember.

328
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,540
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,540
It's okay.

330
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,540
It's okay.

331
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,540
It's okay.

332
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,540
Go.

333
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,540
Go.

334
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,540
Go.

335
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,540
It's okay.

336
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,540
Hold on.

337
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,540
Anyone there?

338
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,540
It's okay.

339
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,540
It's okay.

340
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,540
It's okay.

341
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,540
Anyone there?

342
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:36,540
Anyone there?

343
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,540
Anyone there?

344
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,540
It's okay.

345
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,540
It's okay.

346
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,540
It's okay.

347
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,540
Anyone there?

348
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:16,540
Thank you for watching.
