1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,940
First episode

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:20,800
idea

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You're finally here.

4
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,640
Ah-shen!

5
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,240
What are you doing here?

6
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,240
I was worried about you.

7
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,000
You said you'd come alone.

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
But now that he's here, what are you going to do?

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't want to be embarrassed.

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Come back with me, okay?

11
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
If you want to help the host,

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
you can sneak out in the middle of the night and come alone with him.

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If you don't tell my dad, will he know?

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We're going back.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Are you afraid I'll lose?

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I...

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Lin Shao!

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You're not coming alone.

19
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's okay.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's okay?

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Get lost!

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Brother!

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Get lost!

24
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Be careful!

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Can we start?

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Come on.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Wait!

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You're not going to take a knife and break the gun, are you?

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Am I that kind of a despicable person?

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let me see.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Take off your clothes.

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Turn around.

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Turn...

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Turn...

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Use your hand.

36
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Come on.

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Wait!

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't take a sprayer.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm that kind of person.

40
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Come on.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Take this.

42
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Is it enough?

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Okay.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Count to three.

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You count.

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
One, two,

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
three!

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Damn you!

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You're a trap!

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Didn't you say you were going to take a single shot?

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Who's going to take a single shot now?

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
A gun?

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Didn't you say a cold weapon?

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There's no gunpowder. What are you afraid of?

55
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I told you not to move.

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't move!

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Don't move!

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How could I not move?

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Didn't you say you were going to take a single shot?

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He really came to take a single shot?

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Brother Peng, am I a little too much?

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Not a little.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You're too much.

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Who knows he's so arrogant?

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't mess with him.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Damn you!

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You're so mean when you just came out.

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Damn kid.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm counting on you.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're so shameless.

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This kid didn't leave just now.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He's hiding over there.

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You're back again.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay, I'm not going to mess with you.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Go back and tell his father

76
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
that his baby is in our hands.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Is that okay?

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Go.

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Brother He, I'm leaving.

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Remember to bring a diaper.

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
He's like a big boy who's getting his muscles.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm sorry.

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Good morning.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're so annoying.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You're so annoying.

87
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You started to scold me in the morning.

88
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You're so rude.

89
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You know that?

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm so kind and I bought you breakfast.

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm sorry.

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Brother He said he wouldn't bully you.

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He won't hurt you if he wants to negotiate with you.

94
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
But recently,

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Ming and I have been taken care of by you.

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Because of your manners,

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
you have to be polite.

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Right?

99
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't think there's any today.

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You're so annoying.

101
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You're so annoying.

102
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You're so annoying.

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You're so annoying.

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I have this.

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Go, go, go.

106
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Go, go, go.

107
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'll leave this to you when I'm not here.

108
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Brother Shuang,

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
did you go too far?

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Too far?

111
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Brother, Chen Tian Shuang,

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
are you crazy?

113
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He's just a tea water.

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Why is he so angry?

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Because I...

116
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I won't tell you.

117
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Brother Shuang, you're so bad.

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I feel sorry for him.

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Why do you feel sorry for him?

120
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Do you want to taste it?

121
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Get lost. Who would do that?

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I didn't bully him anyway.

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Look at him.

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Don't let him think too much.

125
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Go play.

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Brother.

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Olin contacted me.

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What did he say?

129
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He said he'd come to the meeting.

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He's alone.

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Get ready.

132
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Yes.

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'll tell you when the warning comes.

134
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll take him home.

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You should be more careful.

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But they don't want to negotiate.

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
If you really want to fight,

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
you should fight.

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
But I'll take Ah Hu back first.

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
One o'clock.

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
If I don't come back,

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
you go to the meeting and call Ah Hu.

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You two,

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
let them fight.

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Understood.

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Brother.

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Last time the Black Lotus Gang went back on their word.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They won't do it again, right?

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Olin cares about his son.

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
As long as we don't let him go,

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
he'll make sense.

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You don't want to let him go?

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's easier for us to do it.

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
But Olin can rest assured.

155
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
As long as he doesn't do anything,

156
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
we won't torture his son.

157
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's a real gun.

158
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You've never seen a real gun?

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What are you doing?

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm trying.

161
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You're trying in the car?

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm just trying.

163
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Don't be nervous.

164
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Brother.

165
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What situation can I shoot in later?

166
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Self-declaration.

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Yanshuang.

169
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
There's not a car coming.

170
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Let's go.

171
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
See how many people they have.

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You watch him.

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Don't let him go.

174
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Put your hand on the wall.

175
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Don't be afraid.

176
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll bring the police back.

177
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You go back.

178
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
If you don't apologize in five minutes,

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
you'll lose your life.

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What are you talking about?

182
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What do you mean?

183
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I really want to see.

184
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
If things don't work out,

185
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
you have the alliance.

186
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Why don't you just shoot me?

187
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You can talk.

188
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You're so weird.

190
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You're not going to use your mouth?

191
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You have a lot of things to talk about.

192
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You're so stupid.

193
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I should have let you finish.

195
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
But I don't want to smoke in the factory.

196
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
You're the Wu's.

197
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
We're meeting.

198
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Tian Haimen is not here.

199
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Tian Haimen?

200
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You scared me.

201
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
You scared me.

202
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:45,560
I'm Lin Da

203
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,560
Okay.

204
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Okay.

205
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
Why did Tawandee Da Wang

206
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,560
come to this small place like this?

207
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,560
We'll meet again.

208
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,560
I hope that you five will

209
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,560
help us out.

210
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,560
Today is our

211
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,560
meeting day.

212
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,560
You want to take this life

213
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,560
from us?

214
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,560
You're mistaken.

215
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,560
We three are the ones who

216
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,560
have to admit it.

217
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
The leader of the gang, Yuchi,

218
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,560
will not be released for a long time.

219
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,560
You said that Yuan Hui

220
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,560
will take revenge.

221
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Tell him.

222
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
An Le will always wait.

223
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,560
An Le?

224
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,560
The guardian of Tian Hai Men.

225
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,560
He's right.

226
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,560
He sent you here?

227
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,560
Don't worry about the body.

228
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,560
I'll take care of it.

229
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,560
I'll stay in Lianzi for a while.

230
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,560
See you then.

231
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Go.

232
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,560
Don't play with the gun.

233
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,560
Go.

234
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,560
Go.

235
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
Go.

236
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,560
Tian Shuang,

237
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,560
are you okay?

238
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,560
I'm fine.

239
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,560
A living person

240
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,560
suddenly disappeared.

241
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,560
It's normal.

242
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,560
How about this?

243
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,560
In the afternoon,

244
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,560
go out and take a walk.

245
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,560
Relax.

246
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,560
Don't think about it.

247
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,560
We'll talk about it tonight.

248
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,560
Get in the car.

249
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,560
The End
