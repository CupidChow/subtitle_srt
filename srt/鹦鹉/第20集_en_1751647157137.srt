1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,200
Oops , I removed track as threshold

2
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,200
I heard you're going to the mall.

3
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Are you so excited?

4
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
The people there are all the sugar-coated people.

5
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
Brother Xiu can't go.

6
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
He didn't ask anyone to pick you up.

7
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
What does that mean?

8
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
What does that mean?

9
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,200
It means that you're his successor.

10
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
You're the one who came to the安政屋.

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
You just came for a long time.

12
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
You're super cool.

13
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Why don't you react at all?

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,200
What reaction do you want?

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,200
I'm not going to the mall.

16
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
I'm not here.

17
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
You're the only one here.

18
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,200
What's the point of saying that?

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,200
You should be careful.

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
Don't offend anyone who shouldn't be offended.

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
Why are you so sentimental?

22
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
I need you to tell me.

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Go home and see more.

24
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,200
Communicate with your dad.

25
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,200
Do you hear me?

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,200
Bullshit.

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,200
I have nothing to say to him.

28
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,200
Bullshit?

29
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,200
You can't even talk properly.

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,200
You're so cute.

31
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Okay, okay.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
I know.

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,200
Take care of yourself.

34
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
Help me clean up.

35
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,200
You can't fly anymore, right?

36
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,200
Do you think I'm feeding you

37
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,200
or did I find a pretty nurse to feed you?

38
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,200
What do you think?

39
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Find me a prettier one.

40
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
Okay.

41
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,200
Brother Liu, thank you for taking care of me.

42
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
Why are you so sentimental?

43
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,200
You're not coming back?

44
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,200
What if?

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,200
There's no if.

46
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,200
I'm badly hurt this time.

47
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,200
Come back to me after you're done.

48
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,200
I mean,

49
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
what if I'm taken by the He family?

50
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Why would I come to Anzhen?

51
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,200
I'll just go straight to heaven.

52
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,200
What if?

53
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
I've been thinking.

54
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,200
You're so close to Jiajie.

55
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
The world has changed.

56
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
You're a bad guy.

57
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
You can really eat goose meat.

58
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
Who's a bad guy?

59
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
Are you jealous of me?

60
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
I'm sure I'm jealous of you.

61
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,200
Yan Shuang,

62
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
be careful.

63
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Wait for me.

64
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Why are you back?

65
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
You're not going to say goodbye to my sister?

66
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
I'm not going.

67
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
I can't bear to leave.

68
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
I've sent her a message.

69
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,200
What did she say?

70
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,200
She didn't reply.

71
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,200
Look, she's angry.

72
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,200
I'll have to rely on you to comfort me.

73
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
Right?

74
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,200
Okay, I'm going in the car.

75
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,200
I'll talk to you later.

76
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
Why are you here?

77
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,200
You're rude to not say hello before you go out.

78
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Why are you laughing?

79
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,200
I don't want to drink.

80
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,200
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,200
I'm sorry.

82
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
I'm sorry.

84
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,200
I'm sorry.

85
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,200
I'm sorry.

87
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
I'm sorry.

88
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
I'm sorry.

89
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,200
I'm sorry.

90
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,200
You're here to send me milk?

91
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Yes.

92
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,200
I have to send it to someone else.

93
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,200
I'm leaving then.

94
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Be careful on the road.

95
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Okay.

96
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,200
Chief Zhang, Yingwu is in position.

97
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
The next step is the next one.

98
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
Okay, let's proceed.

99
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,200
Okay.

100
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,200
Chief Zhang.

101
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,200
Chief Zhang.

102
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,200
Call me.

103
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,200
I'll just get it done.

104
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
Director Li.

105
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Long time no see.

106
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Huang Sixing.

107
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Don't pretend to be happy in front of me.

108
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,200
You took the money from Haiji.

109
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
And were attacked by Li Li.

110
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,200
You're not going to get away with this.

111
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,200
You're not going to get away with this.

112
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
You took the money from Haiji.

113
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
And were attacked by Li Li.

114
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
You think I don't know?

115
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
It's this face.

116
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,200
You never get angry.

117
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Huang Sixing.

118
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:05,200
Do you think everyone will laugh at you?

119
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,200
Don't underestimate him.

120
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,200
He's very capable.

121
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,200
He laughs like this every day.

122
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,200
And he goes to lick the blood of the people above.

123
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,200
He's actually becoming a director step by step.

124
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,200
Director Li.

125
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,200
If you're not satisfied with me,

126
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
you can complain to me.

127
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Complain to you?

128
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,200
If you want me to say,

129
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,200
you took the money from the black community.

130
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
I'm telling you today.

131
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,200
As long as I'm the director of the day,

132
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,200
you can't pass this project.

133
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
Then wait and see.

134
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
You bastard.

135
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,200
You can hit people.

136
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,200
He's too arrogant.

137
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
I gave him face, he didn't want it.

138
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,200
He wants to wait and see.

139
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Director Huang, are you okay?

140
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,200
I'm fine.

141
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,200
Do you want to go to the hospital?

142
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
No, I have to pick up my daughter.

143
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
I'm too late.

144
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,200
Director Li is getting more and more out of control.

145
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,200
He usually scolds everywhere.

146
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Now he dares to hit people.

147
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I'll go back and complain to him.

148
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,200
Don't think too much.

149
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Don't take it to heart.

150
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,200
You are too good-tempered

151
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,200
to be bullied.

152
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,200
It's okay. You go ahead.

153
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,200
Let's go.

154
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,200
How was it?

155
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Did you like it?

156
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,200
Did you like it?

157
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
I like it.

158
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,200
Okay.

159
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,200
Dad, can I eat fried chicken?

160
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Fried chicken is a waste of food.

161
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,200
What about milk tea?

162
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,200
It's not healthy.

163
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,200
It's annoying.

164
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Dad, I just got home from school.

165
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,200
I don't have to go all the way.

166
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
You said you were busy.

167
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
I have to go to school every day.

168
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Because I like to be with Xixi.

169
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Xixi, I'll call you back.

170
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
I'll be right there.

171
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
Yu Jie.

172
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
Yes, I need to get a temporary leave.

173
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Please help me with it.

174
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Dad, what order did you get?

175
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
I got a hand sanitizer.

176
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
I'll eat it next time.

177
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,200
Come on.

178
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Cheers.

179
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Cheers.

180
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,200
He's still pretending to be civilized.

181
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
He even said,

182
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
let's wait and see.

183
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
I slapped him.

184
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
I slapped him.

185
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
I beat him up.

186
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,200
Good.

187
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Good.

188
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,200
But he won't complain about you if you beat him up.

189
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
Complain about me?

190
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,200
He's not that brave.

191
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
You didn't see it.

192
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
I beat him up.

193
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
He climbed up from the ground.

194
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
He's full of blood.

195
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
He still laughs at me.

196
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,200
What is he?

197
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,200
He's a dog in my eyes.

198
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,200
A dog without a breath.

199
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,200
Let's see how I beat him up when we have a meeting tomorrow.

200
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,200
Okay.

201
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,200
Come on.

202
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,200
Let's drink.

203
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
Let's drink.

204
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Cheers.

205
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,200
Mom, I'm back.

206
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
Go in.

207
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,200
You'll be back soon.

208
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Bye, dad.

209
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,200
Bye, Xixi.

210
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Bye.

211
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Come on.

212
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Wash your hands.

213
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
You're not here this weekend?

214
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,200
Xixi's piano class this Saturday afternoon.

215
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,200
She's a new teacher.

216
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
See if it's suitable for her.

217
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
If it's not, then change it.

218
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
She has a great dance competition on Sunday.

219
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
She has a great dance competition on Sunday.

220
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,200
Before the competition,

221
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,200
remind her not to care about winning or losing.

222
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,200
I promised her

223
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
to take her to a new restaurant.

224
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
I'll send you the address later.

225
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
I made it clear, right?

226
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,200
Do you want me to make you a note?

227
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
You've been too spoiled lately.

228
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
I can't even care about her.

229
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
I'm not spoiled.

230
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
I'm just being careful.

231
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,200
Do you think

232
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
you'll never leave me

233
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
if you don't care about me?

234
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,200
It's been so long.

235
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Can you tell me now

236
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
why you're so wary

237
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
of your wife who grew up with you?

238
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
You don't want to tell me anything.

239
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Why do you have so many secrets

240
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
in your heart?

241
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
You only tell me it's okay.

242
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
It's all in the past.

243
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Yes, that's right.

244
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,200
I don't argue, I'm polite and gentle.

245
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,200
I think I'm the crazy one.

246
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
Even when I proposed to you,

247
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,200
you didn't even think of returning.

248
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Keep your voice down.

249
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
Who will hear it?

250
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Huang Zhi Xin.

251
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
You're a workaholic

252
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,200
and a good father.

253
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
But you know what?

254
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,200
You're the worst husband.

255
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,200
I'm sorry.

256
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
I've arranged

257
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
the cleaning.

258
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
Clean it.

259
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,200
I'm sorry.

260
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,200
I'm sorry.

261
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
The last one,

262
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,200
please vote for me

263
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
and keep your precious votes.

264
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Thank you.

265
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
After the Wu Hong Alliance was established,

266
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,200
it became one of the earliest

267
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,200
sects in the southern part of Taiwan.

268
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,200
Since the late 90s,

269
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
the Wu Hong Alliance has been thriving.

270
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,200
It's almost the first sect in the southern part of Taiwan.

271
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,200
But the bigger the region,

272
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,200
the more trouble it has caused.

273
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
Fortunately, Yomi has become

274
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
the leader of the people.

275
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
But now he's retiring.

276
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,200
We'll see who will be

277
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,200
the successor of the Wu Hong Alliance.

278
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
Hello.

279
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Welcome.

280
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,200
Welcome.

281
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,200
Hello.

282
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Long time no see.

283
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
Long time no see.

284
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
Welcome.

285
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Wait a minute.

286
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
Wow.

287
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Brother Hai.

288
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,200
Brother Xiu has been talking about you.

289
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Brother Qiang, long time no see.

290
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Long time no see.

291
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,200
Long time no see.

292
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,200
This one.

293
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,200
Long time no see.

294
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,200
This one.

295
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
Mr. Gao is here.

296
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Brother Qiang, you look good.

297
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,200
I'm good. I'm just as good as you.

298
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Brother Hao.

299
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Hello. Long time no see.

300
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,200
Where have you been?

301
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Brother Hao.

302
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,200
Long time no see.

303
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Brother Hao.

304
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Brother Qiang.

305
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Brother Qiang.

306
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
I'm counting on you.

307
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
Brother Hao.

308
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
Brother Hao.

309
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Brother Qiang, long time no see.

310
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
Okay, everyone sit.

311
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
It's okay to sit at home.

312
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,200
Brother Hao, you've grown up.

313
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,200
You've grown up.

314
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
Brother Mi.

315
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Dad.

316
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
Sit.

317
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Sit.

318
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Sit.

319
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
I'm sorry.

320
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
It's been a long time since we've all been together.

321
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
It's been hard on you.

322
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
Yes.

323
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
Let me introduce you.

324
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Today,

325
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,200
we have a guest.

326
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
The head of Tianhai Gate,

327
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
An Le.

328
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
An Le is waiting for you.
