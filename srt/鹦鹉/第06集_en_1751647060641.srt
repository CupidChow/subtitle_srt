where is our visit now?

26
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,120
Actually we all know

27
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,120
Boosting from the beginning is harder

28
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,120
Conducing it together can fail

29
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,120
We can't do that

30
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,120
As long as the ages are right

31
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,120
It's gonna result very useful

32
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,120
Does that mean you agree to it?

33
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,120
I'm sure I can't

34
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,120
I must have expressed something.

35
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,120
You won't sell me out, right?

36
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,120
Chen Tianshuang, you really think you're the best, right?

37
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,120
No, I'm your best little brother.

38
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,120
I'm not worthy of your most handsome brother.

39
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,120
Tianshuang, what do you value the most?

40
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,120
Me?

41
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,120
What do I value the most?

42
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,120
I'm a very rich person.

43
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,120
I'm very talented and handsome.

44
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,120
I'm not worthy of your most handsome brother.

45
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,120
If you talk like that, you should have some sense of shame.

46
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,120
I have a problem with his son.

47
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,120
Problems are temporary.

48
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,120
Who is he?

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,120
And what does he care about?

50
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,120
Brother Tianshuang, you're making me unhappy.

51
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,120
I'm a commoner.

52
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,120
But a commoner has attitude and dignity.

53
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,120
I might think about it before I come to the Five Lakes Alliance.

54
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,120
But since I'm here, I won't regret it.

55
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,120
We businessmen are the same.

56
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,120
We can have no money, but we can have no trust.

57
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,120
I, Chen Tianshuang, will never be a man who is ungrateful.

58
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,120
Brother Tianshuang, if you don't believe me,

59
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,120
you can kick me out right away.

60
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,120
I didn't mean that.

61
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,120
Otherwise, why would I bring you here?

62
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,120
Since I agreed to join the Five Lakes Alliance,

63
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,120
it means I trust you.

64
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,120
I have to arrange a mission for you when you go back.

65
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
Mission?

66
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,120
You have to work if you want to get the light of the Five Lakes Alliance.

67
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,120
Okay, no problem.

68
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,120
Leave it to me.

69
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,120
The Five Lakes Alliance Travel Agency?

70
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
Yes.

71
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Our Travel Agency also includes homestays, restaurants, and special souvenirs.

72
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
Look at this.

73
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,120
It's all designed by us.

74
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,120
Have you been to the three hot springs in the county?

75
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,120
Black Tao, Big Lake, is our specialty service.

76
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,120
As long as you become a member of the White Gold,

77
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,120
you can experience the scene of the crime of the little brother.

78
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,120
Of course.

79
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
But it's not really a punishment.

80
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
We have a very strict schedule.

81
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
What about you?

82
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,120
I heard that the Five Lakes Alliance is for tourism.

83
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,120
I didn't expect it to be so...

84
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,120
Just like the normal ones.

85
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Just like the normal ones.

86
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,120
Because we are like those in the movies,

87
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,120
we are always looking for a place to stay.

88
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,120
No, the Black Alliance is quite a movie.

89
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,120
They have a door, and they have to wear a suit.

90
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,120
The line is very long.

91
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,120
Look at us.

92
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,120
You wear a suit and sunglasses every day.

93
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,120
Are you sick?

94
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,120
What?

95
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
You want to wear a suit and look at the door?

96
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,120
I just came here to learn.

97
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,120
Brother Wen,

98
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,120
isn't Nianan Town

99
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,120
not a place for the internet celebrities to play?

100
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,120
In terms of popularity,

101
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
it's not as good as sure.

102
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,120
But the Five Lakes Alliance is only for tourism.

103
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,120
How can we fight against the Black Alliance?

104
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,120
We've been here for so long.

105
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Do we have...

106
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,120
What do you mean?

107
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,120
Other than tourism on the surface,

108
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,120
are there any other channels?

109
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,120
No.

110
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
It's a secret.

111
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,120
Who told you that?

112
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,120
No one told me.

113
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,120
I think we are the Black Alliance.

114
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,120
We have some black money.

115
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,120
You're here to tell us this?

116
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,120
Yes, I'm a member of the Five Lakes Alliance.

117
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,120
I'm also one of them.

118
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
Brother Peng,

119
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,120
tell me.

120
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,120
Tell me.

121
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
Since you're here so late,

122
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,120
things have gotten tense.

123
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,120
There's a little bit of information

124
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,120
about the underground traffic lines.

125
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,120
Simply put,

126
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
there are some related businesses

127
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
within the Five Lakes Alliance.

128
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,120
But the people who control the traffic lines

129
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
are their senior members.

130
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,120
You've seen the Five Lakes Alliance.

131
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,120
It's not like Tianhai Gate,

132
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
a company-based organization.

133
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,120
It's more like a big tribe here.

134
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,120
The leaders of the different places

135
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,120
take over their own land and don't interfere.

136
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,120
They get together when there's a big thing.

137
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
The channel you're talking about

138
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
is managed by the He family?

139
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,120
The He family?

140
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,120
Yes.

141
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,120
The leader of the Five Lakes Alliance

142
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,120
hasn't changed for over 20 years.

143
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
His name is Brother Mi.

144
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,120
But I've only seen him a few times.

145
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,120
As the leader,

146
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
the He family is indeed

147
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,120
not closely related to other parties.

148
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
If you want to get close to them

149
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
and not discover them,

150
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,120
you need to have a good head.

151
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,120
I heard that

152
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,120
the headquarters of the Five Lakes Alliance

153
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,120
is holding a meeting soon.

154
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Yes.

155
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,120
At that time,

156
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,120
the different parties will send people to attend.

157
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,120
That means

158
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,120
if you can get close to them before that,

159
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
you'll have a chance to attend the meeting

160
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
on behalf of the Five Lakes Alliance.

161
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
The Five Lakes Alliance is actually

162
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
a very simple structure.

163
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,120
In the end,

164
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
the leader of the party is the top.

165
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,120
So the top priority now

166
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
is to gain Brother Mi's trust.

167
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,120
But he's still watching me.

168
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,120
I can feel that

169
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
he admires me.

170
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,120
But it's not 100% trust.

171
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,120
Didn't he mention

172
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
the matter of A-wen and Wu?

173
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,120
No.

174
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,120
He said that the conflicts between him and the Black Lotus Gang

175
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,120
are all business.

176
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,120
But I think

177
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,120
what he talked to Lin Yonglin

178
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,120
is not only about that.

179
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,120
Brother Xiao,

180
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,120
I heard that your four children

181
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
have been drinking recently.

182
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,120
A-wen and Wu have been going to the team recently.

183
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
Brother Lin,

184
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,120
are they related to you?

185
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Three generations.

186
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,120
How are you related to me?

187
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
My two younger brothers

188
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,120
are indeed a bit of a mess.

189
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,120
But in front of the great master and the great consort,

190
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
they will not be left out.

191
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Why don't I believe

192
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,120
that there will be no one behind this?

193
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,120
What do you think?

194
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,120
Are you going to revenge?

195
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,120
I don't see any relatives.

196
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
Unlike you.

197
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
What do you mean?

198
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,120
Our Five Lakes Alliance is a harmonious group.

199
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
But it's not that we have no temper.

200
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,120
Brother Xiao,

201
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,120
don't be so nervous.

202
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
It's a harmonious group.

203
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,120
I'll take you to see

204
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
what's going on with your A-wen and Wu.

205
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
We are all young people.

206
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,120
We need to take care of each other.

207
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,120
It's all over.

208
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,120
Be careful.

209
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
Brother Lin,

210
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
let's not forget

211
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
that we are all watching.

212
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,120
Qian Shuang,

213
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,120
this is not the end.

214
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Don't try too hard.

215
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,120
It's important not to reveal your identity.

216
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,120
I understand.

217
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Don't be so far away.

218
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
You can walk a lot.

219
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,120
What am I going to do tomorrow?

220
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,120
I've arranged it.

221
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
What are you going to do?

222
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,120
Which street is the most lively in Lin An Town?

223
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Yanjiao Road.

224
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:21,120
Tomorrow I'm going to be the spokesperson of this street.

225
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Spokesperson?

226
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,120
This is not a person.

227
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,120
An Ming.

228
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,120
Mr. Gan, you're finally here.

229
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
I'm going to jump into the water.

230
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
What is this?

231
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,120
You don't know it?

232
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,120
The lucky item of Liang An Town

233
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,120
is designed by our five allies.

234
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,120
This is too ugly.

235
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
You asked me to come here

236
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,120
and you think it's a lucky item?

237
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,120
I'm not a lucky person.

238
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
I'm just a lucky item.

239
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
Brother, don't think it's that simple.

240
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,120
You're not you when you wear it.

241
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
Who is it?

242
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,120
Hu Xianyu?

243
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
That's too funny.

244
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
What Xianyu?

245
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,120
You're the incarnation of this street when you wear it.

246
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Your every move

247
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
will change people's attitude towards this place.

248
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
I saw you jump pretty well.

249
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
Why don't you keep jumping?

250
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,120
Come back.

251
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,120
I'm already out of energy.

252
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,120
But the fish should be full of energy forever.

253
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
You'll have to jump harder later.

254
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,120
Do you hear me?

255
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,120
Here.

256
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,120
Don't forget who you are.

257
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,120
Dong, remember to transform.

258
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,120
Sister, let's take a picture together.

259
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,120
Come on.

260
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,120
Let's take a picture together.

261
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,120
Come on.

262
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,120
Look at this fish.

263
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,120
It's so ugly and sad.

264
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,120
I'm so happy.

265
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,120
Yeah, it's so ugly.

266
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
Let's take a picture.

267
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,120
Hello, can we take a picture?

268
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,120
I don't want to. Let's take a picture together.

269
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,120
Let's take a picture.

270
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,120
Come here.

271
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,120
Come here.

272
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,120
Come here.

273
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,120
Come here.

274
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,120
Come here.

275
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,120
Come here.

276
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,120
Come here.

277
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:28,120
Come here.

278
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Ming.

279
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,120
Ming, come here.

280
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Ming, I'm waiting for you.

281
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
I'm going to transform into a fish.

282
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,120
You're going to die.

283
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,120
Don't come here tomorrow.

284
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,120
I'm leaving you to me.

285
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,120
I'm a fish.

286
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,120
Brother.

287
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,120
Brother.

288
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,120
Brother.

289
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,120
What are you doing?

290
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,120
You don't like people sitting in the same seat?

291
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,120
It's none of your business.

292
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,120
A-Hao.

293
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,120
After a day of fishing,

294
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,120
I'm finally back.

295
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,120
I told you it's tiring.

296
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,120
But you're

297
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,120
really strong today.

298
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,120
You didn't say that.

299
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,120
I'm not used to it.

300
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,120
Brother.

301
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,120
Damn.

302
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,120
It's not easy to be a good lucky guy.

303
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,120
You have to be like me.

304
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,120
You have to be pure.

305
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,120
You're working overtime?

306
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,120
You're working overtime?

307
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,120
You're not even eating.

308
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,120
Brother.

309
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,120
I finally found you.

310
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Why are you here?

311
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,120
I'm helping my dad at the beach.

312
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,120
I'll be right back.

313
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,120
You know what?

314
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,120
The fish is a man.

315
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,120
Look.

316
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Everyone's talking about it.

317
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,120
The fish is so beautiful.

318
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,120
It's so attractive.

319
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,120
You're chasing girls today.

320
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,120
You're doing it for the sake of the girls.

321
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,120
You think I'm just a guy?

322
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,120
You're so good at it.

323
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,120
You're so good at it.

324
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Brother.

325
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,120
You know me.

326
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,120
This is just my first level.

327
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,120
What's your second level?

328
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,120
When we first came here,

329
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,120
they treated us like a vegetable.

330
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,120
But if...

331
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,120
If we change our minds,

332
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,120
Brother will know

333
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,120
that we're reliable.

334
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,120
We're reliable.

335
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,120
We're capable.

336
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,120
What should we do?

337
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,120
Chao.

338
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,120
How's the reputation of Yanjia Road?

339
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,120
It's good.

340
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,120
Some say it's good.

341
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,120
Some say it's a bad idea.

342
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,120
I came here today

343
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,120
to find out the real reason behind it.

344
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,120
The master in his shop

345
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,120
has long gone.

346
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,120
If you go to his shop,

347
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,120
he might have pressed it for you.

348
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,120
You're so stubborn.

349
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,120
How did I do that?

350
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,120
You're so stubborn.

351
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
Let me go.

352
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,120
Don't go.

353
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,120
It's because they're fighting on the street every day.

354
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,120
The tourists might see it.

355
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,120
It will have a good impression.

356
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,120
They're fighting every day.

357
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,120
People around them won't protest.

358
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,120
What's the point of protesting?

359
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,120
They might get scolded.

360
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,120
I don't know why they did that.

361
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,120
They've been doing this for years.

362
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,120
They should have let their business go.

363
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,120
They don't want to be treated well.

364
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,120
It's just business.

365
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,120
There must be other reasons.

366
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,120
Let me ask my master.

367
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,120
Master?

368
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
What master?

369
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,120
A gossip.

370
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,120
Is gossip a master?

371
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,120
It's another kind.

372
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,120
It's done.

373
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,120
My master told me who to look for.

374
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,120
We'll go tomorrow morning.

375
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,120
So fast?

376
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,120
Is your master so good?

377
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,120
Of course.

378
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:22,120
My master is great.

379
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,120
He knows everything.

380
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,120
Can you introduce me to someone?

381
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,120
I'm a big fan of gossip.

382
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,120
Really?

383
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,120
No.

384
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,120
My master is very good.

385
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,120
I've never seen him before.

386
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,120
Never?

387
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,120
Forget it.

388
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,120
Let's go find someone tomorrow.

389
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,120
Daming.

390
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,120
Tomorrow...

391
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,120
I got it.

392
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,120
Leave the gossip to me.

393
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,120
Get out!

394
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,120
This is it.

395
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,120
Mr. Zheng.

396
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,120
You said you'd come next time.

397
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
So...

398
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,120
Are you here to experience it?

399
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,120
Experience?

400
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,120
What service?

401
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,120
I'm here to see your boss' wife.

402
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,120
Boss' wife is inside.

403
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,120
What service?

404
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,120
Next time.

405
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,120
What next time?

406
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,120
Are you sad about the beauty?

407
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,120
I'm not a good lover.

408
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,120
If I were Tang Song,

409
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,120
I'd marry her.

410
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
Sounds good.

411
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,120
Lin Xin!

412
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,120
It's my fault.

413
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,120
Not yours.

414
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,120
We grew up together.

415
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,120
They liked me.

416
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,120
But I married another man.

417
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,120
But I didn't like him.

418
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
I married another man.

419
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,120
But I got divorced.

420
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,120
After that,

421
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,120
I wanted to be the boss

422
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,120
of the massage shop.

423
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
They listened to me.

424
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,120
They started to run the shop.

425
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,120
It's been ten years.

426
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Ten years?

427
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,120
It's not over?

428
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,120
They got it wrong from the beginning.

429
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:24,120
I wanted to be

430
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,120
the number one in the shop.

431
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,120
Number one?

432
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,120
Not the wife.

433
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,120
Li,

434
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,120
you're number one now.

435
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,120
They're not even close.

436
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,120
Yeah.

437
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,120
It's a misunderstanding.

438
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,120
Didn't you explain it to them?

439
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,120
Men should be ashamed.

440
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,120
Besides,

441
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,120
I didn't get married again.

442
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,120
They might think they still have a chance.

443
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,120
It's been so many years.

444
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,120
If it stops now,

445
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,120
it's embarrassing.

446
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,120
They won't change.

447
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,120
But if they keep going on like this,

448
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,120
it will affect the whole street.

449
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,120
What can I do?

450
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,120
I can't just find someone to marry.

451
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,120
You can't.

452
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,120
Hey,

453
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,120
can my life be a joke?

454
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,120
I didn't mean to get you married.

455
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,120
If you're going to fake a relationship,

456
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,120
would you mind?

457
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,120
Who am I going to fake a relationship with?

458
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,120
I only like

459
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,120
handsome guys

460
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:28,120
who are handsome and have a good body.

461
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,120
Men are different.

462
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,120
They have different styles.

463
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,120
They have their own tastes.

464
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,120
I only like younger guys.

465
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,120
Younger guys?

466
00:17:52,120 --> 00:18:02,120
