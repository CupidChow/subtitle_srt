1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,740
också

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,640
messing with

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:06,660
Don't Scream

4
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:07,280
never

5
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:15,980
just

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:23,500
마ные

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,500
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,500
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,500
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,500
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:43,500
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

12
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:47,500
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

13
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,500
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

14
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:56,500
The End

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,500
You're pretty professional

16
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,500
Have you practiced before?

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Of course

18
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
I have a certificate

19
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,500
Are you here to talk to me or to talk business with me?

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,500
It's business on the surface

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Our boss is very rude

22
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,500
Actually

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,500
We can talk about the plan you mentioned

24
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
That's good news

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,500
What about you?

26
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,500
What do you want?

27
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,500
What do you think?

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,500
I'm professional

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,500
What do you mean professional?

30
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
I'm professional

31
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,500
I graduated from a physical education school

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,500
You've been recovering for half an hour

33
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,500
Why don't we exercise?

34
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,500
Are you done talking business?

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,500
What else?

36
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,500
We can talk about business another day

37
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
What else?

38
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
I regret it a little

39
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,500
Why didn't I take your brother's gift last time?

40
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,500
It's too late

41
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,500
That gold bar belongs to someone else

42
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,500
I'll get you a massage set later

43
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
This is better than the previous one

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
You want to take advantage of me?

45
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
I'm giving you a discount

46
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,500
I have to see if you're sincere or fake

47
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
Or hard

48
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Of course

49
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
I'm a real driver

50
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,500
You'll know when you've tested it

51
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Aimee

52
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Sister

53
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,500
What are you doing?

54
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
You're in the boys' dormitory

55
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,500
Why don't you knock?

56
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,500
What?

57
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
I won't disturb you guys

58
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
What are you thinking?

59
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,500
I washed your underwear when you were a kid

60
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
I'm afraid of you

61
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,500
I'll buy you new clothes

62
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
No need

63
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
What?

64
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,500
He hasn't worn clothes for a year

65
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
He can't even pull out the wool

66
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
Try it

67
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
What?

68
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
Get up

69
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
Okay, I'll do it myself

70
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
You little brat

71
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Here's your sleeve

72
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
Take a look

73
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
Turn around

74
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,500
Not bad

75
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
My brother is handsome

76
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
You always treat me like a kid

77
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
Where's Chen Tian Shuang?

78
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,500
I bought him one

79
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,500
You're not interested in Brother Shuang, are you?

80
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
None of your business

81
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Brother Shuang

82
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,500
I was just talking about you

83
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,500
I'll buy you a new dress

84
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Try it

85
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Why are you here?

86
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Is it like that?

87
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,500
Let me explain, okay?

88
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Okay

89
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,500
You really want to listen?

90
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Why not?

91
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,500
Let me think about it

92
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
It's not convenient here

93
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Let's go somewhere else

94
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
What are you doing?

95
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
What are you doing?

96
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
What are you doing?

97
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Chen Tian Shuang

98
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
So you went to approach that woman

99
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,500
All for the mission

100
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Didn't you go to arrest Brother Shuang?

101
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,500
All to protect the peace of Lian An Town

102
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,500
Absolutely

103
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
So you were all threatened?

104
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
All threatened

105
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
You don't like her?

106
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,500
She's not a good person

107
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Why should I like her?

108
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,500
You don't like her at all?

109
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
No

110
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
Then you swear to God

111
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
You don't like her at all

112
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
Or you'll die in the family

113
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
I swear

114
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,500
I swear

115
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,500
What?

116
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
I don't want to lie to you

117
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,500
But in this situation, I can't control my physical reaction

118
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Physical reaction doesn't mean I like her

119
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Here

120
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,500
Are you crazy?

121
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Don't be angry

122
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,500
You admit your mistake

123
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,500
I'm wrong

124
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,500
I'm wrong

125
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,500
I'm wrong

126
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
So you still want to see her?

127
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Of course

128
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Chen Tian Shuang

129
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,500
Of course you can ask Brother Shuang

130
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,500
I don't have to go to this kind of thing

131
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,500
It's the same for him

132
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:34,500
Stop it

133
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,500
You don't have to tell me this kind of thing

134
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,500
You can go to the one you like

135
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,500
It doesn't matter

136
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,500
I know, I know, it doesn't matter

137
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
It doesn't matter to you

138
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
I'm willing to

139
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,500
I don't want to see her

140
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Don't be angry

141
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,500
What?

142
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
Wipe it off

143
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,500
I look good, right?

144
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,500
No, no, no

145
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Wipe it off

146
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Did you wipe it off?

147
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
No

148
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Wait for me to wipe it off

149
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
You can't see

150
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
Crazy

151
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Not bad

152
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,500
I know your taste in family

153
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
How do you know?

154
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,500
To be honest

155
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Did you get caught?

156
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Of course not

157
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,500
You're not telling the truth, are you?

158
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Look at your tattoo on your neck

159
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Brother Ah Xiu

160
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,500
You can't get caught

161
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
He has to have a taste

162
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Otherwise, he won't have a fresh feeling for me

163
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,500
You're quite good

164
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Tomorrow

165
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Take advantage of the opportunity to catch up

166
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Hurry up and get me

167
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Am I going tomorrow?

168
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Who are you going to?

169
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Is it brother?

170
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking

171
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,500
I'm happy

172
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,500
As long as the task is completed successfully tomorrow

173
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,500
I don't care about the rest

174
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Free play

175
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,500
I didn't do it

176
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Just sit down

177
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Waiting for your good news

178
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
Okay?

179
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Go

180
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Is it so big?

181
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Shuanggu told you a lesson with her own experience

182
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
Be careful of those women who want to eat you

183
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
If you let them play quiet

184
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Ordinary people can't stand it

185
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
You're blinding me

186
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
It affects my performance

187
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Don't I really need to move?

188
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
Shut up

189
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Hey

190
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,500
What's that sound?

191
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,500
Didn't you tell me to check the goods?

192
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,500
I have to check it carefully

193
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,500
Be gentle

194
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
It's too hard to hit

195
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
It just started

196
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Ouch

197
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
What?

198
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,500
Does it hurt?

199
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,500
Of course it hurts

200
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
It's a bow wound

201
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
You've been making a lot of noise

202
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
You didn't do anything except being beaten, right?

203
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,500
What else can I do?

204
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,500
It's good that I can come back

205
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
What else can I do?

206
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Then why didn't you confess to my sister?

207
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
I told her she could believe it

208
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,500
Besides, I can't speak too vividly

209
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
What if she learns it?

210
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,500
What if she does this to me?

211
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Right

212
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Then don't talk about it

213
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,500
Yes

214
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
Brother Xiu is really old

215
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,500
I found out

216
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,500
He lied to me about what kind of job it was

217
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,500
I just said how he liked strong young men

218
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,500
It turned out to be a burden

219
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
I have to stay away from my sister in the future

220
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
I can't stand it

221
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
You can't say that

222
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,500
The sister I met was very gentle

223
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
Get out

224
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,500
Take the medicine

225
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,500
Hurry

226
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Here you are

227
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Why are you so far away from me?

228
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,500
Are you afraid of me?

229
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,500
I'm afraid I'm too close to you and excited

230
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
We can't talk about business

231
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Does it hurt?

232
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,500
It's okay

233
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,500
Yesterday was just appetizer

234
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,500
Let's continue today

235
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,500
It still hurts

236
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,500
Let me take a few days off

237
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Let's talk about cooperation first

238
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,500
What cooperation?

239
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Let's talk

240
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Just like you said

241
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
When you are in the goods

242
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
You deal with your troubles

243
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
This thing

244
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,500
I don't know who I should do this for

245
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Why don't I give it to the Black Company?

246
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,500
We five can't be in Lianan Town for so many years

247
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
The resources are not enough

248
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,500
The Black Company is different

249
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
They are hard workers

250
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,500
And they are very slow inside

251
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,500
Lin Pinghe is high-profile and claims to cooperate with Tianhai Wen

252
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,500
You cooperate with them

253
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Isn't it just to cooperate with Tianhai Wen?

254
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Right?

255
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,500
As for the consequences

256
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
What is the result of your partner?

257
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
Don't talk too much

258
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,500
The Five Red Alliance was unwilling to cooperate with us

259
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Even a hundred obstacles

260
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
How do you think of it now?

261
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
It's a matter of time

262
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,500
We don't know Tianhai Wen is coming

263
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,500
That's even more strange

264
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Tianhai Wen didn't bother you

265
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
Why are you complaining?

266
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Have you heard about the chemical plant?

267
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
Tianhai Wen came to Lianan Town

268
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
And killed Lin Youning

269
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,500
Because of this

270
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Of course

271
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
The chemical plant may be safe

272
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
But I heard

273
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
He didn't succeed in several places before

274
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Because of the pollution

275
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Compared to them

276
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
I am much more gentle

277
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
I am sorry

278
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Of course

279
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,500
But not all brothers can accept this kind of change

280
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,500
Our cooperation is a little low-key

281
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Then you have to make me happy first

282
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
OK

283
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
No problem

284
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Brother Lan

285
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Can you knock the door next time you enter the house?

286
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Too excited

287
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Next time it will be decided

288
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
You got this done

289
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
Look, ten o'clock in the night the day after tomorrow

290
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Look at the address

291
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
You can do it, Xiaofeng

292
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
No way

293
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,500
I am also in trouble

294
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
I have been out of sight

295
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
I can't even wash the water

296
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
You have to help me explain to Qiqi

297
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Don't worry

298
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
I will tell Qiqi

299
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
You don't want to go

300
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
I forced you

301
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
You are drunk every night

302
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,500
Tell me how much you love her

303
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,500
Love so much that you can't breathe

304
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,500
OK, OK, OK

305
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Just tell the truth, don't add more

306
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Is there any action from the police?

307
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
I have already made a good call

308
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
I will catch him

309
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
OK

310
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Let me introduce

311
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Officer Lin

312
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
He pretend to be your brother

313
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Then he followed you to the house to do the housework

314
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Hello, Officer Lin

315
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Hello

316
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,500
Brother A Xiu, you should call me A Feng

317
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
I am not used to knocking the door

318
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,500
Don't look at Officer Lin, he is young

319
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
He is super good, super capable

320
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,500
I am also young, and super capable

321
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Your task is to introduce people

322
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,500
You can leave the rest to A Feng

323
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
I like brother to be my partner

324
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,500
I have been watching this sister for a long time

325
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
She used to do drugs in the mainland

326
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Then she came here

327
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
And followed a lot of black-knife masters

328
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
She is very skillful

329
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
But she has no evidence

330
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,500
I am still grateful to you for creating this opportunity for us

331
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Brother A Xiu

332
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,500
You should be grateful for this

333
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Brother

334
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,500
I heard that you can gain the trust of the other party in a few days

335
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
How did you do it?

336
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,500
I did it randomly

337
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Great

338
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
If you hadn't followed brother A Xiu

339
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
I would have let you come to our team

340
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Maybe you are suitable to be an undercover agent

341
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
What undercover agent?

342
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,500
I am very transparent

343
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,500
I can't hide things in my heart

344
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
I should still be with my brother A Xiu

345
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
Don't be so pretentious

346
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,500
An undercover agent should be very honest

347
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Besides, maybe you are more suitable

348
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Officer Lin, don't joke

349
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Besides, I am in the police team with you

350
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Some people are not happy

351
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
Are you talking about Lao Jia?

352
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,500
How do you know?

353
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,500
Don't worry

354
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
Give me some time

355
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,500
I will kick out these corrupt police officers sooner or later

356
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,500
It seems that there are still many good police officers in the police team

357
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,500
Do you think it's okay for us to arrest these people?

358
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Don't worry

359
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
I am responsible for leaving evidence first

360
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,500
And other colleagues have already prepared resources

361
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
In order not to disturb the police

362
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
They have already been ambushed near the location of the accident

363
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,500
When the name is buried in dust

364
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,500
Still have the heartbeat calling me

365
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:13,500
If the ending is not long

366
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:19,500
At least the shadow still occupies the person
