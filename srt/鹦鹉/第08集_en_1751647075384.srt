1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,280
Basically all it did was take a bank grab from the

2
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,280
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

3
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,280
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,280
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,280
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,280
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

7
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,280
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,280
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,280
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

10
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,280
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,280
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,280
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,280
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

14
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,280
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

15
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,280
I'm gonna be the one to make you feel better

16
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,280
Episode 4

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,280
Hard-working girls

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,280
Non-mature fathers

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,280
We've lost our family

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,280
Bro

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,280
You're needed in this family

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,280
Bro, what are you talking about?

23
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,280
This time

24
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,280
It's actually a warning

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,280
Everything will be too tight and too fast when you get here

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,280
You're too fast. You need to slow down.

27
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,280
Be normal.

28
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,280
Normal? How normal?

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,280
You're a bit different from Qiqi.

30
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
Don't talk nonsense.

31
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,280
Look, after coming here, you've made a big mistake and joined the Black Society.

32
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,280
If you want to say you're a money-saving person, it's not necessary.

33
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,280
But if you want to leave an impression on the local girl you like,

34
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,280
isn't it more reasonable to be a human?

35
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,280
If you put it that way, I have to be a love brain.

36
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,280
Love brain? You can do anything.

37
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,280
Right. Who would suspect a love brain?

38
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,280
Right now, Brother Ah Xiu is suspecting me.

39
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,280
Maybe Ah Ming is still his informant.

40
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,280
If Ah Ming knows that I've been thinking about his sister all day,

41
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,280
then Brother Ah Xiu will not suspect me a little bit.

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
You're thinking quite well.

43
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,280
If he doesn't like you, then this play won't go on.

44
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,280
How is that possible? He's like that.

45
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,280
Enough. Enough.

46
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,280
Have you ever been in a relationship? Why are you acting like a middle school student?

47
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,280
How have I never been in a relationship? I was a kid.

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Okay. Okay.

49
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,280
I've thought of a strategy.

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
You have a strategy?

51
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,280
Qiqi thinks Sa Shuang is very lonely.

52
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,280
Her family environment is the stage I'm performing on.

53
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,280
Brother Dong, you should think about it.

54
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,280
You've never been in a relationship.

55
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
Ah Ming.

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
Brother Shao.

57
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Why are you here?

58
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
Are you guys resting?

59
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,280
It's okay.

60
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,280
If you come out, will they...

61
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,280
Why are you afraid of them?

62
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,280
There's no blood feud.

63
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
What did Brother Ah Xiu say?

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,280
It's the same as what you said.

65
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,280
He said to let him check it first.

66
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,280
But he praised you for solving the A Du and A Hua's problems.

67
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
Now the whole street has changed.

68
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
Really?

69
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,280
What about you and Li Li?

70
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
I...

71
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
I went to see her last night.

72
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,280
She was so scared.

73
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,280
But I...

74
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
I confessed to her.

75
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,280
I said I don't care about anything else.

76
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,280
I just like her anyway.

77
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,280
There's nothing at the critical moment.

78
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,280
She said she liked me.

79
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,280
But...

80
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,280
I still have a lot of concerns.

81
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,280
I told her.

82
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,280
Why do you think so much?

83
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
If you like her, you have to be together.

84
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,280
Let's take a step by step.

85
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,280
And then?

86
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,280
And...

87
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,280
And...

88
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,280
And it went pretty well.

89
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,280
It went well.

90
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,280
You know it.

91
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
It was already very late that night.

92
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,280
She was afraid that I would be out late at night.

93
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
So she let me stay.

94
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,280
It's obviously not safe to stay here.

95
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,280
We were all happy in the morning.

96
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,280
But we also agreed that

97
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,280
we would tell everyone after we were together.

98
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,280
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,280
I'm sorry.

100
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,280
I'm sorry.

101
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,280
Hey.

102
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Don't tell anyone.

103
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
Especially my sister.

104
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Don't worry.

105
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:14,280
I'm a good man.

106
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,280
It's best if Amin is in love.

107
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,280
Who is he?

108
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,280
He told me not to tell anyone.

109
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,280
Tell me.

110
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,280
Don't take my taste.

111
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,280
I'm like a horse.

112
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,280
Lily.

113
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
Isn't that weird?

114
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,280
Isn't it weird?

115
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,280
Lily is much older than him.

116
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,280
Amin liked Lily since he was a kid.

117
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,280
And I think Lily has a good feeling for him.

118
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,280
You know a lot of gossip.

119
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,280
Just like Chao.

120
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
He is my apprentice.

121
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,280
You are his secret master.

122
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,280
No wonder you don't let Amin see you.

123
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
Master.

124
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,280
Are you still my apprentice?

125
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,280
What?

126
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,280
You want to be a master?

127
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,280
I'm just learning.

128
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,280
What's the benefit?

129
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,280
I can continue working for you.

130
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
We had a good understanding last time.

131
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
Right?

132
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,280
It's not physical strength.

133
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,280
Are you okay?

134
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,280
Of course I'm okay.

135
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
I'm in good health.

136
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,280
What do you think, master?

137
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,280
I didn't promise you.

138
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,280
You just call me master.

139
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,280
Do you usually have such a relationship with other girls?

140
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,280
How is that possible?

141
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,280
It's the first time.

142
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
Stop talking nonsense.

143
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
I'm going to work.

144
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
Okay, master.

145
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
Slow down.

146
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,280
Slow down.

147
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,280
Hurry up.

148
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
Slow down.

149
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
Slow down.

150
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,280
Here, my salary.

151
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
You are so stingy.

152
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,280
I quit.

153
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
Forget it.

154
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,280
Let's go.

155
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,280
I have a good dinner.

156
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,280
I quit after I finish this.

157
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,280
Chen Chanshuang.

158
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,280
Thank you.

159
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,280
With A Ming's personality,

160
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,280
he won't let others come to his house.

161
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,280
So you must take good care of him.

162
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
We take care of each other.

163
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,280
If he hadn't rescued me from the sea,

164
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,280
I would have been dead.

165
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,280
Our family has been gone for a long time.

166
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
We are old, how can we take care of our children?

167
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,280
I'm the older sister.

168
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,280
I want to take good care of everyone.

169
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,280
But I still can't take care of everything.

170
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,280
You said it very well.

171
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,280
You are better than many mothers.

172
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,280
Then why don't we all sit together and eat together?

173
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,280
Why must there be someone outside?

174
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,280
It's not your fault.

175
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,280
I know.

176
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,280
But do they have their own problems?

177
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,280
But thank you.

178
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,280
I'm not so worried about him

179
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,280
when you are with A Ming.

180
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,280
I'm fine.

181
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,280
Is there anyone who is worried about you?

182
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,280
I'm fine by myself.

183
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,280
What are you worried about?

184
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,280
A Ming.

185
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,280
Brother Sheng.

186
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,280
I met your father.

187
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,280
Your sister told me about you.

188
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,280
I think she cares about you.

189
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,280
I have no choice.

190
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,280
She has a bad temper.

191
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,280
Aren't you the same?

192
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
Why are you sleeping with me?

193
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,280
Are you going to stay here forever?

194
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,280
I don't think I will ever stay here forever.

195
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,280
Do you expect her to be soft?

196
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,280
That's impossible.

197
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,280
I have nothing to say.

198
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,280
It's impossible for me to talk to her.

199
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,280
What if she says something first?

200
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,280
You are thinking too much.

201
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
I'll make a bet with you.

202
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
If I let her say something first,

203
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
you won't be able to get a raise.

204
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
I won't make a bet with you.

205
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,280
I remember what I made a bet with you last time.

206
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
We used to be competitors.

207
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,280
You are a different person now.

208
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,280
What did I make?

209
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
A good brother.

210
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,280
Don't eat tofu all the time.

211
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Eat some vegetables.

212
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,280
It's spicy.

213
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,280
I don't want to eat.

214
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,280
Look at how I eat.

215
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,280
It's delicious.

216
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
I will become a green man after eating.

217
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,280
How can you become a green man?

218
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
Uncle.

219
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,280
Hello, uncle.

220
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
This is delicious.

221
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,280
What are you doing?

222
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Aren't you going to eat with us?

223
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
He's always like this.

224
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,280
Don't mind him.

225
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280
Don't talk to daddy.

226
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
I won't talk to him.

227
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,280
The food that sister made should be delicious.

228
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
You are so good. Have some soup.

229
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,280
You are going to sleep here tonight?

230
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
Can I?

231
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
Yes.

232
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
There is an empty bed upstairs.

233
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,280
Okay.

234
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,280
It smells good here.

235
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,280
The meat is delicious.

236
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,280
It's delicious.

237
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,280
Take off your clothes.

238
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,280
It's a bit sudden.

239
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,280
What are you thinking about?

240
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,280
You are wearing your clothes outside and sleeping.

241
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
I will help you take them off.

242
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
Here, your pajamas.

243
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
Thank you.

244
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,280
I don't know what you are calling me.

245
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
I'm sorry. I forgot to introduce myself.

246
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
My name is Lu Yaqi.

247
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,280
You can call me Qiqi.

248
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,280
Qiqi?

249
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
My name is Chen Tianshuang.

250
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,280
Nice to meet you.

251
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,280
Please take good care of me.

252
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,280
You don't have to call me.

253
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,280
I will go change.

254
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
Okay.

255
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
Do you want me to sleep with you?

256
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,280
Sister, I don't need to accompany you.

257
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,280
But he just said...

258
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,280
You...

259
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,280
I will put my clothes in the bathroom later.

260
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
Okay.

261
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,280
What does your father like to do?

262
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,280
You want to open the topic.

263
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,280
No, I'm just curious.

264
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
Tell me.

265
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
He likes to play ball, play electric.

266
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,280
I also like fishing.

267
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,280
What do you want to do?

268
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,280
It's like this.

269
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,280
Some people don't like to talk.

270
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,280
But when they encounter something they are interested in,

271
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,280
they can't stop.

272
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,280
People like this have to give their all.

273
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,280
You are a thief.

274
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,280
You are a thief.

275
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
Let's go.

276
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,280
Let's go.

277
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
This is for you.

278
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Mom, you are bigger than me.

279
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
I'm not big enough to eat.

280
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,280
It's small.

281
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
A-Shuang.

282
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,280
At least call me A-Shuang.

283
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,280
I won't call you A-Ming or Old Luo.

284
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,280
But you can call me Sister Qiqi.

285
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
That's different.

286
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,280
She is the head of the family.

287
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,280
Okay.

288
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,280
Do you really want to help me when you get close to Old Luo?

289
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,280
Or do you want to find a reason to call me Sister?

290
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
I have both.

291
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,280
Then you still want to call me Sister.

292
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Of course I want to.

293
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,280
But A-Ming is my brother.

294
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,280
I also hope he can get along with Old Luo better.

295
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,280
A-Shuang.

296
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,280
People who tell the truth will be blessed.

297
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,280
You don't hate me anymore?

298
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,280
I never hated you.

299
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,280
You said I was a bad guy with a heart of a thief.

300
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,280
That's just a true story.

301
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Let's eat.

302
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,280
I'll give you a piece.

303
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,280
You and your little girl want to eat.

304
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,280
What's wrong?

305
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,280
You are bullying me.

306
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,280
I won't give it to her.

307
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,280
That's what bad guys do.

308
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,280
Do you want me to give it to you?

309
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,280
I don't want to eat it.

310
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
I don't want to eat it.

311
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
Hello?

312
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
I'll be there soon.

313
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,280
A-Ming has a car accident.

314
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,280
Where is she now?

315
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,280
In the hospital.

316
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,280
I don't know what the details are.

317
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Let's go there and find out.

318
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:17,280
No.

319
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,280
You go to school yourself today.

320
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
I'll go see A-Ming.

321
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,280
My car is out of gas.

322
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,280
I can't lift it.

323
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
What should we do?

324
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
Get in the car.

325
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
There she is.

326
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
A-Ming.

327
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
A-Ming.

328
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,280
A-Ming.

329
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,280
Sister.

330
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:13,280
How are you?

331
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,280
I'm fine.

332
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,280
Just a little skin injury.

333
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,280
Skin injury?

334
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,280
I heard you were in the hospital.

335
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,280
You scared me to death.

336
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,280
I'm sorry, sister.

337
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
How dare you do this next time?

338
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
Look at me.

339
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
I'm sorry, sister.

340
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,280
Don't always pinch my ears.

341
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,280
What are you doing?

342
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,280
You're here too?

343
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
You still have to see a doctor?

344
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,280
I told you I'm fine.

345
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,280
My friends insisted on me coming to the hospital.

346
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,280
They said they were afraid of me getting a sequela.

347
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,280
They even lied to me.

348
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
When did you come out?

349
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,280
After a while.

350
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,280
You're so annoying.

351
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,280
I'm sorry.

352
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,280
I'm sorry.

353
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
I'll get it for you.

354
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
You should have waited for me.

355
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,280
You scared me to death.

356
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,280
Chen Tianshuang.

357
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,280
Did you discuss it with A-Ming?

358
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,280
What did we discuss?

359
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,280
There was no accident, right?

360
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
Okay.

361
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,280
I know you want them to talk.

362
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,280
I won't interrupt you.

363
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,280
When did you see it?

364
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,280
When you called me.

365
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
You saw it on the phone?

366
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,280
So early?

367
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,280
You did it on purpose.

368
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,280
Otherwise, why didn't my car run?

369
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,280
My original plan was very thorough.

370
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,280
I told you the truth when you got to the hospital.

371
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,280
Then I asked you to call your dad.

372
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,280
Then I pretended that my phone was out of battery.

373
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,280
You're so troublesome.

374
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,280
Such a simple thing.

375
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,280
Troublesome?

376
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,280
So your anxiety was all acting?

377
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,280
How was it?

378
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,280
You were tricked by that guy, right?

379
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,280
You're amazing.

380
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,280
Your family is so good.

381
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,280
But I want to see the reaction.

382
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
Will you know?

383
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
I don't know.

384
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
You don't know?

385
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
Not only that.

386
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
He came up with this idea.

387
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,280
What if your dad sees it?

388
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,280
It doesn't matter.

389
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
They're just fighting.

390
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,280
They care about each other.

391
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,280
It's better not to regret it.

392
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
So they just want to step on each other.

393
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,280
Not to make a mistake.

394
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
Men are so troublesome.

395
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
So you mean,

396
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Old Luo also saw it?

397
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
Your whole family knows it.

398
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
It doesn't matter.

399
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,280
But they're talking about it now.

400
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,280
It's all up to you.

401
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,280
Then how are you going to thank me?

402
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
Do you want to go out with me tomorrow?

403
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
It's not a work this time.

404
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
What? A date?

405
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
Otherwise?
