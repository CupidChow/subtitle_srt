1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,860
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,080
It'solt Original.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,420
keys

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm asking you.

5
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You're a man who works in the mainland.

6
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Why are you here?

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What are you thinking?

8
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The Black Company bullied me.

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
They've put up with it.

10
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I can't stand it.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
If the police don't work,

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'll just shut my mouth.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You can look for us.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You don't have to come in yourself.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's weird.

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You're indeed the owner of the hall.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You've seen it.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
To be honest,

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm still a bit of a businessman.

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I think I'm a bit out of luck on East Mountain Island.

21
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I want to open up a new market here.

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But I found out that

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
someone had to take care of it.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Instead of asking for help,

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'd better...

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Join in on your own.

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yes.

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I was still a water supplier in the mainland yesterday.

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
From tomorrow on,

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm Chen Tianshuang of the Five Lakes Alliance.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The villagers see that

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
we're all on our own.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's easy to discuss anything.

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Right?

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You're pretty good-looking.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't worry, Xiu.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm a kind of person who's kind of generous.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If the Five Lakes Alliance needs me

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
to be Chen Tianshuang,

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'll do anything to help.

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
An Yu,

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
there's something

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
that needs you to do.

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The Black Lotus Gang's wanted list?

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
We're brothers.

46
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Help me out.

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Brothers?

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What do you mean?

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You're the one who's talking about the water supply.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm just a big guy.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Xiu,

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
help me out.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I won't cause you any more trouble.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay.

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
We've been having a lot of conflicts lately.

56
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'll go see their chief tomorrow.

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Come with me.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Be sincere.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Apologize to them.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Apologize?

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Is that all you can do?

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If you want to show your sincerity,

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
that's not impossible.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
No, no, no.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Apologizing is good.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Apologizing is civilized.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm the best at apologizing.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Xiu,

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
from now on, you're my biological parents.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll call you brother.

71
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Thank you.

72
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Xiu hasn't gotten married yet.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He doesn't like being a father.

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Go to bed early.

75
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Thank you, Xiu.

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Dad.

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Fine.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
If you don't have a baby, then forget it.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You're so considerate when it comes to big things.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're supposed to be a big guy.

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What big things?

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You want to fight for your life?

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Life?

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm not your life.

85
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
People outside are talking about it.

86
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You have a baby now

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
because you're my baby.

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
When people know you're alive,

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
you're a man.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You'll remember me when you're old.

91
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll call you whatever you want.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Do you know that?

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Did you hear me?

94
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I know.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You're so ugly.

96
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I only have one son.

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I've given birth to him.

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But don't worry.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It won't affect our business.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That's good.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll be back.

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Bye.

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hello?

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Did you sleep?

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You hit me on the face.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You kicked me on the face.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm sorry about today.

108
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I didn't mean to do that.

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Brother, I hit you on the face

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
because I was forcing you.

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Don't say that.

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We're brothers now.

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Let's have a little bit of peace and love.

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Love?

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm telling you.

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You beat me and joined the Five Lakes Alliance.

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But I'm not your brother.

118
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm not your brother now.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm not your brother.

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You're so mad.

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You hurt my feelings.

122
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm so sorry.

123
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What are you sorry about?

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What did we bet on today?

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You don't remember?

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I did it.

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm willing to bet.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Okay, get up.

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm teasing you.

131
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Get up.

132
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What the hell do you want?

133
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Call me brother Shuang.

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's over.

135
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Okay?

136
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Tell me the truth.

137
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Why did I lie to you?

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Why don't you keep lying?

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Shuang.

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Shuang.

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Shuang.

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Shuang.

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's right.

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We're brothers now.

145
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Let bygones be bygones.

146
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Okay?

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Let's go to bed.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Good night.

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What's wrong?

150
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You don't eat?

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Are we in a five-man gang?

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What do you mean?

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We're family.

154
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No ceremony?

155
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You know him.

156
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's all about kowtowing,

157
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
bowing to the public, right?

158
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He's watched a lot of black and white films.

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He must be crazy.

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Is there a slogan?

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
A slogan of Lafeng.

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
We're brothers.

163
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
We're brothers.

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You're so unfeeling.

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Eat your food.

166
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You're so unfeeling.

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Eat your food.

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Shiqing, that parrot.

169
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm going to find a new home.

170
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Don't worry.

171
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Follow me.

172
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Did you forget what I told you yesterday?

173
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
No.

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's all my fault.

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Please forgive me.

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
See you later.

177
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Shiqing,

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
why do I feel like

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
they're more likely to be our partners?

180
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So many people are watching us.

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Are you regretting it?

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Shiqing's partners are real.

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
They've been through a lot.

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And they're okay with it.

185
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So what?

186
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm not a fan.

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Shiqing,

188
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
what does it have to do with the wound?

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It has nothing to do with the wound.

190
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It's a local gang.

191
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
They're not that big.

192
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
They've been doing a lot this year.

193
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
That's because

194
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
they're not that lucky.

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
They're not as strong as us.

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Brother Xiu.

197
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Brother Oulin.

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Long time no see.

199
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Come on in.

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Please.

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm here to introduce you to

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
the daughter-in-law of the girl who got married.

203
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Oulin,

204
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
call me Brother Oulin.

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Brother Oulin.

206
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Brother Oulin,

207
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
let me introduce you.

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This is my new friend.

209
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Chen Tianshuang.

210
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Brother Oulin,

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
my name is Chen Tianshuang.

212
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What's wrong with you?

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Why are you bullying A He?

214
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm not bullying him.

215
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm just asking for directions.

216
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Lin Shao almost cut me off.

217
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You're talking nonsense.

218
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Tianshuang.

219
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm sorry.

220
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's my fault.

221
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm here to apologize to Lin Shao.

222
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's all my fault.

224
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Please forgive me.

225
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Brother Oulin,

227
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
he's not a good speaker.

228
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I know that

230
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
you're going to pay me back.

231
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Lin Shao,

232
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
what about this?

233
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What did I do to you last time?

234
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You can return it to me now.

235
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
What do you think?

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
You're talking nonsense.

237
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
A He, that...

238
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What do you want?

239
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I understand.

240
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You want to see my sincerity, right?

241
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'll help you.

242
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You're talking nonsense.

243
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Tianshuang.

244
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What if you don't forgive me?

245
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What are you doing?

246
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
A He.

247
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Dad, you're rude to me.

248
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Are you scared?

249
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Rude? What did you do to him?

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Yesterday, I...

251
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Shut up!

252
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Brother Oulin,

253
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'll listen to you.

254
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
A He,

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
did you take the knife to the kitchen?

256
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
How is that possible?

257
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
It's possible. He's the one who killed him.

258
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Okay.

259
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I like

260
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
young people

261
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
to be more proactive.

262
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
They can be a little more aggressive.

263
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This thing

264
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
is always like this.

265
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What if it's not?

266
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Forget it.

267
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Forget it?

268
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Dad!

269
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You're a man.

270
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You're not a man.

271
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You're not a man.

272
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You're not a man.

273
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Do you think

274
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
this is a small thing?

275
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Thank you.

276
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Thank you, Brother Oulin.

277
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Do as you want.

278
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I apologize.

279
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Thank you, Lin Shao.

280
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You're not as big as Xiao Rongguo.

281
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I think about what I did yesterday.

282
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm so ashamed.

283
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm so ashamed.

284
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I always fall for it.

285
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Today, I'll cut your head off.

286
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Dad!

287
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You're so stupid!

288
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You haven't cut it yet?

289
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What should we do?

290
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
He's still angry.

291
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'll go and give him a lesson.

292
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Enough.

293
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Wait for me downstairs.

294
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Thank you, Brother Oulin.

295
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm going down.

296
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Brother Oulin!

297
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I saw that mainlander outside!

298
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't touch him!

299
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Damn it!

300
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Chen Tianshuang!

301
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm not done with you!

302
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I can't do it anymore.

303
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I can't do it anymore.

304
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Do you have children?

305
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
No.

306
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's good. It's easy.

307
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I think

308
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
this kind of luggage and this kind of bed

309
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
should be given to children.

310
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I have enough money to buy them.

311
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Lin Anzhen,

312
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
you're not helping the Yi family, are you?

313
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm just trying to make it work.

314
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But

315
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
now,

316
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
it doesn't mean that I can't do it.

317
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Brother Oulin,

318
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
what did you talk about?

319
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You want to know?

320
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm just curious.

321
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
If you think I shouldn't ask, I'll ask.

322
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
There's nothing you shouldn't ask.

323
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
After all, you're one of us.

324
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Not only you,

325
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
we've been in conflict with the Black Lotus Gang.

326
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I went there

327
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
to make peace.

328
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
After all, the conflict will only get worse.

329
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Conflict?

330
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Is it a game?

331
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's business.

332
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Lin Yongning got the money from the developers

333
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
to completely change Lin Anzhen.

334
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Now, people come to our place

335
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
to eat and see the sea.

336
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
They'll be back in two days.

337
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
If you know that Taiwan is a island,

338
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
the sea is everywhere.

339
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If we don't have any specialties,

340
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
we don't have to spend money.

341
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I thought

342
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
we could make a place

343
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
with an international influence.

344
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It's not like we're going to

345
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
buy a place that's not like the one in the city.

346
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
It's a new way of thinking.

347
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Do you know

348
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
the difference between the two?

349
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
This money,

350
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
we can make it together.

351
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I don't know how much we can make.

352
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But I want to ask you

353
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
what should we do with Lin Anzhen's people?

354
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
They're just people who are just people.

355
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
But they don't have the experience.

356
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You mean

357
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
they'll all become actors

358
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
and play in the past, right?

359
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What about the others?

360
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
If people don't change,

361
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
they'll be eliminated.

362
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
This is a labor force.

363
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm sorry, Mr. Lin.

364
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I might be a little bit

365
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
mischievous.

366
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Even if we can make money,

367
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
compared to the cosplay theme park,

368
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I think Lin Anzhen's people

369
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
still prefer the present life.

370
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
When you first came to Taiwan,

371
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I treated you well, right?

372
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Brother Xiao, people have good genes.

373
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
But sometimes they don't change.

374
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
They change in time,

375
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
in the mind,

376
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
and they don't change.

377
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Actually, I'm not a fool.

378
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
If everyone agrees,

379
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I won't stop them.

380
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
