1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,360
This is my daughter Shu Yi.

3
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,960
Nice to meet you.

4
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,280
Welcome.

5
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,900
My son,

6
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,300
Jiahao.

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,000
Today is the family dinner of the Five Lakes Alliance.

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,300
Why are you here?

9
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:25,300
That's right.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,800
Jiahao, you've misunderstood.

11
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,800
The Tianhai Gate Team is against the Five Lakes Alliance

12
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,000
and has been in the same position for a long time.

13
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm an outsider.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I won't interfere in your family affairs.

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I just came to visit Mi Ge today.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
He has been taking care of me.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
That's why he asked me to say a few words.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll leave after I finish.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I told you to come here.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's for Mi Ge.

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why are you here?

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What do you have to say?

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You can say it.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Brother Chang is right.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Don't think you're a fool to be here.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Just treat yourself as a big brother.

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,200
When the Five Lakes Alliance is in the middle of the sky,

28
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,200
the Tianhai Gate Team is not in the same position.

29
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
That's right.

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,200
Shut up!

31
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,200
People are always joking.

32
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,200
Is this the way of the Five Lakes Alliance?

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,200
What's the matter?

34
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,200
Just wait for a while.

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Hurry up and tell everyone.

36
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,200
Let everyone know.

37
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
Mi Ge.

38
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,400
For the past few years,

39
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,400
the Five Lakes Alliance and Tianhai Gate Team

40
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
have been in constant conflict.

41
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
However,

42
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Tianhai Gate's chemical plant

43
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
is moving into Lianan Town.

44
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
What does that mean?

45
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
This plan will bring

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
a lot of changes and business opportunities to Lianan Town.

47
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
However,

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,400
I'm afraid that the progress

49
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,400
will cause some local obstacles.

50
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
At that time,

51
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
I hope that the Five Lakes Alliance

52
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
can help us.

53
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
Lianan Town is now

54
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
the territory of the Five Lakes Alliance.

55
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
What are you trying to do?

56
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Are you trying to steal our land?

57
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,400
Yes, we're trying to steal your land.

58
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,400
How can you do that?

59
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
As long as you cooperate,

60
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
in the future,

61
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
we can share

62
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
the fruits of our success.

63
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
What if I don't cooperate?

64
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
Then you'll regret it.

65
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Brother Huo Bu,

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,900
look,

67
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,900
I'm just a businessman.

68
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
I don't want you to kill me.

69
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,400
Whatever you want,

70
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
I can satisfy you.

71
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
Brother Huo Bu,

72
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
I've said everything I should.

73
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
You... you should let me go.

74
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
You don't want me to interfere in Lianan Town.

75
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
I can do it.

76
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
I'll get out of here.

77
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
I promise to stay away from here.

78
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
I told you a little secret.

79
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
I said it.

80
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
I only open my mouth

81
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
when I'm in front of Le.

82
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
I'm not going to let you go.

83
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
I'm not going to let you go.

84
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
I'm not going to let you go.

85
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
I'm not going to let you go.

86
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,400
What's wrong with you?

87
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
What's wrong with you?

88
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
What's wrong with you?

89
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
You killed me.

90
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
If you kill me, you'll never know this secret.

91
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
Shoot!

92
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Kill me!

93
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
I'm calling An Le now.

94
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,400
If An Le answers, tell him.

95
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,400
If he doesn't answer, you're not lucky.

96
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
Since we're in Lianan Town,

97
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
why don't we invite the local

98
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,400
branch head to talk?

99
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Right.

100
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Lianan Town people say

101
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,400
that Xiao Ge is not a leader.

102
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Why didn't he come?

103
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Yes.

104
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Xiao Ge got hurt.

105
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
I represent Lianan branch.

106
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,400
I'm here for her.

107
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
Who are you?

108
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
I mentioned you.

109
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
Chen Tian Shuang, right?

110
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Okay, I want to hear it.

111
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,400
Do you think we should cooperate?

112
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Don't be stressed. Just say it.

113
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
I'm here for her.

114
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
I'm the branch head.

115
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
I'm here to tell you

116
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
what's going on in Lianan Town.

117
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Tian Hai Men

118
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
didn't kill us

119
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
after coming to Lianan Town.

120
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
As for cooperation,

121
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
we should listen to Mi Ge

122
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,400
instead of him.

123
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
What do you mean?

124
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,400
You're not lucky.

125
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Wait a minute.

126
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
Wait a minute.

127
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
Xu Kong.

128
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Excuse me, I have to answer the phone.

129
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
Hello.

130
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Sorry, Brother An.

131
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
It's me.

132
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
I'll give you 30 seconds.

133
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Then promise me.

134
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Let me go after I say it.

135
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
Damn it.

136
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
I know.

137
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
I'll give the phone to Uncle.

138
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Brother An.

139
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Okay.

140
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Understood.

141
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Sorry, Brother Mi.

142
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,400
We can continue.

143
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Xu Kong.

144
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
You go back.

145
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Let me tell you something.

146
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Wu Hu Meng

147
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
is not a good person.

148
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
Yes.

149
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
Understood.

150
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
But,

151
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
from what I know about the chairman,

152
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
he will be

153
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
a little disappointed.

154
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
The last gang that disappointed Tian Hai Men

155
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
is called Black Lotus.

156
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
They are also in Lianan Town.

157
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
What happened to them?

158
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
Chen Tian Shuang.

159
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
You should know it.

160
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Black Lotus is gone.

161
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
What do you mean?

162
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,400
The chairman was killed.

163
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
The vice chairman and the chairman's son died in a fight.

164
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,400
The chairman's house

165
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
was burned to ashes.

166
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,400
Yes.

167
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
I heard you were there

168
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
and saw it with your own eyes.

169
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
You must have a deep impression.

170
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
I will never forget it.

171
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
If you are interested,

172
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
please share it with everyone.

173
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Brother Mi.

174
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
I have been bothering you for too long.

175
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
I will leave first.

176
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Brother Qiang, right?

177
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,400
Yes.

178
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
What do you want?

179
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
I heard you are very intelligent.

180
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Today I saw

181
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
that you are like this.

182
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
If you are free,

183
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,400
let's have tea together.

184
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,400
What are you?

185
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,400
You are so fake.

186
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,400
I am sorry.

187
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
You two!

188
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
Put the gun down!

189
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
I told you to put the gun down!

190
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
You two! Where did you come from?

191
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
You scared me!

192
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,400
I will kill you!

193
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
Kill him!

194
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,400
You two!

195
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
If you dare to touch me,

196
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
I will kill you!

197
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Put the gun down!

198
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,400
Kill him!

199
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,400
What?

200
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Kill him!

201
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
I told you to put the gun down!

202
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
I told you to put the gun down!

203
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,400
I told you to put the gun down!

204
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
Put it down!

205
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,400
Brother Mi.

206
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
I will take him away.

207
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,400
Goodbye.

208
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Brother Mi!

209
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Brother Mi!

210
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Brother Mi!

211
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
Brother Mi!

212
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,400
An Le agreed.

213
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
Let me go.

214
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
You know, An Le told me.

215
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Then let me go.

216
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,400
You are so beautiful.

217
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,400
It's a pity that you let me go.

218
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Tian Ai Men's general protection.

219
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
It doesn't mean anything, right?

220
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
How?

221
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
An Le's words always count.

222
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
As long as you let me go,

223
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,400
I can do anything.

224
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,400
You want me to do something.

225
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Really?

226
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Really.

227
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
I want you to die.

228
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
I want you to die.

229
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Jesus!

230
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Dad.

231
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
How about we call it a day?

232
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
You go back and rest.

233
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
It's been a long time since we last met.

234
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Just for such a small thing,

235
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,400
you are here.

236
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
Isn't that a joke?

237
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,400
Brother Mi.

238
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,400
Why didn't you let us do it?

239
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Dad.

240
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
Come with me.

241
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Do it.

242
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Didn't you see the gunfire over there?

243
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,400
We have it too.

244
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
We have so many people.

245
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,400
We can't beat them.

246
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
Yes.

247
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Winning is winning.

248
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
But what about the price?

249
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,400
Have you thought about it?

250
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
I'm not afraid.

251
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
You should be afraid.

252
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
Have you seen An Le's tricks?

253
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Have you seen it?

254
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
I have.

255
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,400
I don't take it seriously.

256
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,400
I thought I could trick him.

257
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
I have seen all the tricks.

258
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
But what happened?

259
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,400
They all lost.

260
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
One by one.

261
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
So you mean

262
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,400
they let them take my brother away

263
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,400
on our turf, right?

264
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,400
It's obvious today.

265
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,400
An Le came prepared.

266
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,400
Everyone's reaction today

267
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
is in his expectation.

268
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
You guys lost.

269
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,400
You lost.

270
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,400
You lost.

271
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
You can't beat him.

272
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
You can't let him take you away.

273
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
You have to fight back.

274
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
You have to be surprised.

275
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
You have to beat him.

276
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,400
You have to be surprised.

277
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,400
So you can get a chance.

278
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
So

279
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
as you said,

280
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
everything went well.

281
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
We only lost a little bit.

282
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
So, Brother Hao,

283
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,400
do you have any good idea?

284
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Let me tell you.

285
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
The mainland is under our feet.

286
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,400
Why do we have to use the steel?

287
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Brother Hao,

288
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
you mean

289
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
An Le is a smart guy.

290
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
You said he took Brother Qiang away.

291
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
But he didn't use the gun.

292
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,400
It's obvious, right?

293
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
He didn't mean to be our enemy.

294
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,400
I think

295
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
as long as we help him,

296
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Brother Qiang will come back safe and sound.

297
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Then we will eat and drink with Tianhai Gate.

298
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
Isn't that a good thing?

299
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
Help him?

300
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
That's being Tianhai Gate's dog.

301
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
How can you talk like that?

302
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
He just said it clearly.

303
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,400
It's cooperation.

304
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
You don't understand cooperation.

305
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,400
You are the leader of Tianhai Gate.

306
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,400
You are the leader of Tianhai Gate.

307
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
You don't understand cooperation.

308
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
You took him away in front of so many people.

309
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,400
You call this cooperation?

310
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Brother Qiang's attitude is too bad.

311
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
Didn't you see that?

312
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
He was so polite to my father and me.

313
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
In the future,

314
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
when I take over the Five Lakes Alliance,

315
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
I will go to him first.

316
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Then he will definitely

317
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
take the lead.

318
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
Today's bad days are over.

319
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
Right.

320
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,400
I was wondering

321
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,400
why Brother Hao was so active today.

322
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
He wanted to win the lottery.

323
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
Win the lottery?

324
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,400
I was thinking for everyone's sake.

325
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
Do you understand?

326
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Think about it.

327
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
The Five Lakes Alliance is a big deal on the street.

328
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
We don't do drugs.

329
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,400
We don't gamble.

330
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,400
We don't do politics.

331
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
We took away all the oil and water.

332
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
Isn't it bad for the people?

333
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
But can the people eat?

334
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
The rules of the game have been passed.

335
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
It's time to change.

336
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Although we gathered everyone here today

337
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
for the next leader's recommendation,

338
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
but now,

339
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
I think

340
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
who will be the leader is not the most important.

341
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,400
The most important thing

342
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
is that at this moment,

343
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
the Five Lakes Alliance will unite

344
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,400
to deal with the current situation.

345
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
He Shuyi,

346
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
so according to your opinion,

347
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
who should unite?

348
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
You? A woman?

349
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
What's important now is not a man or a woman.

350
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
But which way should we go?

351
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
After all,

352
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,400
not everyone

353
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
is willing to be a dog walker for Tianhai Gate.

354
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,400
I didn't like Tianhai Gate at first.

355
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
But what happened today is happening right in front of me.

356
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,400
I figured it out.

357
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,400
An Le made it very clear.

358
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,400
The one who follows the flag will be the king.

359
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
The one who resists the flag will be the king.

360
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,400
But we shouldn't call the Five Lakes Alliance.

361
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Let's just disband and go to Tianhai Gate.

362
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
Forget it.

363
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Okay.

364
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
At this time, everyone is still not united.

365
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Then the Five Lakes Alliance

366
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,400
should just disband.

367
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,400
Brother Mi, you should be the leader.

368
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,400
My time is almost up.

369
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,400
How to go in the future

370
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,400
is up to everyone.

371
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Today, everyone should think about it.

372
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Tomorrow morning,

373
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
everyone will vote

374
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
for the next leader.

375
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
I will say one last thing.

376
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
Since everyone chose it,

377
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
no matter who will be the leader,

378
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
the future of the Five Lakes Alliance

379
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
will be up to him.

380
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
The Five Lakes Alliance

381
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
is the leader of the Five Lakes Alliance.
