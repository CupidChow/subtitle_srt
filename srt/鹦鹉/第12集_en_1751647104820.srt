Ivan Oли

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I can't let them get away with it.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I have to decide right away

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
who is the next leader.

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Is it you?

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Of course.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
After Oulin's attack,

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I am the leader.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The Heaven's Chess Club might want to revenge Oulin.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They won't be standing by your side.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
No one is leading.

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's all a group of people.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oulin has a son.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You mean him?

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I heard Wu Huo and Mo'er released him.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Really?

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Damn!

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How could they release him so easily?

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Wu Huo and Mo'er are both good people.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
They are not just for fun.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Really?

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Brother, you are right.

49
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
After the attack,

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
the Black Lotus Gang will be mine.

51
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The Black Lotus Gang

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The Black Lotus Gang

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The Black Lotus Gang

54
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The Black Lotus Gang

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The Black Lotus Gang

56
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The Black Lotus Gang

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Damn!

58
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Are you crazy?

59
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Why are you on my bed?

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Brother,

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
this is obviously my bed.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Then why am I on your bed?

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How would I know?

64
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Damn!

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's disgusting!

66
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Think about it.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What happened?

68
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I don't remember.

69
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I drank too much last night.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll buy you breakfast.

71
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't be mad.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Just this once.

73
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Yesterday, the chairman of the Heaven's Chess Club,

74
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Zheng Tai Xiang, announced that

75
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
the factory was built two years ago.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The new location is

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Lianan Town, Tainan City.

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Brother Long,

79
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
bring me some water.

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
How many times do I have to tell you?

81
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The news is fake.

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's none of our business.

83
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You'll know if it's our business or not.

84
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's just a factory.

85
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Let me ask you.

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Do you know how to go to the factory?

87
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No.

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's right.

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
When the factory is built,

90
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
who will travel in Lianan Town?

91
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We'll change the business.

92
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Brother Yushuang,

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
something bad happened to the Hellenic Gang.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Do you know?

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Where did you hear it?

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
On the Internet.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's all over.

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Liu Yongting is gone.

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Someone said it was Wu Meng.

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Someone said it was the Hellenic Gang's own brother.

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Someone said it was his son.

102
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He wanted to hurt Li Weishui and kill his father.

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What the hell?

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're crazy.

105
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What happened?

106
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The Heaven Gate.

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The Heaven Gate?

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
When the coffin is delivered home,

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
the Heaven Gate will let everyone know

110
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
that the Black Lotus Gang boss is in the air.

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
In their eyes,

112
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
he is a dead ant who can die at will.

113
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But

114
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
they are already the biggest gang.

115
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Why did they come to Lianan Town?

116
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yeah.

117
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What are they doing?

118
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's not that complicated.

119
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's just...

120
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
they have a grudge against the Hellenic Gang.

121
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah.

122
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Is there anything special about Lianan Town?

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I mean,

124
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
it's like a new main station.

125
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Lianan Town is just a tourist spot.

126
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
There's nothing special.

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Come in.

128
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Ah Xiu,

129
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I know.

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What?

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Why did the Heaven Gate

132
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
want to kill Lin Yongning?

133
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
They wanted to start a chemical factory.

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
They did it a few times before.

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But it didn't work because of pollution.

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Now they chose to do it in Lianan Town.

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Didn't you say before

138
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
that Lin Yongning wanted to turn this place

139
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
into an ecological tourist spot?

140
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's just a conflict with the chemical factory.

141
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You mean,

142
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
the Heaven Gate chose to kill the Hellenic Gang

143
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
because they didn't want to talk to Oulin?

144
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
That's why they started the chemical factory.

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's not like they have a grudge against the Hellenic Gang.

146
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But that's not the point.

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Go on.

148
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The point is that we are a five-tower alliance.

149
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
We are traveling.

150
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
If there's any problem with the pollution

151
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
from the chemical factory,

152
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
we'll be in trouble.

153
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You mean, traveling?

154
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
But our lives will be in danger.

155
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Not just our lives.

156
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I can't even handle those seafood.

157
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Bo Bo is in a good mood now.

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's hard to say what will happen next.

159
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Tian Shuang, I've told you before.

160
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You are a good man.

161
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Don't praise me, Xiu.

162
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Then do we have any grudge against the Heaven Gate?

163
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What's wrong?

164
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The Heaven Gate is so powerful.

165
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I don't want to fight them.

166
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't want to either.

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But it's hard to predict.

168
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We can only take one step at a time.

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Before the Heaven Gate comes,

170
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
we have someone else to deal with.

171
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The Hellenic Gang?

172
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The thing about Baolin

173
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
is not just about the Black Gang.

174
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's about the Big Brother.

175
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Who will listen to it?

176
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Who will take revenge?

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I guess everyone in the bottom line

178
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
has his own thoughts.

179
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But it won't come to a conclusion soon.

180
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You let Lin Ping He go.

181
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I think you did the right thing.

182
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's a cross-section.

183
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The thing about Baolin

184
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
may be a good opportunity for us.

185
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The Five Lakes Alliance

186
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
is no longer the Black Gang's target.

187
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
But what will happen?

188
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It depends on our meeting today.

189
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Meeting?

190
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
What meeting?

191
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Like you.

192
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's a businessman.

193
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
His name is Jia.

194
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Businessman?

195
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What business?

196
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Jia's business

197
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
is the channel you're thinking of.

198
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Channel?

199
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
That's good.

200
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We can make more money.

201
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The more money you make,

202
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
the more dangerous it is.

203
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I told you before

204
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I have two brothers

205
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
called Avin and Awu.

206
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I heard about it.

207
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Did they have a surprise?

208
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Surprise?

209
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't have any evidence.

210
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Everyone knows

211
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
they were killed by the Black Gang.

212
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
That's the channel.

213
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Making big money

214
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
is troublesome.

215
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The Black Gang has been

216
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
based on our channel.

217
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
They want to take over.

218
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So they are behind the scenes

219
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
doing things to Awu and Awu.

220
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They are on the surface

221
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
of real estate.

222
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
But in fact,

223
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
they are making it easy for themselves

224
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
to expand the channel.

225
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Awu is in charge of

226
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
the Taiwan side.

227
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The mainland is Jia.

228
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Now that Awu is dead,

229
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
it may be a good opportunity

230
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
for us to get Jia

231
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
to come over

232
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
so that the Black Gang

233
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
no longer has the capital to make channels.

234
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Brother,

235
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm a newbie

236
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
for such an important meeting.

237
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm not familiar with the business.

238
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Can you handle it?

239
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You have no problem.

240
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Jia

241
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
will take your job.

242
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Brother,

243
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I can't play

244
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
with the business.

245
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I told you to talk business.

246
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I didn't tell you to play.

247
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You said

248
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
he would take my job.

249
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You are being aggressive.

250
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I have a bottom line.

251
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Anyway,

252
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
you can play

253
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
however you want

254
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
to get the channel you want.

255
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,200
I'm going to the

256
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,000
office.

257
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Hello, Jia.

258
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm Chen Tianshuang

259
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
from the Five Lakes Alliance.

260
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The young man with the snowy temper

261
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
is not bad.

262
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He is so big.

263
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He is so big here.

264
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What's your name?

265
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Chen Tianshuang.

266
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm Erdong Chen.

267
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm Tianshuang.

268
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Chen Tianshuang.

269
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Tianshuang.

270
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Can you do it?

271
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
No.

272
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Our leader asked me to come

273
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
to talk about cooperation.

274
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Cooperation?

275
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't think

276
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I have anything to do with the Five Lakes Alliance.

277
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You didn't have it before.

278
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You can have it in the future.

279
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
But we are much better

280
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
than the Black Lotus Gang

281
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
in terms of the channel.

282
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Besides, they are in a mess inside.

283
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The tree is dead,

284
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
but the man is alive.

285
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The Five Lakes Alliance has its own principles.

286
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The principles are dead,

287
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
but the man is alive.

288
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
In this age,

289
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
who would be able to get through this?

290
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Right?

291
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We have fame and resources.

292
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Let's work together.

293
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
We win twice.

294
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We win twice?

295
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Sit.

296
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You are doing this now.

297
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Are you afraid that you will

298
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
offend Tian Haimeng for me?

299
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
We can't live without each other.

300
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
As long as we have our own rules,

301
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
they have their own rules.

302
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We will get through this one day.

303
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But this day

304
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
will be earlier than we think.

305
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You are quite clear.

306
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
We are young people.

307
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We can be close to each other.

308
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Okay.

309
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There are some people

310
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
who are troublesome.

311
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Let's go to the goods store

312
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
and get rid of them.

313
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Then I will agree to work with you.

314
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Sister,

315
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
this is our rule.

316
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If we get rid of one person

317
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
in the nick of time,

318
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
we will still be the Five Lakes Alliance.

319
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We can make money.

320
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Why do we care so much?

321
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We have our own rules.

322
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
We can understand each other.

323
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What is this?

324
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
A gift for you.

325
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Open it.

326
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I don't have money.

327
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
How much do you have?

328
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You said you don't like

329
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
the net that opens up joy in your heart.

330
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I have my own rules.

331
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Your hand...

332
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I just want to push you away.

333
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Nothing else.

334
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Push?

335
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Just push.

336
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Chen Tianshuang.

337
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Tianshuang.

338
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You are not a fool.

339
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Are you scared?

340
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What are you doing?

341
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Am I not a fool now?

342
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You are a skinny young man.

343
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You are quite strong.

344
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
It reminds me of

345
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
an old friend I met years ago.

346
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Old friend?

347
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Who?

348
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I will tell you after we talk about business.

349
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Think about it.

350
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
After this village,

351
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
there will be no more stores.

352
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Did you get caught by Jiang Jiang?

353
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I am envious.

354
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The process is so exciting.

355
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Jiang Jiang.

356
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
It is the same as I thought.

357
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Business, bribery, seduction.

358
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The process is exciting,

359
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
but it is all in my palm.

360
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I am tired.

361
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Why are you tired?

362
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Brother Ah Xiu.

363
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Shouldn't you be the one to go?

364
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Are you afraid you can't handle it?

365
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What are you joking about?

366
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
When I was young,

367
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
you were so good at everything.

368
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You are much better than you are now.

369
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I am testing you.

370
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Why am I so unhappy?

371
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I am asking you.

372
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Did you get caught?

373
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Of course not.

374
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
What did he say?

375
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
The same as you said.

376
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
He wants to smuggle goods and get people.

377
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What is his reaction after you rejected him?

378
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I think he won't give up easily.

379
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Yes.

380
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
People like him

381
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
never give up.

382
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You don't know him?

383
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
No.

384
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I just heard about him before.

385
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What is his attitude now?

386
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Just remember one thing.

387
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
No matter what,

388
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
you can't affect his life.

389
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
If you can, then you can.

390
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
If you can't, then you have to stop him.

391
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
That's not difficult.

392
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What do you mean?

393
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
A new assistant is here.

394
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Let him handle it.

395
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You mean Ding Hai Wen?

396
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Can't he?

397
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
He can.

398
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
He can.

399
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But...

400
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
It's all in the past.

401
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Have a good rest.

402
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
There is a big show in the afternoon.

403
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
A big show?

404
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Baolin's attack.

405
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Have you seen Jia?

406
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Did you find anything?

407
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So the Black Lotus Gang is also working on underground things.

408
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Jia is the key.

409
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
If the Military Police Bureau doesn't cooperate with the Five Red Bricks,

410
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'll be in vain.

411
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
This is a good chance for me.

412
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
If I do well,

413
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'll have a good impression on Brother Xiu.

414
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'll win.

415
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
You're both experienced.

416
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The more he trusts you,

417
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
the closer you are to the traffic line.

418
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
But you're climbing so fast.

419
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
What's the reason?

420
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
The Black Lotus Gang is so easily defeated by Tian Hai Wen.

421
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
What if the next step is the Five Red Bricks?

422
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
So he has to hurry up

423
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
to train the next successor.

424
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
He's afraid of unexpected events.

425
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Not only that,

426
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
he has a tumor in his brain.

427
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But he's still a good man.

428
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's hard to say.

429
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Brother Long.

430
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Brother Long.

431
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
About Tian Hai Wen,

432
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I have something to tell you.

433
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Behind Tian Hai Wen

434
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
is the Military Police Bureau.

435
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
As expected.

436
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The Military Police Bureau is promoting a secret plan

437
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
called the Acting Plan.

438
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
We don't know what it is.

439
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But the chemical plant we saw on TV

440
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
is prepared for the Acting Plan.

441
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Acting Plan?

442
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Should we check it?

443
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
No. Keep checking the traffic line.

444
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The Acting Plan has another plan.

445
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I understand.

446
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'll leave now.

447
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
There's a big show in the Black Lotus Gang this afternoon.

448
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Tian Shuang.

449
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Did Lin Wu Ning's death

450
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
affect you?

451
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
No.

452
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That's good.

453
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm glad.
