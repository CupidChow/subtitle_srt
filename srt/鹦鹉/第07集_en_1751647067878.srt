1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,920
The 4 Bait Sh containment

2
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,720
Travel at full speed

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:25,620
Yellow

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,120
Love is Dharma

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I don't like men either. I'm not hitting on you.

6
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I need to ask you.

7
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What kind of girls do you like?

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's right, Brother Yuan.

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
A lot of girls were after you when you were in school.

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But you're very indifferent to them.

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
They're not my type.

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I like mature girls.

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You like mature girls?

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's great.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What?

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Tomorrow, I'll give you a good job.

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It's your type.

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You're a good cook.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What the hell?

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You're a good cook.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You're so clean.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't think you've got a job yet.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I read in the newspaper that someone is suing a massage shop for hitting their own bones.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're the one who's suing.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What are you talking about?

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You're the one who's suing.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Are you kidding me?

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The photos are all fake.

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's clearly written on it.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Adu Awa.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Lily.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
A Min, come here.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Come on.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Do you have a guest today?

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Don't talk to me.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I have a guest.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Brother Shuang, you didn't guess it right.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
When Lily saw A Min, she was so happy.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Good job, A Min.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I think she wants to work harder.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Let's go.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Is it good?

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yes.

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You're so pretty.

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It looks delicious.

47
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Is it good?

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Try it.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Is it good?

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Is it good?

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Are you okay?

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I didn't expect you to act in such a play.

54
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Why are you sorry?

55
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Did you have a hard time dating your sister?

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Of course not.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I think you're very good.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're good at making women happy.

59
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But I know you guys like young girls.

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I don't want you to say that.

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't care about age.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Even if it's a play, I'm happy when you say that.

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's go. We have one last stop.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
A Min, I have a bad feeling about this.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No way. They're so different.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Didn't you notice?

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Their date today is only in this place.

69
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Damn it.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Huang, it's been more than ten years.

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't lie to yourself.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Lily likes young girls.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I don't like them.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What do you mean?

75
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That little bitch.

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Who is it?

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Don't move.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Your calligraphy is good.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You're pretty professional.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Where did you learn that?

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We're from the same school.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Same school?

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I used to massage my girlfriend every day.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Now she ran away.

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
She said she was out of breath after 00.

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
She's looking for a new one.

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So you're from the same school.

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We're all secretaries.

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Secretaries?

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's have one.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's have one.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I know.

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Love is unreliable.

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll put all my energy on work.

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let her regret.

96
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You're different.

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You're still young.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We're old.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No hope.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What's the difference?

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I think it's the same.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
What's the saying?

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What's the meaning of men's life?

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Young people.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Young people.

106
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's have one for young people.

107
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Let's have one.

108
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm a man.

109
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm still young.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You're a man?

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
No wonder Lily doesn't like you.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You're a man.

113
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Look at me.

114
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm a man.

115
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
A man?

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You?

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm a young man.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Cheers for young people.

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Cheers for young people.

120
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Cheers.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
To young people.

122
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Cheers.

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Someone was blackmailing us on the Internet.

124
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I asked someone to check.

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The Internet army was made by the Black Lotus Gang.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Black Lotus Gang?

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Why?

128
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
They want to destroy our business.

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
They want us to be unable to run the business.

130
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
They want to take away our stores.

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That's too much.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yes.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We've been doing business on the Yen-Jiao Road for so many years.

134
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Shouldn't we maintain the reputation of this side together?

135
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes.

136
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Of course.

137
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Then let's make a deal.

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Don't do anything against each other anymore.

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We've already made a deal yesterday.

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We're all old.

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
We're not that childish.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Lily, you have to be careful.

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Otherwise, your business may be taken away by us.

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Taken away?

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You're so beautiful.

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Say it.

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You and Anming are...

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You mean you're not really together anymore?

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's still different to be a young couple.

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Lily, I'll sing you a song.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll sing you a song.

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Okay.

153
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'll take over the world of massage shops and black shops.

154
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'll also give Black Face a black pan.

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What are you doing?

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Mr. Chen, I'm sorry.

157
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Are you okay?

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I didn't mean to do it.

159
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But thanks to you, I was able to fulfill my dream of a child.

160
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Dream? What dream?

161
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Actually...

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Actually, I liked Lily when I was little.

163
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I knew it.

164
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You know, we were only ten years apart.

165
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
She probably doesn't remember.

166
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I said I liked her a long time ago.

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But she only treated me like a child.

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
But these past two days, I still like her.

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
But these past two days,

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
we were able to hold a date like real couples.

171
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I still like Lily.

172
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Did you guys go to the hotel?

173
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It was a script.

174
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Since you guys are in love, why did you do it?

175
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Of course not.

176
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What do you mean by in love?

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Because I think she likes you too.

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The conditions she set for you are made for you.

179
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
No way.

180
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I told her I didn't care about age.

181
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
If I said too much, she might misunderstand.

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
What's there to be afraid of?

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What if?

184
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What if?

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
From my point of view,

186
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
you're not in love at first sight.

187
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You're like a double-sided couple.

188
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I think you should try.

189
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What if you succeed?

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't leave any regrets.

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I understand.

192
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
No matter what the result is, I should try.

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Like you said, there's nothing wrong with misunderstanding.

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That's right.

195
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What if you succeed?

196
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I don't want to leave any regrets.

197
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Shuang, thank you.

198
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Go now.

199
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's too late.

200
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I can't wait to see you.

201
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
You should go now.

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm leaving.

203
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Okay.

204
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Bye.

205
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Bye.

206
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Bye.

207
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Bye.

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Bye.

209
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Bye.

210
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Bye.

211
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Bye.

212
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Bye.

213
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Bye.

214
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Good night.

215
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't get up so early.

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What are you reading?

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Did you really say something?

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I think I did.

219
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Where am I?

220
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
My home.

221
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Your home?

222
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I...

223
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Why am I in your home?

224
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
My brother said you fell into the sea.

225
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
So he got you up here.

226
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
He put you here because you were close to home.

227
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Your brother?

228
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Shuang, you're awake.

229
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Damn it.

230
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You scared me.

231
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Why are you there?

232
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm here to see you.

233
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm glad you're okay.

234
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
My brother is like this all the time.

235
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm sorry.

236
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He's your brother?

237
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yes.

238
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You guys talk.

239
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm going to make breakfast.

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
If you're in the mood, come down and eat.

241
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Okay.

242
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm going to make breakfast.

243
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay.

244
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm going to make breakfast.

245
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Bye.

246
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Bye.

247
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Bye.

248
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Bye.

249
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Bye.

250
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Bye.

251
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Bye.

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Bye.

253
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Bye.

254
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Bye.

255
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Bye.

256
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Of course.

257
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
That's my sister.

258
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Isn't this your home?

259
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Come in.

260
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I can't go in.

261
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Why?

262
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
My sister explained it to you.

263
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What are you doing?

264
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
A bread truck suddenly hit me.

265
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Is it a black bag?

266
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Who else can it be?

267
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Except for Lin Shao.

268
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Damn it.

269
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Stop it.

270
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Calm down.

271
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
What if it's Lin Shao's trap?

272
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You can't go to him.

273
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You mean...

274
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
They didn't mean to let us go to them, right?

275
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
They didn't.

276
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
So calm down.

277
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Find the evidence first.

278
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I can't do that.

279
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I can't stand it.

280
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
A Ming.

281
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You treat Shuang as your brother.

282
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
He's really happy.

283
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What's wrong with you?

284
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You should tell Brother Anxiu.

285
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Tell him to investigate it.

286
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm at your home.

287
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll take a rest.

288
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I won't go back to the room.

289
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'll see what's going on with the black bag.

290
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I know.

291
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I've told my sister.

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
She'll take good care of you.

293
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Come down and eat.

294
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'll go down in my clothes.

295
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll go down in my clothes.

296
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Kid.

297
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You are...

298
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm Chen Tianshuang.

299
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What's your name?

300
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Huihui.

301
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
How old are you?

302
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Are you here to see my sister?

303
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Don't talk nonsense.

304
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We just met.

305
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You just met and you came to my home.

306
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You slept.

307
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You don't know me.

308
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You don't know me.

309
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I can't sleep.

310
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm not sleeping.

311
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You slept.

312
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You're shameless.

313
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm your brother's friend.

314
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm your brother's friend.

315
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Don't talk nonsense.

316
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
No.

317
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You don't like my sister.

318
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You don't understand.

319
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You don't understand.

320
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You're a thief.

321
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You're a coward.

322
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Huihui.

323
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Why do you bully others?

324
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
He's right.

325
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm a bad guy.

326
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What? Are you hungry?

327
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Eat an egg.

328
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's delicious.

329
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Eat slowly.

330
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
No one will steal it from you.

331
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
He's so impatient.

332
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
He's like A-Ming.

333
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Huihui.

334
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Call me brother.

335
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Why A-Ming doesn't go home?

336
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
He's playing with Luo.

337
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Luo?

338
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Dad, did you vote last night?

339
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No.

340
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You lied to me.

341
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I went to the cinema.

342
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You're a drunkard.

343
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
You saw it.

344
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Luo is like this.

345
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
He and A-Ming had a bad relationship.

346
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
A-Ming wanted to be a gang.

347
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Luo said,

348
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm a gang.

349
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I don't want to be in this family.

350
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
A-Ming said,

351
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Okay.

352
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
They never said a word.

353
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
They're like strangers.

354
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You're family.

355
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
You can't talk.

356
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Men.

357
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Huihui.

358
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You haven't given me the score yet.

359
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm full.

360
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm going to school.

361
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You didn't even take your bag.

362
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Wait.

363
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm sorry.
