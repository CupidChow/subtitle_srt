1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:27,240
Survivors

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:57,600
Does he dare to do that many people?

3
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
No.

4
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,040
Help me teach Uncle Han.

5
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,760
Now?

6
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,400
I have something to tell him.

7
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,320
Hurry up.

8
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Okay.

9
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
I'll be right there.

10
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,960
I haven't come yet.

11
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,960
Uncle Han.

12
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,440
Brother He wants you to go.

13
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,960
Take care of him.

14
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,320
He.

15
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,920
So many people are waiting for you outside.

16
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,720
Tell me if you need anything.

17
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,720
Aren't you there?

18
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
Uncle Han.

19
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Hi.

20
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,040
I'll be there right away.

21
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,320
Okay.

22
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,240
You're a man of your word.

23
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,040
Why are you so serious?

24
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,680
What are you talking about?

25
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Tell me.

26
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,640
Actually, I've thought about it.

27
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,080
It's too dangerous to be a assistant.

28
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,640
This position...

29
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,240
doesn't have to be mine.

30
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
He.

31
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,640
You mean...

32
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
Uncle Han.

33
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,280
Why don't you be the assistant?

34
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
I...

35
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,120
I can do it.

36
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,160
We're family.

37
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,160
It's the same.

38
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,560
Ask me a condition.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Go ahead.

40
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
When I hug you,

41
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,560
I must hug you.

42
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,200
Of course.

43
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
But, He.

44
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,400
We need evidence to find the murderer.

45
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,920
We have to take our time.

46
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,600
Isn't it clear who the murderer is?

47
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,880
Tianhai Gate did it.

48
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,120
But there are so many people in Tianhai Gate.

49
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,000
It can't be the murderer.

50
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,480
Who did it?

51
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,360
Do we have to investigate it?

52
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm not sure who did it.

53
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,120
But I've found the assistant.

54
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
Xia.

55
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Tell me.

56
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,120
I can handle it.

57
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,880
You.

58
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,120
He.

59
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,480
You're kidding, right?

60
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,920
How could it be me?

61
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:16,920
What do you think?

62
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
Pan Tu.

63
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
He's here.

64
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,680
Let's go and check.

65
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Be careful.

66
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
You.

67
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I'll kill you.

68
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,360
You want to kill me?

69
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,160
Come on.

70
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,360
I'll kill you.

71
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:39,240
solo

72
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,200
XIN!

73
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,980
XIN!

74
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,760
XIN!

75
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,380
brotha

76
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
dero suitable

77
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
hide

78
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,620
de de da de de

79
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,620
da da de da

80
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,900
Fight!

81
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,900
Hi!

82
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,700
Hi!

83
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
Go!

84
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,900
He's the first, but not the last!

85
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,900
I'll be back to be blind the day people beat me!

86
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,020
The last structure was taken down till now, right?

87
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,900
Yes.

88
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,040
Descendants of two Generally called Gods and Gods encountered in the case of Lin雪凌.

89
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,960
Now that you brought it up, why要走這條路?

90
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,960
Type it the same way, just similarly.

91
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
Let's go.

92
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
I'm going to see Bo Bo.

93
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Do you know what fishing is?

94
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,960
What kind of fish?

95
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,960
It's a pity.

96
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,960
What is it?

97
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,960
If you want to fish, come here.

98
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
There's no fish here.

99
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
What do you mean?

100
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,960
You didn't watch the news?

101
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Oh.

102
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,900
You mean the

103
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,900
city of the wild?

104
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,900
Fish?

105
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:12,900
I can't stand it.

106
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,900
People should be fine.

107
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,400
Tianhai Gate,

108
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,900
Daxia's coming,

109
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,900
high-end.

110
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,900
So that's why.

111
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,900
Yes.

112
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,900
I'll leave it to you.

113
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,900
Leave what to us?

114
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,900
The department approved it.

115
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,380
But the

116
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,060
change of the

117
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,060
rules.

118
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,060
It's troublesome.

119
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:43,060
There are people who don't know the rules.

120
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,060
Someone should come out and persuade them.

121
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:51,060
Like you to persuade Lin Yonglin?

122
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,060
According to your plan,

123
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,060
the future of this place

124
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,220
is different from now.

125
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,220
The old won't go, the new won't come.

126
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,220
If you five are willing to cooperate,

127
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,220
I'll help you.

128
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,220
What do you think?

129
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,220
What do you mean?

130
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,220
Why are you here today?

131
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,220
I'm sorry.

132
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,220
Business is not quick.

133
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,220
If you're not available today,

134
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,220
I can come tomorrow.

135
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,220
No need.

136
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,220
I'm available now.

137
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,220
Brother.

138
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,220
It's enough.

139
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,220
I'm sorry.

140
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,220
We don't want to

141
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,220
destroy the black-faced gang.

142
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,220
We just want the town

143
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,220
not to be too much disturbed by them.

144
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,220
So why are you saying

145
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,220
what you mean?

146
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,220
We are willing to help.

147
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,220
But there are conditions.

148
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,220
Is it?

149
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,220
What do you think?

150
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,220
That gun

151
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,220
is the gift I gave you.

152
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,220
What do you want in return?

153
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,220
Your father told you

154
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,220
what business

155
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:53,220
we were in?

156
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,220
Impossible.

157
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,220
I'm sorry.

158
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,220
Don't be so hasty.

159
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,220
Think about it.

160
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,220
Travel is the basic

161
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,220
of Lian'an town.

162
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,220
As you said,

163
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,220
we have to change our business

164
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,220
since the factory came.

165
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,220
Is it good?

166
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,220
The world is changing.

167
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,220
Changing a method

168
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,220
is not necessarily a bad thing.

169
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,380
We can't change the good.

170
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,380
Ask the people here.

171
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,380
As far as I know,

172
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,380
they

173
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,380
don't want to change.

174
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,380
We have some differences.

175
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,380
But it doesn't matter.

176
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,380
We are here to help.

177
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,380
Then I'll go first.

178
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,540
Goodbye.

179
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,540
Chen Tianshuang, right?

180
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,740
Am I that smart?

181
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:10,740
If you were the owner of the hall,

182
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,740
would you be so stubborn?

183
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,740
I can't

184
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,740
be your brother.

185
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,740
You said that

186
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,740
you would help me.

187
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,740
It's not hard to be a brother.

188
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,740
You are the brother

189
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,740
if you are gone.

190
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,740
Are you kidding me?

191
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,740
You have time to fish with me.

192
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:52,740
I'm sure of it.

193
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,740
You are not going to forgive me.

194
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,740
I'm going to be your brother.

195
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,740
How can you do that?

196
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,740
You should think it over.

197
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,740
Don't think that

198
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,740
you are the real brother

199
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,740
because of their brother.

200
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,740
So many people were there.

201
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,740
Only one person can help you.

202
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,740
The others are all the guests.

203
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,740
If you are good,

204
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,740
they will treat you as a brother.

205
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,740
If you are not good,

206
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,740
they will send you to Tianhai Gate.

207
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,740
What about you?

208
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,740
I'm your last life-saving straw.

209
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,740
You have no choice.

210
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,740
I have no choice.

211
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,740
Yes,

212
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,740
I have no choice.

213
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,740
But you are the same.

214
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,740
You have no choice.

215
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,740
I have tried to help you.

216
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,740
But you don't know what you are doing.

217
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,740
No one can help you.

218
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,740
What can you do?

219
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,740
If you can do anything,

220
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,740
why are you hitting me?

221
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,740
So I am your last life-saving straw.

222
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,740
You can't only add price,

223
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:22,740
you have to lower the price.

224
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,740
You are crazy.

225
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,740
If you don't cooperate with me,

226
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,740
you will die when Tianhai Gate comes.

227
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,740
You will die.

228
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,740
Tianhai Gate.

229
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,740
I will do it.

230
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,740
Yes, I am crazy.

231
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,740
But you are not.

232
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,740
You can't beat me.

233
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,740
I can do anything.

234
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,740
Do you dare?

235
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,740
Do you dare?

236
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,740
I got the news that

237
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,740
Jiajie is cooperating with Lin Pinghe.

238
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,740
So we have to act now.

239
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,740
What about Lin Pinghe?

240
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,740
Lin Pinghe has called Tianhai Gate.

241
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,740
Tell them to eliminate the murderer.

242
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,740
Otherwise, they will die.

243
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,740
Tianhai Gate hasn't responded yet.

244
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,740
Let them fight.

245
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,740
We just need to do something.

246
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,740
The fight and grudge in the gang

247
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,740
have nothing to do with us.

248
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,740
But if it involves Lin Anzhen,

249
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,740
it will be our fault.

250
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,740
What can Tianhai Gate do?

251
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,740
We saw Lin Yongning die in front of us.

252
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,740
Now Lin Pinghe has to act now.

253
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,740
I guess it won't be long before

254
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,740
the Black Lotus Gang is over.

255
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,740
Why do we have to be involved?

256
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,740
I always say

257
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,740
to protect Lin Anzhen.

258
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,740
To protect Lin Anzhen.

259
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,740
Actually, it's to protect

260
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,740
those I know and those I don't.

261
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,740
To be honest, I've been here for six years.

262
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,740
I care about them very much.

263
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,740
Do you understand what I mean?

264
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,740
You said so much.

265
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,740
You just want me to deal with Jiajie?

266
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,740
You finally heard it.

267
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,740
Say it.

268
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,740
How to act this play?

269
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,740
Very simple.

270
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,740
We have to cooperate.

271
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,740
We have to be careful.

272
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,740
What's the plan?

273
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,740
You told him the Five Lakes Alliance

274
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,740
would help him deal with the people around him.

275
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,740
But it's not convenient for people

276
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,740
to show up in public.

277
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,740
We need help.

278
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,740
We almost forgot the police.

279
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,740
I can help you with the next two steps.

280
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,740
But it's up to you

281
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,740
to gain his trust.

282
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,740
This is the hardest part.

283
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,740
When I saw you come back last time,

284
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,740
you were very excited.

285
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,740
It's a play.

286
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,740
So Jiajie is an old

287
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,740
playboy.

288
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,740
You have to do your best.

289
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,740
For Lin Anzhen's peace,

290
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,740
I have to sacrifice myself.

291
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,740
At least the shadow

292
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,740
still occupies the person.
