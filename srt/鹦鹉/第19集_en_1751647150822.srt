1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,540
Komatsun microwaves

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'm going to get a cup of tea.

3
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'm going to get a cup of tea.

4
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm going to get a cup of tea.

5
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Xiaoleini.

6
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
How is it?

7
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Are you used to it?

8
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's okay now.

9
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Can you drink it?

10
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Just a little.

11
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Thank you for taking care of our Amina.

12
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We take care of each other.

13
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're pretty good.

14
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Really?

15
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Are you praising me?

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Qiqi said you're a big radish.

17
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Big radish?

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It's a flower.

19
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm not a flower.

20
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You know how to play the game of chess.

21
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I was playing it too.

22
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I was the boss for a few years.

23
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But I met a thousand people.

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I couldn't do anything.

25
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The boss said I have a name and a profit.

26
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
He wanted me to take over.

27
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I was the boss at that time.

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
How could I possibly take over?

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And then?

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm still the boss.

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why is it not important to me?

32
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You're important.

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Uncle Wei.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Thank you for telling me this.

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm touched.

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's just that...

37
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm not familiar with the world.

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I just stepped in halfway.

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Xiaoling, I've seen a lot of people.

40
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You're not fit to be the boss.

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Are you praising me or mocking me?

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Don't be so arrogant.

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why haven't I seen you eat at home recently?

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I have a thick skin.

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But I have a sense of propriety.

46
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I can't eat every day.

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's not appropriate.

48
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Is it appropriate?

49
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay.

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'll be there when I have time.

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I'll tell Ming about this today.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't tell him I told you.

53
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay?

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
And don't tell anyone about this.

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Okay?

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You're not my type.

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You're not my type.

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You'll have to drink a lot.

60
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You'll have to hug me.

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
How can I be sorry?

62
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Okay.

63
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll eat at home when I have time.

64
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll be there when I have time.

65
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What are you doing?

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Are you going to run away with me?

67
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I believe that as long as you're here,

69
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
no matter where you are,

70
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
you'll be the best.

71
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Come here when you have time.

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Don't be afraid.

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay?

74
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Brother Sheng.

75
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I didn't fall asleep.

76
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Go back and rest. I'll watch you.

77
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm fine. I can do it.

78
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Go ahead.

79
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Okay.

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Brother Sheng.

81
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm sorry.

82
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'll go back and rest.

83
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'll be back when I have time.

84
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Go ahead.

85
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll be back.

86
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll be back.

87
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll be back.

88
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Brother Sheng.

89
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'll be back.

90
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll be back.

91
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'll be back.

92
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll be back.

93
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'll be back.

94
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You pushed me.

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You told me that I shouldn't do that again.

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What are you doing now?

97
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You're the leader.

98
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What are you going to do

99
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
with us?

100
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'll do whatever I can.

101
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You're a fool.

102
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You're a fool.

103
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You were sleeping well.

104
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Why did you talk so much?

105
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm so annoyed.

106
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Brother Sheng, you're awake.

107
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Brother Sheng, you're so hardworking.

108
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You're so hardworking.

109
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Brother Sheng.

110
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Thank you.

111
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You're all so kind.

112
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You should go home.

113
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Don't stand here and watch your family.

114
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
When I'm out of the hospital,

115
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'll see you fans.

116
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Let's go.

117
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Brother Sheng, you're so kind.

118
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You stay here.

119
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm talking about you.

120
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll go home with you.

121
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Have a good rest.

122
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
You should go home and rest.

123
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Okay.

124
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Brother Sheng, how do you feel?

125
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I can't die.

126
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But I want to come back alive.

127
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's not that fast.

128
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
You're kidding.

129
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It seems like you're fine.

130
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You can leave the hospital today.

131
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Did you find the gunman?

132
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Not yet.

133
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But don't worry.

134
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'll find him.

135
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
To be honest,

136
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't know if I really found the gunman.

137
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Let's assume it's Tian Hainan.

138
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
And then?

139
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Turn around?

140
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Maybe this is what Tian Hainan is waiting for.

141
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So we just have to endure it?

142
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
We can't.

143
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
We can endure it once.

144
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Next time?

145
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
If the Five Red Forces can endure it,

146
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
what about the others?

147
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What will people do after I'm out of the hospital?

148
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
A Ming is very excited.

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
He wants to take revenge on you.

150
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What about the others?

151
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The others?

152
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
First, Black Face.

153
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Then, Aolin.

154
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Now, it's me.

155
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
If An Le comes tomorrow,

156
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
how many people do you think will stay?

157
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Except A Ming.

158
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I don't think anyone else will go.

159
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You're the one who's going to change the city.

160
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What should you do?

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I don't think we have enough power.

162
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We need help.

163
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Tian Sha,

164
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
you have to run for me.

165
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
As the leader of the Five Red Forces.

166
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Why didn't you add some sweet soup?

167
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You're sick?

168
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Give it to me.

169
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Don't worry.

170
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You don't think it was Tian Anlin who did it?

171
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No.

172
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
If it was me, I would have gone to the cemetery.

173
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
We're still friends.

174
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Friends?

175
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
When we were in Black Face,

176
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
your men shot us.

177
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Do you know?

178
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It was an accident.

179
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Was it just an accident?

180
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What else?

181
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Your leader Tian Yaimeng helped us out.

182
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Do you have to thank me?

183
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Thank you.

184
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You're welcome.

185
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's normal for a man to sweat.

186
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I've found out

187
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
that I like this place more and more.

188
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm getting to know

189
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
the people here better.

190
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You're really cute.

191
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
No wonder you always come to my house.

192
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Don't worry.

193
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
We'll be fine.

194
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Okay.

195
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
We're friends.

196
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Brother Long, are you okay?

197
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I'm much better.

198
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Brother Ah Xiu asked me to take him to the meeting.

199
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm doing my best to support him.

200
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
He asked you to take him?

201
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He's the leader.

202
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm taking him.

203
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That's good.

204
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It took a lot of effort.

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
But it's satisfying.

206
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yes.

207
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's good to be a good leader.

208
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's good to get close to Brother Ah Xiu.

209
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
At first, I thought I really cared about them.

210
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I just got out of the city.

211
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm going to a new place.

212
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Brother Teng, what should I do?

213
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You're the only one left.

214
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Be careful.

215
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm not far from here.

216
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'll come back.

217
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I've asked about the situation.

218
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Brother Ah Xiu said

219
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
it's not a peaceful meeting.

220
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
He wants to be the next leader.

221
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
He wants to be the next leader.

222
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
He wants to be the next leader.

223
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
According to Brother Ah Xiu,

224
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
the leader of the general is old.

225
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
He's been sick for a long time.

226
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He has little time.

227
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
And his two children have their own power in the gang.

228
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
He wants peace for his children.

229
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So he's going to the general meeting

230
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
because of the inheritance.

231
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
He invited all the parties to attend.

232
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The organization's mission

233
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
is to let me stand on the side of the debate

234
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
and make some contributions.

235
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Then I can be the next leader.

236
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Then I can be the next leader.

237
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
By then,

238
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'll be a businessman

239
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and get some benefits.

240
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Then I'll get the information about the underground air traffic.

241
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's easy to say.

242
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Who's not a leader?

243
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
You're a commoner.

244
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You must make some contributions.

245
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes, I must.

246
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
There must be a way to the mountain.

247
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But Tianhai Gate is here.

248
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm not there.

249
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
With the power of the Five Lakes Alliance in Lian'an Town,

250
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
you can't fight against Tianhai Gate

251
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
whether you're there or not.

252
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But if you can get an assistant from the Alliance,

253
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
things will be different.

254
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I think so, too.

255
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It depends on your ability.

256
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Brother Wang,

257
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I have a favor to ask you.

258
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Go ahead.

259
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You're not bothering me.

260
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I know it's not convenient for you to stand on the side of the debate.

261
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
But when I'm not there,

262
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
can you help me

263
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,040
to stop the

264
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,000
Qiqi's case?

265
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
You're worried about them?

266
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Tianhai Gate is not here today.

267
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
They threatened me in person.

268
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Don't worry.

269
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Protecting the people is our responsibility.

270
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
If anything happens,

271
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'll let you know.

272
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Thank you for being here.

273
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What can you do without me?

274
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What do you think?

275
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Brother Wang,

276
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I haven't been here for a long time.

277
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You must be here for a long time.

278
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Yes.

279
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Do you miss home?

280
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm different from you.

281
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You have a specific task when you come here.

282
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
When I came here,

283
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I said I wouldn't stay long.

284
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Maybe two or three years.

285
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Maybe I'll stay here forever.

286
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Forever?

287
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You won't go back to China?

288
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I don't know.

289
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I opened this store to have an identity.

290
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Now I think I'm the owner of this restaurant.

291
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I watch food videos when I'm free.

292
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Sometimes,

293
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
you live in the drama.

294
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
You can't tell which one is the drama.

295
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Brother Wang,

296
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
isn't this your first time working undercover?

297
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Of course not.

298
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
When I was in the police force,

299
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I didn't want to tell you

300
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
the past.

301
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What about you, Qian Shuang?

302
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The secret agent

303
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
and the businessman

304
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
are all your secrets.
