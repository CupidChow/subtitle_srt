00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,720
You can go and rest. I'll be watching here.

8
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,720
Brother Shang.

9
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,720
You're here.

10
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,720
I'm here.

11
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,720
I'm here.

12
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
I'm here.

13
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
I'm here.

14
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,720
I'm here.

15
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,720
Eat something.

16
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,720
Don't blame yourself.

17
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,720
The doctor said that you'll be fine after you get the vaccine.

18
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,720
You're not in danger.

19
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,720
I just don't know when I'll be able to wake up.

20
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
I'm here.

21
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
Damn it.

22
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,720
No one dares to do this to them.

23
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
I'll go there tomorrow.

24
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,720
A Mei.

25
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,720
Don't be impulsive.

26
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,720
Brother Shang.

27
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,720
You didn't talk just now.

28
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,720
I'm worried that you have a mental problem.

29
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Who touched it?

30
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
There's no conclusion yet.

31
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
The gang is gone.

32
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,720
Who else can it be?

33
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,720
Is there any evidence?

34
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Even if it's from Tianhai Gate,

35
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
what do you want?

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,720
Kill the leader?

37
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,720
Or blow up Tianhai Gate?

38
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,720
Damn it.

39
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,720
I'll find out who touched it.

40
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,720
Don't be impulsive.

41
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,720
You're a member of the Five Lakes Alliance now.

42
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,720
You have to discuss with everyone first.

43
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,720
Do you hear me?

44
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
I know.

45
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,720
You're right.

46
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,720
I should eat something.

47
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,720
I'll settle this debt with them.

48
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
You watch over there.

49
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,720
Let's go.

50
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:27,060
the

51
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,060
I thought I hit him.

52
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,060
He was rescued by the bait.

53
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,060
Where are you going?

54
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,060
I'm going to see if there are other clues at the scene.

55
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,060
You've been looking for the whole night.

56
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,060
What if?

57
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:43,060
What you should do now is to sleep well.

58
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,060
I can't sleep.

59
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,060
You have to sleep even if you can't sleep.

60
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,060
Don't worry.

61
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,060
I have to worry.

62
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,060
Don't worry.

63
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,060
Tian Shuang,

64
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,060
you can't be too grateful now.

65
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,060
You have to be grateful.

66
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,060
I'm not.

67
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,060
I'm not.

68
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,060
I'm not.

69
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,060
You can't be emotional now.

70
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,060
I'm emotional.

71
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,060
Now, Ah Xiu is lying in the hospital.

72
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,060
I don't know if he can wake up.

73
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,060
Do you know why?

74
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,060
Because you were attacked.

75
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,060
He was shot.

76
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,060
You're not...

77
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,060
Because of me.

78
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,060
Tian Shuang,

79
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,060
things have happened.

80
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,060
Calm down.

81
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,060
I can't calm down.

82
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,060
I shouldn't be the one who survived.

83
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,060
Why?

84
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,060
Why do you say?

85
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,060
Why is it always me?

86
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,060
It's my fault.

87
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,060
They should be the one to bear the consequences.

88
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,060
Why did you come to me?

89
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,060
Come to me!

90
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,060
Come to me!

91
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,060
I don't know!

92
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,060
Come to me!

93
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,060
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,060
It's okay.

95
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,060
I'm okay.

96
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,060
I'm too excited.

97
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,060
I'm sorry.

98
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,060
It's okay.

99
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,060
Tian Shuang,

100
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,060
you really have to rest.

101
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,060
I can't rest.

102
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,060
I can't rest.

103
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,060
I have to find the murderer.

104
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,060
But don't worry.

105
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,060
I won't be found.

106
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,060
It's reasonable to find the murderer.

107
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,060
I'm not afraid of you being exposed.

108
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,060
I'm worried about you.

109
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,060
I'm your contact.

110
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,060
I have to be responsible for the mission.

111
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,060
I have to be responsible for you.

112
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,060
What are you worried about?

113
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,060
Tian Shuang,

114
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,060
we feel like

115
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,060
a lot of things have passed.

116
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,060
Actually, it didn't.

117
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,060
We have something in our hearts.

118
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,060
It doesn't mean we're weak.

119
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,060
But if we can't solve this,

120
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,060
it might be too late.

121
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,060
I'm fine.

122
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,060
How about this?

123
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,060
I'll arrange it.

124
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,060
You go to see Xu Chu.

125
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,060
I have nothing to talk to him.

126
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,060
Maybe he has.

127
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,060
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,060
About your situation,

129
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,060
A'Long has told me.

130
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,060
He's exaggerating.

131
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,060
It's not that serious.

132
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,060
I was a little emotional.

133
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,060
I haven't done it for two years.

134
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,060
It's half of the job.

135
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,060
You explain it.

136
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,060
So you mean

137
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,060
it's just an accident

138
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,060
that he's so popular this time?

139
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,060
It's just a small accident.

140
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,060
People

141
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,060
have been acting.

142
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,060
It's normal to be a little bit more.

143
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,060
That's good.

144
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,060
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,060
Are you done?

146
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,060
Yes.

147
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,060
Nothing else?

148
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,060
I'll leave you alone.

149
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,060
Don't worry.

150
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:12,060
It will take a while to get back.

151
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,060
It's been a long time.

152
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,060
Just talk to me.

153
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,060
Okay.

154
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,060
What are you talking about?

155
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,060
I was too anxious when I saw you last time.

156
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,060
It was just a mission.

157
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,060
Let me tell you

158
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,060
how you've been these two years.

159
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,060
It's great.

160
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,060
I'm smart.

161
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,060
I can do anything.

162
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,060
You did a good job.

163
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,060
I'm late for the industry.

164
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,060
Two years earlier,

165
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,060
I'm the king of the water industry now.

166
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,060
So

167
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,060
I'm the one who's delayed you.

168
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,060
Of course you're the one who's delayed me.

169
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,060
Let's not talk about anything else.

170
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,060
You just ask Brother Long

171
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,060
how I've been doing in Lianan Town.

172
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,060
Not to mention the mission on my body.

173
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,060
I'm a very famous person

174
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:00,060
in Lianan Town now.

175
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,060
What about now?

176
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,060
Will you still be unable to figure it out?

177
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,060
What do you mean by still?

178
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,060
I'm a happy man.

179
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,060
Will I be unable to figure it out?

180
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,060
If I don't let you go after the accident,

181
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,060
you'll decide

182
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,060
which mission is the most risky

183
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,060
and which one you'll do.

184
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,060
Right?

185
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,060
Actually,

186
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,060
a young man like you

187
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,060
is a rare talent.

188
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,060
But if you're going to leave,

189
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,060
I have no choice.

190
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,060
Do you think

191
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,060
I was wrong?

192
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,060
Tian Liang's blow to you

193
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,060
might be

194
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,060
bigger than you imagined.

195
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,060
I can tell you now

196
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,060
that you were

197
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,060
a little bit

198
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,060
what I mean

199
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,060
to ask for a release.

200
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,060
I'm sorry.

201
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,060
I was asking for a release.

202
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,060
I was.

203
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,060
Ever since that time,

204
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,060
I've been like this.

205
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,060
I told you I was leaving

206
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,060
and wanted to change my life.

207
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,060
Actually, I lied to you.

208
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,060
I just thought

209
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,060
if Tian Liang wasn't the one who died,

210
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:46,060
it would be me.

211
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,060
The bullet

212
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,060
was fired at me.

213
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,060
Tian Liang pushed me away

214
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,060
and got me killed.

215
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,060
And then,

216
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,060
sometimes I thought,

217
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,060
why is God so unfair?

218
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,060
Why should God

219
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,060
do this to me?

220
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,060
Why?

221
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,060
You're right.

222
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,060
I just wanted to get rid of it.

223
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,060
That way, I wouldn't feel bad.

224
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,060
But Tian Liang is gone.

225
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,060
So I changed my life.

226
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,060
Two years have passed.

227
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,060
I thought I was used to it.

228
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,060
I got used to it.

229
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,060
I forgot the past.

230
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,060
I didn't.

231
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,060
I was lying to myself.

232
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,060
Now, there's another time.

233
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,060
The people around me

234
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,060
blocked a bullet

235
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
that belonged to me

236
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,060
and was about to kill me.

237
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,060
I can't stand it anymore.

238
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,060
I said, why?

239
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,060
Why is it that every time it's not me?

240
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,060
Calm down.

241
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,060
Maybe

242
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,060
everyone needs it.

243
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,060
Don't say that, Xu Chu.

244
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,060
Everyone needs it.

245
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,060
That's what I thought.

246
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,060
Now,

247
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,060
I'll tell you this.

248
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,060
I won't go too far.

249
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,060
I haven't been in Lianan for long.

250
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,060
Right?

251
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,060
A Ming got stabbed.

252
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,060
Long got injured.

253
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,060
Xiu got shot.

254
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,060
Even Lin Bing and the Black Lotus Gang

255
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,060
got shot.

256
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,060
Do you think I'm a bad guy?

257
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,060
Where did I go wrong?

258
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,060
I was the one who got involved in Lianan.

259
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,060
I was the one who got involved in Lianan.

260
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,060
I'm not bad.

261
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,060
I think I'm much better

262
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,060
than them.

263
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,060
What you said is a bad thing.

264
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,060
I hope so.

265
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,060
But I think

266
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,060
if I didn't come,

267
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,060
they might be fine.

268
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,060
When you were young,

269
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,060
you always liked to

270
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,060
cheer for yourself.

271
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,060
When you were my age,

272
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,060
you'll understand.

273
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,060
Everything

274
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,060
wasn't so good

275
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,060
but it wasn't so bad.

276
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,060
I'm still young.

277
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,060
Although you came back from the mountains,

278
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,060
you've been in the organization

279
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,060
for a few years.

280
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,060
You've been in the organization

281
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,060
for a few years.

282
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,060
You're actually

283
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,060
a newbie.

284
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,060
Half a newbie, half a newbie.

285
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,060
If the organization

286
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,060
gives the task to this kind of person,

287
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,060
can he take the responsibility?

288
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,060
I hope you can say that

289
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,060
you're a promising person.

290
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,060
Since you're a newbie

291
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,060
in the outside world,

292
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,060
it's normal to be a little confused.

293
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,060
But you mustn't be in a hurry.

294
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,060
I heard that

295
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,060
no matter what others think,

296
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,060
or even no matter what you think,

297
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,060
I have to tell you firmly

298
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,060
that the organization needs you.

299
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,060
I need you.

300
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,060
Your friends need you.

301
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,060
Are you sure?

302
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,060
Because I believe

303
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,060
as long as you're here,

304
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,060
no matter where you are,

305
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,060
or anywhere else,

306
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,060
in the end,

307
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,060
everything will be fine.

308
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,060
You're an adult.

309
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,060
You're still doing this.

310
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,060
Enough. Don't coax me.

311
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,060
I'm not quitting.

312
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,060
I'm serious.

313
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,060
I'm serious.

314
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,060
Okay, I'm serious.

315
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,060
When you came here,

316
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,060
you said you didn't want to do it.

317
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,060
But after seeing the sunrise,

318
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:11,060
you changed your mind.

319
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,060
The sunrise is so scary,

320
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,060
but I never planned to leave it.

321
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,060
So I think

322
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,060
since I'm living for it,

323
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,060
I can't just sit around and wait.

324
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,060
Otherwise, she'll be angry.

325
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,060
Right?

326
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,060
Don't be so guilty.

327
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,060
I'm not guilty.

328
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,060
I'm just starting over.

329
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,060
Tianzhuang,

330
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,060
let me tell you.

331
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,060
What happened that day

332
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,060
wasn't your fault.

333
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,060
I know.

334
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,060
Let me say it again.

335
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,060
It wasn't your fault.

336
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:04,060
I know.

337
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
You don't know.

338
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,060
It really wasn't your fault.

339
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,060
It wasn't.

340
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,060
It was.

341
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,060
I'm sorry.
