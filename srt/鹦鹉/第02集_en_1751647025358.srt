1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,220
The OBSCAD

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,400
Here it goes.

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
If you don't do that, how can you know your current state of mind?

4
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm already gone. What state of mind?

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Indeed, you've changed a lot in the past two years.

6
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But the key things are loyalty, discipline, and willpower.

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The most important thing is that you still have the fire in your heart.

8
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What fire?

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm relying on water now. I'm working on seafood.

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Didn't I say I wouldn't let you work on seafood?

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
For this mission, you're the most suitable person to make the decision.

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Mission?

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You've organized so many youths' talent shows. Why must you look for me?

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
For the mission's goal, you're the closest to their conditions.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You've been trained professionally, and you've also tested your performance.

16
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How is it? Let's go.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
How long?

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I can't say.

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Is the treatment good?

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
It's basically self-sufficient.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Is there any security?

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What do you think?

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You're a secretary, and you don't even have a cake.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
This may be necessary for others, but not for you.

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Because you didn't come here for this.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
But you still did.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Whether you do it or not, it's all up to your own thoughts.

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Two years have passed.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Now the organization needs you.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You still need to think about it.

31
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I've changed in the past two years.

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm different from before.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I was young and crazy, I didn't fear anything.

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Now I've slowly found that I'm more and more like Tian Liang.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm starting to be afraid.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Afraid of what?

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Afraid of everything.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Afraid of being useless, afraid of dying from old age, afraid of being helpless.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Afraid that one day I'll be impulsive

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and give Tian Liang back his life.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Do you know what I'm most afraid of?

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Afraid of what happened back then?

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I've told you many times.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Zhang Tian Liang's death is not your fault.

45
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I understand.

46
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't want to experience the same thing again.

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I think I'm doing well here.

48
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm getting used to it.

49
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Mingzhe, do you think you're more and more like Tian Liang?

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let me ask you.

51
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Do you know what kind of person Tian Liang is?

52
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What kind of person?

53
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Have you ever thought about it?

54
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Tian Liang is so secretive, so passionate about life.

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
But why does he have to take such a dangerous trip?

56
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Have you ever thought about it?

57
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What is this?

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Tian Liang's diary.

59
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
We found it after you left.

60
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Tian Liang's diary.

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Mingzhe, you may not think you're like the old days.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But in my opinion,

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
you couldn't do this job back then.

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But you can now.

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Why?

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
How about this?

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
When you finish reading Tian Liang's diary,

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
no matter what kind of choices you make,

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I won't talk to you again.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't need it.

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I definitely won't go.

72
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The mission is in Taiwan?

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The personnel of the Taiwan Military Police Bureau

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
are not allowed to visit the site.

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
They need to pass through a special underground traffic line.

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's the same as many things in Taiwan.

77
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
These gray lines are not easy to manage by the military police.

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
They are in the hands of the gangsters.

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So you need someone to go to Taiwan and enter the gang's internal affairs.

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And get information about the traffic line.

81
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
One more thing.

82
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The old man who has been in contact with you in Taiwan,

83
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
is actually more concerned with the local gangsters.

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Brother He, I'm going to throw it.

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Three, two, one.

86
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
That's great, Brother He.

87
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
A warrior who's a warrior.

88
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Take that one.

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This one?

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's too small.

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Take it.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Be careful not to hurt me.

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Be careful.

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's too small.

95
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Be careful.

96
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Damn it.

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
We're gangsters.

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It looks like nothing's wrong.

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But one day,

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
we'll be in trouble.

101
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We need to practice more.

102
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Practice more.

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Where's the man in the military uniform?

104
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The man in the military uniform.

105
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hey, you.

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You're a cosplayer?

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You're so cool.

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You're so cool.

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You're so cool.

110
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You're so cool.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
How do you get to the Five-Tiger Alliance?

112
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The Five-Tiger Alliance?

113
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Look, there's a road here.

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
There's a crossroad that leads to the other side.

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You're a douchebag.

116
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Where are you from?

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm from the mainland.

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm here to travel.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
What's up?

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Why are you looking for the Five-Tiger Alliance?

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What's up?

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Why are you looking for the Five-Tiger Alliance?

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
God damn it.

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You're so annoying.

125
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No, no.

126
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Don't say that.

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Don't do it.

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What?

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What's wrong?

130
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
God damn it.

131
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Say that again.

132
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You're the Five-Tiger Alliance.

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Why are you doing this?

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
What's wrong with you?

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What's wrong with you?

137
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Are you crazy?

138
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What are you doing?

139
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Are you crazy?

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Are you crazy?

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What?

142
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm sorry.

144
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Help me.

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Brother He.

148
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Come on.

149
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't spray it.

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I won.

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
He's the one who hit me first.

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Are you okay?

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Who?

154
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Brother He.

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Why are you so bad?

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The Black Lotus Gang is so good.

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Brother, be civilized.

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't use the spray.

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
He's using the knife to cut me.

160
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I don't allow myself to be on the science show.

161
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You're the one who destroyed the Black Lotus Gang first.

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What nonsense?

163
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You're not the one who stole the knife.

164
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I know martial arts, too.

165
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Are you sure?

166
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sure.

167
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Come on.

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Don't be so crazy, kid.

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What are you doing?

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I told you.

171
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm here to travel.

172
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Remember.

173
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
My name is Chen Tianshuang.

174
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Why are you so crazy?

175
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You're Chen Tianshuang.

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Do you know the Black Lotus Gang?

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You're dead.

178
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You're so rude.

179
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You hit my ass again.

180
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
What are you doing?

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It hurts.

182
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Go away.

183
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Go away.

184
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Go away.

185
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Go away.

186
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Go away.

187
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You're crazy, aren't you?

188
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I'm telling you.

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm Chen Tianshuang.

190
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll show you what crazy is.

191
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Get up.

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'll kill you.

193
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What are you doing?

194
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll kill you.

195
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll kill you.

196
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Shut up.

197
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'll kill you.

198
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Get out of here.

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll kill you.

200
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What are you doing?

201
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't be so rude.

202
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Open your mouth.

203
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Open your mouth.

204
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Stop yelling.

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You're not old enough.

206
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Can you keep your mouth clean?

207
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I have a question.

208
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
How many gangs are there in Lian'an Town?

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Only us and the Five-Face Gang.

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
How's the relationship?

211
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
We're dead.

212
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We have different ideas.

213
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
So the relationship is not very good.

214
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
How long have you been here?

215
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Why is the Black Lotus Gang so crazy?

216
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
We're established...

217
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Shut up.

218
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
We're established not long ago.

219
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's only been two years that we've grown up.

220
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
He, don't talk.

221
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Can you talk a little more carefully?

222
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
For example, some of the local people know about the relationship.

223
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh, right.

224
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
There's a travel guide in my bag.

225
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's marked on it.

226
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
It'll definitely help you.

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Really?

228
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
In the bag.

229
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He, don't talk.

230
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You can't beat them.

231
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
This one?

232
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This one.

233
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
And that one.

234
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
This one?

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
There's a note.

236
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It's detailed.

237
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Right?

238
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
My mom wanted to be a tour guide.

239
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
But the travel business in Lian'an Town is in the hands of the Five-Face Gang.

240
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
So...

241
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Let me see.

242
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Here.

243
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's for you.

244
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
For me?

245
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, right.

246
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
There's some money in my bag.

247
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'll give it to you.

248
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You're so good at this.

249
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Learn from your brother.

250
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Do you hear me?

251
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
He started it first.

252
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We'll apologize to you.

253
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Shut up.

254
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He, don't talk.

255
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You can't beat them.

256
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This one?

257
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Stop talking.

258
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I don't know where to put it.

259
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
This bag...

260
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'll give you the bag too.

261
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You gave me the bag too?

262
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Look.

263
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
You're so good at this.

264
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
So can you let me go?

265
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'll give you some face.

266
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Let me go.

267
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Let your brother go too.

268
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Thank you, brother.

269
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Brother, come here.

270
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You're so bad.

271
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You're so good at this.

272
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You're so good at this.

273
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm so scared.

274
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Wipe it.

275
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Wipe it.

276
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm so scared.

277
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Wipe it.

278
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm so scared.

279
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm so scared.

280
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Listen.

281
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm afraid you can't stand it if I hit you.

282
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What a coincidence.

283
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I suddenly got a cramp.

284
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What are you doing?

285
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What are you doing?

286
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Brother, no.

287
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
No, no, no.

288
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Brother, brother, brother.

289
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Don't do that, brother.

290
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Brother.

291
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What do you mean by I'm a chicken thief?

292
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Mom, don't talk nonsense.

293
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm not going back now.

294
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Okay, okay, okay.

295
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
You play mahjong.

296
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Black Lotus Gang.

297
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Brother.

298
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Are you from the mainland?

299
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Why don't you let me come?

300
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You got a black lotus gang?

301
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
They got me, okay?

302
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Brother.

303
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Are the police here all in the same gang as the black lotus gang?

304
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It's okay.

305
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We all know this little place.

306
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's inevitable to be involved.

307
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Then why are they so angry?

308
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Angry?

309
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's okay.

310
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Brother.

311
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Are there any other gangs in Lin'an?

312
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
There are five gangs.

313
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I heard they've already recruited people.

314
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's okay.

315
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Five gangs?

316
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Young people.

317
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Don't be so arrogant.

318
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We're different from the mainland.

319
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's not a good thing to eat a little bit of a loss.

320
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Go back early.

321
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
What's the difference?

322
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I think it's the same.

323
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Black Lotus Gang, right?

324
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I think it's the same.

325
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I think it's the same.

326
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's the same.

327
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'll teach you a lesson.

328
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Thank you, boss.

329
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Come again.

330
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Are you trying to get a kiss?

331
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Young people.

332
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Eat a little bit of a loss.

333
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
None of us came here like this.

334
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Why do I feel like he's not going to turn around?

335
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Just do it.

336
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
You can't cause any trouble.

337
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
A'Long, go and collect the money.

338
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Brother He.

339
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Wipe it.

340
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Wipe it.

341
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Damn it.

342
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Did you just poison my mouth?

343
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You're going to pee on me, right?

344
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You can just go home and take a shower.

345
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Take a shower?

346
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Take a shower?

347
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Come on. I'll pee on you.

348
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What can I do?

349
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I can't beat him.

350
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You can't beat him?

351
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll beat you.

352
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Chen Tiansuo.

353
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Chen Tiansuo.

354
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I want you to feel good every day.

355
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Mr. Chen.

356
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Do you want to try the new set?

357
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Relax.

358
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Relax?

359
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The clothes are great.

360
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Relax?

361
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Our store is right ahead.

362
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Let's go.

363
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'll take you there.

364
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You scared me to death.

365
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm hungry now.

366
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It's okay.

367
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm hungry.

368
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm hungry.

369
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
There are many delicious food in our store.

370
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What?

371
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Next time.

372
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Next time.

373
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Don't scare me.

374
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Next time.

375
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Wait for me.

376
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'll come next time.

377
