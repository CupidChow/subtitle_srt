1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry.

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Brother Jiu.

3
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes?

4
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Your police friend won't help us to arrest you, right?

5
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Did you break the law today?

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
No.

7
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Then what are you afraid of?

8
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
After all, we are the Black Gang.

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
It's a bit...

10
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You're not used to it?

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Then I ask you.

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why don't we deal with the Black Gang?

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why don't we go to the Heavens and the Sea to deal with Jiajie?

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
For Li Anzhen.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What is the police's duty?

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
For Li Anzhen.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
That's enough.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So, whether it's the police or the Black Gang,

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
don't care too much about their identity.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You have to see the situation through the eyes of the public.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
As long as there is a common wish,

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
it's a family, it's a partner.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Do you remember?

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Brother Jiu is right.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I heard you say that there is no need for a life today.

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Bullshit.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hey, it's not good. Let's go.

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How about it?

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're good at it.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's great.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Great, great, great.

32
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't let your colleague recognize you.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll catch you all together.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll wait for you here.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If anything happens, contact me immediately.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Be careful.

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I understand.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Let's go.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Let's go.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Is this the place?

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why is there no one?

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's not time yet.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Let's wait.

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll go.

45
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Jia, I've been here for a long time.

46
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Where is your mother?

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
She's at 10.30.

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Look, I'm almost there.

49
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll be right there.

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No need to fight.

51
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
They won't come.

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Let's go.

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Brother Hachio,

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
did Jia play us at the beginning?

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Or did we show up today?

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What do you think?

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Jia.

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Jia's calling.

59
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Pick up.

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Maomao, what's wrong with you?

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I've been waiting for you all night.

62
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I haven't slept all night.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Where have you been?

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Me?

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm on Baiwei Road now.

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Where are you?

67
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Get off.

68
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Get off.

69
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You miss me?

70
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I miss you so much.

71
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You brought so many friends to pick me up.

72
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You really let me down.

73
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You brought new friends too.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
It's a pity they're gone.

75
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
When did you realize?

76
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You're a good actor.

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But I've seen a similar trick.

78
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Have you ever talked about that old friend?

79
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Director Tang?

80
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I was talking about you.

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
A traitor.

82
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Traitor?

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You know each other?

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
It's so windy.

86
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What should we do?

87
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm so disappointed in you.

88
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You're still so stubborn.

89
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're so anxious.

90
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We were caught by the Black Lotus Gang.

91
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You don't know how much Lin Ping He hates me.

92
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He hates you.

93
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Besides, he hates Tianhai Gate.

94
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
We won't be in danger.

95
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We won't be in danger?

96
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He can torture us.

97
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's okay. He hates me.

98
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm too arrogant.

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Don't worry.

100
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm the director.

101
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If he catches me, there will be news.

102
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's not just about the Black Lotus Gang.

103
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What do you mean?

104
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't forget we're the Five Lakes Alliance.

105
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Not the Black Lotus Gang.

106
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The people you met are all in the same boat.

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
In the same boat?

108
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Brother Ma.

109
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't understand.

110
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
The Five Lakes Alliance is a big gang.

111
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I think Lin An's big and small things...

112
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
are all up to your director.

113
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You didn't see anyone else.

114
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You just came from the mainland.

115
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
There are many gangs in Taiwan.

116
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
But there are several.

117
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You mean the Black Lotus Gang?

118
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's simple.

119
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's local.

120
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The Five Lakes Alliance is different.

121
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
But it's actually...

122
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
a union of gang leaders.

123
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The gang leaders had their own land.

124
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Then the banana business formed.

125
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It sounds like a tribe.

126
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It's true.

127
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We usually have a clear plan.

128
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Only when we encounter a big problem...

129
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
can we discuss it together.

130
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
A big problem?

131
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
For example, the gang leader was arrested?

132
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yes.

133
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
That's great.

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I mean, thanks to you...

135
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I won't be in danger.

136
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
What about Tianhai Gate?

137
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
They're the biggest gang in Taiwan.

138
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Tianhai Gate is a company...

139
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
that's more like a gang.

140
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
They have a network of interests...

141
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
and a network of resources.

142
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Their boss is Zheng Tai Xiang.

143
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
He's the boss, but he's more like Tianhai Gate's chairman.

144
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So the general manager is the general manager?

145
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yes.

146
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The difference between them and other companies...

147
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
is that they can't solve problems with normal means.

148
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
They have other ways.

149
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I think they're more in line with the trend.

150
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
We're a bit lost.

151
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
How about I give you the way to get the money?

152
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You can exchange it with him.

153
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll exchange it with Brother Ah Xiu.

154
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We have a lot of money now.

155
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Brother Ah Xiu.

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I heard Sister Jia call you a traitor.

157
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes.

158
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Yes, I heard that.

159
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You're the gang leader.

160
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You're the gang leader.

161
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Yes, I heard that.

162
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You know each other?

163
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We've talked before.

164
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
It was a long time ago.

165
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
So the traitor is your nickname?

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm a young man's agent.

167
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Agent?

168
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Your ex-girlfriend?

169
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Don't ask me the details.

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
She won't admit it even if you ask.

171
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Brother Ah Xiu was too romantic when he was young.

172
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's all a grudge.

173
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Let me tell you something.

174
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Don't look at the analysis just now.

175
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But when you have a chance,

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
you have to find a way to get out.

177
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Even if you can get out, it's good to get a message.

178
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I've been through the whole thing.

179
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
How can I act?

180
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'll go.

181
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Baby.

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You're finally here.

183
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I thought you didn't want me anymore.

184
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Where did you go?

185
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Am I wrong?

186
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Am I really wrong?

187
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But I know I can change it.

188
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I've been thinking all these hours.

189
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I've figured it out.

190
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Go to his warehouse.

191
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The owner of the warehouse has been arrested.

192
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Wu Hongmeng has no future.

193
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Baby, let me follow you.

194
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Okay?

195
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You're dangerous and charming.

196
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I can't pull myself out.

197
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
From now on,

198
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm yours.

199
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

200
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I won't say anything.

201
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Are you done?

202
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm done.

203
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Baby, I love you so much.

204
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What I said just now

205
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
is less than one percent of my heart.

206
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Do you love me that much?

207
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I love you so much.

208
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Go back with me.

209
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Tie his hands to me.

210
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Tie.

211
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I like being comforted by you.

212
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I feel like you care about me.

213
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Listen,

214
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
you have to listen to me when you go back with me.

215
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
If you make me unhappy,

216
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
don't you ever think of peeing on me.

217
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Okay.

218
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'll wait for you.

219
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Be gentle.

220
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Didn't you see the owner waiting for a while?

221
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You're still waiting for him.

222
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It hurts.

223
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Hanjie.

224
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You didn't want to talk to me about business.

225
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Now,

226
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
no matter what I do,

227
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
you can't refuse.

228
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Because the secrets behind you

229
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
are not to be known by your brothers.

230
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What do you want?

231
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I want you to cooperate completely.

232
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
No.

233
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's Mr. Fu.

234
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I want you to announce your support

235
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
to the Black Lotus Gang in front of everyone.

236
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I can tell right away that you are the one who forced me.

237
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
So what?

238
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I want them to listen.

239
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
They are not stupid.

240
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
They will listen to whatever I say.

241
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Then you have to think of a way.

242
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Or do you want them to know

243
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
what you have done?

244
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Do you really think that

245
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
the past is not mentioned by anyone?

246
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
What?

247
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes.

248
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
She agreed.

249
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
She agreed.

250
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The next day,

251
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
at the annual meeting of your Black Lotus Gang,

252
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I've made it this far.

253
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
As for the rest of the people, what do you think?

254
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Leave it to me.

255
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Shen Tianshuang is in your car, right?

256
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
My toy is in my car.

257
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
His life is mine.

258
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't look at me like that.

259
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Think about it.

260
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Can you take it without me?

261
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm not going to take it.

262
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Then when you're tired of it,

263
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
leave it to me.

264
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You'd better think about what's going on in front of you.

265
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Hello?

266
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Everything is ready now.

267
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Only Dongfeng is missing.

268
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The End
