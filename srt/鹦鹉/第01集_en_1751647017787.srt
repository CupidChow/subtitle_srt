1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,700
UK

2
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,000
HU

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,680
How much do you earn for sending this shipment?

4
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,340
Alright

5
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,300
You know

6
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,860
I don't think we will ever feel what we get

7
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,920
That's strange

8
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,340
What is their plan for the shipment they work for?

9
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:28,280
Why would he not tell me about this?

10
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,080
What do you see?

11
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,620
Aumbled.

12
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,980
This is a check huh?

13
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,180
But it can't be Taipei.

14
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,160
Not too dangerous.

15
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,880
Weird.

16
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,280
Oh

17
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,880
Oh

18
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:38,440
well

19
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,880
well

20
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:49,480
well

21
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,880
well

22
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,560
well

23
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
What?

24
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,560
What about Hui?

25
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
He's a good man.

26
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,560
Don't worry.

27
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,560
But...

28
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,560
Don't be afraid.

29
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,560
I knew it.

30
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,560
This money is not enough for your appetite.

31
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,560
The military police will know tomorrow morning.

32
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
The news of the accident on the road to the Wu's.

33
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
We have to go back to Hong Kong.

34
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,560
So that everyone can see that Lian An Zheng has a better choice.

35
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,560
Don't worry.

36
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,560
I've arranged everything for you in the mainland.

37
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
But the investigation is tight.

38
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
The costs of all aspects have to be raised.

39
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,560
I hate when people change their mind.

40
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,560
What are you doing?

41
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,560
You're making fun of me.

42
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,560
You're so naughty.

43
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,560
Don't you like to be excited?

44
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
What are you doing?

45
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
There are dead people over there.

46
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
The King of Dwarfs

47
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,560
The King of Dwarfs

48
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,560
My name is Chen Tianshuang.

49
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,560
I'm righteous and kind.

50
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
I'm from the East Mountain Island of Minnan province.

51
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
I'm a water expert.

52
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
As the saying goes,

53
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
When Lian An and Yi Jiaqing come to Taiwan,

54
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
I feel very happy.

55
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,560
The reason why I feel happy is

56
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,560
that I can work hard with everyone.

57
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,560
We can fight together.

58
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Wait a minute.

59
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Wait a minute.

60
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Mr. Chen, please don't be so single.

61
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
We're here to report the case.

62
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,560
Can you tell us the point?

63
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,560
If you say so,

64
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
I'll be frank with you.

65
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,560
The matter should start with Brother Yu.

66
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,560
You don't know who Brother Yu is.

67
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,560
Brother Yu is my supplier in Taiwan.

68
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,560
If he hadn't given me a bad smell of seafood,

69
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,560
I wouldn't have come here in person.

70
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,560
I came here to talk to him.

71
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,560
After all, we've been working together for so long.

72
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,560
I don't have high standards.

73
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
I just want him to apologize.

74
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,560
Who would have thought...

75
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,560
I won't answer your phone.

76
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
Brother Yu, don't do this to me.

77
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,560
The seafood you sent me last time was stinky.

78
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,560
I lost all my customers.

79
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,560
I'll have to pay you back for this.

80
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,560
Don't talk nonsense.

81
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,560
How could my goods have problems?

82
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
I'm talking nonsense.

83
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,560
I'm not talking nonsense.

84
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,560
Do you think I'm stupid?

85
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,560
Here's the money.

86
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
I'll pay you back.

87
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,560
Where's the money?

88
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,560
I lost my customers.

89
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
I don't want the money.

90
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,560
I see you picking seafood every day.

91
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,560
I can't sleep.

92
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,560
I'll pay you back.

93
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,560
I'll pay you back.

94
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
It's none of my business.

95
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,560
You're not paying me back?

96
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Well,

97
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,560
introduce me to the seafood business here.

98
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
I want to develop here too.

99
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,560
This money...

100
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,560
is half the price.

101
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,560
Is that okay?

102
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,560
You want to come here?

103
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,560
No.

104
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,560
I've already taken over the seafood market in Dongshan.

105
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,560
I want to open a new market here.

106
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,560
Don't worry.

107
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,560
I'll take your business.

108
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
Okay.

109
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,560
I'll introduce you to the seafood here.

110
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
Hurry up.

111
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,560
Later I found out that

112
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
the brother he was talking about

113
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
was the Black Lotus Gang.

114
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
Black Lotus Gang?

115
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,560
Let them come.

116
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
I'll kill them!

117
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
Young man,

118
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,560
you're so arrogant.

119
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
So many seafood vendors.

120
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,560
They're not only being unreasonable

121
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
and not paying me back,

122
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,560
they even threaten me with black.

123
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
What era is this?

124
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,560
I'm a citizen who follows the law.

125
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,560
How can I be wronged?

126
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,560
So I immediately told him

127
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,560
that I'm sorry.

128
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
And then?

129
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,560
And then...

130
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,560
You mean

131
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,560
you were beaten?

132
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,560
I would have done that too.

133
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,560
But they were too many

134
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,560
and surrounded me.

135
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,560
Then they convinced me

136
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,560
and asked me to apologize to them.

137
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
What did I do wrong?

138
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,560
Why should I apologize to them?

139
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,560
As the saying goes,

140
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
I should have been the one who stood up

141
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,560
to them.

142
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,560
But...

143
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,560
You were beaten again.

144
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,560
Do you know what these people are like?

145
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
You don't know about the Black Lotus Gang.

146
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,560
You're a fool.

147
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,560
Are you talking about me?

148
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Yes, yes, yes.

149
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
They beat me.

150
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,560
They took away my ID.

151
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
They arrested me, officer.

152
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,560
Young man,

153
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,560
what are you talking about?

154
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,560
I've never seen you before.

155
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,560
You're lying.

156
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,560
You're not a man.

157
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,560
Stop it.

158
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Officer Jia,

159
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,560
I was on my way

160
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,560
and found a document.

161
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
But the photo

162
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
looks like you.

163
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,560
You were pointing at me.

164
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,560
The report needs evidence.

165
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,560
Do you have a recording,

166
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,560
a photo

167
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
or a video?

168
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,560
There's a surveillance camera.

169
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,560
There must be a surveillance camera in the water market.

170
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,560
They must have recorded me.

171
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Our equipment is being repaired.

173
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
The surveillance camera

174
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,560
isn't working.

175
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,560
It's a pity.

176
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
We can't prove our innocence.

177
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,560
I'll kill you.

178
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
You're a failure.

179
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,560
Mr. Chen,

180
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
we're busy.

181
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,560
If you have nothing else,

182
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,560
please go back.

183
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,560
Okay.

184
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,560
I'll call the police.

185
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Come on, police.

186
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,560
I'll call the police.

187
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,560
I'll call the police.

188
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,560
Mr. Chen,

189
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
I'm warning you.

190
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,560
If you keep doing this,

191
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,560
I can sue you for obstructing public affairs.

192
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,560
I'm not.

193
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,560
Xiaomin,

194
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
go back to the mainland.

195
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,560
Or you might not be able to

196
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,560
find anything you lost next time.

197
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,560
Cut.

198
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:10,560
Brother Yu,

199
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,560
I'll call you back

200
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
as soon as I get the money.

201
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,560
Send me the next bottle of seafood first.

202
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
Where are you?

203
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
I know.

204
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
Don't make fun of me.

205
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,560
You're still...

206
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
It's no use scolding me.

207
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,560
I'm working on

208
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,560
the food management of the five-tailed fish.

209
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Give me three yuan for each catty.

210
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
How about a long-term cooperation?

211
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Brother Yu.

212
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,560
You're so arrogant.

213
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Did you get him to run away?

214
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,560
You don't understand.

215
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,560
I'm just playing tricks.

216
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,560
You're playing tricks.

217
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
You're playing tricks on me.

218
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,560
I can't be too greedy.

219
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,560
You were quite generous when you were young.

220
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
Why are you getting more and more like a thief?

221
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
What do you mean by a thief?

222
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
I'm a mature man.

223
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,560
I'll have to raise my grandma in the future.

224
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
Enough.

225
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,560
I can't count on you.

226
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
You're always eating and drinking.

227
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
The kid next door, Zheng,

228
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,560
is about to go to elementary school.

229
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,560
You can't even get a girlfriend.

230
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
You don't understand.

231
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,560
My ideal type

232
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
is a sweet girl with a good personality.

233
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
She looks like a hot girl.

234
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
She's a real girl.

235
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
Son.

236
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,560
What era is it now?

237
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
You're still looking for a girlfriend

238
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,560
just like your mom and me.

239
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
How can you find one?

240
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
I dare say

241
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
that your father married me back then

242
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
because he didn't know which temple

243
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,560
had the right incense.

244
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,560
That's why he was so lucky.

245
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
You're a little self-confident, okay?

246
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
Mom, I'm not coming home for dinner tonight.

247
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,560
I have to do business.

248
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
Don't be so arrogant.

249
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,560
I know.

250
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,560
I'm leaving.

251
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
You're back, Mr. Ma.

252
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,560
What are you doing today?

253
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,560
Same old stuff.

254
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,560
I'm looking at you.

255
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,560
Let's go.

256
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,560
I think I'm going to have to go with you.

257
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
Do you want to?

258
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,560
I'm going to go with you.

259
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,560
It's too obvious.

260
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Why are you following me?

261
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,560
Are you handsome?

262
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Tell me.

263
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,560
Chen Tianshuang, right?

264
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,560
Brother, do I owe you money?

265
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,560
I can pay you back.

266
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,560
Why are you helping me?

267
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,560
Turn off the lights.

268
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,560
Let's talk.

269
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,560
Brother, I'm sorry.

270
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,560
I'm not your brother.

271
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
I'm just a friend.

272
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
I'm just a friend.

273
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
I'm just a friend.

274
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
I'm just a friend.

275
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
I'm just a friend.

276
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,560
I'm just a friend.

277
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
I'm just a friend.

278
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
I'm just a friend.

279
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Turn off the lights.

280
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
Let's talk.

281
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Let's go.

282
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,560
You can tell that you're being followed

283
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,560
and that you're trying to subdue us.

284
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,560
You can do it.

285
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
No.

286
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
You guys are too obvious.

287
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,560
How can you be so close to people?

288
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,560
What did you do after graduation?

289
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
Do you remember?

290
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
I was doing some small business.

291
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
I'm doing seafood now.

292
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,560
Brother, if you need seafood,

293
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,560
I'll send it to you.

294
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,560
You have to let me know who you are first.

295
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,560
I can't see you.

296
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,560
It doesn't matter who I am.

297
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Chen Tianshuang,

298
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,560
who are you?

299
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,560
Didn't you just call me?

300
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,560
I'm Chen Tianshuang.

301
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
Zhi Liao, is it you?

302
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
Zhi Liao.

303
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,560
I've never used this nickname.

304
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,560
My nickname is Chen Tianshuang.

305
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,560
Tian Tianshuang.

306
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
What is it?

307
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,560
Zhang Tianliang

308
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,560
is your secret power, right?

309
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,560
Two years ago,

310
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,560
he died in an execution mission.

311
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,560
Since then,

312
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,560
you've quit Guohan.

313
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,560
Am I right?

314
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,560
What organization?

315
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,560
What mission?

316
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,560
Do you know how Tianzhuang died?

317
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
Tell me!

318
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
Tell me!

319
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Still pretending?

320
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
It seems that it's useless to just ask.

321
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
It doesn't matter.

322
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,560
Let's take it slow.

323
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,560
Are you willing to talk now?

324
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,560
Are you tired of talking?

325
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,560
What do you mean tired of talking?

326
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,560
I don't know what to say!

327
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,560
Say it again.

328
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,560
No!

329
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,560
Still not talking?

330
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,560
What did I say?

331
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,560
Say it again.

332
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,560
Brother, I really don't know!

333
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,560
I said it!

334
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,560
I said it!

335
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
Brother,

336
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,560
let me go!

337
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,560
I've said everything I should say.

338
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,560
Why are you arresting me?

339
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,560
What are you doing?

340
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
You said it,

341
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,560
but it's all fake.

342
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
If we investigate according to what you said,

343
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
it's like reporting to Guohan.

344
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,560
No, I'm telling the truth!

345
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,560
I didn't say anything fake.

346
00:17:58,560 --> 00:17:59,560
They're lying!

347
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,560
They're lying!

348
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,560
I'm telling the truth!

349
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,560
I'm telling the truth!

350
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
You're lying!

351
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,560
They're lying!

352
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,560
You're the one who lied to me.

353
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,560
I'll give you one last chance.

354
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,560
Is Zhang Tianliang your secret power?

355
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,560
Tianliang...

356
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,560
He's my discovery.

357
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
Don't touch him!

358
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,560
Don't come near!

359
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,560
Don't touch him!

360
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,560
I'm very careful!

361
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,560
Zhang Yuan!

362
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
Don't come near!

363
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,560
Don't touch him!

364
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,560
Don't touch him!

365
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,560
Zhang Yuan!

366
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,560
Let go of the gun.

367
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,560
Xu Chu!

368
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,560
The End
