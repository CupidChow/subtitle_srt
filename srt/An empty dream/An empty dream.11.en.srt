that you've encountered some trouble.

So I came to see

43
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,320

Do you understand rhythm
and music theory?

If I must say,

48
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,040
I should be considered proficient.

49
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,200
Can you play a piece
after hearing it just once?

50
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,280

agree on this?

54
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,800
He had someone drug the food

55
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,960
and you took the opportunity to extort.

56
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,040
The two of you

57
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,760
surely make a great team.

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,240
may I be struck by lightning

62
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,040
and exiled from the Six Realms.

63
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:54,680

00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,400

means letting go of everything

159
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,040
if you are willing to lend a hand

160
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,000
and make the Demon King
lose face at the Summit Ceremony

161
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,480
and become the laughingstock
of the Six Realms,

162
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,160
as the Demon admires the strong,

163
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,040
they will certainly not
accept such humiliation.

164
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,920
At that time,
the position of the Demon King

165
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,200
will naturally belong to you, Prince Yu,

166
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,040
as you have always kept a low profile

167
