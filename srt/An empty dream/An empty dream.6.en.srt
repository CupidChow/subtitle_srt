[Episode 6]

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,040
It's all my fault.

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,840
I was so lax

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,760
that the villain exploited a loophole.

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,840
So you got the assassination.

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,960
I should die for it.

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,560
What's the situation here?

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,880
Please punish me.

18
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,880
I'm willing to receive any punishment.

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:13,960
Suyan.

20
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:14,680
Suyan.

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,360
Suyan, come play with me.

22
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:18,520
Suyan.

23
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,360
Suyan.

24
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,320
Breathe slowly.

25
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,560
Don't be nervous.

26
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,200
I won't pursue it.

27
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,040
Don't worry.

28
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,240
Suyan.

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,440
Come play with me.

30
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,520
That new game is really interesting.

31
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,440
Suyan.

32
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,320
Suyan.

33
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,480
What's this smell?

34
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,080
I've been taking medicine
since I was little.

35
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,400
Over time,

36
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,840
I got the smell of herbal medicine.

37
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,360
Mr. Yu, please stop here.

38
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,000
I can leave the palace on my own.

39
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,960
It won't do.

40
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,720
The Lord is concerned about you,

41
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,280
so he asked me to escort you...

42
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,960
Hypocritical.

43
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,800
Qi.

44
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,720
Let's go home.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,200
Alright.

46
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,360
Why did you hit me?

47
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,560
I didn't do it hard.

48
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,760
It hurts still.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,400
If you had done it hard,

50
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,160
then my head would have split open.

51
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,280
Why would I do so?

52
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,400
Do you really let go of Prince Yu?

53
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,960
He's not usually like this.

54
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,240
Now, appearing as a child,

55
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,880
he's simply doing a ploy
to gain your sympathy.

56
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,800
Don't forget

57
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,360
he has been scheming
for taking your life.

58
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,400
What's wrong with you?

59
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,520
Since just now,

60
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,800
you've been acting weird.

61
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,960
Are you injured?

62
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,720
Are you injured?

63
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,600
No.

64
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
What's this smell?

65
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,160
I've been taking medicine
since I was little.

66
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,360
Over time,

67
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,200
I got the smell of herbal medicine.

68
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,200
Why are you

69
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,320
looking at me like that?

70
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,000
Nothing.

71
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,160
By the way,

72
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,320
do you still remember

73
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,120
the first time when we met?

74
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,240
Yes.

75
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,840
I want to ask you.

76
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,720
That day,

77
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,640
why were you in the palace?

78
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,280
I...

79
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,760
I was...

80
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,240
I can't tell you I was here to kill you.

81
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,560
You were here for the orb?

82
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,000
Exactly.

83
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,680
I was here for the orb.

84
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,560
Right.

85
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,840
For the orb.

86
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,720
General,

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,440
what happened to you?

88
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,240
Did the Lord

89
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,880
have troubled you again?

90
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,480
It's not him,

91
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,600
but me.

92
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
I can't say it.

93
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,440
You can't say it?

94
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,080
Jinli,

95
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,120
let me ask you.

96
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,240
If you are very close to someone,

97
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,560
and he trusts you well,

98
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,960
even entrusting his life to you,

99
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,000
but you once wanted to kill him.

100
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,240
If it were you,

101
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,480
would you tell him

102
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,040
that you once wanted to kill him?

103
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,440
I would definitely not tell.

104
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,480
Since we are now so close,

105
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,920
why bother doing so

106
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,960
to ruin the relationship?

107
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,560
No, no.

108
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,760
Annoying!

109
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:48,880
Annoying!

110
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,680
Get to sleep.

111
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,280
Where's the sincere cooperation?

112
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,240
Where is the sincerity?

113
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,600
She's clearly cooperating

114
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,480
with my cunning and villainous
younger brother.

115
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,080
She had the smell of herbal medicine

116
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,200
the last time she broke into
the Demon Palace.

117
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,920
She must have been ordered

118
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,280
by my younger brother to kill me.

119
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,280
I can't just ask her straight up.

120
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,840
I know everything

121
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,000
about you and him.

122
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:43,840
You owe me

123
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,800
an explanation, don't you?

124
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:50,600
No one would ever do so.

125
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,640
I can't believe she lied to me.

126
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,000
I'd better keep away from her.

127
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,440
My Lord.

128
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,280
Are you not feeling well?

129
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,000
Exactly.

130
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,240
I am not

131
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,440
feeling well now.

132
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,400
What?

133
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,320
That serious?

134
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,160
My Lord.

135
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,480
Shall I ask General Hua to come?

136
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,080
Don't!

137
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,680
Don't mention her.

138
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,520
And don't let me see her.

139
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,640
Once you mention her,

140
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,840
my heart would flutter.

141
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,200
If she asks,

142
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,280
just say that I am not well.

143
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,960
I don't meet anyone these days.

144
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,360
Oh.

145
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,280
His heart flutters for General Hua.

146
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,160
Miss Jinli.

147
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,360
Please return.

148
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,640
The Lord is not feeling well.

149
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,280
Today,

150
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,640
he doesn't see any visitor.

151
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,600
Mr. Yu.

152
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,080
I am not a visitor.

153
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,440
I am here on behalf of General Hua

154
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,280
to deliver some nourishing
herbal decoction for the Lord.

155
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,680
Besides,

156
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,160
it's been several days,

157
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,960
and the Lord has not shown up.

158
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,680
General Hua

159
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,280
is worried about him.

160
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:21,880
It's the order of the Lord.

161
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,600
I dare not disobey.

162
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,400
However,

163
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,640
the Lord reigns over the Demon Realm,

164
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,240
but when facing with love,

165
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,680
he would be worried.

166
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,960
Please ask General Hua

167
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,440
to forgive him.

168
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,040
L...

169
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,640
Love?

170
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,760
Miss Jinli.

171
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,120
I only tell you this.

172
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,680
The Lord

173
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,800
has a crush on General Hua.

174
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,640
What?

175
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,400
Really?

176
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Right.

177
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,880
The Lord told this to me himself.

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,600
He said once General Hua is mentioned,

179
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,880
his heart would flutter.

180
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,640
What...

181
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,720
What did you say?

182
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,160
The Lord

183
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,160
has a crush on me?

184
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,280
It is absolutely true.

185
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,680
This is what the Lord told Mr. Yu.

186
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,840
He said once he thinks of you,

187
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,480
his heart would flutter.

188
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,240
The Lord does not know

189
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,600
how to handle this love,

190
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:39,400
so he pretends to be sick

191
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,920
and distances himself from you.

192
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,240
Anyone in the Demon Realm

193
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,560
could snap your neck.

194
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,080
No!

195
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,880
Please protect me.

196
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,120
General.

197
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,560
What happened to your face?

198
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,360
Nothing.

199
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,240
The nerd is experiencing the love
for the first time.

200
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,800
Does he

201
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,520
really have a crush on me?

202
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,640
Boring.

203
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:39,960
My Lord.

204
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,360
I understand you.

205
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,080
You understand?

206
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,080
Are you really struggling now?

207
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,240
Do you not know how to face her?

208
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,840
Are you getting uneasy

209
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,880
whenever you think of her?

210
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,040
Exactly.

211
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,120
Continue.

212
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,240
My lord.

213
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,320
You're distraught over her.

214
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,760
It is because of love.

215
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,920
In my opinion,

216
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,760
you might as well spill it out.

217
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,320
Perhaps

218
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,160
it could

219
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,240
make an extraordinary love story
of the Demon Realm.

220
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,960
Stop, stop.

221
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,880
What are you talking about?

222
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,320
Because of love?

223
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,240
An extraordinary love story?

224
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,160
Why does that sound so weird?

225
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,440
My lord.

226
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,440
I...

227
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,320
I mean you have a crush on General Hua.

228
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:35,920
Yuzai.

229
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:36,680
Yes.

230
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,360
Come closer.

231
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,440
Yes.

232
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,120
My lord.

233
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,320
Yuzai.

234
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,440
Listen to me,

235
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,680
shipping anyone will only harm yourself.

236
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,480
My lord.

237
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,360
