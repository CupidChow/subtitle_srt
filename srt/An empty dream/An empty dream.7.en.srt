[Episode 7]

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,040
General Hua.

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,360
Put these things here.

13
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,320
Go and rest first.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,640
Okay.

15
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,240
Are you...

16
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,520
What?

17
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,600
Nothing.

18
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,480
I'll leave now.

19
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,720
Was this an attempted murder?

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,600
Yuzai.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,800
Yuzai.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,720
Yuzai!

23
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,800
Quickly help me up.

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,120
Oh no.

25
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,920
My Lord.

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,080
What happened?

27
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,840
If he truly confesses to me,

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,600
what will I do?

29
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,640
It's so annoying.

30
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,760
What's wrong with General Hua?

31
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,000
General Chen,

32
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,760
the Lord has often been avoiding
the meeting with General Hua lately.

33
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,120
Perhaps General Hua is displeased.

34
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,600
Why does the Lord avoid General Hua?

35
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,040
I don't know.

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,840
I just heard...

37
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,640
What?

38
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,560
Speak freely.

39
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,240
I've heard that General Hua harbors
an ulterior motive towards the Lord.

40
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,440
These are just rumors.

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,240
General Chen,

42
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,440
please do not take it to heart.

43
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:55,800
My Lord.

44
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:57,880
My Lord.

45
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,640
What has happened to you?

46
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,360
General Hua was just a bit heavy-handed.

47
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,720
It's fine.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,720
It's fine.

49
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,200
General Hua laid hands on you?

50
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,840
General Hua and I hadn't practiced

51
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,640
our skills for a while,

52
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,480
so we were just working out.

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,160
My Lord.

54
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,240
If General Hua has
an ulterior motive towards you,

55
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,360
with the sword in my hand,

56
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,480
I will be the first to disagree.

57
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,480
Did I say anything?

58
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,600
Why did he leave
with his sword just like that?

59
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,440
Is he trying to help me

60
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,000
or getting me in trouble?

61
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,240
What kind of karma have I made?

62
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,240
He is so weary

63
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,800
and lacks energy.

64
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,960
He only craves sweets.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,760
He's quite busy with official duties,

66
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,600
so I should bring him
some tasty pastries.

67
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,040
You are so considerate of the Lord.

68
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,280
I do not know when the Lord

69
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,440
will reveal his true feelings to you.

70
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,960
As your subordinate, I feel anxious.

71
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,520
This kind of matter

72
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,480
cannot be rushed.

73
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,840
Moreover,

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,120
I haven't even figured out
how to respond to him yet.

75
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,240
General Chen.

76
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,520
What is this?

77
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
For the sake of the Lord,

78
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,000
I have specially come to you today

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,160
for an explanation.

80
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,360
General.

81
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,600
This is the vital place
of the Demon Palace.

82
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,800
How can a vice commander

83
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,320
dare to be impudent with you?

84
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,320
There must be another purpose.

85
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,240
Hmm.

86
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,280
Exactly.

87
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,040
But,

88
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,560
what purpose could he possibly have?

89
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,400
We hold no grudges

90
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,560
against each other.

91
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,240
General.

92
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,760
Do you think

93
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,160
he could be acting
under orders from the Lord?

94
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,000
You're saying

95
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,760
that the Lord intends

96
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,920
to play the hero?

97
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,160
If that's the case,

98
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,520
I should give him the opportunity.

99
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,840
Why hasn't the Lord arrived yet?

100
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,240
Where is he?

101
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,640
Why hasn't he come?

102
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:30,800
General Hua.

103
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,120
As you harbor an ulterior motive,

104
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,160
you should know

105
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,640
that no one will come to save you.

106
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,040
Ulterior motive?

107
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,880
What ulterior motive?

108
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,000
Where is the Lord?

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,840
How come he didn't show up?

110
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
When I get to the bottom of this,

111
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,360
I will personally escort you
to see the Lord.

112
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,400
Escort me?

113
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,480
My Lord.

114
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,160
My Lord.

115
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,640
Can someone explain to me

116
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,840
what is going on here?

117
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,440
Isn't it

118
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,040
because of you?

119
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,040
What do you mean?

120
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,120
It's clearly because of you.

121
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,520
I have matters to discuss
with General Hua.

122
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,680
The rest of you can leave now.

123
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,480
My Lord.

124
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,560
Please don't.

125
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,120
My Lord.

126
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:29,920
My Lord.

127
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,800
Take him away as well.

128
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:33,960
My Lord.

129
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,760
My Lord.

130
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,160
Let go of me.

131
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,400
Let go of me.

132
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,520
I must protect the Lord.

133
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,640
My Lord.

134
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,200
I swear to protect you with my life.

135
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,800
Oh my goodness.

136
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,840
You're tied up like this.

137
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,640
Can you protect me?

138
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,600
My Lord.

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,680
My Lord.

140
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,040
I appreciate your good intentions.

141
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,000
You can leave now.

142
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,160
My Lord.

143
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,000
My Lord.

144
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,240
Explain it to me clearly.

145
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,440
What do you mean?

146
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,640
You're the one who needs
to explain clearly.

147
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,320
What on earth did I do to you?

148
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,600
Why did Chen Ye come at me with a sword

149
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,920
and ask for explanations?

150
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,280
He accused me
of having an ulterior motive.

151
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,280
Do you dare to say you don't?

152
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,360
When we first met,

153
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,240
didn't you try to kill me

154
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,040
under my sickly
younger brother's orders?

155
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,520
Later, after we found out
about each other's identities,

156
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,320
didn't you also go to see him?

157
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,640
What about the promise
among time-travel teammates?

158
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,160
We agreed to not

159
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,400
deceive each other, right?

160
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
So...

161
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,600
You've found out

162
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,320
about everything.

163
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,440
But I can swear

164
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,000
that it's definitely not what you think.

165
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,000
[Study]
My Lord.

166
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,040
My Lord.

167
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,200
General Chen.

168
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:07,840
General Chen.

169
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
That won't do, General Chen.

170
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
- Let him go.
- General Chen.

171
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,560
At worst, our general
will tie him up again.

172
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,440
What?

173
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
You can't accept it?

174
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,080
You might not

175
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,440
stand a few moves with me,

176
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,560
let alone our general.

177
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,520
Please enlighten me, Miss.

178
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,560
Alright.

179
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,560
Follow me.

180
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,200
Since you've already terminated
your partnership with him,

181
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,560
you might as well tell me.

182
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,080
I'm just worried you might overthink.

183
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,440
If you knew

184
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,520
that I was once ordered
by Prince Yu to assassinate you,

185
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,720
you would surely

186
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,120
hold some grudges.

187
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,320
But think about it.

188
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,080
If I really wanted to kill you,

189
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,760
why would I save you time and again?

190
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,560
I am a noble man of great stature.

191
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,000
How can I be so petty?

192
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,400
This is a contempt of my character,

193
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,560
and an insult to my personality.

194
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,840
Alright, alright.

195
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,560
It's all my fault.

196
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,000
I must have been stupid

197
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,720
to think that you were avoiding me
because of a secret crush.

198
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,240
What did you say?

199
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,800
Nothing.

200
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,240
I'm just reflecting

201
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,600
on my own foolishness.

202
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,560
That's the right attitude.

203
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,480
You...

204
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,400
Okay, okay.

205
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,440
No more fuss.

206
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,640
Take a look at this.

207
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,400
I haven't been idle all this time.

208
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,200
In order to help you find the orb,

209
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,760
I've scoured the ancient scrolls
of the Demon Realm

210
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,800
to find this.

211
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,160
According to this ancient scroll,

212
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,040
there once was a spiritual object

213
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,960
that appeared in Mirror Mountain,
north of Linyuan City.

214
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,320
I guess this spiritual object

215
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,080
is very likely the orb
you are looking for.

216
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,440
Perhaps

217
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,920
we should take a trip there.

218
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,880
Let's go to Mirror Mountain

219
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,080
tomorrow morning.

220
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,870
[Prince Yu's Mansion]

221
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,640
Although I successfully misled
General Chen

222
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,600
to suspect General Hua,

223
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,400
but he was no match for her

224
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,200
and was captured instead.

225
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,920
Now, there are no more misunderstandings

226
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,800
between General Hua and the Lord.

227
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,040
I even heard

228
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,880
General Hua saying

229
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,600
that tomorrow morning,

230
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,360
she will accompany the Lord
to leave for Mirror Mountain.

231
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,560
Mirror Mountain?

232
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,480
What are they going to do there?

233
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,760
I do not know.

234
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,200
I can't take it anymore.

235
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,640
I need to rest.

236
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,600
I can't walk any further.

237
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,920
No.

238
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,440
I must rest.

239
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,640
Don't you master magic?

240
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,240
Why can't you carry me and fly together?

241
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,200
I have been walking for most of the day.

242
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,880
My shoe soles are almost worn out.

243
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,320
Since it is a spiritual object,

244
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,160
so we need to search

245
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,480
for it inch by inch meticulously.

246
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,440
But Mirror Mountain is so vast.

247
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,720
It will take an eternity to find it.

248
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,000
If you ask me...

249
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,360
I hear the sound of a copper bell.

250
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,520
Did you hear that?

251
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,360
How come I didn't hear it?

252
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,000
Wait.

253
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,520
It is the sound of a copper bell.

254
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,560
The sound is coming from over there.

255
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Mirror Mountain Evaluator.

256
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,360

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,720
