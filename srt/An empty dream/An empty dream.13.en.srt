[Episode 13]

11
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,880
This monster tried to provoke the war

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,040
among the Demon Realm, the Immortal Realm
and the Monster Realm,

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,160
which is unacceptable.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,360
Young Lord,
do you have any explanation for this?

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,800
I'm the one who planned everything.

16
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,120
All for recapturing the Twelve Cities.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,040
This has nothing to do with Young Lord.

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,600
Kill me

19
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,800
as you please.

20
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,680
Since both of you are
under the Young Lord's command,

21
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,880
why not let the Young Lord deal with it?

22
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,000
But...

23
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,960
But if it happens again,

24
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,120
things won't be that simple.

25
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,800
Thank you for your kindness.

26
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,640
The Six Realms coexist,

27
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,400
restraining each other.

28
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,280
One suffers, all suffer.

29
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,480
One prospers, all prosper.

30
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,160
The Twelve Cities have been
suffering in war for a long time,

31
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,880
longing for peace so much.

32
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,920
Now is the time to rest and recuperate.

33
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,880
If anyone dares to stir up war,

34
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,560
I will never let him off.

35
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,040
Starting tomorrow,

36
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,320
General Chen Ye will take my place
in guarding the Twelve Cities,

37
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,000
to protect the peace of the borders.

38
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,720
May it bring everlasting peace.

39
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,960
If you weren't that foresighted,

40
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,760
I don't think

41
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,000
it would end well today.

42
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,720
Yuzai.

43
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,800
Find the best witch physician
in Linyuan City

44
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,520
and bring the finest nourishing elixirs

45
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,800
to Prince Yu's Mansion.

46
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,440
Yes.

47
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,040
My Lord.

48
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,880
What's wrong?

49
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,320
Have you noticed

50
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,840
Prince Yu seems to be getting worse?

51
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,400
General.

52
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,960
General.

53
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,920
What's the matter?

54
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,800
I have something to say.

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,920
Have you thought it through?

56
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,680
The border is in poor condition,

57
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,560
unlike Linyuan City.

58
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:45,840
General.

59
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,280
I am willing to go
to the border to defend the city.

60
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,640
I would never regret.

61
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
You do so
for that reckless General Chen?

62
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,240
Indeed, I have my personal motives.

63
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,560
General, you once said,

64
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,920
we must

65
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,200
fight for our own happiness.

66
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,760
I have been following you
since I was a kid.

67
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,440
Everything has been arranged.

68
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,760
So I've never fought for anything.

69
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,120
This time,

70
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,240
I want to take the initiative
to fight for it.

71
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,360
But that's not the only reason.

72
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,520
Over these years,

73
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,000
I have followed you
through life and death,

74
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,040
fighting at the border cities.

75
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,680
So I know better than anyone

76
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,240
that you have sacrificed a lot

77
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,680
for recapturing the Twelve Cities.

78
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,400
So,

79
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,000
I must defend the Twelve Cities for you.

80
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,720
Whether for a hundred years,

81
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,680
or for a thousand years,

82
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,440
as long as I still survive,

83
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,320
I would never let the Monster

84
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,640
lay a finger on the border cities.

85
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,080
If Chen Ye

86
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,400
dares to bully you,

87
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,800
I will surely give him a good beating

88
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,160
and tie him up.

89
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:09,800
Let's go.

90
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,240
96.

91
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,600
97.

92
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,160
98.

93
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,760
Not bad.

94
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,400
I already have 98 gold.

95
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
It's been so long,

96
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,560
and you still haven't a hundred gold.

97
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,400
Do you know how hard it is
to save these 98 gold?

98
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,200
Besides,

99
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,440
if in the Human Realm,

100
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,480
that's enough for the average person

101
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,880
to spend in a lifetime.

102
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,280
No way.

103
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,520
I have to count it again.

104
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,560
Father.

105
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,280
Mother.

106
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,680
Brother.

107
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,880
Your Highness.

108
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,920
Your Highness.

109
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,720
Someone!

110
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,040
The Highness has passed out.

111
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,080
Someone!

112
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,760
His Highness

113
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,960
is the twin brother
of His Highness Suyan,

114
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,840
but he is treated so differently.

115
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,560
The other day,
His Highness Suyan took a fall,

116
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,160
and the whole palace
was thrown into chaos.

117
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,960
While His Highness
has fallen seriously ill like this,

118
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,280
and the Lord just came
to take a quick look.

119
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,400
The Demon establishes itself
through martial strength.

120
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,400
Men are always strong.

121
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,280
But His Highness is frail and weak.

122
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,240
If word gets out,

123
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,760
they fear it will disgrace
the royal family.

124
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,240
By comparison,

125
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,240
naturally, His Highness Suyan
with his outstanding talents

126
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,160
deserves more attention.

127
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,360
That's right.

128
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,040
But...

129
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,720
His Highness is so pitiable.

130
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,560
Why is it so lively outside?

131
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,480
Your Highness.

132
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,560
Today,

133
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,000
His Highness Suyan has been
appointed as a Young Lord.

134
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,280
A celebration is being held.

135
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,360
Your Highness,

136
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,120
you seem to be in better spirits.

137
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,880
Would you like to go out and see?

138
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,520
Close the windows.

139
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,640
Today,

140
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,800
I did not lose to him,

141
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,320
but to you instead.

142
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,240
Your Highness.

143
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,800
I...

144
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,720
I know everything.

145
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,920
Qi.

146
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,200
I'll give you some more gold

147
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,080
and set you free.

148
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,640
Within the Six Realms,

149
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,000
you can go

150
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,680
wherever you want to go.

151
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,200
You must be speaking nonsense
due to ill health.

152
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,520
I will not go anywhere

153
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,000
and will stay with you.

154
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,240
Besides,

155
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,720
I should prepare your medicine.

156
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,560
It's no use.

157
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,680
Forget it.

158
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,560
Your Highness.

159
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,240
The Lord has sent someone
with the finest nourishing elixirs

160
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,520
and a witch physician accompanying.

161
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,760
Tell them to leave.

162
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,280
Just say

163
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,640
I'm having a rest.

164
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,720
Wait.

165
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,320
Ask them to leave the elixirs.

166
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,840
Keeping the elixirs

167
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,480
won't do us any harm after all.

168
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,160
Yes.

169
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,160
The Lord cares about you.

170
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,280
Do you know that?

171
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
He knew that I colluded with the Monster

172
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,600
and intended to rebel,

173
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,720
but he did not punish my crime

174
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,200
or hold me accountable.

175
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,040
Why is that?

176
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,360
He only did so

177
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,200
because he found out

178
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,040
that I'm dying.

179
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,560
And he

180
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,160
does not care about a dying man.

181
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,440
No matter what I do,

182
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,280
he doesn't have me

183
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,800
in his eyes.

184
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,040
What?

185
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,960
What's wrong?

186
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,760
At today's banquet,

187
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,840
your sword dance was really stunning.

188
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,760
Aren't you skilled with the spear?

189
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,960
How come you're also
so good with the sword?

190
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,400
Saber, spear, sword, halberd,

191
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,920
axe, lance, hook, fork,

192
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,800
poison, hidden weapons,

193
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,080
and the Demon's spells.

194
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,480
I have received systematic training.

195
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,240
You are really amazing.

196
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,120
Respect.

197
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,360
Respect.

198
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,960
Actually, what you did today

199
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,800
was really impressive.

200
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,360
You acted like

201
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,080
a real Demon King.

202
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,440
Me?

203
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,400
I know nothing about spells.

204
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,400
I can hardly keep me alive.

205
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,200
I'm a total loser.

206
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,920
But since
I'm taking over someone's body,

207
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,920
I can't just loaf around and do nothing.

208
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,120
No matter what,

209
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,440
I have to go for it.

210
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,760
I just praised you

211
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,160
and you're being proud now.

212
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,920
However,

213
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,520
I can never be a real Demon King.

214
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,960
After all, a king

215
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,200
has to devote himself to the people

216
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,200
and even he has to die for it.

217
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,280
Such a state

218
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,160
is beyond my reach.

219
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,920
I would never sacrifice my life

220
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,000
for the people of the Demon.

221
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,640
I didn't expect you to do so.

222
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,160
Alright.

223
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,200
You've been busy all day.

224
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,400
Go to sleep.

225
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,520
Oh,

226
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,080
okay.

227
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,920
Good night.

228
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,920
I'm going to bed.

229
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,440
What about you?

230
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,720
It's been eventful lately.

231
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,280
I'll stay and keep watch.

232
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,600
Rest assured.

233
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,720
This time,

234
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,080
I definitely won't tie you up.

235
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,960
You're sleeping like this.

236
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,560
I might as well tie you up.

237
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,200
General Hua.

238
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,120
General Hua.

239
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,720
Take our kids

240
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,000
and run.

241
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,120
Run!

242
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,920
In reality,

243
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,440
you've never confessed your love to me.

244
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,640
But in your dreams, we even have kids?

245
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,840
Is the mental world of a homebody

246
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,360
