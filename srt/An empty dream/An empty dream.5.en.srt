[Episode 5]

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,960
General Hua.

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:38,480
Master Hua.

13
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,120
Miss Hua.

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,280
Don't be mad.

15
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,320
Others don't know me,

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,480
but you know me.

17
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,040
As the Demon King,

18
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,360
I'm so poor.

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,440
To tell you the truth,

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,400
I've been working hard for a long time.

21
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,000
Up until now,

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,760
I don't even get paid a dime.

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,680
I have no one to complain about it.

24
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,000
That's why I'm relying on you.

25
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,400
You have no salary.

26
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,080
But you must have some treasures.

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,480
Right.

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,040
Indeed.

29
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,080
I heard that the most valuable treasure

30
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,320
in my place is a crystal skull.

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,040
I got scared by it
when I went to the restroom

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,280
in the middle of the night.

33
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,520
That thing looks scary.

34
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,960
No one would carry it around.

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,640
If you like it,

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,520
I'll give it to you later.

37
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,720
Just accept it.

38
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,640
You...

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,240
What did you come here for?

40
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,600
You have no money,

41
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,880
or magic power.

42
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,720
You just live shamelessly all day long.

43
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,760
You are wrong.

44
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,840
According to the rules of the ACG world,

45
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,080
someone like me

46
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,920
must definitely be blessed with luck.

47
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,000
With me,

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,920
you can definitely

49
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,120
find any orb.

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,800
Oh my.

51
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,400
I just got back from the border.

52
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,720
I saw clearly
what happened to the Twelve Cities.

53
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,800
Now General Hua

54
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,400
has been ordered
to take back the Twelve Cities.

55
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,120
It ends the hundred years of conflict
between the Demon and the Monster.

56
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,720
The Demon can stand tall,

57
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,880
then the Monster would suffer.

58
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:15,800
Thus,

59
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,600
these days,

60
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,040
the Twelve Cities in the border
have been in disorder,

61
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,000
making everyone so nervous

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,200
and the cities in a mess.

63
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,760
So,

64
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,720
I went back quickly.

65
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,800
I see.

66
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,440
Well,

67
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,520
should these Twelve Cities

68
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,960
be taken back?

69
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,200
What are you talking about?

70
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,120
They are our territories,

71
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,920
so why don't we take them back?

72
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,000
Calm down.

73
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,120
I just think
the common people are suffering.

74
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,040
These Twelve Cities

75
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,800
seem more like a hot potato.

76
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,640
Stop arguing.

77
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,000
Well,

78
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,280
this matter is...

79
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,480
It seems that ending the war

80
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,120
does not mean that peace will come.

81
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,120
The victims of war

82
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,800
are always the common people,

83
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,240
whether they are
from the Demon or the Monster.

84
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,560
Since it's a hot potato,

85
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,800
then we should

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,040
cool it down.

87
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,960
Let's go.

88
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,960
Where are we going?

89
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,720
To do what we need to.

90
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,480
He's being serious now.

91
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,600
Twelve Cities are recovering,

92
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,200
with the lives of people
remaining unchanged.

93
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,240
People of the Demon and the Monster
live their own lives,

94
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,600
with no distinction between people
with high and low status anymore.

95
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,160
They can trade with each other.

96
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,200
My Lord.

97
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,680
Is there something improper

98
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,120
with this decree?

99
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,600
What's improper about it?

100
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,200
We finally took back the Twelve Cities.

101
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,160
These Twelve Cities

102
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,920
are the territories of Demon Realm.

103
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,000
Then, we must expel
the monsters from the cities,

104
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,720
prioritizing the people of the Demon.

105
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,000
But now...

106
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,840
Do you know how many years

107
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,280
have the Demon and the Monster
fought for the Twelve Cities?

108
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,320
Already a hundred years.

109
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,360
Then do you know

110
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,760
how many soldiers

111
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,120
were buried in a foreign land

112
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,960
and could never return?

113
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,800
Tens of thousands.

114
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,640
My father and brother

115
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,680
died on the battlefield.

116
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,640
In order not to let the family,

117
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,360
tribes people,

118
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,440
and descendants

119
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,520
live amidst the perils of war,

120
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,200
your father and brother

121
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,360
sacrificed their precious lives

122
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,120
like countless others soldiers.

123
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,200
The world has suffered
from war for a long time.

124
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,240
The peace gained through blood
is the most precious.

125
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,960
What they yearn for

126
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,240
is precisely

127
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,240
the eternal peace.

128
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,320
My Lord.

129
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,920
You can't issue this decree.

130
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,160
The Twelve Cities are now
territories of Demon Realm.

131
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,000
If you issue this decree,

132
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,520
allowing those monsters

133
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,760
to be equal with us,

134
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,560
I fear it will harm the might of us.

135
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,840
My Lord.

136
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,800
The Twelve Cities
have gone through years of war.

137
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,600
The best thing to do now
is to cease fighting

138
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,040
and benefit the people.

139
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,920
What the Lord wants to do

140
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,080
conforms to the will of the people.

141
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,400
The might of the Demon

142
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,000
would never be diminished
by the will of the people.

143
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,200
General Chen, well said.

144
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,360
The might of the Demon

145
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,360
would never be diminished
by the will of the people.

146
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,760
I have already made a decision.

147
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,000
No more discussion.

148
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,160
Issue the Demon King's decree.

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,880
Issue the Demon King's decree.

150
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,320
Who are you?

151
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,840
This fan fiction
of the Demon Realm is so boring,

152
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,720
making me sleepy.

153
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,040
You killed someone in my room?

154
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,600
He came to kill you.

155
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,640
If I had been two seconds later,

156
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,760
we would be having your funeral.

157
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,760
He killed himself.

158
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,880
He committed suicide
after failing his mission.

159
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,240
I think he is a man of sacrifice
of the Demon.

160
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,040
Man...

161
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,200
Man of sacrifice?

162
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,440
Who have I offended?

163
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,480
We shouldn't have sent the Silver Flood
Dragon back to Skyless Cave.

164
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,280
See?

165
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,160
We just sent it over,

166
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,600
and then the assassin came.

167
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,240
If we hadn't sent it back,

168
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,760
it would become as useless as you.

169
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,840
It's only been a few days,

170
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,760
and it has learned

171
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,120
all those loafing tricks from you.

172
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,520
It's a demonic beast,

173
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,080
but you've almost raised it into a pig.

174
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,120
One useless thing
in the Demon Palace is enough.

175
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,400
Do you recognize him?

176
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,880
I recognize him.

177
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,200
He is the man of sacrifice
under Prince Yu.

178
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,600
Prince Yu?

179
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:03,960
Who is he?

180
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,720
Prince Yu.

181
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,800
Yu Ke.

182
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,920
Your younger brother.

183
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,240
I didn't know

184
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,200
I have a younger brother.

185
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,880
He wants to kill me?

186
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,760
Although Prince Yu is your twin brother,

187
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,840
he has always been sickly and frail.

188
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,680
And the Demon always admires the strong.

189
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,360
With his weak body,

190
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,600
he naturally can't compare to you
with your strong physique.

191
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,680
So he has been given the cold shoulder

192
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,120
and been ignored by the tribes people

193
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,360
since he was little.

194
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,920
Even though he was titled Prince Yu,

195
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,280
it was only an empty title.

196
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,920
Naturally, nobody mentioned him.

197
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,240
Suyan.

198
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,080
Suyan.

199
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,600
Suyan, come play with me.

200
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:48,920
Suyan.

201
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,600
Suyan.

202
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,880
What are you thinking about?

203
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,000
So why does he want to kill me?

204
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,520
He's jealous.

205
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,320
He's jealous that you've
always lived in the spotlight,

206
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,800
while he has been ignored
due to his frailty.

207
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
Over time, this led to
his psychological distortion.

208
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,000
Of course he wants to kill you.

209
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,800
I understand.

210
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,520
What a cunning
and villainous younger brother.

211
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,480
Wait.

212
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,240
How do you know he wants to kill me?

213
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,600
He can't be so foolish

214
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,320
that he tells everyone
he wants to kill me.

215
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,200
There are few things of the Demon

216
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,880
that can hide from me.

217
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,280
It's getting late.

218
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,560
You should rest.

219
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,800
I'll stand guard outside.

220
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,160
Are you

221
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,480
really going to do this?

222
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
Of course.

223
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,200
I'm strong.

224
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,480
Besides,

225
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,400
how can I let a lady sleep on the floor?

226
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,600
I am still considerate.

227
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,240
Oh.

228
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,480
Thank you.

229
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,040
Thank you for saving me today.

230
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,120
With you here,

231
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,400
I don't seem to be so scared anymore.

232
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,360
Let's sleep.

233
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,360
I'll meet

234
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,600
my cunning and villainous
younger brother someday.

235
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,480
Okay.

236
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,720
Good night.

237
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:04,880
Good...

238
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,280
Good night.

239
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,600
Why does this kid seem so obstinate

240
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,280
with such a small body?

241
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,040
He's indeed obstinate.

242
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,400
This is

243
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,040
your younger brother,

244
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,600
Prince Yu.

245
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:09,920
He...

246
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,160
