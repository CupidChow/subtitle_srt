[Episode 9]

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,360
Whenever I led an army

12
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,880
and won a battle,

13
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,680
I'd drink with my men.

14
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,480
Singing songs,

15
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,560
drinking wine,

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,600
and crying and laughing

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,040
are really exhilarated.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Inside the barracks,

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,320
there are no men and women,

20
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,200
only the general

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,160
and soldiers.

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,080
What did you see

23
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,760
in the Mirror Mountain Evaluator?

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,040
You're luckier than I am,

25
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,200
as you haven't been here for long.

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,240
But I

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,520
have already lived in this world
for over a hundred years.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Do you know

29
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,720
what a hundred years mean?

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,240
It means

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,720
the length of a person's life

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,640
from birth to death.

33
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,720
But for me,

34
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,680
I've lived for a hundred years
without a sense of belonging.

35
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,600
Living in that real world,

36
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,280
I was just a corporate slave,

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,480
suppressed by my boss every day.

38
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,560
And I had never-ending work.

39
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,680
Sometimes,

40
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,320
even my gender had become a fault to me.

41
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,520
Not to mention achieving self-worth.

42
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,320
But in here,

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,000
although the Demon admires the strong,

44
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,040
strength is what matters the most.

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,480
I can

46
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,880
work my way up

47
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,480
to be a commanding general,

48
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,000
and wouldn't be confined by my gender.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,640
So there was a moment

50
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,520
in the Mirror Mountain Evaluator

51
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,480
that I hesitated.

52
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,800
I don't know

53
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,760
whether to go back

54
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,600
to that cruel

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,720
and meaningless world.

56
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,280
What about you?

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,080
What did you see
in the Mirror Mountain Evaluator?

58
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,080
I have a younger brother.

59
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,440
A biological one.

60
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,440
His name is Nan.

61
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,680
He had suffered
from congenital heart disease,

62
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,960
and had always been weak.

63
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,520
My parents were busy with work,

64
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,160
so he needed me to take care
of everything for him.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,200
He's very clingy to me,

66
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,360
just like my tail.

67
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,920
When I left that day,

68
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,600
he specifically asked me

69
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,200
to come back early
to play video games with him.

70
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,520
But sometimes I wanted

71
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,720
to take a break.

72
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,440
So I came back very late.

73
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,080
But on that day,

74
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,200
he had a heart attack.

75
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,440
And there was no one around him,

76
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,240
so he died all alone.

77
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,400
So I shut myself in the room

78
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,600
and immersed myself in the ACG world

79
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,560
of his favorite games and virtual idols,

80
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,360
attempting to

81
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,080
escape everything.

82
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,840
Maybe it was God's will

83
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,200
that gave me a chance
to make up for my regrets.

84
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,640
In this world,

85
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,040
I also have a younger brother.

86
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,200
But I didn't expect

87
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,800
that this younger brother

88
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,200
to be cunning and villainous.

89
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,280
Oh my.

90
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,160
After thinking carefully,

91
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,120
I found this world

92
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,440
is much more interesting
than the real world.

93
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,520
I don't need to think about anything.

94
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,400
Do we

95
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,400
keep escaping forever?

96
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,040
[Demon Palace]

97
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,560
Someone!

98
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,320
Help!

99
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,320
Enough.

100
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,520
Enough.

101
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,960
Stop it.

102
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,120
I tied you up.

103
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,200
Why?

104
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,920
Do you

105
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,000
have any eccentricity?

106
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,440
Don't you have any idea

107
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,360
why I tied you up?

108
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,680
It's you who tied me up.
How could I have any idea?

109
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,160
You

110
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,920
don't remember?

111
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,480
What?

112
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,600
Keke.

113
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,840
You really look good.

114
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,240
You tied me up while I'm drunk.

115
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,240
You bad guy!

116
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,920
I was afraid

117
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,640
you'd do something weird

118
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,120
after getting drunk.

119
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,080
Ridiculous!

120
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,680
What a joke!

121
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,280
Among the entire Demon Realm,

122
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,800
there are few people

123
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,640
who are weaker than me.

124
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,520
I'm the one who should be afraid, okay?

125
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,680
It hurts.

126
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,520
Why do I feel like I've been hit?

127
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
Well...

128
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,120
You must have slept in a bad position.

129
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:55,720
Alright.

130
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,440
Get up now.

131
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,600
The location for the Summit Ceremony
has been set.

132
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,720
It's at Linyuan City.

133
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,200
Regarding the Summit Ceremony...

134
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,600
That's a long story.

135
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,800
At the beginning of the world,

136
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,040
the Divine Mother created the world,

137
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,440
making Six Realms.

138
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,920
Can you speak in plain words?

139
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,360
Alright then.

140
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,360
To put it simply,

141
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,680
the Summit Ceremony

142
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,920
is a communication event

143
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,880
organized for the Immortal Realm,

144
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,000
the Demon Realm and the Monster Realm.

145
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,240
It's held
once every three hundred years,

146
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
lasting one month.

147
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,160
The time and location
are decreed by the gods,

148
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,040
without fixed schedule.

149
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,040
Since it's hosted
by the Demon Realm this time.

150
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,080
The delegations from the Immortal Realm
and Monster Realm will visit Linyuan City.

151
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,960
There will be communications

152
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,120
and the three realms
will enjoy themselves

153
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,240
and embrace the peace.

154
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,040
Oh.

155
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,560
Who will be in the delegations
from the Immortal Realm

156
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,160
and the Monster Realm?

157
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,080
[Prince Yu's Mansion]

158
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,160
What?

159
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,560
Your Highness.

160
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,880
This Summit Ceremony

161
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,200
will be held in Linyuan City.

162
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,600
The delegations from the Immortal Realm
and the Monster Realm

163
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
will set off in a few days.

164
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,120
Who will be the envoys?

165
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,120
I heard

166
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,160
they are still

167
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,240
Immortal Lu Zhen from the Immortal Realm

168
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,640
and Young Lord Ying Ri

169
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,960
from the Monster Realm.

170
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,960
How is it?

171
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,400
A piece of sweet pastry

172
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,680
makes it less bitter.

173
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,280
Qi.

174
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,960
How is your saving of gold going?

175
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,360
Let me tell you secretly.

176
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,560
It's quite substantial.

177
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,520
But

178
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,880
it still falls short of my expectation.

179
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,200
Then you must hurry.

180
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,760
Then I will try harder

181
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,800
to achieve my expectation soon.

182
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,000
I heard

183
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,640
Miss Yuan has found some more
prescriptions for His Highness.

184
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,760
Right.

185
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,800
Miss Yuan has done so much
for His Highness.

186
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,720
Everyone here knows
they have a strong bond.

187
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,040
But,

188
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,640
why hasn't His Highness
married Miss Yuan yet?

189
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,240
His Highness is unpredictable.

190
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,720
You and I can never understand him.

191
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,680
This one

192
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,280
is the leading envoy
from the Monster Realm,

193
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,080
He's Ying Ri, Young Lord
of the Monster Realm,

194
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,520
the successor designated
by the Monster King.

195
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,000
But

196
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,760
he has rarely shown himself,

197
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,960
full of mystery.

198
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,840
This time

199
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,760
is his first time attending
the Summit Ceremony.

200
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,280
Therefore,

201
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,600
we don't know much about him.

202
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,080
What about this one?

203
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,720
This one

204
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,760
is the leading envoy
from the Immortal Realm.

205
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
He's Immortal Lu Zhen
from the Immortal Realm.

206
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,320
It's heard he is graceful, handsome,

207
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
upright and honest,

208
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,240
with a high reputation
in the Immortal Realm,

209
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,000
known as the role model
of the immortals.

210
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,880
Well,

211
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,600
he also has ties to the Monster Realm.

212
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,680
There is a book in the Immortal Realm
called the Record of Taming Monster,

213
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,520
which tames various guilty monsters.

214
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,600
Immortal Lu Zhen

215
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,240
is the guardian of this book.

216
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,320
Thus, the Monster Realm
greatly fears him.

217
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,280
For nearly a thousand years,

218
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,760
he's the one representing
the Immortal Realm

219
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,080
to attend the Summit Ceremony.

220
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,280
Have I attended

221
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,760
this ceremony?

222
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,400
It is said that three hundred years ago,

223
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,680
Demon King Suyan attended it
while he's still a Young Lord.

224
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,000
Well, then this Immortal

225
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,480
must have seen me.

226
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,320
If I talk to him,

227
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,040
I might get caught, right?

228
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,040
The former Demon King

229
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,440
certainly wasn't as timid as you.

230
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,320
He was solitary and unyielding.

231
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,560
Last time,

232
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,080
it is said he just showed up and left,

233
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,840
which caused a loss of face
for the Demon Realm.

234
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,640
Therefore,

235
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,120
he only met Lu Zhen once,

236
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,880
and didn't have a deep acquaintance.

237
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,920
Rest assured.

238
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,960
Young Lord,

239
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,640
everything has already been prepared.

240
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,720
