[Episode 8]

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,120
Suyan.

12
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,200
Suyan.

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:13,920
Suyan.

14
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,120
Suyan, come play with me.

15
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,240
Suyan.

16
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,400
This is Keke,

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,200
my favorite virtual idol.

18
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,520
Suyan.

19
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,240
When can I be free

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,640
to play outside like them?

21
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,880
Suyan.

22
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,400
Come back early, okay?

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,560
I'm waiting for you

24
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,880
to play games with me.

25
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,520
Nan.

26
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,880
How can I live without you?

27
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,400
Yan.

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,560
Why didn't you come back earlier?

29
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,040
If it weren't for you,

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,800
Nan wouldn't have missed
the best time for treatment.

31
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,520
It's all your fault.

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,080
It's all your fault.

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,880
It won't do.

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,000
Redo it.

35
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,440
Take it and redo it.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,480
Do you think this is acceptable?

37
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,920
Redo it.

38
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,040
How could I have such
a foolish subordinate?

39
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
If we use your plan,

40
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,440
our company will go bankrupt
in less than a month.

41
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,960
You haven't even done
your work properly.

42
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,920
How do you have the nerve
to leave on time?

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,800
Is lack of sleep an excuse?

44
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
Look at everyone.

45
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,840
They are all working
from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.

46
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,800
How come you're the only one
with so many issues?

47
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,720
You are crying?

48
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,000
Do you have the nerve to cry?

49
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,360
That's why they say women
are the most troublesome.

50
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,240
Since you've already
gotten what you wanted,

51
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,800
now

52
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,880
why are you in pain again?

53
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,320
You want to escape your brother's death,

54
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,000
escape the blame from your parents,

55
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,320
and escape reality.

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,640
That's why you chose to come here.

57
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,240
But why is your heart

58
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,200
still in pain?

59
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,200
Now you are working your way up

60
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,320
to be a commanding general,

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,720
but why are you still unhappy?

62
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,320
You want to escape
the "996" overtime culture,

63
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,680
escape from your boss's suppression,

64
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,960
and escape reality,

65
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,080
so

66
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,760
you came here.

67
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,080
But why are you

68
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,640
still not happy?

69
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,960
The Mirror Mountain Evaluator can
reflect everyone's inner demons.

70
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,240
You need to be careful.

71
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,680
But as the Demon King and General,

72
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,480
how could you be bound
by this mere Mirror Demon?

73
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,320
Could it be

74
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,760
there're some dark secrets

75
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,200
hidden in your hearts
that cannot be revealed?

76
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,040
Who is

77
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,320
this girl?

78
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,400
She is a maid of Prince Yu.

79
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,920
Where is Qi?

80
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,840
Miss Yuan has left for chores.

81
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,160
Did she leave the mansion?

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,720
Yes.

83
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,680
Do we need to send someone
to find Miss Yuan?

84
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,120
Never mind.

85
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:37,640
Let her be.

86
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,120
You can leave now.

87
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,160
Yes.

88
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:55,680
Let her be.

89
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,120
Eventually, one day,

90
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,840
everyone will leave.

91
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,240
So you do remember me.

92
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
My name is Yuan Qi.

93
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,280
I heard you came to Mirror Mountain.

94
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,520
I was worried

95
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,880
that His Highness would be against you,

96
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,400
so I came to save you.

97
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,880
If you are with Prince Yu,

98
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,200
why would you save us?

99
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,000
Why can't I?

100
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,960
Although I am with His Highness,

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,840
I can distinguish right from wrong.

102
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,320
His Highness

103
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,720
holds some grudges against the Lord.

104
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,880
Sometimes, he's quite stubborn about it.

105
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,440
You should not stoop to his level.

106
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,560
This girl is quite honest, isn't she?

107
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,760
Thank you for the rescue.

108
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:57,560
Wait.

109
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,720
Don't rush to thank me.

110
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,960
Everything here has a clear price.

111
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,200
The price is

112
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,000
20 gold per person.

113
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,000
If it's two people,

114
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,480
I'll charge

115
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,360
30 gold.

116
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,040
How about it?

117
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,800
You're charging for this?

118
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,960
Of course.

119
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,720
I came from far away to save you.

120
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,600
30 gold is already very cheap.

121
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,800
Think about it.

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,760
If not for my help,

123
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,160
you might be stuck in there

124
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,920
for a while.

125
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,920
This girl is not only honest

126
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,360
but also very practical.

127
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,560
Look at her business mind.

128
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,440
Pay me back when we return.

129
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,400
What are you doing here?

130
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,560
So,

131
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,600
you are unsatisfied

132
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,800
with yesterday's match, right?

133
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,360
Miss Jinli.

134
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,720
Is General Hua here?

135
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,440
No.

136
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,200
I told you yesterday.

137
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,280
If you want to find fault
with my general,

138
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,840
you must first get past me.

139
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,200
Miss Jinli.

140
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,680
I apologize for what I did yesterday.

141
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,000
I later realized

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,560
that I misunderstood General Hua.

143
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,480
So,

144
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,680
I've come to apologize today.

145
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,560
I hope

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,920
you'll forgive me.

147
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,280
Are you telling the truth?

148
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,720
Absolutely.

149
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,760
Alright.

150
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,040
Not to blame for not knowing.

151
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,920
I'll forgive you this time.

152
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,880
If this happens again...

153
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,120
I swear to the heavens

154
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,400
that it won't happen again.

155
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,120
You are

156
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,120
not bad after all.

157
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,280
Why are you scared?

158
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,200
Aren't you afraid of him?

159
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,120
Although I am just a young lady,

160
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,640
I have heard of the Demon King's decree.

161
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:29,400
Now the Twelve Cities have ceased
fighting to benefit the people,

162
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,360
with equality among all people.

163
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,480
The Demon and the Monster are encouraged
to trade with each other.

164
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,880
We are fortunate

165
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,440
to have such a wise ruler.

166
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,280
Why should we fear?

167
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,760
Having you

168
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,840
is Prince Yu's fortune.

169
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,600
My Lord.

170
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,040
I have personal motives this time.

171
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,520
His Highness has unresolved issues.

172
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,000
So I usually

173
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,120
do not intervene

174
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,160
or advise him to let go.

175
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,480
But one day,

176
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,200
if His Highness cannot
be absolved from his sins,

177
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,800
for the sake of my help today, My Lord,

178
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,040
please spare his life.

179
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,400
Alright.

180
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,320
I promise you.

181
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,440
Thank you, My Lord.

182
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,600
Finally, I can go home.

183
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,440
Why do I feel

184
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,960
something isn't quite right?

185
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,040
You're just realizing it now?

186
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,960
She asked you for 30 gold

187
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,840
and asked me for a life-saving promise.

188
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,280
Hasn't she made too much profit?

189
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,160
Miss Yuan.

190
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,440
Please return the gold to us.

191
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,600
How can you do business like this?

192
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,360
Even returning half of it
would be all right.

193
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,120
You're back.

194
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
Ouch, ouch.

195
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,840
I haven't even hit you yet.

196
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,360
If I shouted when you hit me,

197
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,440
wouldn't that be too late?

198
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,760
Have you waited for long?

199
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,200
Yes, indeed.

200
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,720
For too long.

201
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,800
It seems my illness has worsened.

202
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,120
Okay.

203
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,120
I will prepare medicine for you.

204
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:37,920
By the way,

205
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,360
why didn't you ask me

206
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,240
where I went?

207
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,360
You can go wherever you wish.

208
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,080
You are free.

209
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,480
But why are you

210
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,920
still not happy?

211
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,080
Right.

212
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,920
Why is that?

213
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,400
General.

214
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,960
Is there something on your mind?

215
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:17,760
Jinli.

216
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,520
Do you know

217
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,000
how one can truly be happy?

218
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,200
I think

219
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,160
as long as there is something
that I want to protect,

220
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,520
something I wish to accomplish,

221
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,280
and

222
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,240
someone who I like,

223
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,480
I will feel happy.

224
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
Jinli.

225
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,000
Do you have someone you like?

226
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,280
What's there to be embarrassed about?

227
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,320
Happiness

228
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,680
is something you must actively pursue.

229
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,600
I'm not quite sure either.

230
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,520
I just think

231
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,320
that person is very interesting.

232
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,640
We got to know
each other through a fight.

233
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,280
Although he's a bit rash,

234
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,560
he is a good person.

235
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,600
Today,

236
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,560
he even came to apologize.

237
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,160
Who is he?

238
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,120
Apologize for what?

239
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,120
It's just...

240
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:18,960
Well...

241
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,880
General Chen Ye.

242
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,120
What?

243
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,120
It was him?

244
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,840
Why would it be him?

245
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,400
I think

246
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,480
I need to take a walk

247
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,600
and process this news.

248
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,040
General Chen

249
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,360
is quite nice.

250
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,680
It seems

251
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,440
I'm not the only one who can't sleep.
