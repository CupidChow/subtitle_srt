[Episode 18]

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,000
Wherever you go,

12
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,960
you must carry this gold with you?

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,040
Of course.

14
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,480
Or His Highness would steal it from me.

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,320
You don't have to worry about food
and money in the Prince Yu's Mansion.

16
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,200
Why do you save this gold?

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,600
I'm saving this gold for important use.

18
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,000
If one day,

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,400
His Highness is really exiled

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,920
because of rebellion,

21
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,280
this gold can ensure

22
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,400
that he and I won't worry about money

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,280
on the road to exile.

24
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,560
Does His Highness know about this?

25
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,000
His Highness has never mentioned it,

26
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,000
but I think he knows everything.

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,320
That's why I tried to help you
so many times,

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,080
and he never blamed me.

29
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,680
It's more than that.

30
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,240
I suspect he was secretly helping you

31
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,840
extort us.

32
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,760
You two

33
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,520
are really like-minded.

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,080
This time, I owe you, My Lord.

35
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,440
Call me Suyan.

36
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,560
And brothers don't
owe each other anything.

37
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,200
Actually, I have no interest

38
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,320
in the position of the Demon King.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Regarding this,

40
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,280
I'm exactly like you.

41
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,600

42
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,480
stay for lunch.

43
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,480

44
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,760
I think

45
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,120
we can have a big meal.

46
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,520
Okay.

47
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,160
I rarely cook.

48
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,720
And I'm not sure how it tastes.

49
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,160
Please don't mind.

50
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,200
Well...

51
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,000
These dishes look quite unique.

52
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,640
This is so spectacular.

53
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,040
Look at these colors,

54
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,160
this luster,

55
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,560
and the presentation.

56
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,280
So artistic!

58
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,760
Are you serious?

59
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,000
Love is blind.

60
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,960
Why don't you give it a try?

61
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,080
Come on.

62
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,440
Try some.

63
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,320
This is stunning.

64
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,080
What delicacy is this?

67
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,320
Love makes you blind

68
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,880
and lost your taste as well?

72
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,120
I have not taken my medicine today.

73
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,000
I will have a meal with you another day.

74
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,640
Over there.

Regarding it,

77
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,800

It's all yours now.

87
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,720
Be careful.

88
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,960
Don't leave anything behind.

89
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,600

that from now on,

129
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,920

interfere with the Twelve Cities.

The reason I gave up sending troops
to the Twelve Cities

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,760
is simply I do not want
to see the war to be started again

Okay.

191
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,000
I am here to say goodbye

192
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,200
to you and General Hua.

193
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,600
Has the departure day
for the Immortal delegation been set?

194
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,960
I have informed Immortal Lord Lu Zhen

195
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,920
that I am not going to return
to the Immortal Realm with the delegation.

196
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,960
You won't return?

197
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,200
Miss Si.

198
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Where are you going?

199
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,400
The world is vast,

200
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,560
so I have places to go.

201
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,640
The Lord is right.

202
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,400
I could have been free
to practice medicine in the world.

203
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,360
Why be obsessed with empty fame?

204
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,200
Now,

205
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,560
I have found what I really want to do.

206
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,440
Compared to love,

207
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,400
I'd rather travel through the Six Realms

208
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,480
and save people,

209
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,320
becoming a true healer.

210
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,920
Having a medical immortal
like you in the Immortal Realm

211
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,680
is really a blessing for the Six Realms.

212
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,040
Actually, at one moment,

213
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,960
I indeed had a crush on the Lord.

214
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,000
But

215
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,400
compared to love,

216
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,360
I have something
more valuable to cherish.

217
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,880
Nerd.

218
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,040
Why are you here today?

219
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,720
Nothing can be hidden from you.

220
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,600
After the Summit Ceremony ends,

221
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,680
the delegation will
soon leave Linyuan City.

222
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,280
I wonder

223
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,680
when to meet you again.

224
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:07,960
So,

225
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,920
I have prepared the farewell wine.

226
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,360
Treat it as if it were a dream.

227
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,360
In the end of spring, I stop here.

228
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,880
To welcome guests
from three hundred years past,

229
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,080
only Linyuan can make it.

230
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,000
I have cultivated for a thousand years,

231
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,440
knowing everything
from the past and present.

232
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,000
Yet I still can't

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,560
compare to you.

234
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,440
Before I came here,

235
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,960
I had a glimpse of the sky

236
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,960
and noticed unusual phenomena
in the Demon Realm

237
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
that the imperial star has changed,

238
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
fearing a great change will happen.

239
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,080
Thus, in fact,

240
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,360
I came here

241
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,000
to set things right

242
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,440
