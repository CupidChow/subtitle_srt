[Episode 20]

11
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,040
Yuzai.

12
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,840
The scholar dies for his bosom friend.

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,960
I have no regrets.

14
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,520
Why is it so hard to be a salted fish?

15
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,600
My Lord.

16
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,840
Do you want to eat fish?

17
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,160
I've heard

18
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,760
saying in the Human Realm,

19
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,320
"The scholar dies for his bosom friend."

20
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,440
Since you regard me as a friend,

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,840
if I die for you,

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,440
I have no regrets.

23
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,320
My Lord.

24
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,000
Young Lord.

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,440
Once it's said,

26
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,560
then it counts.

27
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,240
I, Ying Ri, hereby swear

28
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,800
that if the Demon King cannot
give me a proper explanation today,

29
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,560
I will personally lead 100,000 warriors
from the Monster Realm.

30
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,040
I won't return

31
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,800
until the Demon Realm is destroyed.

32
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,240
The reason I gave up sending troops
to the Twelve Cities

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,240
is simply I do not want
to see the war to be started again

34
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,160
and the people suffer greatly.

35
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,400
If the people
at the border cities suffer,

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,160
I will personally lead
the Monster Realm's troops

37
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,480
to take back the Twelve Cities.

38
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,680
Good.

39
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
It's a deal.

40
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,240
Young Lord, you are concerned
about the common people.

41
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,040
You are sure to be
a good ruler in the future.

42
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,520
Okay.

43
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,160
Miss Si.

44
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,680
In my heart,

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,560
you are the true medical immortal.

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,960
Physicians save lives
and help the injured.

47
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,040
It's one of the noblest professions.

48
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,320
You are really incredible.

49
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,240
Marry me, My Lord,

50
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,240
you will get
a glimmer of hope for Prince Yu,

51
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,960
and I can also rely on your identity

52
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,760
to secure the title of medical immortal.

53
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,560
Is it not a perfect solution?

54
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,520
If we do this,

55
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,640
it would only make you suffer.

56
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,360
I treat illnesses

57
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,920
and you heal hearts.

58
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,720
Miss Yuan.

59
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,160
I will keep

60
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,280
my promise to you.

61
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,640
Don't rush to thank me.

62
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,640
Everything here has a clear price.

63
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,640
20 gold for one person.

64
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,960
If it's two people,

65
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,240
I'll charge you

66
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,040
30 gold.

67
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,160
How does that sound?

68
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,440
You're charging for this?

69
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,120
But even if His Highness
chooses a dead end,

70
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,320
I still

71
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,160
want to leave him a way out.

72
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,560
Thank you, My Lord.

73
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:17,960
During all these years,

74
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,040
you've had it tough.

75
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,800
Why does this kid seem so obstinate

76
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
with such a small body?

77
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,640
This time, I owe you, My Lord.

78
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,240
Just call me Suyan.

79
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,440
And brothers don't
owe each other anything.

80
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,440
No.

81
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,200
I finally have a brother.

82
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,520
How can you do this?

83
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,800
Live well.

84
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,480
In this life,

85
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,680
having a friend like you

86
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,120
fills my heart with joy.

87
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,800
Even if I have a talent for poetry,

88
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,160
without someone like you
who understands poetry,

89
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,200
wouldn't it be in vain?

90
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,560
This world is full of those
who know pleasure,

91
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,920
but it's hard to get those
who understand me.

92
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,920
But you have astonishing poetic talent

93
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,560
and the ability to govern the world.

94
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,400
Only now do I understand
that those anomalies

95
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,680
were not chaos.

96
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,160
I am just a commoner,

97
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,320
with mirth, scolding,

98
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,080
greed, anger, ignorance, and hatred.

99
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,920
But having a friend like you

100
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,360
brings me great joy.

101
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,640
As for the rest,

102
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:31,840
it doesn't matter.

103
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,880
It also fills my heart with joy.

104
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,200
General Chen.

105
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,800
I will leave the Twelve Cities to you.

106
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,960
Now the Monster Realm
provokes us time and again,

107
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,880
yet you say to prioritize peace.

108
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,600
Who exactly are you?

109
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,640
Now the civilian life in Twelve Cities
has been restored

110
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,960
and trade is booming.

111
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,240
However, we must stay vigilant

112
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,080
even in peace.

113
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,880
That's why I need
a true protector of the cities

114
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,920
to guard the Twelve Cities
against invasion

115
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,560
and secure a hundred years of peace.

116
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,480
I am willing to defend the city.

117
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,720
I am willing

118
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,360
to defend the city to the death.

119
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,720
What a surprise.

120
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,320
I didn't expect...

121
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,960
My Lord.

122
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,040
We were just chatting just now.

123
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,720
I didn't expect you
to be a time traveler as well.

124
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,320
A king

125
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,680
has to devote himself to the people

126
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,640
even if he has to die for it.

127
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,600
Such a state

128
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,600
is beyond my reach.

129
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,360
I would never sacrifice my life

130
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,440
for the people of the Demon.

131
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,240
I like you.

132
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
I like you very much.

133
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,440
I can't wait any longer.

134
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,960
I want to tell you right now

135
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,320
that I really like you.

136
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
Even though I'm useless,

137
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,120
coward and incompetent,

138
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,920
escaping reality

139
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,840
and always wanting to give up.

140
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,240
Additionally,
I can't live long without you.

141
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,440
But I just can't stop liking you.

142
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,560
I want you to promise me

143
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,680
to search for the orb with me,

144
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,960
and return together

145
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,760
to the reality we once escaped from.

146
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,440
Only by facing reality

147
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,440
and letting go of the past,

148
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,480
can we keep moving forward.

149
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,280
What if

150
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,160
we don't find the orb?

151
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,320
Shut up.

152
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,480
I am the orb.

153
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,640
No.

154
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,240
I'm not going back.

155
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,440
We won't go anywhere.

156
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,760
Okay?

157
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,680
What's that saying again?

158
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,080
The homebody can save the world.

159
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Unexpectedly,

160
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,880
I can really save the world now.

161
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,760
If you save the world,

162
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,960
who will save me?

163
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,280
The last thing I can do for you

164
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,240
is to send you back.

165
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,280
Don't.

166
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,520
I'm not going back.

167
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,080
Didn't you say

168
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,120
that nothing can do us apart
in your world?

169
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,320
Though this journey is brief,

170
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,840
I've gained the most precious thing.

171
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,360
I used to escape

172
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,600
reality,

173
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,160
and I was useless,

174
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,680
timid, and weak,

175
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,800
until I met you all.

176
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,120
Each of you can live in the moment.

177
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,640
You gave me strength

178
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,040
and made me a qualified Demon King.

179
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,280
I, the Demon King Suyan,

180
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,760
am willing to offer
my Primordial Spirit orb

181
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,640
to eternally guard this place.

182
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,080
No regrets

183
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,680
until death.

184
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,640
My Lord.

185
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,680
My Lord.

186
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,360
Nerd.

187
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,760
My Lord.

188
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,760
Suyan.

189
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,080
