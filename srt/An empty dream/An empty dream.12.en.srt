[Episode 12]

11
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,120
Although it's no match for the generous
gifts you two have brought,

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,680
these two gifts

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,000
were personally chosen by me,

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,320
symbolizing my genuine welcome.

15
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,080
I hope the Immortal Lord

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,440
and the Young Lord

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,560
will like them.

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,960
I appreciate

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,840
your kindness...

20
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,840
My Lord.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,800
What does this mean?

22
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:34,880
Huh?

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,360
Why would it be fox fur?

24
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,680
Who doesn't know that the Monster King
is from the Fox Tribe?

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,840
Oh, no.

26
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,920
Everyone in Six Realms knows
that Immortal Lord Lu Zhen's true form

27
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,200
is a spiritual deer.

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,480
Sending deer antlers as a gift

29
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,040
is improper.

30
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,320
I'm afraid

31
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,800
that I cannot accept this grand gift.

32
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,880
But this matter is quite peculiar.

33
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,840
We still need to clarify
the reasons behind it.

34
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,600
You can tolerate this,

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,480
but I cannot.

36
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,080
We have traveled
thousands of miles to Linyuan City

37
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,320
for the Summit Ceremony,

38
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,600
only to be subjected
to such humiliation.

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,280
Where's the justice?

40
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,680
I, Ying Ri, hereby swear

41
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,120
that if the Demon King cannot
give me a proper explanation today,

42
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,760
I will personally lead 100,000 warriors
from the Monster Realm.

43
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,400
I won't return

44
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,320
until the Demon Realm is destroyed.

45
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,200
The Immortal Lord wants
to clarify the reasons.

46
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,920
The Young Lord wants an explanation.

47
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,560
If so,

48
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,520
how can I not fulfill your wishes?

49
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,080
Bring them on.

50
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,520
My Lord,

51
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,520
I have just witnessed this monster

52
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,720
sneaking into the side hall

53
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,400
and replacing the grand gifts

54
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,640
that you had prepared in advance.

55
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,440
It took me some effort

56
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,680
to capture him.

57
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,000
Thus I was a step too late

58
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,400
and could not replace gifts in time.

59
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,880
My Lord, I beg for your punishment.

60
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,640
It is also an explanation
to the Immortal Lord and the Young Lord.

61
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,960
Young Lord, didn't you
want an explanation?

62
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,280
You can know it now.

63
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,000
Young Lord.

64
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,760
I think

65
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,440
that you are familiar with this monster.

66
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,880
I remember

67
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,560
that he should be a member
of the Monster Realm's delegation.

68
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,880
Qi.

69
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,280
Pour the wine.

70
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
Did you do it?

71
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,720
You...

72
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,640
Your Young Lord has made a great plan.

73
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,880
If the Demon King is humiliated

74
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,960
and the Demon Realm is in turmoil,

75
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,920
the Monster

76
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,840
will take advantage of the chaos.

77
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,400
In fact, our Young Lord just wants...

78
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,960
Go back and tell your Young Lord

79
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,680
that I agree

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,320
to this matter.

81
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,840
Don't look at me like that.

82
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,560
It makes me feel uneasy,

83
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,080
and feel like nothing good
will come of this.

84
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,400
My Lord, you're wise.

85
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,520
I'm here this time

86
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,120
precisely to assist you

87
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,000
in addressing concerns.

88
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,280
What is my cunning and sickly

89
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,920
younger brother scheming again?

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,880
My Lord.

91
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,720
What does "cunning and sickly" mean?

92
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,480
And what does "scheming" mean?

93
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,280
What the Lord means

94
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,760
is that Prince Yu

95
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,880
is planning something
against the Lord again?

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,440
Your assistance in addressing concerns

97
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,000
isn't for free, is it?

98
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,600
You know me too well, My Lord.

99
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,800
In fact,

100
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,080
as long as there is enough gold,

101
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,600
I can surely assist you

102
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,680
in averting disaster
through financial loss.

103
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,400
Averting disaster
through financial loss.

104
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,320
You are the first one

105
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,240
to justify the extortion.

106
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,360
Miss Yuan.

107
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,200
You have rescued us several times.

108
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,080
Aren't you afraid
that Prince Yu will punish you

109
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,280
after he learns of this?

110
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,600
What exactly is your purpose?

111
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,640
I was orphaned at a young age.

112
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,920
His Highness took me into his residence

113
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,720
and allowed me to grow up by his side.

114
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,080
I know His Highness

115
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,800
harbors a deep sadness.

116
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,920
He has been frail
and sick since childhood.

117
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,840
He was neglected by his father,

118
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,680
ignored by his elder brother,

119
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,800
and treated coldly by tribespeople.

120
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,720
He has suffered enough already.

121
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,040
So I won't stop him
from doing what he wants.

122
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,240
But even if His Highness
chooses a dead end,

123
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,560
I still

124
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,200
want to leave him a way out.

125
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,080
What are you thinking?

126
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,840
About Yuan Qi?

127
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,400
I want to give up.

128
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,480
Being a Demon King
means so much trouble.

129
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,960
How about

130
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,920
I just give up the throne to him?

131
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,240
Fine.

132
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,440
If you abdicate in his favor today,

133
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,200
the Demon will be in chaos tomorrow.

134
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,880
Just think about it.

135
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,320
The Demon has a nature
of admiring the strong.

136
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,800
Could they easily let
Prince Yu ascend to the throne?

137
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,440
He colluded with the Monster's
Young Lord Ying Ri,

138
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,720
merely to gain the support
of the Monster Realm.

139
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,800
But Ying Ri's purpose

140
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,560
is never to disgrace me,

141
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,640
but to use this as a pretext

142
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,480
to reignite the war

143
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,760
and reclaim the Twelve Cities.

144
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,760
When the time comes,

145
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,400
unless concessions are made,

146
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,640
how could the Monster Realm
possibly support him?

147
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,560
And if he agrees to that,

148
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,200
how could the Demon Realm
tolerate such a Demon King?

149
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,920
He's so foolish.

150
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,840
Even we can figure that out.

151
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,240
Prince Yu is unfathomable,

152
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,120
so how could he not figure it out?

153
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,480
Right.

154
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,360
Why then?

155
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,720
I'm also beginning to get confused.

156
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,520
Never mind.

157
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,640
Since we know he's up to something,

158
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,360
we just

159
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,560
prepare in advance.

160
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,400
Hmm.

161
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,680
The Monster aims for the Twelve Cities.

162
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,680
The Twelve Cities are
gradually regaining vitality,

163
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,920
but we still need
a capable person to defend them,

164
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,920
so the Monster will stop coveting them.

165
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,600
Someone might be

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,400
the best candidate.

167
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,920
[Study]

168
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,120
My Lord.

169
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,280
You are looking for me?

170
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,160
General Chen.

171
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,680
I have a question.

172
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:13,760
My Lord.

173
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,280
I am the deputy general.

174
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,280
I dare not overstep.

175
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,120
Then, starting today,

176
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,720
you are the general.

177
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,120
General Chen,

178
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,360
now the civilian life in Twelve Cities
has been restored

179
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,680
and trade is booming.

180
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,920
However, we must stay vigilant

181
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,840
even in peace.

182
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,560
That's why I need
a true protector of the cities

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,640
to guard the Twelve Cities
against invasion

184
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,360
and secure a hundred years of peace.

185
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,920
I am willing

186
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,200
to defend the city.

187
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,320
General Chen.

188
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,840
Have you made up your mind?

189
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,360
Getting far from the capital

190
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,400
and defending the border for a century

191
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,840
will involve

192
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,360
all kinds of hardships.

193
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,040
For you, My Lord,

194
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,880
for the people of the Twelve Cities,

195
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,920
and for the everlasting
peace of the Demon,

196
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,920
I am willing to guard the border.

197
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,520
I'll lay down my life for it

198
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,200
and never shirk from death.

199
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,280
Your Highness.

200
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,600
Please take your medicine first.

201
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,400
It's alright.

202
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,160
I'm fine.

203
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,640
My Lord.

204
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,040
I'm not feeling well.

205
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,600
I hope you'll allow me

206
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,800
to leave first.

207
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,240
Hmm.

208
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,440
