[Episode 19]

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,160
I have cultivated for a thousand years,

12
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,480
knowing everything
from the past and present.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,400
Yet I still can't

14
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,960
compare to you.

15
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:44,840
Before I came here,

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,640
I had a glimpse of the sky,

17
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,600
and noticed unusual phenomena
in the Demon Realm

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,920
that the imperial star has changed,

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,960
fearing a great change will happen.

20
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,800
Thus, in fact,

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
I came here

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,880
to set things right

23
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,240
in the right direction.

24
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,800
But

25
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,360
you have astonishing poetic talent

26
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:05,000
and the ability to govern the world.

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,800
Only now do I understand
that those anomalies

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,160
were not chaos.

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:11,800
Perhaps your emergence

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,240
is following the laws of nature.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,080
Well,

32
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,240
I've lived a bewildered life.

33
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,480
By chance,

34
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,320
somehow

35
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,800
I have turned out like this.

36
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,000
I am just a commoner,

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,520
with mirth, scolding,

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,360
greed, anger,

39
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,320
ignorance, and hatred.

40
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,920
But having a friend like you

41
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,520
brings me great joy.

42
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,760
As for the rest,

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,080
it doesn't matter.

44
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,200
Having a friend like you

45
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,520
also fills my heart with joy.

46
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,200
By the way, Lu San.

47
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,240
Since you are knowing everything
from the past and present,

48
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,000
have you ever heard of a mysterious orb

49
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,440
in the Demon Realm?

50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,120
The orb?

51
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,920
I have been searching
for that orb all along,

52
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,760
but I couldn't find it.

53
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,600
Do you know

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,080
the twin orbs of the Demon Realm?

55
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,760
Twin orbs?

56
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,080
What are those?

57
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,880
I see.

58
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,560
This matter is a secret
of the Demon Realm.

59
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,280
I only came to know it by chance.

60
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,520
Well, do you know

61
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,920
the Treasure of the Demon Realm?

62
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,520
It's the demon orb, right?

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,960
The Treasure of the Demon Realm
is a pair of orbs.

64
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,280
One is the demon orb,

65
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,600
and the other is the orb.

66
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,920
Several centuries ago,

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,760
there was turmoil in the Demon Realm.

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,480
The pair of orbs
that protected the Demon Realm

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,640
were born with the twin children
of the previous Demon King.

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,520
They are also a part
of the twin's primordial spirits.

71
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,400
To maintain the stability
of the Demon Realm,

72
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,320
the previous Demon King
took the demon orb

73
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,320
out from the younger child's
primordial spirit

74
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,280
and enshrined it
under the Demon Realm's altar.

75
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,520
As a result,

76
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,640
the younger child's primordial spirit
became weak,

77
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,560
and he was plagued with illness.

78
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,000
Meanwhile, the other orb

79
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,440
remained in the elder son's
primordial spirit.

80
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,720
The younger of the twins

81
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,640
is none other than Prince Yu.

82
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,320
And the elder son

83
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,520
is now the current Demon King,

84
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,680
You...

85
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,360
Though Prince Yu is your twin brother,

86
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,960
he has been frail and sickly all along.

87
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,760
Prince Yu suffers from his illness

88
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,880
because his primordial spirit
is incomplete.

89
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,000
Look,

90
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,600
with a stroke like this,

91
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,360
you can see the mountains and rivers.

92
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,280
What's wrong, Your Highness?

93
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,720
Are you feeling unwell?

94
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,600
Don't worry.

95
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,520
It's nothing serious.

96
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,320
It looks like it's going to rain.

97
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,640
I have an ominous premonition.

98
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,400
A storm is approaching.

99
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,360
I'll go out and take a look.

100
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,920
I'll go with you.

101
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,760
If the previous Demon King

102
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,960
enshrined my orb

103
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,640
under the altar back then...

104
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,960
The Demon King today

105
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,120
might have been Prince Yu.

106
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,880
Nerd.

107
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,880
The past cannot be advised,

108
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,600
but the future is still
within our reach.

109
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,640
After searching for so long,

110
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,560
I never thought the orb had been with me

111
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,800
from the very beginning.

112
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,280
If I forcefully extract the orb,

113
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,000
what will happen?

114
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,160
The orb has long become
a part of your primordial spirit.

115
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,680
If extracted by force,

116
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,480
it would surely lead to your death

117
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,400
and soul dissipation.

118
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,800
The sun was shining just now.

119
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,600
Why the sudden thunder and lightning?

120
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,080
Right.

121
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,680
This weather is truly strange.

122
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,720
This is the malevolent energy
of the Demon Realm.

123
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,160
But,

124
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,640
why has it suddenly appeared?

125
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,000
Let's go

126
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,160
take a look.

127
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,800
What is that place?

128
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,600
It should be the Demon's altar.

129
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,280
What?

130
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,040
If the demon orb
under the altar is removed,

131
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,040
what will happen?

132
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,600
Taking it out might
seem harmless at first,

133
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,560
but after a while,

134
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,800
the malevolent energy of the Demon Realm

135
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,880
will burst forth.

136
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
This force

137
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,280
is enough to destroy
the entire Linyuan City.

138
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,320
The city's common people
won't be spared.

139
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,520
By then, all Six Realms

140
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,160
will be affected.

141
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,830
[Linyuan City]

142
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,200
Stop.

143
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:57,640
Young Lord.

144
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,440
It is but a sudden change
in the celestial phenomena.

145
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,440
Perhaps

146
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,600
it's going to rain.

147
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,480
This isn't a sign of rain.

148
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,480
Let's go take a look.

149
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,000
You all find a place
to take shelter for now.

150
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,440
It's the direction
of Linyuan City, right?

151
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,720
An anomaly at the royal capital.

152
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,480
I fear something has happened.

153
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,520
What should we do?

154
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,120
Should we go back and check it out?

155
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,400
No.

156
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,800
Our duty

157
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,880
is to protect the border city
until death.

158
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,280
My lord.

159
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,760
The malevolent energy is too strong.

160
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,880
I'm afraid we cannot hold it back.

161
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,680
Immortal Lord.

162
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,160
Think of something.

163
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,760
Suyan.

164
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,480
It's all because of me.

165
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,960
Take away the demon orb.

166
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,360
Your Highness.

167
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,920
Aren't you the Demon King?

168
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,160
What are you waiting for?

169
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,880
To maintain the stability
of the Demon Realm,

170
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,840
the previous Demon King
took the demon orb

171
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,760
out from the younger child's
primordial spirit

172
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,720
and enshrined it
under the Demon Realm's altar.

173
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,000
As a result,

174
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,040
the younger child's primordial spirit
became weak,

175
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,920
and he was plagued with illness.

176
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,480
Meanwhile, the other orb

177
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,680
remained in the elder son's
primordial spirit.

178
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,240
If the previous Demon King

179
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,600
enshrined my orb

180
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,320
under the altar back then,

181
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,840
the Demon King today

182
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,160
might have been Prince Yu.

183
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,880
The orb has long become
a part of your primordial spirit.

184
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,000
If it were forcibly removed,

185
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,760
it would surely lead to your death

186
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,680
and soul dissipation.

187
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,400
The malevolent energy of the Demon Realm

188
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,560
will burst forth.

189
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,280
This force

190
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,920
is enough to destroy
the entire Linyuan City.

191
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,040
The city's common people
won't be spared.

192
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,320
By then, all Six Realms

193
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
will be affected.

194
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,480
I can never become a real Demon King.

195
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,960
After all, a king

196
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,120
has to devote himself to the people

197
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,160
even if he has to die for it.

198
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,040
Such a state

199
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,960
is beyond my reach.

200
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,800
I would never sacrifice my life

201
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,760
for the people of the Demon.
