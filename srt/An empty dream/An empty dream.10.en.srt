[Episode 10]

11
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,800
This is the performance

12
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,280
for the Summit Ceremony?

13
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,960
My Lord.

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,520
This is the Demon's welcome dance,

15
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,720
one of the fixed performance
at the Summit Ceremony.

16
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,480
Don't you think this kind
of fixed dance performance

17
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,560
is particularly boring?

18
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,880
No one can get excited.

19
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,360
You're here to see the performance,

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,760
not to rave.

21
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,600
What's there to be excited about?

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,120
If you think it is boring,

23
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,280
then you'd do it.

24
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,120
Stop.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,320
Fine, I'll do it.

26
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,400
Today, I'll show you

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,920
what a professional dancer is.

28
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,200
I wish

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,120
I have never seen this.

30
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,400
Just tell me,

31
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,200
what do you think?

32
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,440
In this world,

33
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,560
is there no one you care about anymore?

34
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,240
She said I was making a fuss.

35
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,720
She doesn't appreciate it.

36
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,240
Otaku dance.

37
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,080
Do you know about the otaku dance?

38
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,080
Otaku dance

39
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,960
is the best.

40
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,360
This is the most important thing
in the ACG world.

41
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,480
She just doesn't appreciate...

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
General Hua's

43
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,960
artistic attainments

44
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,320
are indeed inferior to mine.

45
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
What a pity.

46
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,280
What a pity.

47
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,480
My Lord.

48
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,760
To welcome the Summit Ceremony,
the city has held many events

49
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,080
these past few days.

50
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,520
If you feel boring,

51
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,120
you might as well take a look.

52
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,960
Events?

53
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,200
Look,

54
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,320
how lively it is!

55
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,480
It's much more fun
than the Demon Palace.

56
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,600
Yuzai.

57
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,000
So many people up ahead.

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What are they doing?

59
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,760
My Lord.

60
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,320
I think

61
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,600
it's the poetry gathering

62
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,080
for the Summit Ceremony.

63
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,840
Poetry gathering?

64
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,160
Let's go

65
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:53,680
check it out.

66
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,080
[Summit Ceremony]
The Demon

67
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,040
has always been considered
to value the military force.

68
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,000
Now,

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,480
it's rare that the Summit Ceremony
is held in Linyuan City.

70
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,480
Today,

71
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,440
we gather for poetry.

72
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,800
The purpose is

73
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,440
to show those monsters and immortals

74
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,400
that we also value knowledge.

75
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,160
Okay?

76
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,560
Okay.

77
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,640
The theme of this poetry gathering

78
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,240
is guest welcoming.

79
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,480
The winner

80
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,160
shall get this grand prize.

81
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,000
What's in that box?

82
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,240
Why are they so excited?

83
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,200
My Lord.

84
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,440
This is the thousand-year-old Xuanchu,

85
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,160
the herb rarely seen in the Six Realms.

86
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,480
I didn't expect to see one here today.

87
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,360
I'll go first.

88
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,800
Please.

89
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,520
All who come are guests.

90
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,680
Today I pay the bill.

91
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,320
Drink as you please.

92
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,800
It's all for fun.

93
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,160
This is not a poetry,

94
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,280
but a joke.

95
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,360
If you're capable, you try.

96
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,600
This is easy.

97
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,880
Let me think.

98
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,800
I've got it.

99
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,360
The Monster and the Immortal are coming.

100
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,240
The Demon is welcoming them.

101
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,720
What do you mean

102
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,600
by that?

103
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,080
It sounds petty.

104
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,720
Listen to me.

105
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,480
Guests from Six Realms

106
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,800
are gathering here with joys.

107
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,920
Today we are at the poetry gathering,

108
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,920
tomorrow we'll have a happy end.

109
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,720
I have finally understood.

110
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,080
The Demon needs

111
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,200
to get educated.

112
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,880
Otherwise,

113
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,600
it will no longer be the Demon,

114
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,880
but the Illiteracy.

115
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,960
Illiterate literally.

116
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,280
This is all nonsense.

117
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,000
They are all ones
who don't get compulsory education.

118
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,880
It's time

119
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,280
to show my true skills.

120
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,960
I have a poetry

121
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,360
and I wish to share it with you all.

122
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,680
Please.

123
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,920
Treat it as if it were a dream.

124
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,080
In the end of spring, I stop here.

125
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,960
To welcome guests
from three hundred years past,

126
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,520
only Linyuan can make it.

127
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,080
What a line.

128
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,760
To welcome guests
from three hundred years past,

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,760
only Linyuan can make it.

130
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,120
With modest

131
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,400
and domineering sense,

132
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,320
it's a rare and remarkable poetry.

133
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,920
Excellent.

134
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,840
Good.

135
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,600
Sir, please wait.

136
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,880
What's up?

137
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,840
Sir, your poetic talent
is extraordinary.

138
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,080
Your brilliance and elegance
are stunning,

139
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,240
winning my utmost admiration.

140
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,600
May I ask

141
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,800
if you could chat with me?

142
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,520
Lu San?

143
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,120
What an interesting name.

144
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,600
Just call me Nerd.

145
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,400
It sounds friendly.

146
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,400
Actually, the poem just now

147
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,520
was something
I came up with on the spot.

148
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,480
After all,

149
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,600
I'm just standing
on the shoulders of giants.

150
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,640
Giants?

151
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,760
I am merely a beneficiary
of the compulsory education.

152
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,520
In where I come from,

153
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,840
everyone can recite
a few lines of poetry.

154
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,680
Even children can recite some poetry.

155
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,320
What is the compulsory education?

156
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,400
Well...

157
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,920
Everyone can go to school

158
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,280
and learn knowledge

159
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,200
equally

160
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,080
and free of charge.

161
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,040
Everyone?

162
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:18,920
Exactly.

163
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:19,720
Everyone.

164
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,680
Regardless of
whether they are male or female,

165
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,480
or who they are.

166
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,600
In front of education,

167
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,160
everyone is equal.

168
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,000
I see.

169
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,680
I've learned a lot from you

170
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,720
today.

171
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,120
Me too.

172
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,680
Even if I have a talent for poetry,

173
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,840
without someone like you,

174
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,240
who really understands poetry,

175
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,240
it would also be a waste.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,560
This world is full of those
who know pleasure,

177
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,120
but it's hard to get those
who understand me.

178
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,880
This world is full of those
who know pleasure,

179
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,200
but it's hard to get those
who understand me.

180
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,760
For this single line,

181
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,440
my journey here is not a waste.

182
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:08,880
Try this.

183
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,320
A bosom friend is rarely found in life.

184
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,120
Drink.

185
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's drink.

186
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,600
It's rare to see you this happy.

187
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,200
Apart from General Hua and you,

188
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,440
I have finally made another friend.

189
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,120
I am so happy.

190
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,520
My Lord.

191
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,680
You said that I am

192
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,320
your friend?

193
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,640
You're the first person

194
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,080
who's really cared about me
since I got here.

195
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,640
Then you are my friend.

196
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,200
But there are some things

197
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,960
I can't tell you.

198
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,400
I remember it in my heart

199
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,200
that you are

200
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,960
my friend.

201
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,960
General.

202
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,880
Logically speaking,

203
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,400
the delegation from the Monster Realm
should have arrived by now.

204
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,960
But there is still no sign of them.

205
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,480
I think

206
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,720
they are doing it on purpose,

207
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,840
probably wanting to put on airs.

208
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,040
Go

209
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,040
set up a table and a pot of wine

210
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,840
right at the city entrance.

211
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,780
[Study]

212
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,880
Why is it so quiet today?

213
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,200
Hua...

214
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,760
Where is General Hua?

215
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,440
My lord.

216
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,040
Today,
the Monster's delegation will arrive.

217
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,560
In case anything wrong will occur,

218
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,920
General Hua has gone
to meet them in person.

219
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,960
The Monster's delegation?

220
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,760
We were invited into the city,

221
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,000
yet you are obstructing us here.

222
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,280
Is this how you treat guests?

223
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,000
When distinguished guests come,

224
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,960
it is only natural
to offer them a toast.

225
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,360
However, this toast has been prolonged.

226
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,680
I'm afraid

227
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,440
it has become a penalty drink,

228
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,240
and its taste has also changed.

229
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,640
Ridiculous!

230
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,200
How dare you be so rude!

231
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,640
Tell me your name.

232
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,960
I never scare of

233
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:04,920
telling anyone my name.

234
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,480
Hua Yao.

235
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,400
Hua Yao?

236
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,040
She is that General Hua?

237
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,520
It's her

238
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,600
who took

239
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,080
Twelve Cities from us.

240
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,360
I heard she is invincible.

241
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,320
In the Demon Realm,

242
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,480
she's second

243
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,560
only to one.

244
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,000
Since you have come
to greet us personally,

245
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,240
you must attach
great importance to the visit

246
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,160
of the Monster.

247
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
So,

248
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,960
we are grateful.

249
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,200
But we got held up on the way.

250
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
The wine you prepared might be in vain.

251
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,760
However, I also brought
from the Monster Realm

252
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,600
a few jars of exquisite wild wine.

253
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,960
I shall offer them to you.

254
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,040
The longer

255
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,920
my wine is stored,
the more mellow it becomes.

256
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,720
Its taste will never change.

257
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,000
Thank you, Young Lord.

258
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,960
I'm afraid I might not get used to it

259
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,520
and waste your gifts.

260
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,800
Welcome the delegation

261
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,840
