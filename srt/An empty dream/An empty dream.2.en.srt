[Episode 2]

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,800
General Hua.

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,760
It's been a while.

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,720
What!

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:42,360
It's you!

15
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,600
Oh no.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,960
How is it him?

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,480
Wait.

18
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,920
My head.

19
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,040
It hurts so much.

20
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:18,720
My head.

21
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,480
I am not feeling well today.

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,640
Let's adjourn the court for now.

23
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,240
Why didn't you tell me

24
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,400
that General Hua is a woman?

25
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:41,360
Your Majesty.

26
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,720
I have been wrongly accused.

27
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,720
I did not know

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,240
that you had even forgotten

29
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,200
General Hua's gender.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,760
I ask you.

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,640
When did General Hua return?

32
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,080
General Hua returned with the army,

33
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,960
so they

34
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,520
entered the city yesterday.

35
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,560
Yesterday?

36
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,600
If...

37
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,800
I mean if...

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,400
If General Hua had returned a month ago,

39
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,440
how would you explain it?

40
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,640
Your Majesty.

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,680
This is a very

42
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,240
dangerous "if".

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,120
A general returning to the royal city
without imperial orders

44
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
can be seen as a crime of treason.

45
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,920
I know

46
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,000
that you and General Hua
have never gotten along.

47
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,400
But this accusation

48
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,200
is severe.

49
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,760
Your Majesty.

50
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,840
The Demon King's decree
has already been passed down.

51
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,520
General Hua

52
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,320
is now your personal guard.

53
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,160
Perhaps

54
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,040
by spending time with each other,

55
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,760
your relationship

56
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,400
will gradually improve.

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,840
It's over.

58
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,960
Everything is over.

59
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,920
Who would have thought
that she was General Hua?

60
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,360
She... She...

61
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,280
Instead of staying put
at the border as she should,

62
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,160
she returned to court on her own

63
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,400
and even dared to barge
into the Demon Palace.

64
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,080
If it weren't to take my life,

65
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,640
why would she take such a great risk?

66
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,840
Oh no, it's all over now.

67
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,400
And now she has even
become my personal guard.

68
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,760
I might as well offer her my neck.

69
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Why is it so hard to be a salted fish?

70
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,240
Your Majesty.

71
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,520
Do you want to eat fish?

72
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,680
No, I don't!

73
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,040
I'll eat your head.

74
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:27,600
Your Majesty.

75
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,960
I don't have much of a brain.

76
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,320
My head definitely won't taste good.

77
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,920
General.

78
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,560
His Majesty has summoned us suddenly.

79
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,600
Could it be something important?

80
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,920
The intention of His Majesty

81
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,600
is hard to guess.

82
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,560
Let's go.

83
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,480
Hurry up and go.

84
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:58,960
Hurry.

85
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,800
What is going on here?

86
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,080
General Hua,

87
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,640
presumably

88
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,000
they must have displeased
His Majesty again.

89
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,400
What do you mean?

90
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
You're not aware.

91
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,480
His Majesty is now

92
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,000
famously known as the cold-blooded
Demon King in the Six Realms.

93
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,640
Most

94
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,440
of these people are
instructed by His Majesty

95
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,040
to take their own punishment.

96
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,400
The previous head of the guards

97
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,680
made a mistake

98
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,360
and voluntarily gave up his cultivation.

99
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,040
General Hua.

100
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,360
This way, please.

101
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,440
It seems

102
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,280
my barging into the Demon Palace
can't be concealed any longer.

103
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,240
Without his totem or mask,

104
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,600
I didn't recognize him.

105
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,320
He's making me see this

106
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,960
to send a message.

107
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,720
I have military exploits to my name

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,840
and the support of the people.

109
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,480
He didn't confront me head-on,

110
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,200
and instead, he's appointed me
as his personal guard.

111
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,360
Presumably,

112
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,560
it is also to pick faults

113
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,400
and have me punished.

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,040
Quite a cunning and
unpredictable mastermind.

115
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,560
Prince Yu, secretly summoning me

116
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,840
can't just be

117
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,200
for tea, right?

118
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,280
I risked the great crime of treason

119
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,520
to return quietly to Linyuan City.

120
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,400
I hope Your Highness

121
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,160
will not let me down.

122
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
She can stay.

123
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,560
I heard General Hua

124
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,080
has been searching for the orb.

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,200
If that is really the case,

126
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,760
you and I might as well make a deal.

127
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,160
Do you have the whereabouts of the orb?

128
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,480
Who knows?

129
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,480
What deal?

130
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,880
It's simple.

131
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,520
Kill someone for me,

132
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,280
and I will find the orb for you.

133
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:19,880
Who?

134
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,680
The Demon King,

135
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,520
Suyan.

136
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,480
I've heard the Demon King has been
in seclusion for cultivation recently,

137
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,520
which is precisely
when he is at his weakest.

138
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,200
In this nation,

139
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,560
the only one who can match him

140
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,800
is none other than General Hua.

141
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,040
Your Highness.

142
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,320
You're truly unafraid of death.

143
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,160
Those who are about to die

144
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,560
have no reason to fear death.

145
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,280
Deal.

146
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,080
If it's fortune, it's not calamity.

147
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,440
If it is calamity, it cannot be avoided.

148
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,960
Come on.

149
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,040
Let the storm come more fiercely.

150
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,680
A true man stands in the world,

151
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,920
and survival is of utmost importance.

152
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,240
When she arrives shortly,

153
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,000
should I kneel and kowtow to her?

154
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,160
Perhaps she will spare me.

155
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,600
Your Majesty.

156
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,160
General Hua is here.

157
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,320
Okay.

158
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,360
Greetings, Your Majesty.

159
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,680
Hua...

160
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,280
General Hua, stand up.

161
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,680
General Hua.

162
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,560
What are you doing?

163
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,440
Your Majesty.

164
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,120
Since you have appointed me
as the commander of guards,

165
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,720
starting today,

166
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,440
I shall never leave your side

167
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,760
and protect you with my life.

168
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,120
General.

169
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,560
You have already made it clear

170
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,880
that you want to protect His Majesty.

171
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,640
But why does His Majesty

172
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,080
seem so unhappy?

173
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,480
He

174
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,880
is probably worried.

175
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,560
About what?

176
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,920
Jinli,

177
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,840
have you ever heard the saying,

178
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,040
"the first one to act is the strongest"?

179
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,240
The one who strikes first
gains the advantage.

180
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,800
His Majesty

181
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,440
naturally has to be worried.

182
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:35,760
Yuzai.

183
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,200
Did you see that?

184
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,360
Your Majesty

185
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,720
I didn't

186
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,080
see anything.

187
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,120
Murderous intent.

188
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,560
Murderous intent?

189
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,040
She harbors murderous intent toward me.

190
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,440
No.

191
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,040
I must stay far away from her.

192
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,520
I pray for the blessing from
the God of homebodies.

193
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,440
Is there any misunderstanding?

194
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,320
No.

195
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,720
I must find a way to give them
more opportunities to interact

196
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,760
to ease their relations.

197
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,680
General Hua.

198
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,880
General Hua.

199
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,120
General Hua.

200
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,000
Mr. Yu.

201
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,760
What is the matter?

202
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:18,960
Oh, General Hua.

203
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,000
Please don't call me that.

204
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:21,960
His Majesty...

205
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,400
His Majesty is missing.

206
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,320
Missing?

207
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:25,680
Yes.

208
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,480
General Hua,

209
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
you are now the personal guard
of His Majesty.

210
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,360
If any mishap occurs

211
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,520
due to your negligence,

212
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,160
I fear it won't be easy to explain.

213
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,360
You go ahead.

214
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,520
I'll be there shortly.

215
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,240
No!

216
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,520
What!

217
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,120
Yuzai.

218
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,600
Bring me some painting albums.

219
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,920
She's not even hiding her
dagger-like stares at me.

220
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,920
Who can come to save me?

221
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,560
General.

222
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,960
Why do you look so weary, sir?

223
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,120
It's all thanks to
our esteemed Demon King.

224
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,480
I even have to attend to him
when he gets up at night.

225
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,760
When he poos,

226
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,080
I hold the toilet paper.

227
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,000
That's just fantastic.

228
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,760
Only the wise know how to act
according to the circumstances.

229
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,560
In the end, one has to face reality.

230
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,400
A favor calls for kindness.

231
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,560
A meal calls for grace.

232
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,920
With an appropriate gift,

233
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,440
perhaps our relationship can be better.

234
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,360
Furthermore,

235
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,440
no one strikes the smiling face
that reaches out.

236
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,560
Tormented by this idiotic Demon King,

237
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,120
the soul of my former
corporate drone self

238
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,520
seems about to awaken.

239
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,440
Wait.

240
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,840
When I was a corporate drone,

241
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,280
it wasn't this painful.

242
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,160
General.

243
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,640
What is 'idiotic'?

244
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,280
What is

245
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,360
a 'corporate drone'?

246
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,720
It's nothing.

247
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,560
