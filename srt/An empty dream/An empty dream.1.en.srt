[Episode 1]

11
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,720
Your Majesty,

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,280
in this battle with the Monster clan,

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,720
General Hua

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,480
fought hard to reclaim
the Twelve Cities.

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,080
Shall we press on with one breath

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,640
or rest the troops and recuperate,

17
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,880
we wait for your
clear instructions, Your Majesty.

18
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,400
You really are regressing more with age.

19
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,320
Do I have to tell you

20
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,640
what should be done?

21
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,480
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,440
Your Majesty,

23
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,560
in my opinion,

24
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,240
consecutive campaigns

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,640
have exhausted the officers
and soldiers to the limit.

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,720
Now...

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,000
Now,

28
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,560
resting the troops

29
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,280
is the best strategy.

30
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,200
Well.

31
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,680
You're not so foolish, after all.

32
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,960
Understood, Your Majesty.

33
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,600
Sir,

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,800
just now,

35
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,000
I truly sweated on your behalf.

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,640
Indeed.

37
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,760
Everyone knows

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,040
that our great Demon King here

39
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,280
is the infamous cold-blooded
Demon King of the Six Realms.

40
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
He's bloodthirsty and brutal,

41
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,480
murderous without a blink.

42
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,240
A moment's inattention could...

43
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,000
Enough.

44
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,160
To tell you the truth,

45
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,320
my undergarments

46
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,320
are already soaked through.

47
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,760
Same here.

48
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,800
It was so scary, so scary!

49
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,200
I've made it through
another day at last.

50
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,480
Those ministers of the Demon Realm

51
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,080
all look so wicked and ferocious.

52
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,920
So scary.

53
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,920
Heavenly spirits, earthly spirits.

54
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,240
Heavenly spirits, earthly spirits.

55
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,040
Your faithful follower Suyan
swears to not see ten new series,

56
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,120
no,

57
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,760
20 new series

58
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,000
in exchange for the God of homebodies

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,240
to grant me blessings to stay alive.

60
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,200
But then again,

61
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,280
my performance just now

62
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,520
didn't give anything away, did it?

63
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,800
My name is Suyan.

64
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,840
I've been single for 26 years.

65
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,040
I used to be a fervent fan
of the ACG world,

66
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,760
animation, games, and virtual idols.

67
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,000
Today's Keke is still so cute.

68
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,680
It's another day full of vigor.

00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,760
[A miraculous experience
makes your dream come true]

70
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,640
A miraculous experience?

71
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,720
What miraculous experience?

72
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,520
That's right.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,640
I couldn't resist

74
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,440
clicking on a pop-up ad

75
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,680
and when I woke up again,

76
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,800
I was already here.

77
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,840
What a crappy experience.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,120
Miraculous my foot.

79
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,600
What is this place?

80
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,600
Where am I?

81
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,880
It seems I have

82
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,160
traveled through time.

83
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,040
Your Majesty.

84
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,000
Your Majesty.

85
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,400
Your Majesty.

86
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,560
Your Majesty.

87
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:01,520
Your Majesty.

88
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,640
What's wrong with you?

89
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,600
Did I really

90
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,440
travel to another time?

91
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,160
Isn't this like the live-action version
of a trans-dimensional anime?

92
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,240
Look at his anxious expression

93
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,200
and concerned eyes.

94
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,360
He seems to truly
care for the original owner.

95
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,680
What is

96
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,040
this place?

97
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,080
What?

98
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,640
Who am I?

99
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,560
And who are you?

100
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,520
Your Majesty.

101
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,920
What happened?

102
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,120
This is Linyuan City, the capital
of the Demon Realm,

103
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,360
and you are the supreme Demon King.

104
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,040
I...

105
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,880
I am Yuzai.
I attend to your daily needs.

106
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:53,960
Yuzai?

107
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,040
Otaku?

108
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,560
This name does fit well with me.

109
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:00,720
But,

110
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
the Demon Realm?

111
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,440
The Demon King?

112
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,360
What are these all about?

113
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,800
Your Majesty.

114
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,400
Please don't scare me.

115
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,360
You have been in solitary
cultivation recently.

116
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,160
Did anything go wrong?

117
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,320
I see.

118
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,600
It seems the original owner
got possessed by a demon.

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,800
Wait.

120
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,280
He is a demon himself.

121
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,360
What demon could possibly possess him?

122
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,120
Forget it.

123
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,040
The Demon Realm

124
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,880
doesn't sound like a good place.

125
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,120
If he is the Demon King...

126
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,000
Something went wrong
during my cultivation,

127
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,560
and my memory is a bit blurry.

128
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,240
Before my memory is restored,

129
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,320
this shall stay between you and me.

130
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,560
If I hear even a whisper of rumor...

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,440
Yes.

132
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,200
Your Majesty.

133
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,680
I've finally bluffed
and deceived my way through.

134
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,640
I still look exactly like me.

135
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,160
But this Demon King's attire

136
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,840
is so bizarre.

137
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,280
What are these scribbles
all over my face?

138
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,960
Forget it.

139
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,200
It's not wise to stay here long.

140
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,280
I better prioritize my survival.

141
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,840
It's a dark and windy night,

142
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,120
perfect for making a getaway.

143
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,520
What?

144
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,920
Keke?

145
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,280
Who's there?

146
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,080
You're injured.

147
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,240
Go look over there.

148
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:30,920
Quickly.

149
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,160
Hurry up.

150
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,920
I'm finished.

151
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,640
No chance to run now.

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,160
If they start fighting,

153
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,000
my identity will definitely be exposed.

154
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,680
Leave.

155
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,640
I'll hold them off.

156
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:01,880
Who's there?

157
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,440
Come out.

158
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,080
Quickly.

159
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

160
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:11,800
But

161
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,600
why are you dressed like this?

162
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,840
I wanted to test the guards
of the Demon Palace.

163
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,440
I never expected that such a disguise

164
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,560
would make me walk freely here.

165
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,400
The guards have neglected their duty.

166
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,680
What punishment do they deserve?

167
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,680
Your Majesty,

168
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,640
we apologize.

169
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,280
Go and accept your punishment.

170
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,200
Yes.

171
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,960
Since there's no way to flee,

172
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,680
I must think of a new strategy.

173
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,320
Speaking of which, I'm the Demon King.

174
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,120
Surely, I am no ordinary person.

175
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,360
I'm the Demon King, right?

176
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,480
Where is the promised
legendary cheat of time travelers?

177
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,480
Why don't I know any magic at all?

178
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
This Demon King is useless.

179
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,760
No way.

180
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,960
I need to ponder on this.

181
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,520
It's such a simple matter,

182
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,680
and yet you need my help?

183
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,720
This is my story of time travel.

184
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,400
It was only later that I found out

185
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,920
that this mysterious world
was divided into six realms,

186
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,760
the Divine Realm,

187
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
the Immortal Realm,

188
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,400
the Human Realm,

189
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,280
the Demon Realm,

190
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,600
the Monster Realm, and the Ghost Realm.

191
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,320
And I

192
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,760
have become the cold-blooded Demon King

193
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,520
whom all six realms fear

194
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,960
by bluffing and blustering
in just a short month.

195
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,400
The direction of this story

196
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,440
has made such a sharp turn.

197
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,680
Your Majesty.

198
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,640
Your Majesty.

199
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,280
Why are you still here?

200
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:39,760
Did you forget

201
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,440
about meeting General Hua, who is
returning to the city after the victory?

202
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,800
Yuzai.

203
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,120
Am I acquainted with General Hua?

204
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,600
What is our relationship like?

205
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,040
General Hua has always been
at odds with you in the past.

206
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,200
It's just that in recent years,
General Hua has been away for war,

207
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,280
and her contributions to the recovery
of Twelve Cities are undeniable.

208
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,040
Now,

209
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,280
she surely can understand
your painstaking efforts, Your Majesty.

210
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,560
It seems she is a troublemaker.

211
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,760
It's hard to say
whether she's a friend or foe.

212
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,720
So,

213
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,360
how are General Hua's magical powers?

214
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,080
Speaking of magical cultivation,

215
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,080
in the entire Demon Realm,

216
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,360
General Hua is second only to you.

217
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,320
Crap.

218
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,040
It seems we can only be friends now.

219
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,840
I can't defeat her as an enemy.

220
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,880
Since I can't beat her,

221
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,640
I can curry favor with her.

222
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,760
Yuzai.

223
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,800
Is the position
of my personal guard still vacant?

224
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,760
It is.

225
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,960
Previously, you had ordered the guard
to take his punishment.

226
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,960
He deprived himself of any powers.

227
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,520
The people here
take things too seriously.

228
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,040
For punishment,

229
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,680
couldn't he just dock some wages?

230
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:51,960
At worst,

231
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,720
a beating on the palms would suffice.

232
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,360
Why deprive the powers?

233
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,520
If you don't want them,
you can give them to me.

234
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,640
Fine.

235
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,320
Later, issue my decree

236
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:09,480
and make General Hua my personal guard.

237
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,040
Yes.

238
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,200
General Hua has arrived.

239
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,360
The Demon King's decree

240
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,480
has appointed General Hua Yao
as the Demon King's personal guard

241
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,080
and commander of the palace guards.

242
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,440
Your Majesty,

243
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,360
I obey the command.

244
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,800
Suyan.

245
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,360
Clinging to the mighty General

246
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,040
is your first step to survive
in this Demon Realm

247
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,360
where you're all alone.

248
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,160
Good luck.

249
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:48,560
You got this.

250
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,000
Come on!

251
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,080
General Hua.

252
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,400
It's been a while.

253
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,560

254
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,560
