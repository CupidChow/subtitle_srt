[Episode 15]

11
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:43,080
Young Lord.

12
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,520
The heart of General Hua
is as firm as a rock.

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,680
I'm afraid

14
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,080
she cannot be of use to you.

15
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:53,080
Who said I wanted her
to be of use to me?

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,320
What I want is her.

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,720
General Hua, are you interested
in having a chat together?

18
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:12,960
No.

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,360
If I want to talk with General Hua

20
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,280
about dispatching troops
to the Twelve Cities...

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,400
Now,

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,320
are you interested?

23
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,120
Miss Si Ning.

24
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,360
Why are you still here?

25
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,600
Ever since the Summit Ceremony began,

26
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,000
you have been claiming illness,

27
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,640
but instead, you're reading here.

28
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,840
Now,

29
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,160
you should show up, shouldn't you?

30
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,760
What's the point of attending
the Summit Ceremony?

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,600
It's not as interesting
as these medical books.

32
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,240
If the Immortal Lord asks,

33
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,120
just say that I haven't
acclimatized myself

34
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,120
and not feeling well.

35
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,920
Also, it's hard
to recover in a short time.

36
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,760
How can this be?

37
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,840
You are from the medical immortals.

38
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,840
What illness could possibly stymie you?

39
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,680
Miss Si Ning, where are you going?

40
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,920
Why is she running away again?

41
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,240
What do you mean, Young Lord?

42
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,840
What I mean is...

43
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,320
What I mean is

44
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,440
that my original purpose

45
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,160
was to reclaim the Twelve Cities.

46
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,680
Original?

47
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,880
What about now?

48
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,760
Have you changed your mind?

49
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,440
Now,

50
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,840
if you are willing
to return to the Monster Realm with me,

51
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,480
I am willing, for the next 300 years,

52
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,280
to leave the Twelve Cities alone.

53
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,720
Young Lord,

54
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,440
are you using this as leverage

55
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,440
to force me to leave the Demon Realm?

56
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,960
I am merely negotiating

57
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,000
with you.

58
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,480
I know you're concerned
with the Twelve Cities,

59
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,200
but have you

60
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,040
truly seen the current
state of the Twelve Cities?

69
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,040
I have to handle official duties
all day long.

70
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,520
This is simply unreasonable.

71
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,680
A Demon King's life matters.

72
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,560
Just let me take a break.

73
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,400
Sorry about that.

74
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,320
I wasn't paying attention just now.

75
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,560
It's okay.

76
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,280
You are

77
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,880
from the Immortal?

78
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,160
From the Immortal Realm's delegation?

79
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,400
I am indeed impressive.

80
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,400
Every guess I make is spot on.

81
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,400
These are all medical books, right?

82
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,880
Do you know medicine?

83
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,600
I know a little.

84
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,720
Physicians save lives
and help the injured.

85
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,360
It is one of the most noble professions.

86
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,480
You are really incredible.

87
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,520
Although I come from medical immortals,

88
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,880
it's a collateral branch,

89
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,560
not the direct line.

90
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,680
I can't inherit the title
of a medical immortal.

91
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,840
So I hardly count as a physician.

92
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,440
Who says only those who inherit
titles can treat illness and save lives?

93
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,080
What does it matter
if it's a collateral branch

94
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:44,960
or a direct line?

95
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:47,240
A physician's compassionate heart

96
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,880
is more important than anything else.

97
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,040
Consider these grapes as an apology.

98
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,920
Where are you going?

99
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,160
Let me help you take the books over.

100
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,240
Thank you.

101
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,240
I'm going back to the other courtyard.

102
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,200
Let's go.

103
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,240
By the way,

104
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,440
since you are a physician,

105
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,080
I have a matter I would
like to consult you on.

106
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,560
I have a younger brother
who has been frail since birth.

107
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,320
Is there any way

108
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,440
to help him?

109
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,200
There are many reasons
for congenital weakness.

110
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,320
A diagnosis in person is needed

111
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,600
before the appropriate treatment
is given.

112
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,640
Oh.

113
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,800
So this is the love

114
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,680
that troubles him.

115
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,560
Now, in the Twelve Cities,

116
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,240
the Demon and the Monster
coexist equally,

117
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,040
and the citizens live
in peace and contentment.

118
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,840
It has not been easy
to recover some vitality.

119
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,360
Young Lord,

120
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,760
can you bear to destroy
this hard-won peace?

121
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,160
That's why I said.

122
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,800
If General Hua is willing to return
to the Monster Realm with me,

123
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,120
within 300 years,

124
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,920
I shall leave the Twelve Cities alone.

125
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,640
I am flattered by your
misplaced affection.

126
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,080
But I

127
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,040
have fallen for someone.

128
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,080
I have promised him

129
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,520
to stand by his side
through thick and thin.

130
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,520
General Hua.

131
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,560
You may have misunderstood.

132
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,720
Misunderstood?

133
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,200
What misunderstanding?

134
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,960
Young Lord, behave yourself.

135
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,360
So the Young Lord

136
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,880
is actually

137
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,880
a lady.

138
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,880
That's right.

139
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,800
General Hua has galloped

140
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,760
across the battlefield bravely.

141
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,800
You played a significant role
in retrieving the Twelve Cities.

142
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,440
But to my knowledge,

143
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,840
upon your return to Linyuan City,

144
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,480
the Demon King feared
your merits might overshadow his,

145
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,960
so he made you his personal guard,

146
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,920
confining you to the Demon Palace

147
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,840
and letting you be entangled
in trivial matters all day long.

148
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,080
As a lady,

149
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,280
I know General Hua
is not a common person.

150
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,880
Rather than having your spirit
worn down here,

151
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,040
it's better to return
to the Monster Realm with me.

152
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,040
Together, you and I

153
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,360
will surely accomplish
unprecedented feats.

154
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,640
To be honest with you,

155
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,000
I was indeed somewhat convinced.

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,560
I deeply understand the difficulties
women face in this world.

157
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,320
And you are also

158
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,680
the future Monster King.

159
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
You will have

160
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,760
a huge burden.

161
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,480
But like the Young Lord,

162
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,240
I also have something I wish to protect.

163
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,600
Therefore,

164
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,840
I will not leave.

165
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,040
What General Hua wants to protect

166
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,720
is the Demon King, right?

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,400
According to the information
you've gathered,

168
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,240
tomorrow morning, we can leave
the palace after we get things done.

169
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,520
First, have a big meal
at the restaurant.

170
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,920
Then, we can go and watch
the martial arts competition together.

171
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,520
And then there's
the lantern show at night.

172
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,360
Right.

173
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,920
The important thing is the lantern show.

174
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,760
Suddenly looking back,

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,960
the person is there
where the lights are dim.

176
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,080
Along with some surprises
prepared in advance.

177
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,360
It sounds so wonderful.

178
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,880
That's right.

179
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,920
I haven't seen General Hua all day.

180
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,160
Where is she?

181
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,400
My Lord,

182
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,520
I've heard these past few days,

183
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,960
Young Lord Ying Ri and General Hua
have become quite close.

184
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,880
Today,

185
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,920
they even went to General Hua's
quarters together.

186
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,000
This guy from the Monster
indeed harbors no good intentions.

187
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,320
He has come from afar to steal my girl.

188
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,520
What are you talking about?

189
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,360
What girl?

190
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,880
You know,

191
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,880
there's a martial arts competition
under the city walls tomorrow.

192
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,360
I'd like to invite you
to watch it together.

193
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,360
Okay.

194
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,240
I said,

195
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,400
okay!

196
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,760
After this matter is over,

197
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,840
we'll go out of the palace to play.

198
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,040
The letter from the Immortal Realm
has already been received.

199
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,360
If Immortal Lord has no other matters...

200
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,160
My Lord,

201
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,240
there's another matter.

202
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,640
What is it?

203
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,840
The purpose of the Summit Ceremony

204
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,680
is to promote peace in the three realms
of immortals, demons, and monsters.

205
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,440
Although there were some
twists and turns this time,

206
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,760
considering the Lord's righteous heart,

207
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,320
the Immortal is willing to form
a marriage alliance with the Demon

208
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,240
and cultivate a good relationship.

209
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,280
I am Si Ning.

210
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,400
Greetings, my Lord.

211
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,800
A marriage alliance?

212
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,600
General Hua.

213
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,840
Is General Hua alright?

214
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,520
It's said that the Demon King
is going to marry

215
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,520
someone from the Immortal.

216
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,400
You are indeed

217
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,840
well-informed.

218
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,080
He's going to marry someone else.

219
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,000
Why don't you think about my proposal?

220
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,480
I ask you

221
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,760
to think about going back
to the Monster Realm with me.

222
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,040
No.

223
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,720
Don't be so heartless.

224
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:55,960
Think about it again.

225
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,200
Or maybe

226
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,360
I'll treat you to lunch,

227
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,840
and let's talk while we eat.

228
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,120
Alright then.

229
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,440
So what shall we eat?

230
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,120
General Hua.

231
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,280
Let's start with a skewer
of candied hawthorn.

232
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,120
General Hua.

233
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,640
It's all a misunderstanding.

234
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,720
Lu San is stirring up trouble
in the match-making.

235
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,240
He's persecuting me.

236
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,160
Wait for me.

237
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,280
General Hua.

238
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,600
