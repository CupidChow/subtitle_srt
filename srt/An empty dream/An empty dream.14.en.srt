[Episode 14]

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,880
Prince Yu

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,840
has kept the elixirs you gave.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,680
However,

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,360
he did not allow the witch physician
to enter his mansion.

15
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,200
That's good.

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,840
At least he kept the elixirs.

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,400
My Lord.

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,600
You know what Prince Yu did.

19
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,480
Why are you being so kind to him?

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,000
After all, we are brothers.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,920
How could I harm him?

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,560
Moreover, I have promised someone

23
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,440
to spare his life.

24
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,720
By the way,

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,360
thank you for risking your life
to save me yesterday.

26
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,080
Tell me,

27
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:15,040
what treasure do you want?

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:15,840
Pick whatever you want.

29
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,280
How about I give you that crystal skull?

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,280
No, no.

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,320
Protecting you is my duty.

32
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,800
I must not seek merit for this.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,440
Don't be shy.

34
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,000
You risked your life to save me.

35
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,840
In the past, this would have required

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,880
something more.

37
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,000
Besides,

38
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,480
compared to
being a master and a servant,

39
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,520
we are more like friends.

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,440
I've heard a saying in the Human Realm,

41
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,160
"The scholar dies for his bosom friend."

42
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,680
Since you regard me as a friend,

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,840
if I die for you,

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,560
I have no regrets.

45
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,600
Oh my. Where did you pop out from?

46
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,280
In the hall yesterday,

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,000
a maid of Ying Ri made a sneak attack

48
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,760
before I had reacted yet,

49
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,880
Yuzai came to protect you first.

50
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,600
The Demon King is that powerful,

51
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,120
so why would he need
the protection of a mere servant?

52
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,680
Unless...

53
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,040
Unless he knew
that I wasn't the real Demon King,

54
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,240
I possess no magic power

55
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,440
and need protection.

56
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,680
This isn't hard to guess.

57
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,520
Whether he knows or not,

58
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,200
he is the first friend
I made in this world.

59
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,800
He risked his life to save me.

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,200
It already says it all.

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,440
Indeed.

62
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,120
Quite good.

63
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,280
Get ready.

64
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,840
Today, Chen Ye and Jinli

65
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,360
are about to set out for the border.

66
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,840
Let's go see them off.

67
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:43,840
Okay.

68
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,920
Right.

69
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,480
You had a dream last night?

70
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,440
I think I did.

71
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,200
What did you dream about?

72
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,320
I can't remember.

73
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,080
But it's something about getting married

74
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,440
and having children.

75
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,320
What's with that look?

76
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,880
Are you going to control my dreams?

77
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,800
Rascal!

78
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,400
I haven't been in a relationship,

79
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,280
finally getting a wife
and children in my dreams,

80
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,640
and you won't even allow it?

98
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,120
Actually,

99
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,120
you don't have to go with me.

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,960

You're welcome.

112
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,160
Well,

113
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,880
I just wanted to comfort you.

114
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,760
Okay.

115
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,800
I have things to do,

116
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,000
so I'm leaving.

117
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,360
Where is General Hua?

118
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,360
General Hua has gone to handle
the affairs of the Summit Ceremony.

119
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,080
I want to discuss something with you.

120
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,120
Please go ahead, My Lord.

121
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,000
Well,

122
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,920
I have a friend,

123
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,760
who has always been

124
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,280
obsessed with virtual idols,

125
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,280
but recently he's been acting strangely,

126
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,320
constantly thinking about
a girl by his side,

127
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,400
even dreaming about her.

128
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,520
The most terrifying thing is

129
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,840
that he starts to get anxious

130
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,000
when he doesn't see the girl.

131
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,440
Tell me,

132
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,800
is he suffering from
some serious illness?

133
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,400
My Lord.

134
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,840
I do not know what

135
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,920
virtual idols are,

136
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,440
but your friend

137
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,560
even dreams of that girl while sleeping.

138
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,320
This indicates

139
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,720
that he is into that girl.

140
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,680
I'm afraid he's caught lovesickness.

141
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,840
No way.

142
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,440
He and the girl are teammates.

143
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,960
My Lord.

144
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,280
Recently, in Linyuan City,

145
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,680
many events have been held,

146
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,000
such as martial arts competitions

147
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,320
and lantern festivals.

148
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,440
You might as well

149
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,560
take General Hua out
of the palace for some fun.

150
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,440
It could also enhance your relationship.

151
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,400
Right.

152
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,840
Going on a date

153
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,080
is also a solution.

154
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,360
Who told you it was General Hua?

155
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,400
It's my friend.

156
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,080
My friend.

157
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,840
My Lord.

158
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,000
I understand.

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,120
It's your friend, not you.

160
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,040
You!

161
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,200
Recently, there are more and more civil
events during the Summit Ceremony,

162
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
especially at night.

163
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,200
Strengthen the city's defenses.

164
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,160
Yes.

165
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,600
General Hua, you are really amazing.

166
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,200
Young Lord.

167
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,360
What do you want?

168
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
General Hua.

169
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,880
You've misunderstood.

170
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,000
I heard a lot of rumors about you

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,960
when I was in the Monster Realm.

172
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,160
I've always admired you.

173
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,520
Then please continue your admiration.

174
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,800
I have things to do,

175
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,920
so I shall take my leave first.

176
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,520
I have things to do,

177
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,720
so I shall take my leave first.

178
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,040
Young Lord, you appear here.

179
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,200
I'm afraid it's a bit improper.

180
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,000
Unexpectedly,

181
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,760
General Hua even has to be responsible

182
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,040
for the Demon King's diet.

183
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,440
It has nothing to do with you.

184
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,440
I wonder if you

185
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,520
would have a meal with me.

186
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,120
I booked the best restaurant
in the Linyuan City.

187
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,920
I am busy,

188
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,520
so I cannot accept your invitation.

189
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,200
No worries.

190
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,360
I'll wait for you.

191
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,480
General Hua, who is invincible,

192
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,840
gets trapped in the Demon Palace

193
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,240
and spends all day with trivial matters.

194
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,040
I feel sorry for you.

195
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
Not in the good mood?

196
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,040
Can you even

197
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,800
tell that?

198
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,080
Has someone bullied you?

199
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,360
Tell me who did it.

200
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,400
I'll go avenge for you.

201
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,720
If the sky falls,

202
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,040
I'm relieved to have you

203
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,400
support me.

204
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,040
Well,

205
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,080
lately, there have been many
martial arts competitions

206
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,320
and lantern festivals in the city.

207
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,240
Maybe we should go on a date sometime.

208
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,120
No.

209
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,640
To go out of the palace for some fun.

210
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,920
Alright then.

211
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,920
Going out for some fun.

212
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,440
Lu San.

213
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:35,760
Have a seat.

214
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,840
Few people know
that I was third in my family.

215
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,920
Compared to me,

216
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,200
you are even more knowledgeable.

217
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,200
When did you find out who I am?

218
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,400
I noticed it
at the poetry gathering that day.

219
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,680
You and I met each other

220
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,080
at the Summit Ceremony 300 years ago.

221
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,880
But you did not recognize me.

222
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,760
By the way,

223
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,840
you wanted to meet with me today.

224
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,240
What is the matter?

225
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,240
To be honest,

226
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,000
I indeed have a favor to ask.

227
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,680
I wonder

228
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,240
if you guys in the Immortal Realm

229
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,400
have any special ways of wooing a girl.

230
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,280
Something high-end and classy.

231
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,200
Wooing a girl?

232
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,280
High-end and classy?

233
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,960
Well...

234
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,360
I like a girl.

235
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,960
So I want to try every mean
to make her happy.

236
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,840
To be honest,

237
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,160
although I have
a thousand years of Taoist cultivation,

238
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,400
I don't know much

239
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,880
about the love.

240
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,200
Have you

241
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,800
been single for a thousand years?

242
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,560
For an immortal,
the heavenly Tao comes first.

243
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,200
Personal affections

244
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,800
are not what we seek.

245
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,080
Fine.

246
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,640
I've asked the wrong person.

247
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,040
Although I've never
been in a relationship,

248
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
at least I have
a virtual girlfriend in games.

249
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,800
But you

250
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,120
seek the heavenly Tao
and annihilate all your desires.

251
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,800
It's impressive.

252
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:21,840
It's impressive.

253
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,920
Regarding the love,

254
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,160
I'm not good at it,

255
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,120
but if you need help,

256
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,800
I shall certainly help you.
