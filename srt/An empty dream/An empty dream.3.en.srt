[Episode 3]

11
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,160
Your Majesty.

12
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,840
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,000
What a surprise.

14
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm shocked.

15
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,880
Your Majesty.

16
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,560
We were just chatting just now.

17
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,160
I didn't expect you
to be a time traveler as well.

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,880
I can finally take off this guise.

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,000
It almost suffocated me.

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,160
Wait.

21
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,560
My head.

22
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,520
It hurts so much.

23
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,600
Wait.

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,040
I am not feeling well today.

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,160
Let's adjourn the court for now.

26
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,440
No!

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:56,080
What!

28
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,720
Odd changes, but not even.

29
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,240
Signs depend on the quadrant.

30
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,560
Imperial Jade Liquor.

31
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
180 per cup.

32
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,280
How is the liquor?

33
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,280
I'll tell you about it.

34
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,080
Stop, stop.

35
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,480
I didn't expect

36
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,800
you to be a time traveler too.

37
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,360
Exactly.

38
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,280
I also traveled through time.

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,640
Misleading ads can be deadly.

40
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,840
You're saying

41
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,720
you took a nap at the company
during lunchtime

42
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,280
and woke up here?

43
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,920
Yes.

44
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,960
How come you can use magic
to make sunflower seeds

45
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,520
and I can't do anything?

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,560
You've only been here
for just over a month.

47
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,280
I've been here for more than 100 years.

48
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,440
To tell you the truth,

49
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,720
when I first arrived,

50
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,280
the original owner of this body
was still in diapers.

51
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,320
Moreover,

52
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,640
these skills of mine

53
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,200
are all from practicing since childhood.

54
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,400
As for you,

55
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,560
it won't do.

56
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
I'm not a child anymore.

57
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,040
But I'm still a virgin.

58
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,760
What?

59
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,480
Never mind.

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,720
Are there any shortcuts?

61
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,760
Quick mastery technique,

62
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,920
elixirs and the like?

63
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,760
There's plenty of this stuff
in the novice village.

64
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,720
Do you think you're here to play a game?

65
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,080
The novice village?

66
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,760
Believe it or not,

67
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,560
any random person in the Demon Realm

68
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,840
can easily twist your neck.

69
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,480
No.

70
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,360
Please protect me.

71
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,680
Actually,

72
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,840
your identity is still somewhat useful.

73
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,920
Useful how?

74
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,160
Do you know

75
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,840
about the Orb of the Demon Realm?

76
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,000
The orb?

77
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,640
Hmm.

78
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,320
I've only heard of Dragon Balls.

79
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,960
In the Demon Realm,

80
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,800
there is a mysterious orb

81
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,680
that can grant any wish.

82
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,480
So I guess,

83
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,560
with the orb,

84
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,800
we can definitely return
to the original world.

85
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,000
Return

86
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,160
to the original world?

87
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,480
Do you not

88
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,720
want to go back?

89
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,240
That's true.

90
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,920
It's not a must to go back.

91
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,200
But to have a choice

92
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,520
is always better than having none.

93
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,760
How about we cooperate?

94
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,640
I'll help you conceal your identity

95
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,440
and protect you.

96
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,920
You can help me find the orb.
How about that?

97
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,640
No problem.

98
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,280
Deal.

99
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,080
No backing out.

100
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
Time travelers

101
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,640
don't deceive each other.

102
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,720
Deal.

103
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,640
♪Good fortune and good luck♪

104
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,360
Your Majesty.

105
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,160
You seem to be in a good mood today.

106
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,640
Have you encountered something pleasant?

107
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,800
Do you know my recent wishes?

108
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,440
My wishes are

109
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,680
to cling to a powerful person

110
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,840
and to slack off.

111
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,880
Truly, the God of homebodies
has blessed me!

112
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,120
Both my wishes came true.

113
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,320
Your Majesty.

114
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,360
I understand

115
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,880
the word 'powerful',

116
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,320
but what does slack off

117
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,400
mean?

118
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,240
Hush.

119
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,000
It's perceived

120
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,600
rather than expressed.

121
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,240
Alas.

122
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,440
This is what slacking off is!

123
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,720
Why?

124
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,360
Why are there so many?

125
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,480
A Demon King's life matters.

126
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,160
Act your part in the position you hold.

127
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,040
Since you have become the Demon King,

128
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,120
please

129
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,560
stick to one thing

130
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,520
and love what you do.

131
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,040
Love what I do?

132
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,200
You're such an unyielding working force.

133
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,760
Applause to the soul
of the corporate slave.

134
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,200
I think you are

135
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,160
lacking a harsh beating by society.

136
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,200
You don't say.

137
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,720
I've lived for 26 years

138
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,560
and have never really
suffered hardships in society.

139
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
Well.

140
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,760
So it turns out

141
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,200
you're a homebody.

142
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,480
What a coincidence.

143
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,120
I've lived for so long

144
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,800
and it's my first time

145
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,280
seeing a living homebody.

146
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,000
I can't take it anymore.

147
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,960
I can't do it.

148
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,560
My HP bar is empty.

149
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,680
You've worked hard.

150
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,920
No, I haven't.

151
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,400
But my life is hard.

152
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,320
Your Majesty.

153
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,720
General Chen Ye requests an audience.

154
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,520
Again?

155
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,200
Your Majesty,

156
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,280
there has been reports from the front

157
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,680
that the Monster Realm has launched
frequent attacks on our Twelve Cities.

158
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,320
Although they were skirmishes,

159
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,400
such behavior

160
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,680
is undoubtedly a provocation against
the majestic power of our Demon Realm.

161
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,360
I humbly beseech
Your Majesty to decree...

162
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,320
Well,

163
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,040
do you want one?

164
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,520
[Study]

165
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,320
Mr. Yu.

166
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,800
Did anything happen

167
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,440
to His Majesty after his seclusion?

168
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,160
General Chen, you worry too much.

169
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,800
What could possibly happen to him?

170
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,440
His Majesty

171
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,360
is still the same
high and mighty Demon King.

172
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,600
Mr. Yu,

173
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,360
if I remember correctly,

174
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,280
His Majesty does not like sweets, right?

175
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,880
Yes, indeed.

176
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,280
His Majesty never liked
those sweet and greasy things.

177
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,360
He won't even touch

178
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,920
the sweet treats or pastries.

179
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,360
Well,

180
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:45,960
I don't know.

181
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,240
What I say is not necessarily accurate.

182
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,280
Perhaps His Majesty

183
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,640
has had a change of heart.

184
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:50,960
General Chen.

185
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,920
I shall take my leave here.

186
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,680
Please travel safely.

187
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,160
His Majesty clearly never eats sweets.

188
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,680
About the Monsters causing
chaos in the Twelve Cities,

189
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,600
I believe

190
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,520
it must not be indulged.

191
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,040
Today's spark

192
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,400
can set the prairie ablaze tomorrow.

193
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,240
Whether to fight or to make peace,

194
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,560
it is my hope that Your Majesty

195
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,520
will make an early decision.

196
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,040
Years of continuous campaigning

197
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,040
have exhausted the soldiers

198
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,160
and made the people suffer.

199
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,920
The Monsters
stirring up trouble at the border

200
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
is nothing but the struggle of ants.

201
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,120
A truce is not easily obtained.

202
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,720
Peace should be the priority

203
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,600
and war is the last resort.

204
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,720
War is the last resort?

205
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,040
Your Majesty.

206
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,160
Do you still remember the words
you once said to me?

207
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,440
I've said many things.

208
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,320
I can't remember them all.

209
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,280
You once said

210
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,520
that within the Six Realms,

211
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,560
whoever dares to offend our Demon Realm

212
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,800
is in for a fight to death.

213
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,360
Even if it takes thousands of years,

214
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,320
you must defend
our territory and fight to the end.

215
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,960
Now the Monster Realm
provokes us time and again,

216
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,800
yet you say to prioritize peace.

217
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,480
Who exactly are you?

218
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,880
His Majesty has his plans,

219
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,080
which are not for a mere
deputy general to influence.

220
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,040
To recapture the Twelve Cities,

221
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,360
the Demon and Monster Clans
have been at war for 100 years.

222
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
In these 100 years,

223
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,960
the Demon Clan has lost
hundreds of thousands of soldiers

224
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,320
whose bones have turned
into mountains stretching for miles.

225
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,480
The Twelve Cities

226
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,920
have also been ravaged
by the chaos of war

227
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,120
with the people's
livelihoods devastated.

228
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,080
You don't see all these,

229
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,600
but His Majesty does.

230
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,560
Now is the time to rest the army
and nurture the troops,

231
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,320
allowing the Twelve Cities
to recuperate.

232
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,880
Otherwise,

233
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,200
how can there be everlasting peace?

234
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,360
My dear family.

235
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,800
My benefactor.

236
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,040
You have finally arrived.

237
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,440
The sword in his hand seemed
to have a longer life than mine.

238
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,760
Are you injured?

239
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,320
I'm not.

240
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
But

241
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,360
he has become suspicious.

242
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,880
Your identity

243
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,640
could be exposed at any moment.

244
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,400
I won't make it.

245
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,280
Even without General Chen,

246
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,080
there are still General Zhang

247
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,920
and Mr. Li.

248
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,440
There is no once-and-for-all solution.

249
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,640
Says who?

250
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,040
There is a place where we can try.

251
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,000
What place?

252
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,360
