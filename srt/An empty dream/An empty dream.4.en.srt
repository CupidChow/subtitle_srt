[Episode 4]

11
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,160
What on earth is this place?

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,040
What exactly are we looking for?

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,000
Something scary

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,240
gives me indigestion.

15
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,040
This is the Skyless Cave.

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,680
Can you let go of my hand?

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,000
You are

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,320
as timid as a hare.

19
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,840
I'm not timid.

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,640
I just don't feel safe.

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,800
Well,

22
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,840
you're putting on a brave front.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,000
Hua.

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,080
General Hua.

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,920
Skyless Cave?

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,000
Does it actually mean

27
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,000
hopeless?

28
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,680
What?

29
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,400
It means lawless.

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,160
By the way,

31
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,440
you're the one who named it.

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,280
What?

33
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,720
I named it?

34
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,800
How dare I name
such an arrogant name?

35
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,120
Do I deserve to?

36
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,960
You don't.

37
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,160
This name was given
by the real Demon King Suyan

38
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,440
to house the one inside...

39
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,960
What?

40
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,040
Who?

41
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,840
Well...

42
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,280
Can you be bold?

43
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,200
Even a gust of wind can scare you.

44
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,880
What's wrong?

45
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,680
It recognizes you.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,400
It seems it has you in mind.

47
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,160
Well...

48
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,480
Does it have me in mind?

49
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,200
I think it wants
to have me in its stomach.

50
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,000
This is...

51
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,960
Silver Flood Dragon?

52
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,720
General Chen.

53
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,240
Indeed,
it's the Lord's Silver Flood Dragon.

54
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,880
Since the Lord went into seclusion,

55
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,520
we haven't seen it in a few days.

56
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,800
Recently, the Lord

57
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,520
summoned it out of the Skyless Cave.

58
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,160
Mr. Yu.

59
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
I remember,

60
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,840
though the Silver Flood Dragon
has a violent nature,

61
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,720
yet is extremely loyal to its master.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,920
That's right.

63
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,160
Within the Six Realms,

64
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,000
the Silver Flood Dragon

65
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,600
is only loyal to the Lord.

66
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,920
It does nothing all day
but eat and sleep.

67
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,600
It looks more useless than me.

68
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,720
It doesn't look like
a demonic beast at all.

69
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,880
Don't underestimate it.

70
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,480
It's the second deadliest weapon
in the Demon Realm.

71
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,280
The second?

72
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,880
Then who is the first?

73
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,480
Me?

74
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,640
I declare

75
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,920
it ranks as the first now.

76
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,680
Then what about you?

77
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,000
Which rank are you in?

78
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,800
Are you a fool?

79
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,280
You call a girl a deadly weapon?

80
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,920
If you keep talking nonsense,

81
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,760
I'll...

82
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,680
What's wrong?

83
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,960
My Lord.

84
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,560
General Chen has been kneeling
outside the hall for days.

85
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,360
Well...

86
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,840
Tell him to leave.

87
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,520
Deliver a message to him for me.

88
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,960
[Study]

89
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,760
Here's the order of the Lord.

90
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,680
Let bygones

91
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,560
be bygones.

92
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,680
General Chen, you can leave.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,760
I

94
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,240
was so foolish

95
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,000
that I speculated about you.

96
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,200
I'm willing to take any punishment.

97
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,720
General Chen.

98
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,000
The Lord told me
to deliver a message to you.

99
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,880
General Chen, you are so loyal.

100
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,960
There's nothing wrong with that.

101
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,440
You can maintain national stability,

102
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
and help the people
live and work in peace.

103
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,080
If there's any war to be started,

104
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,120
even if you shed your last drop of blood,

105
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,320
you would not give in

106
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,440
any single inch of land.

107
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,920
I thought nerds don't like to exercise.

108
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,320
You're just stereotyping.

109
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,920
Although the spirit of nerds
lives in the ACG world,

110
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,520
we can still build our bodies
in the gym.

111
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,800
Doing broadcast exercises in the gym?

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,640
Nice.

113
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,280
Aren't you afraid he'll find out

114
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,880
you're not the real Demon King Suyan

115
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,080
and come kill you again?

116
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,320
Who?

117
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,000
Oh.

118
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,600
General Chen?

119
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,240
Of course I'm afraid.

120
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,400
But he is a loyal and righteous man
who serves the country and its people.

121
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,440
I can't just risk his life

122
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,040
for my private ends.

123
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,760
That would make me a scumbag.

124
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,200
So,

125
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,000
you chose to win his heart over?

126
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,480
Win his heart over?

127
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,640
I didn't think it through that much.

128
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,880
How does that saying go?

129
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,080
Right.

130
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,960
Sincerity is always the best.

131
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,320
I treat him with sincerity.

132
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,640
He can't just take my life

133
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,800
regardless of the truth.

134
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,440
General Hua, have you thought it through?

135
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,840
If you give up the deal between us,

136
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,040
then the whereabouts of the orb...

137
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,040
I will find the orb myself

138
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,840
and won't disturb you anymore.

139
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,040
I don't force you

140
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,160
to cooperate with me.

141
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,200
It doesn't hurt to stop here.

142
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,680
Alright.

143
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,880
Alright.

144
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,160
But

145
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,400
if word of this gets out

146
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,360
that General Hua attempted to assassinate
the Demon King and failed,

147
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,840
I think the consequences

148
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,440
would be terrible.

149
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,960
If word gets out

150
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,000
about

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,400
the fratricide,

152
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,400
I wonder what the mess it will cause.

153
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,960
It doesn't hurt to have you

154
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,040
bear the consequences with me.

155
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,200
Yes.

156
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,280
So,

157
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,640
General Hua,

158
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,680
you continue serving your lord loyally,

159
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,040
and I'll continue causing the mess.

160
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,320
You and I
don't interfere with each other,

161
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,560
relying on our own abilities.

162
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,840
Do you agree?

163
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,480
Deal.

164
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,680
Leave then.

165
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,160
It hurts!

166
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,840
General Hua.

167
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,440
Are you rebelling?

168
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,160
You made a sneak attack.

169
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,920
I saw you in a daze,

170
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,280
so I wanted to ask you

171
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,840
if you want to go out
of the palace and have fun.

172
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,280
Go out of the palace?

173
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,920
Sorry

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,320
Go.

191
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,240
Go.

192
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,120
You've been flipping for a while.

193
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,640
What exactly are you looking for?

194
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,360
You don't understand.

195
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,760
Fan fiction.

196
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,080
Such stalls are usually
full of treasures.

197
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,920
I'm sure I can find
something interesting.

198
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,200
The Story Between Me and Demon King.

199
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,600
The Mighty and Invincible Hua.

200
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,400
Who is Invincible Hua?

201
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,400
Miss,

202
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,680
don't you know?

203
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,040
The Invincible Hua in this book

204
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,080
is the renowned General Hua.

205
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
Aside from the Demon King,

206
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,440
she is the most invincible

207
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,200
in the whole Demon Realm.

208
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,880
Invincible, indeed.

209
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,320
But who told you

210
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,000
General Hua is mighty?

211
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,520
Literary creation.

212
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
Some exaggeration is acceptable.

213
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,400
But I think,

214
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,320
it's somewhat true.

215
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,760
The Invincible General

216
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,120
Captures Twelve Cities.

217
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,640
Look,

218
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,840
it's all about your great achievements.

219
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,600
The next chapter.

220
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,040
The Ruthless Demon King
Fears General Hua

221
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,160
and Makes Dirty Tricks.

222
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,080
What does it mean?

223
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,760
Dirty tricks?

224
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,320
I am so sincere and devoted

225
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,840
to ask you to be my personal bodyguard.

226
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,160
What a junk.

227
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:53,680
It's been modified.

228
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,720
Definitely.

229
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,640
We should stick to the truth,

230
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,600
and don't believe it.

231
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,480
Owner.

232
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,240
This one,

233
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,680
this,

234
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,360
and this one.

235
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,840
These fan comics...

236
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,040
No.

237
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,680
Art books.

238
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,520
I'll take them all.

239
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:06,760
Okay.

240
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,920
What's wrong?

241
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,400
Pay him.

242
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,160
Do you think I have money?

243
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,920
My wallet has nothing left.

244
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,280
So, you're treating me
like your money pouch?

245
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,920
