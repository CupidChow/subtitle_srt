[Episode 16]

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,960
Your Highness.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,760
I have obtained a new prescription.

13
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,200
I hear it is very effective.

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,160
Your Highness.

15
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,040
Your Highness?

16
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,120
Your Highness.

17
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,560
What time is it?

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,480
My Lord,

19
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,760
it has just turned to the Hour of Hai.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,120
Shall we continue to wait?

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,960
Yes.

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,120
If we don't clarify things
with her tonight,

23
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,280
none of us will be able to sleep.

24
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,680
Yuzai.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,880
Get me a stool.

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,920
I must confront her tonight.

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:20,800
Yes,

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,520
My Lord.

29
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,000
My Lord.

30
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,040
General Hua has returned.

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,240
Where have you been?

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,440
At noon,

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,000
I had a feast with Young Lord
at the restaurant.

34
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,200
In the afternoon,

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,560
we watched a martial arts competition.

36
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:55,880
In the evening,

37
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,360
we watched the lantern show together.

38
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,080
What a wonderful day.

39
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,640
That pretty boy from the Monster clan.

40
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,200
He harbors ulterior motives towards you.

41
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,520
Yes, indeed.

42
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,880
I was invited to go
to the Monster Realm.

43
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,360
I knew he came to poach.

44
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,120
You weren't paying
enough attention to me,

45
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,720
and you blame others for poaching?

46
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,440
I know you're very upset now,

47
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,560
But I still want to tell you

48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,320
that I will never agree
to a political marriage.

49
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,000
Not now, not in the future.

50
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
My Lord, My Lord.

51
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,000
I request to see the Lord.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,720
Intruding into the Demon Palace,

53
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,480
you should be punished.

54
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,120
Yuzai.

55
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,840
What's going on?

56
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,200
My Lord.

57
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,080
It's Miss Yuan Qi, Prince Yu's maid.

58
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,920
She's making a scene,

59
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,000
insisting on seeing you.

60
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,680
My Lord.

61
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,880
My Lord.

62
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,160
My Lord.

63
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,840
[Demon Palace]

64
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,840
His Highness is seriously ill.

65
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,120
He's unconscious now.

66
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,800
My Lord. For your brother's sake,

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,280
I beg you to save him.

68
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,000
My Lord.

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,680
I request an audience with you.

70
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,480
My Lord.

71
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,600
Please let me in.

72
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,120
Something must have happened to Yu Ke.

73
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,600
Yuzai.

74
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,840
Tell Yuan Qi

75
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,120
to wait at the mansion.

76
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,200
I will come over shortly.

77
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,160
Yes.

78
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,840
Perhaps there is someone

79
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,080
who can help him.

80
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,280
Follow me.

81
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,720
My Lord, so you came here late at night

82
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,880
trying to get me to help Prince Yu.

83
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,240
Miss Si, you once said

84
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,280
that you were from the clan
of medical immortals.

85
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,840
Surely there must be a way to save him.

86
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,800
Well,

87
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,960
it is not impossible.

88
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,480
But My Lord,

89
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,960
under one condition.

90
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,920
Please speak, Miss Si.

91
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,880
If you accept the marriage alliance
with the Immortal Realm

92
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,360
and take me as your wife,

93
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,680
I will save him.

94
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,880
Miss Si.

95
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,000
Why put yourself through this?

96
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,480
Because marrying you

97
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,520
is the best option.

98
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,640
What do you mean?

99
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,880
The clan of medical immortals

100
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,840
has always only allowed direct disciples

101
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,520
to inherit the title
of medical immortal.

102
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,600
Since you, Miss, bear the surname Si,

103
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,760
you must be from a side branch.

104
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,160
If you marry
into a distinguished royal family,

105
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,720
take your husband's surname,

106
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,360
and triumph at the Immortal Realm's
Medical Conference,

107
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,080
you can then inherit the title
with a royal identity.

108
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,200
And the royal family of the Demon Realm

109
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,080
is naturally

110
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,640
the best choice for you.

111
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,800
Exactly.

112
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,880
Marry me, My Lord,

113
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,920
you will get
a glimmer of hope for Prince Yu,

114
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,560
and I can also rely on your identity

115
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,120
to secure the title of medical immortal.

116
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,120
Is it not a perfect solution?

117
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,160
If we do this,

118
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,240
it would only wrong you, Miss Si.

119
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,240
You are skilled in medicine.

120
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,880
You can freely practice medicine
between heaven and earth.

121
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,280
Why must you affirm your existence

122
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,600
by taking your husband's surname

123
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,600
through a marital alliance?

124
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,320
Although I am not
one of the medical immortals,

125
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,800
I understand
the name of medical immortal

126
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,360
is definitely not

127
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,320
a false reputation passed down
through the direct lineage.

128
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,960
I believe taking the art
of healing for a lifetime,

129
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,520
taking the path of medicine for ages,

130
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,920
and saving lives with a benevolent heart

131
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,320
are what make a medical immortal.

132
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,120
Besides,

133
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,840
I already have someone I like.

134
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,040
Even though I don't know how she feels,

135
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,000
she is the only one for me.

136
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,120
I could never take another as my wife.

137
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,200
Yes.

138
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,240
Why do I need those empty titles?

139
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,040
I have studied medicine
since I was young

140
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,600
because I wanted to help the world,

141
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,040
to treat ailments, and to save people.

142
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,120
Today,

143
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,800
both of you

144
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,000
relieved my years-long anxiety.

145
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:37,640
Thank you.

146
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,000
You're welcome.

147
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,160
The people from where I come from

148
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,280
all know a little
about offering soulful advice.

149
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,680
In fact,

150
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,360
I just wanted to probe a bit.

151
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,080
I didn't expect...

152
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,360
Let's go.

153
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,600
I will accompany you to see Prince Yu.

154
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,600
Okay.

155
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,290
[Prince Yu's Mansion]

156
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,120
How is he?

157
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,960
Prince Yu suffers from his illness

158
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,920
because his primordial spirit
is incomplete.

159
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,840
It's a miracle for him

160
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,960
to have lived to this day.

161
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,000
Unless the primordial spirit
is restored,

162
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,560
otherwise,

163
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,080
he can't be healed.

164
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,960
How can one restore
the primordial spirit?

165
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,920
Restoring the primordial spirit

166
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,880
requires the Demon Realm's
supreme treasure, the demon orb,

167
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,840
but as far as I know,

168
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:27,800
the demon orb

169
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,520
has been lost for hundreds of years.

170
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,600
I will find the demon orb

171
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,560
even if it means turning
the Demon Realm upside down.

172
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,800
Apart from the demon orb,

173
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,760
what else do you need?

174
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,960
Blood of a close kin is also needed.

175
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,120
I am his brother by the same mother.

176
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,160
You can use my blood.

177
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,400
Besides that,

178
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,960
several medicinal ingredients
are needed.

179
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,840
Among them, there is a spiritual herb

180
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,640
called the Millennium Xuanchu.

181
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Although,

182
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,840
it is extremely valuable.

183
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,400
I'm afraid it's as hard to find

184
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,640
as the demon orb.

185
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,360
My Lord.

186
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,800
This is the Millennium Xuanchu,

187
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,560
a spiritual herb rarely seen
in the Six Realms.

188
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,600
I never expected that today,

189
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,880
we can stumble upon it here.

190
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,320
As for the Millennium Xuanchu,

191
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,480
I do have it.

192
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,560
If I were to say

193
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,120
I won it at a poetry gathering,

194
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,920
would you believe me?

195
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,520
We haven't found the orb,

196
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
and now we have to find the demon orb.

197
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,480
Dawn has broken.

198
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,760
Since it's the treasure
of the Demon clan,

199
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,720
it might still be in the realm.

200
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,720
Perhaps

201
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,120
it's in the Demon Palace.

202
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,400
But Si Ning said this thing

203
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,280
has been missing for hundreds of years.

204
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,880
If it were in the Demon Palace,

205
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,400
we would surely find some clues.

206
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,600
But now,

207
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,000
we can't even find a single trace.

208
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,280
My Lord.

209
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,720
What happened here?

210
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,280
Did you dismantle

211
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,880
the study overnight?

212
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,760
Shut up.

213
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,680
Don't you see we're actively
looking for something?

214
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,440
But we have been searching all night

215
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,400
and we've got nothing.

216
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,480
My Lord.

217
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,760
What are you searching for?

218
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,200
Let me assist you in the search.

219
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,080
Might as well tell you.

220
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,200
We are looking for an object

221
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,040
that has been lost
for hundreds of years.

222
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,160
The demon orb.

223
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,320
You wouldn't know about it.

224
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:06,960
After all...

225
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,560
The demon orb?

226
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,880
I am aware of it.

227
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,320
I knew you wouldn't know.

228
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,640
- You know?
- You know?

229
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,000
I have been with you since my childhood,

230
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,200
and I once overheard
the old Demon King mention

231
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,520
that the demon orb was sealed in the
forbidden grounds of the Demon clan,

232
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,800
the Demon clan's altar.
