[Episode 17]

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,640
This must be the place Yuzai mentioned.

12
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,000
Where is the demon orb?

13
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,520
Since it's said
to be sealed at the altar,

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,120
then it must be the place.

15
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,280
Do we need to cast a spell

16
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,800
to find the demon orb?

17
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,560
Yes.

18
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:30,880
Let me try.

19
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,320
I'll do it.

20
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,680
Abracadabra.

21
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,080
Come out now.

22
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,240
Come out now.

23
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,480
Abracadabra.

24
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,520
Come out now.

25
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,600
Come out now.

26
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,640
Come out now.

27
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,720
Come out now.

28
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,160
What are you doing?

29
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,760
Bow first.

30
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,880
That's how it works in games.

31
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,560
Trigger the mechanism,

32
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,640
and then the boss will come out.

33
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,240
So,

34
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,320
where is the boss?

35
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,240
Seems I failed.

36
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,320
Do you really want to save Prince Yu?

37
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,840
He tried to kill you
over and over again.

38
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,320
I think

39
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,080
that he has never really

40
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,600
intended to kill me
from start to finish.

41
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,280
He sent you to kill me,

42
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,160
but by that time I had already
finished the seclusion.

43
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,280
If I were still the Demon King,

44
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,760
you certainly wouldn't kill me.

45
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,560
And that assassin.

46
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,800
How could he possibly kill me?

47
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,240
Moreover,

48
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,600
by that time you had already

49
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,960
become my personal guard.

50
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,440
During the Summit Ceremony,

51
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,680
he colluded with the Young Lord
from the Monster.

52
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,160
He must have known

53
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,280
that once he stirred up a war between
the Demon Realm and the Monster Realm,

54
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,720
then the Demon Realm

55
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,400
would never accept him

56
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,280
as the new Demon King

57
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,720
who colluded with the Monster
and ceded territory.

58
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,680
So,

59
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,240
you're saying...

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,240
He's cunning and villainous.

61
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,440
He must have known

62
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,640
that people around us
have been tipping us off.

63
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,480
Perhaps Yuan Qi doesn't know

64
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,560
she is the backup plan
Yu Ke prepared for us.

65
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,720
He's been sick since childhood,

66
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,240
bearing all the cold shoulders,

67
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,520
and being ignored by the Demon.

68
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,720
It is not easy for him
to survive to this day.

69
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,920
Maybe he already knows he's dying,

70
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,480
so he wants to use this way

71
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,560
to leave something

72
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,720
in his solitude

73
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,560
and neglect life.

74
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,960
Even if it is

75
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,480
a bad reputation.

76
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,200
Because of
my younger brother Nan's death,

77
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,120
I began to escape reality

78
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,880
and indulge in the virtual world.

79
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,960
But god has given me a second chance.

80
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,600
In real world,

81
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,760
I couldn't save Nan.

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But in here,

83
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,040
I can save Yu Ke.

84
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,080
I don't want to escape anymore.

85
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,520
This is my redemption.

86
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,520
You can do it.

87
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,960
When this is over,

88
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,560
I want to tell you something.

89
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,120
Okay.

90
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,800
So now,

91
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,080
let's start searching for the demon orb.

92
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,320
This is my first time here.

93
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,240
I don't know

94
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,680
what the Demon's ceremony is like.

95
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,680
How come I didn't think of that?

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,320
The altar is for the ceremony.

97
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,760
And the ceremony requires
offerings for the sacrificial ritual.

98
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,280
I have the simplest

99
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,400
and most direct way.

100
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,440
Do you have a knife?

101
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,680
Thank you, Si Ning.

102
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,600
By the way,

103
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,960
how is the Lord now?

104
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,520
General Hua is looking after the Lord.

105
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,720
He will wake up soon.

106
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,360
I've got some soup on the stove.

107
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,160
If you need me,

108
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,320
send someone to me.

109
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,120
Okay.

110
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,880
How are you?

111
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,400
Do you feel unwell?

112
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,680
I'll go call Si Ning.

113
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,720
You...

114
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,400
I like you.

115
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
I like you very much.

116
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,680
Well...

117
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,400
What did you say?

118
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,360
Don't you sober up?

119
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,480
I can't wait any longer.

120
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,040
I want to tell you right now

121
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,440
I really like you.

122
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,320
Even though I'm useless,

123
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,200
coward and incompetent,

124
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,920
always escaping from reality
and wanting to give up.

125
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,040
Additionally,
I can't live long without you.

126
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,560
But I just can't stop liking you.

127
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,360
Any more?

128
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,680
Yes.

129
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,800
I feel sick if I don't see you.

130
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,640
Last time I saw you going out on a date
with that Young Lord of the Monster,

131
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,280
I felt so upset.

132
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,120
What's more,

133
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,600
you're all I dream about.

134
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,160
In my dreams,

135
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,240
I've even named our children.

136
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,400
Without you,

137
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,320
I would have probably given up long ago.

138
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,280
But now,

139
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,920
I just want to stay with you.

140
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,680
Wherever you go, I'll follow.

141
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,720
Do you homebodies all have unique ways

142
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,240
of confessing love?

143
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,400
Sincerity is always the best.

144
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,280
Actually,

145
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,080
you're not as terrible as you say.

146
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,720
Because of you,

147
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,160
I could stick to my choices.

148
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,520
By the way,

149
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,040
you have to promise me one thing.

150
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,840
Okay.

151
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,320
I haven't told you yet.

152
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,560
I want you to promise me

153
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,640
to search for the orb with me,

154
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,960
and return together

155
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,880
to the reality we once escaped from.

156
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,480
Only by facing the reality

157
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,480
and letting go of the past,

158
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,960
can we keep moving forward.

159
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:04,880
Moreover...

160
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,520
Moreover...

161
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,760
I want to meet you in the real world

162
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,640
and then fall in love with you.

163
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,520
Even in a cruel

164
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,160
and unpredictable world,

165
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,760
I still believe
that good things will happen.

166

What if

167
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,320
we can't find the orb?

168
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400

[Prince Yu's Mansion]

179
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,760
They said I had no father or mother,

180
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,000
so I came to you crying.

181
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,360
You said you were my family.

182
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,160
And the other day,

183
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,160
you tried to kiss me while I was asleep.

184
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,520
I know everything.

185
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,960
I know everything.

186
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,360
You knew you don't have much time left,

187
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,200
worried about leaving me alone
in this world with no one to rely on,

188
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,120
so you wanted to set me free

189
