1
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,480
Laorchan.

2
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,280
Ma'am.

3
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,160
Excuse me.

4
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,040
Ma'am.

5
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,800
Ma'am.

6
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,240
Ma'am.

7
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,320
Ma'am. Wait.

8
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,400
Ma'am.

9
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,360
Wait.

10
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,080
Excuse me.

11
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,360
Ma'am.

12
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,560
Ma'am.

13
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,640
Who are you?

14
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,040
How do you know my name?

15
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,640
Ma'am.

16
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,600
Wait.

17
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,720
Ma'am.

18
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,920
Wait.

19
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,920
Ma'am.

20
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,440
Ma'am.

21
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:17,959
What?

22
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,640
No.

23
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,560
No!

24
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,880
Sun.

25
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,320
Can you meet me at Café de Flore?

26
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:43,400
PARIS, FRANCE

27
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,600
Are you well?

28
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Yes.

29
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,640
Sun.

30
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,120
I dreamed about that woman again.

31
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,840
I dreamed that

32
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,640
I walked into the woods

33
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,720
just like every time I had this dream.

34
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,560
Why do you keep having the same dream?

35
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,600
Who is that woman anyway?

36
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,040
I've never seen her face.

37
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,400
In my dream,

38
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,120
I'm always chasing after her.

39
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,480
What's weird is that

40
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,600
you're always chasing after her.

41
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,840
But you've never seen
anything along the way?

42
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,720
Laor.

43
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,120
Let's go back to Viengphukhum.

44
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,600
It's not the right time, Sun.

45
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,120
When will be the right time, Laor?

46
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,680
We'll go back once we've found

47
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,520
the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

48
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,360
There he is.

49
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,640
-Catch him.
-Hey!

50
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,840
Come on then.

51
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,400
Take this!

52
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,000
Get him!

53
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,280
Get him!

54
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,120
Take that!

55
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,720
Hey.

56
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,000
Watch out.

57
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,960
Take this!

58
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,120
Hey!

59
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,880
Take that!

60
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,280
Watch out!

61
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,480
After him!

62
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,200
Come on! Let's go!

63
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,120
Should I handle this?

64
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,840
I'll deal with him myself.

65
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,440
Hey.

66
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,600
We've got you now.

67
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,920
Hand me the necklace.

68
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,240
Come and get it if you want it.

69
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,400
Enough with this nonsense.

70
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,680
You and me.

71
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,200
Let's sort this out.

72
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Gosh. Your Highness.

73
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,080
Phu! You shot that in my mouth.

74
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,080
The water got in my mouth and my eyes.

75
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,480
Gosh.

76
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,280
This remote-controlled car got through

77
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,640
your impenetrable security system.

78
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,840
The system needs a lot of work.

79
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,240
I got through using a toy car.

80
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,280
-If the necklace really gets stolen,
-Shortwave signals interfere with the…

81
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,480
will you take responsibility?

82
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,240
My boss went easy on you earlier.

83
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,520
He could've finished you off.

84
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,640
Right. I see.

85
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,480
I wonder if you're more afraid
of your boss here

86
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,080
or the one in Bangkok.

87
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,280
Well…

88
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,760
You're actually a good fighter.

89
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,160
Your skills are unmatched.

90
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
That's better.

91
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,880
The security system
is not fit for purpose.

92
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,640
We'll have to find a company
that can do better.

93
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,640
Thank you, Phu,

94
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,960
for taking the time
to help us test our security system.

95
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,000
It's an honor to serve you, Your Highness.

96
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,400
I'll be in Bangkok next week.

97
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,440
I want a night out.

98
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,360
Jane, Noon, and Bow are waiting. Hurry.

99
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,600
Who are they?

100
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,400
How can you not know them?
They're super popular.

101
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,960
You Casanova.

102
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,400
I'll introduce you.

103
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,320
-Deal.
-Deal.

104
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,800
Wachira, give Phu a ride to the airport.

105
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

106
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,360
Good luck.

107
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,360
BANGKOK, THAILAND

108
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,000
Give me your bag.

109
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,240
Give it to me.

110
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,880
Hey!

111
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,280
Let me go!

112
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,000
Help! Somebody help!

113
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,200
Let go of me!

114
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,160
-Help!
-Hey!

115
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,320
Gosh!

116
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,360
Hey!

117
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,040
Get lost!

118
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,400
Get out of here!

119
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,720
Go!

120
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,040
Scram!

121
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,560
Go!

122
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,880
Get out of here!

123
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
Let's go.

124
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,920
Thank you.

125
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,680
No problem.

126
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,840
Thank you.

127
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Thank you again for helping me earlier.

128
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,560
Without you, I don't know
what would've happened.

129
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,360
We're lucky
those two were just petty thieves.

130
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,600
Otherwise, we would've been in trouble.

131
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,440
So why are you wandering
around here alone?

132
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,440
I just arrived in Bangkok.

133
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,040
I was going to stay at my friends',

134
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,320
but I can't find their house.

135
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:03,240
Are you from out of town?

136
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,200
I'm from out of town too.

137
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,160
I'm from Nong Waeng in Udon Thani.

138
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,560
Where are you from?

139
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,560
I'm from Paris.

140
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,200
I see. You're from Takhli, Nakhon Sawan.

141
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,119
It's Paris.

142
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,760
Not Takhli.

143
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,480
Paris. It's in France.

144
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,760
My gosh!

145
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,920
So glamorous.

146
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,560
So if you can't find your friend's house,

147
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,680
where will you stay?

148
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,800
I'll probably stay at a hotel for now.

149
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,240
I don't have much money.

150
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,440
I was going to stay with my friend
and find a job.

151
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,800
I see. How about this?

152
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,600
If you want to save money,
you can stay with me tonight.

153
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:47,040
If you like it, you can stay
and we can split the rent.

154
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,440
What do you say?

155
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,640
My gosh.

156
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,840
Do you mean it?

157
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,520
Merci beaucoup.

158
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,800
What?

159
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
My place isn't a coop.

160
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,640
I--

161
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,280
My name is Veena.

162
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,680
I'm Laorchan.

163
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,040
Or you can call me

164
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,120
Laor.

165
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,240
Okay.

166
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,760
Come on. Follow me.

167
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,440
Let's go.

168
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,880
LAMDUAN APARTMENT

169
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,200
Do you want coffee?

170
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,400
Make it a strong one.

171
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,000
I got us deep-fried dough sticks.

172
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,960
Okay.

173
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,880
Here's your coffee.

174
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,680
Here you go.

175
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
How many hours do you plan to sleep?

176
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,920
Maybe five.

177
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,400
I have an afternoon shift
at the restaurant

178
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,640
and a shift at One Mart at 9:00 p.m.

179
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,160
Gosh.

180
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,960
You need to rest.

181
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,040
If you only get
four or five hours of sleep a night,

182
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,640
it will take a toll on your body.

183
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,320
What can I do?

184
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,160
I have to support my parents and siblings.

185
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,920
Not to mention my nieces and nephews.

186
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,320
I am so jealous of you.

187
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,360
You have a good job that pays well.

188
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,640
Goodness.

189
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,600
There's news about
those handsome Jutathep men.

190
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,360
"M.L. Phuthaneth of JT Center."

191
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,120
I have the biggest crush on him.

192
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,120
So…

193
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,720
What does it say?

194
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,680
Jeez, you sure seem interested
in the local news.

195
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,800
Do you like them too?

196
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,720
Yes. So…

197
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,720
What's going on with that family?

198
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,480
"M.L. Phuthaneth of JT Center

199
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,000
takes the lead among the Jutathep boys

200
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,680
in preparing a birthday party
for their great-grandma.

201
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,520
All the ladies will have to wait
outside the palace gate for this event

202
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,520
because only close family members
are invited to the party."

203
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,200
Damn. What a shame.

204
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,400
I'm going to quit my job.

205
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,480
What?

206
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,360
Why?

207
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,840
You've only been there a month.

208
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,280
Also, your boss adores you.

209
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,680
Is there a problem?

210
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,720
No.

211
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,920
I just found a more interesting job.

212
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,320
Guys.

213
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,400
Mr. Phuthaneth is coming.

214
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,680
Make sure everything is taken care of.

215
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,440
I'll go check on things over there.

216
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,800
Hello.

217
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,240
Hey.

218
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
Get out of the way.

219
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,680
What are you doing standing here?

220
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,480
Gosh.

221
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,320
Thank you.

222
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,040
Thank you.

223
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,560
I'm sorry.

224
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,120
Can't you see I'm setting the table?

225
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,480
I have to get things ready

226
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,960
before Mr. Phu gets here.

227
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,200
If you have nothing to do,
help me set the table.

228
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,360
If you don't know how,
you can go sweep the floor.

229
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,320
Or else, Mr. Phuthaneth will give us
a scolding once he gets here.

230
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,160
Gosh.

231
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,280
Hey.

232
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,920
Have you never worked
for Mr. Panas before?

233
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,760
No.

234
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,520
This is my first gig.

235
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,640
Why?

236
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,960
That's why

237
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,320
you don't know the rules around here.

238
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,040
When you work in the palace,

239
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,240
you must dress appropriately.

240
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,720
Look at your bow tie.

241
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,160
You must make sure
both loops are the same size.

242
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,680
Like this.

243
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,160
And fix your sleeves.

244
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,960
Both sleeves must be pulled
all the way down,

245
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,000
and the cuffs must be buttoned.

246
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,240
Goodness.

247
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,560
I can do it myself.

248
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,520
Who are you anyway?

249
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,240
I am M.L. Phuthaneth

250
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,840
Jutathep.

251
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,440
Gosh.

252
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,640
I see.

253
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,040
I'm so sorry.

254
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,000
I've just remembered that

255
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,080
I'm needed in the kitchen.

256
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,440
Please excuse me.

257
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,360
Wait, miss.

258
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,320
Yes?

259
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,520
You dropped your handkerchief.

260
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,560
Right.

261
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,280
That's mine.

262
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,560
You must take good care

263
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,160
of your personal items.

264
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,080
Can't you see
there are people walking around?

265
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,680
The floor is dirty.

266
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,880
What if you can't get all the stains out?

267
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,240
Yes, sir.

268
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,840
What's your name?

269
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,800
I'm Laorchan.

270
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,600
Wait, Mr. Phuthaneth.

271
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
It's just that

272
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,680
my handkerchief is all dirty now.

273
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,800
Can I have it back?

274
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,760
Mr. Phuthaneth.

275
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,040
Mr. Phu.

276
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,760
Gosh.

277
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,440
Here you go.

278
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,160
This croissant is fresh from the oven.

279
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,160
Gosh. It smells so good.

280
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,000
Thank you, Sroi.

281
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,240
Well, well.

282
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,120
My parents are as in love as ever.

283
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,720
Goodness.

284
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,360
Kan.

285
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,680
Get over here and give me a kiss.

286
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,360
Once Wachira asks me
for your hand in marriage,

287
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,920
I won't get to kiss you anymore.

288
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,920
Come here. Get over here.

289
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,640
-All right.
-Come here.

290
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,880
That's my girl.

291
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,240
All right.

292
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,680
Phu.

293
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,520
What's up?

294
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,880
You seem cheerful.

295
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,600
That must mean
the preparations are going well.

296
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,760
Right?

297
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,440
Yes. Mr. Panas' team is getting
the venue ready for the party.

298
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,320
Everything should be ready by noon.

299
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,440
We'll start bringing
the food out around 4:00 p.m.

300
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,400
Okay.

301
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,560
It's wonderful

302
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,040
that you all take turns throwing parties
for your great-grandma.

303
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,480
Your cousins did a great job,

304
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,840
so you must make sure

305
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,960
that this party is a success as well.

306
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,320
-That's right.
-Okay.

307
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,520
Goodness. It's hard to believe that

308
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,360
the caterer actually lived up
to your expectations for your first party.

309
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,000
Wait.

310
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,800
What's that?

311
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,440
Is this a girl's handkerchief, Phu?

312
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,880
That's not your sister's handkerchief.

313
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,080
Right.

314
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,160
Kan doesn't have

315
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,240
a laced handkerchief like that.

316
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,560
That's right.

317
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,040
Well, you see…

318
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:28,880
I…

319
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,640
I want to ask you two to come with me
to Great-Granma Orn's house.

320
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,840
You too, Kan.

321
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,720
He's acting suspicious.

322
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,120
Mom. Dad.

323
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,120
Let's go.

324
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,240
All right.

325
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,480
Madam, there's a letter for you.

326
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,480
A letter for me?

327
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,760
Yes, Madam.

328
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,520
Who is it from?

329
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,960
It's from Vilairumpa, Madam.

330
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,560
Vilairumpa?

331
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,920
Vilairumpa.

332
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,880
Vilairumpa.

333
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,800
MAY THOSE WHO BREAK THEIR PROMISES
BE DAMNED FOR ETERNITY

334
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,040
Is anyone there?

335
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,680
Get the car ready.

336
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:27,520
Get the car ready.
I need to see Vilairumpa.

337
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,920
Is anyone there?

338
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,760
Hurry up. Do you hear me?

339
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,960
Get the car ready.

340
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,880
-Madam.
-Bring the car.

341
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,360
I need to see Vilairumpa.

342
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,960
-Grandma.
-Get the car ready.

343
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,640
-Grandma.
-Get the car.

344
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,600
-Nuanchawee, what happened?
-Chai Lek.

345
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,920
This letter came to her.

346
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,760
Calm down, Grandma.

347
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
Phu.

348
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,080
Take me to see Vilairumpa.

349
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,640
And Maratee too. I need to talk to them.

350
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,480
They can't damn us like this.

351
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,000
Hurry. Take me to see them.

352
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,360
-Grandma.
-Great-Grandma.

353
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,960
I'll fetch Dr. Chat.

354
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,920
Hurry.

355
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,320
This letter.

356
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,440
There's no return address
and no postage stamp.

357
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,760
Who delivered it?

358
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,120
The guard gave it to me.

359
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,360
I saw that it was addressed to Madam,

360
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,840
so I gave it to her.

361
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,600
MAY THOSE WHO BREAK THEIR PROMISES
BE DAMNED FOR ETERNITY

362
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,480
Hey.

363
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,680
How is she doing, Dr. Chat?

364
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,640
Her blood pressure is low.

365
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:40,120
She's feeling tired and lightheaded.

366
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,320
She needs rest.

367
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,280
I left her medicine with the nurse.

368
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,200
I think

369
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,720
we should postpone
Great-Grandma's birthday party.

370
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,720
I agree.

371
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,960
We'll wait for Ruj and Taew
to return from Spain.

372
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,440
Okay.

373
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,080
In that case, you need to talk
to your parents, Saruj.

374
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,160
We'll find the time
when the whole family is here.

375
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,440
The ministry is sending you
to work in Switzerland soon, right?

376
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,600
Yes, Uncle.

377
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,200
Good. We can wait
for Uncle Phee and Aunt Paengkwan

378
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,640
to return from Japan as well.

379
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,160
Jak, don't forget to ask Res and Korn

380
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,320
when they will be back.

381
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,560
Those two are so hard to reach.

382
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,640
One is busy with ballet rehearsals.

383
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,760
The other is busy making movies.

384
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,360
You should do it, Chat.

385
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,720
You should call Ked.

386
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,720
She can get Res back from France.

387
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,600
Great-Grandma's birthday party
isn't the problem.

388
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,480
The problem is
Aunt Maratee and Aunt Vilairumpa.

389
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,960
Great-Grandma asked us to look for them.

390
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,240
But where can we find them?

391
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,400
I think

392
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,040
we should let karma do its job.

393
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,920
Aunt Maratee assaulted Aunt Krongkaew

394
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,720
and it was Aunt Rumpa

395
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,240
who poisoned Great-Grandma Eied.

396
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,960
What they did was…

397
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,400
horrifying.

398
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,680
I think Great-Grandma
might want to see them

399
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,200
to tell them she has forgiven them

400
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,200
and to let bygones be bygones.

401
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,800
But I think

402
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,920
she might want to make good on the promise

403
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,480
that the two families made to each other.

404
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,360
She might want her grandchildren to help

405
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,560
unite the two families through marriage.

406
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,600
Therefore,

407
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,160
you all had better be prepared.

408
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,560
I believe

409
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,720
love cannot be forced.

410
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,880
If fate wants a Jutathep
to fall in love with a Dhevaprom,

411
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,320
then it will happen naturally.

412
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,960
We don't have to try

413
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,440
to force it to happen.

414
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,200
More importantly
and I want you all to bear this in mind,

415
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:11,040
if any more letters come
for Great-Grandma,

416
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,880
I want you to check them first.

417
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,440
Do not let her see them.

418
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,160
Hello, Mr. Phu.

419
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,360
Hi, Wisarn.

420
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,200
-Hello, Mr. Phu.
-Hello, Mr. Phu.

421
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,920
Hey, Man. Hi, Kanchid.

422
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,480
Gosh.

423
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,440
Jaree! Mr. Phu is here!

424
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,560
Goodness.

425
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,280
-Jeab. Jang. Hurry.
-Yes, ma'am.

426
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,640
-Hello, Mr. Phu.
-Hello, Mr. Phu.

427
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,920
-Hello, Mr. Phu.
-Hello, Mr. Phu.

428
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,880
-Right, Ling.
-Yes, sir.

429
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,080
Have you received your overtime check yet?

430
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,320
I have, sir.

431
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,760
How are you, Jang?

432
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,080
Is your leg all better after your fall?

433
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,040
You can take a couple of days off.

434
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,560
I'm all better now, Mr. Phu.

435
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,040
Jeab.

436
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,679
I'm looking into
our employee benefits policy.

437
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,280
I'll make sure that

438
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,040
you can apply for a mortgage.

439
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,440
Thank you, sir.

440
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,920
Thank you so much, sir.

441
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,800
You take such good care of us.

442
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,400
That's because

443
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,400
you all work hard
and give this company your all.

444
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,960
JT Group wouldn't be where it is

445
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,440
without all of you.

446
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,960
You are good to me,

447
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,360
so I'm good to you as well.

448
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,560
Can you bring me coffee?

449
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,800
Right away, sir.

450
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,840
He's kind, handsome, and loaded.

451
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,240
He's perfect.

452
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,560
I think you should tell him.

453
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,440
Gosh.

454
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,560
I'm too scared.

455
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,840
I know you're scared,
but you have to tell him.

456
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,640
Mr. Phu seems to be in a good mood.

457
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,720
This is your chance.

458
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,400
Didn't you hear him?

459
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,840
"You are good to me,

460
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,440
so I'm good to you as well."

461
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,200
My gosh.

462
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,320
Tell him.

463
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,080
I am good to you,

464
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,160
but it doesn't mean I'll let you quit.

465
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,040
But I…

466
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,280
I really need to, sir.

467
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,640
Tell me the reason.

468
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,080
You see…

469
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,120
I…

470
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,640
I'm getting married.

471
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,680
Getting married?

472
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,560
Is marriage really necessary?

473
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,560
If it is,

474
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,960
how come I'm not married?

475
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,440
And since I'm not married,

476
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,520
it means you don't need to be married!

477
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,560
It's really important to me, sir.

478
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,040
I am 39 years old.

479
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:12,360
I'm 39 years, 9 months, and 9 days old.

480
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,840
If I put it off any longer,
I'll be 40 when I get married.

481
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,200
I can't take it!

482
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,840
If I wait until then,

483
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,120
I'll be an old and wrinkled bride.

484
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,960
I'm not stopping you.

485
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,160
Go ahead and get married.

486
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,280
What?

487
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,520
Do you mean it, sir?

488
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,520
I can't stop you from starting a family.

489
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,160
It's just a shame.

490
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,320
I don't know where I'll find someone

491
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,960
who makes coffee as well as you do.

492
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,560
I'm not leaving right away.

493
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,240
I'll stay for another month
to help train the new secretary.

494
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,040
I'll find someone competent

495
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,880
who can make coffee just like I do.

496
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,440
Just make sure she's not

497
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,680
as sassy as you.

498
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,520
Gosh.

499
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,280
Don't tease me, sir.

500
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,840
Congratulations in advance.

501
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,040
I'll be the guest of honor at your wedding

502
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,120
if you'd like.

503
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,840
My goodness! Are you serious, sir?

504
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,560
You're the best boss in the whole world.

505
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:24,360
I'm so happy!

506
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,240
Gosh.

507
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,960
-No!
-Jaree!

508
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,840
I'm so sorry.

509
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,040
I'm really sorry, sir.

510
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,840
I'll take your shirt
and have it washed for you.

511
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,800
I'll bring you a new shirt.

512
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,240
I'll have this one cleaned
and make it as good as new.

513
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,320
I'm really sorry.

514
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:21,320
MANAGER

515
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,240
Can you make a call and cancel everything?

516
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,240
Did something happen?

517
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,440
We've already prepared everything.

518
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,880
It's not your team's fault.

519
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,520
We'll compensate you for everything.

520
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,640
Can you send over 30 sets
of the food you prepared to the palace?

521
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,320
Yes, Mr. Phu.

522
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,320
Can you have that female staff member
who just started this morning

523
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,760
deliver the food?

524
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,080
You mean Laorchan?
She finished her shift already.

525
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,520
Should I call her back?

526
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,640
Do you quit?

527
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,800
Yes.

528
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,760
Listen. You've only been working
at Sky Catering for a week.

529
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,120
Why quit so soon?

530
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,640
Well,

531
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,520
it doesn't excite me anymore.

532
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,040
This is work, not a singing contest.

533
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,680
It doesn't have to be exciting.

534
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,040
I know what I'm doing.

535
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:24,280
I already got a new job.

536
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,960
Hang on.

537
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,360
What's the job?
How did you get it so quickly?

538
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,520
A library manager.

539
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,280
Gosh.

540
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,560
That sounds so exciting.

541
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,720
You'll be sitting around
guarding books all day.

542
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,440
On a second thought,

543
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,760
I guess it suits you.

544
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,920
Yes.

545
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,600
I can do research while I work.

546
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,760
Right.

547
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,960
I'll work there until
I get the job that I really want.

548
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,480
What? You're going to keep looking?

549
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,840
You've already quit three jobs.

550
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,200
Where do you really want to work?

551
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,200
Tell me.

552
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,120
Her address is in her job application.

553
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:29,880
Laor.

554
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,080
You'll start working
at the library tomorrow, right?

555
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,520
That's right.

556
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,680
You can work late tonight.

557
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,040
I'll make sure to lock the door,
so don't worry.

558
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,160
All right. I'll see you later.

559
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,720
See you.

560
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,480
Would you like some grilled meatballs?

561
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,200
-Sure.
-How many do you want?

562
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,640
All of them.

563
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,280
Goodness. Sure thing.

564
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,840
Miss.

565
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,240
Laor.

566
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,480
Sun.

567
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,000
Are you well?

568
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,480
Yes.

569
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,280
Let's go.

570
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,600
When did you get back?

571
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,440
I just got back.
I came straight to see you.

572
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,520
Let's catch up.

573
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,720
Okay.

574
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,880
Thank you.

575
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,920
How are things over there?

576
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,840
Things are kind of gloomy.

577
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,200
King Rangsimun and Queen Chanta
don't visit the people like they used to.

578
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,000
There are also rumors of the rebels
hiding among the townsfolk.

579
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,520
You have to be careful.

580
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,640
You too.

581
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,280
Gosh.

582
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,280
Sir, my mom had me bring you
your meatballs.

583
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,800
That's 300 baht, please.

584
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:20,720
We're being followed.

585
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,240
Here you go.

586
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,840
You can share these meatballs
with your friends.

587
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,360
Really?

588
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,160
Gosh, you're awesome.

589
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,200
I hope you find a cute girlfriend.

590
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,840
The road is cut off.

591
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,200
The road is cut off, sir.

592
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,160
Copy that.

593
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,360
Protect the royal vehicle.

594
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,640
Don't let anyone get
to the King and the Queen.

595
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,280
Hey.

596
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,760
Kill them all. Don't let anyone get away.

597
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,560
No!

598
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,240
Go after them! Go!

599
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,240
Let's go!

600
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,960
After them!

601
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,760
-Capture them.
-Yes, sir.

602
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:32,120
Let's go.

603
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,200
Get them.

604
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:36,360
Over there.

605
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,480
On your knees.

606
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,520
Dad.

607
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,160
Dad. Mom.

608
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:05,720
Are you two all right?

609
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:07,920
Yes.

610
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:10,040
What happened?

611
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,760
The rebels ambushed us,

612
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:14,760
but we have things under control.

613
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,200
Satarasamee.

614
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:20,760
Escort the King and the Queen
back to the palace.

615
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,600
Wachira and I will handle things here.

616
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,760
Get in there.

617
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
Get in.

618
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:57,120
Watch it.

619
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,360
Hurry up.

620
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,360
Stay there.

621
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:20,160
VIENGPHUKHUM PALACE, VIENGPHUKHUM

622
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,760
We can't just be
on the defensive like this.

623
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,400
We need to eliminate those rebels.

624
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,280
Listen.

625
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,880
We need to think before we act.

626
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:33,880
Problems arising
from differences of opinion

627
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,200
have always been there,

628
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,360
ever since the times of our ancestors.

629
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,880
Perhaps even longer than that.

630
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,640
I agree with Dad, Uncle.

631
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:44,720
We don't need to use violence
to suppress the rebels.

632
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,480
Negotiation is our best option.

633
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,840
Who would we negotiate with?

634
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,320
The rebels always fight dirty.

635
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:56,280
If I hadn't made your parents

636
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:58,040
hide in the supply wagon

637
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:59,840
and you hadn't got there in time,

638
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,320
think what would've happened.

639
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,480
Could this be caused
by the curse of Lord Naga Trinetr?

640
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,920
I know all of you are thinking
what I'm thinking.

641
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,640
Lord Naga Trinetr is the Great Naga.

642
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:21,480
He was loved and worshipped
by humans and gods alike.

643
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,240
If his death was brought about

644
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,720
by human desire and lust as the myth says,

645
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,400
it's only normal that
he would hold a grudge against us.

646
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,200
It's a myth.

647
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:34,960
Myths are nothing but stories.

648
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,360
The rebels made this story up

649
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,960
to frighten the townsfolk.

650
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,120
I'm thinking the same thing,
Prince Anucha.

651
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,480
However, evidence shows that

652
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:54,840
ever since the times of our ancestors,

653
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:57,120
there have been calamities

654
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:00,720
just as the curse
of Lord Naga Trinetr foretold.

655
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:04,360
Then we need to prove it.

656
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:07,040
I'll go to Thailand to look into this.

657
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,040
Thailand?

658
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:12,440
What answer will you get from going there?

659
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,320
Someone will help us solve this mystery.

660
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,800
They will help us.

661
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,920
I'm sure of it.

662
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,680
What?

663
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,480
Hey.

664
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,360
Gosh. Sun.

665
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,080
You scared me.

666
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:24,720
Gosh.

667
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,360
What are you looking for?

668
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:33,520
It's the woman in a sarong
that I always dream about.

669
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,480
She's gone.

670
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:37,640
What? There's no one here.

671
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,880
I didn't see anyone when I walked in.

672
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,120
What?

673
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,000
But…

674
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,760
Gosh.

675
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,240
Am I so worried I'm seeing things?

676
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,240
Damn it.

677
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,480
Anyway,

678
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,720
what are you doing here?

679
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,200
I have important news.

680
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:03,080
Who told you this?

681
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,400
My dad's former subordinate

682
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,800
works in Viengphukhum Palace.

683
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,160
He informed me that Prince Satarasamee

684
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,160
is coming to Thailand on a private trip.

685
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,040
-When?
-I think within a couple of days.

686
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,560
Why is he coming here?

687
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,920
Is it for a holiday?

688
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,680
I doubt it.

689
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,000
There are rumors
going around about the rebels.

690
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,840
This is hardly the time for the prince

691
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:29,880
to take a vacation abroad.

692
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,600
More importantly, his trip to Thailand

693
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:34,840
isn't just a regular trip.

694
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,680
It's highly confidential.

695
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,000
No one knows about this,

696
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:39,960
not even the people in Viengphukhum.

697
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:41,960
And the newspapers here

698
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,440
haven't caught wind of it either.

699
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,520
It's hard to guess
where the prince will stay.

700
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:06,120
Is this such a big secret
that you have to be in disguise?

701
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,160
It's for the prince's safety, Mr. Phu.

702
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:11,000
More importantly,

703
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,360
it's for my parents' safety.

704
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,680
If the rebels know I'm away,

705
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,600
the two of them might be in danger.

706
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,000
At least Uncle Anucha volunteered

707
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:21,920
to stay and protect them.

708
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,080
I just heard from Prince Anucha.

709
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,760
Everything is fine, Your Highness.

710
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:32,560
I came here

711
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:35,320
to learn the truth about
the Ajna Chakra Necklace

712
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,880
and its influence over
our reign in Viengphukhum.

713
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,080
The person who can help me is here.

714
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,800
But I don't know anything about this.

715
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,480
But you can take me
to the person who does.

716
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,640
Again?

717
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,760
You can't get a new job
every time you pick up a newspaper.

718
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,640
Listen.

719
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,480
This is the one job that I have to take.

720
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,600
What job is it this time?

721
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,840
It's my dream job.

722
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,600
Don't tell me

723
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,480
it's a job at JT Center.

724
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,040
That's right.

725
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,240
That's awesome.

726
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,840
Everything just worked out in your favor.

727
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,840
Let me see.

728
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,400
Here.

729
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,040
You're right.

730
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,720
You're so lucky.

731
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:40,560
You always get the job you want.

732
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,640
My gosh.

733
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,120
You'll be working
as M.L. Phuthaneth's secretary.

734
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:49,480
I'm beyond jealous right now.

735
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:54,360
Hang on.

736
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,400
This ad is from three days ago.

737
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,840
What if he already found someone?

738
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,360
Shit.

739
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,360
Your coffee, sir.

740
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,640
-Jaree.
-Yes?

741
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,280
If I can't find a new secretary today,

742
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,760
what then?

743
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:20,160
Goodness.

744
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,480
You just have to lower
your expectations a little.

745
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:25,240
I guarantee you'll find someone.

746
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,440
No. If I can't find someone
competent to replace you,

747
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,680
I won't let you quit.

748
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,160
That's not a threat.

749
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:36,920
I'm just letting you know.

750
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,080
I was born in Thailand,

751
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,280
but I went to study in America
when I was little.

752
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:44,280
I can speak English very fluently

753
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:46,840
and I can also speak Thai like a native.

754
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,920
My name is Sumitra.

755
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,320
I like being a secretary.

756
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,760
I'm polite

757
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,480
and I'm also confident.

758
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,480
If you choose me,

759
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,240
you'll have someone
very competent working for you.

760
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:01,200
Long live JT!

761
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,000
Long live JT!

762
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,160
I don't like to work with people,

763
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:08,960
so I chose to be a secretary

764
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,360
so I could work directly under my boss.

765
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,840
I'm agile and flexible.

766
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:19,600
I'm playful.

767
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,000
I can steal any man's heart,

768
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:23,760
including

769
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,360
my boss's.

770
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,720
Jaree.

771
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,480
Excuse me. Please come with me.

772
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,040
Wait, sir. Hold on.

773
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,960
Please give me one more chance.

774
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,760
We have one more candidate.

775
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,120
I have an appointment.
Your time is up, Jaree.

776
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,400
Sir, wait!

777
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,000
Sir, please don't go!

778
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,800
Please give me another chance, sir!

779
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:32,960
Maybe Mr. Phu was just joking.

780
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,120
As if.

781
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,720
You talk like you don't know him.

782
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,680
There has to be someone

783
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,360
who is as perfect as me.

784
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,600
Hello.

785
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,960
I'm here to apply for the position
of Mr. Phuthaneth's secretary.

786
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,280
My dear.

787
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,760
You're my last hope

788
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:03,920
to finally get hitched.

789
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,560
Well…

790
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,680
Here.

791
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,520
Have a seat.

792
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,360
Sit down, dear.

793
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:20,600
There you go. Stay right there.

794
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,600
I can finally get married.

795
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,160
Yes!

796
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:28,960
All right.

797
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,960
Yes!

798
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,880
Do you have to change
your disguise every day, Your Highness?

799
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:42,960
Who knows?

800
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,480
There could be someone
with malicious intentions in this room.

801
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,240
It's better to take precautions.

802
00:57:57,560 --> 00:57:59,040
Right, Phu.

803
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,160
Let's drop the formality,

804
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,760
so we don't attract attention.

805
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:03,600
Sure, man.

806
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,360
It's Satarasamee.

807
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,880
Sorry. I got carried away.

808
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,680
You punk.

809
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,880
Gosh.

810
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,040
What's up, Jaree?

811
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,320
Sir, I have urgent news.

812
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:23,560
What is it?

813
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,480
I have found you

814
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,960
the perfect secretary.

815
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,120
You could enter her
in a pageant for secretaries

816
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,440
and I guarantee she would win the crown.

817
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,640
She's a clear winner.

818
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,080
She's gorgeous.

819
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,920
So I'd like you to come in

820
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,400
to interview her yourself.

821
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,840
If she's that perfect,

822
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,760
why didn't you let me
meet her this morning

823
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,480
instead of letting me talk
to all those other people for hours?

824
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,160
Now I'm busy.

825
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,920
It's too late, Jaree.

826
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,360
Please ask her to leave.

827
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,240
But--

828
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,960
Sir!

829
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,800
I'll be his secretary
until I'm old and grey.

830
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:10,840
Ma'am.

831
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,640
Excuse me.

832
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,040
Does Mr. Phuthaneth
already have a new secretary?

833
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,520
Don't cry, Jaree.

834
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,000
What's wrong, Nujaree?

835
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:29,880
Go.

836
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:35,880
Well…

837
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,720
This is Ms. Sroifha.

838
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,240
She is Mr. Phuthaneth's mom.

839
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,240
She's the vice president of JT Center.

840
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:46,040
That's Ms. Kanthika,
Mr. Phuthaneth's sister.

841
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:49,840
She's the director
of Resource Management here.

842
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,760
This is Laorchan Pundheva.

843
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,240
She's applying to be Mr. Phu's secretary.

844
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,160
Hello.

845
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,040
Prince Anucha would like a word.

846
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,720
Yes, Uncle.

847
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:19,440
Some rebels snuck
into the palace last night.

848
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,040
But don't worry.

849
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:23,600
My men were standing guard

850
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:25,560
and we captured all of them.

851
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:28,120
I'm interrogating them about their boss.

852
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,680
I'd really like to know

853
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,880
who their big boss is.

854
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,840
Does that mean they know where I am?

855
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,160
I think we might have a mole.

856
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:40,160
No one knows you're not at the palace

857
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,400
except those on the inside.

858
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,480
I'll hurry and take care
of my business here.

859
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,640
Please look after my parents.

860
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,240
Don't you worry.

861
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:53,440
I'll protect the King and the Queen

862
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,840
with my life.

863
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,320
Tell me

864
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,720
who your big boss is!

865
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,840
Tell me!

866
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,080
Let's go.

867
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:41,720
Sir.

868
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,200
Thank you.

869
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,640
It says here

870
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:11,320
that you obtained your diploma in France.

871
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,880
How long did you live there?

872
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:18,320
Thirteen years. My dad moved there
when I was ten years old.

873
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,480
How many languages do you speak?

874
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:24,760
Four. I can speak Thai,
English, French, and German.

875
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,200
Do you come back

876
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,160
to Thailand every summer?

877
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,280
Do you have any relatives here?

878
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:35,120
No. My dad got ill
after he moved to France

879
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,160
and I had to take care of him.

880
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,800
He already passed away.

881
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:52,720
Did you also choose

882
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:56,120
to study the history of Southeast Asia?

883
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:01,360
Yes, because the history
of this region interests me.

884
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:03,040
I was born here.

885
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:05,160
Though I grew up in France,

886
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:07,000
I have a bond with my motherland.

887
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,560
How can we truly know ourselves

888
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,640
if we don't know anything about our roots?

889
01:03:58,040 --> 01:04:01,040
I'm done here.
Would you like to add anything, Phu?

890
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,720
I'm satisfied with the interview,

891
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:19,360
but I'd like to test her skills a bit.

892
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,400
It's too sweet.

893
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,280
Don't use white sugar.

894
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,760
Did you put syrup in this?

895
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,200
The coffee is not hot.

896
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:06,440
This is too hot.

897
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:11,760
Is the water at 94 degrees?

898
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,160
Put more milk in the coffee.

899
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,240
How much milk did you put in here?

900
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:38,240
This is good.

901
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:40,800
Yes!

902
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,240
So has she passed the test?

903
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,040
Nujaree.

904
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:47,880
I'm sorry, sir.

905
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,240
I got a bit too excited.

906
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,920
But I think she nailed it
since the first cup.

907
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,080
What are you talking about?

908
01:05:57,160 --> 01:05:58,760
Every cup of coffee

909
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:01,360
was brewed with water at 94 degrees

910
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,400
using 8 g of roasted arabica coffee beans

911
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,000
which were extracted into 30 cc of water,

912
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,600
making this the perfect espresso shot

913
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,640
that contains both body and heart.

914
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,240
I didn't add any sugar or syrup

915
01:06:15,320 --> 01:06:17,040
because you don't like that.

916
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:20,320
But I did add 30 cc of milk

917
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,360
because that's how you like it.

918
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,520
Every cup I made was the same.

919
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,440
I can confirm that.

920
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,680
I taught the recipe

921
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:30,960
to Laorchan myself

922
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:33,360
even before she had her interview.

923
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:35,920
Or did you change how you take your coffee

924
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:37,080
without telling me?

925
01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:39,960
I like my coffee
the way I've always liked it.

926
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:42,480
That will never change.

927
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,280
In the time before the Buddha,

928
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:57,040
there was a naga named Lord Naga Trinetr.

929
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,880
How is the Ajna Chakra Necklace

930
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:01,880
connected to Lord Naga Trinetr?

931
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,320
It's magnificent.

932
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,440
No wonder so many people want it.

933
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,840
Is it true that he put a curse

934
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,600
on the people of Pimpa Kingdom?

935
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,760
I'd be happy to do it myself.

936
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:13,160
But it's hard.

937
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,160
I majored in Southeast Asian history.

938
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,760
I can do it.

939
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:20,040
Were you able to decipher the inscription?

940
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:23,280
I was able to interpret
some details regarding the curse

941
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,960
but where it talks about the time,
I'm not sure.

942
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,040
Laorchan might be able to help.

943
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:29,520
Yes, sir.

944
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:14,720
