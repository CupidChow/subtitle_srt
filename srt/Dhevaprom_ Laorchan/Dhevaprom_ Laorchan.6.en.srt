1
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,600
<i>I saw the Ajna Chakra necklace.</i>

2
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,200
<i>So it's really here?</i>

3
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,600
The necklace is in Jutathep Palace.

4
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,640
<i>So you know where the safe is.</i>

5
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,720
If one day, something happens
that causes us to break up,

6
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,680
<i>we can end things quietly.</i>

7
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,759
Do you still have doubts
about our relationship?

8
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,840
Are you here with your boyfriend?

9
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,520
What a coincidence.

10
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,840
You should introduce us.

11
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,000
- Sister, look at this.
- What?

12
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,880
My gosh! What is this?

13
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,400
You should all know that

14
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,600
Laorchan and I are in a relationship.

15
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,720
- Phu.
- Mr. Phu.

16
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,520
It seems that your lover
has quite a few suitors.

17
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,080
<i>Now she's flirting with another man
in front of the office.</i>

18
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,120
Nujaree said you had
urgent business to take care of.

19
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,400
Why are you back so soon?

20
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,840
It was faxed to every department?

21
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,040
Did they have to go that far?

22
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,520
One of the employees must have done it.

23
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,960
Phu agrees with you.

24
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,120
But there's no evidence to prove it yet.

25
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,120
I think an outsider sent the fax.

26
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,440
Or more than one person

27
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,760
is behind it.

28
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,560
Think about it,

29
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,240
did they have to do all that
just to get at one woman?

30
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,840
What did Phu say about it?

31
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,640
Despite being extremely upset,

32
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,480
he handled the situation very well.

33
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,000
He offered the culprit a chance to confess

34
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,480
and ordered everyone
not to mention the photos again.

35
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,240
All the employees were so scared

36
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,760
that they destroyed
every copy of the photo.

37
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,120
But the damage has already been done.

38
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,760
Laorchan must be very upset.

39
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,680
I'm not sure what upset her more,
the photos or the other thing.

40
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,600
Phu announced to everyone
that he loves Laorchan

41
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,240
and that they are dating.

42
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:56,160
He turned a crisis into an opportunity.

43
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,880
He was left with no choice.

44
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,680
I'm still worried about Laor.

45
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,960
She must be so frightened.

46
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,760
I would be too
if photos of me were released like that.

47
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,920
But Laor also handled the situation well.

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,800
This woman is much stronger
than we thought.

49
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,120
Here's your payment.

50
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,760
What if Mr. Phu found out that it was us?

51
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,440
He will fire me if he knows

52
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,320
I took those photos.

53
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,920
Don't be such a coward.

54
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Just don't admit to anything.

55
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,920
You're not the only person
with a camera, Nikom.

56
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,960
But I didn't think you were going
to fax it to the whole company.

57
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,520
This is a very serious matter.

58
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,520
That's why I did it.

59
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,440
It was the only way

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,240
to expose that woman.

61
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,240
Does this mean

62
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,040
our job is done?

63
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,880
No.

64
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,760
This is just the beginning.

65
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
You two must keep an eye on her

66
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,560
and report back to me.

67
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,760
My mom used her connections
to get you two jobs at JT Center.

68
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,200
She can do the same to get you fired.

69
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,720
Are we clear?

70
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,440
- Yes.
- Yes.

71
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,480
Drink some coffee, Laor.

72
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,760
It will provide you with energy
to give orders.

73
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,160
I don't know why,

74
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,560
but I can sense an executive aura
radiating from your body.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,920
I agree.

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,480
Let me know

77
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,920
whenever you feel fatigued.

78
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,360
I will dedicate my heart and soul

79
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,800
to serving you, Ms. Laor.

80
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,440
Stop it!

81
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,600
Stop kissing her ass.

82
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,560
Don't you have work to do?

83
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,680
Just so you know,

84
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:14,920
in case you need any help at all,

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,920
I'm here for you.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,440
- Seriously?
- Seriously?

87
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,240
Everyone, stop teasing me.

88
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,640
And don't call me Ms. Laor.

89
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,320
Come on.

90
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,200
We can't do that, Laor.

91
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,240
After all,

92
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,680
you are dating our boss.

93
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,760
That's right.

94
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,520
That makes you our boss too.

95
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,320
She's right.

96
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,800
I don't know how things will turn out
between me and him.

97
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,040
But his eyes say
there's a future between you two.

98
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,560
I got goosebumps

99
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,760
when he announced your relationship.

100
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,000
My goosebumps haven't gone away.

101
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,760
It was so cute.

102
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,680
Guys.

103
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,400
Don't discuss personal matters at work.

104
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,400
You are making me uncomfortable.

105
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,560
Why do you feel uncomfortable?

106
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,160
Boss.

107
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,000
Have you sent me the documents?

108
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,720
I'm sending them to you now.

109
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,000
- Email them to me.
- Okay.

110
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,440
Have you finished your work?

111
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,880
Come with me.

112
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,320
It's urgent.

113
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,840
Hello, Mr. Phu. It's an honor
to welcome you in person today.

114
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,360
How can I help you?

115
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,720
Hello, Bas.

116
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,600
This lady needs an evening dress
for a gala dinner

117
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,400
and another dress

118
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,800
for an engagement ceremony.

119
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,120
Are you or Ms. Kan getting engaged?

120
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,920
Kan is getting engaged.

121
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,560
I apologize for the short notice.

122
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,040
Don't worry about it.
Please wait a moment.

123
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
Okay.

124
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,920
Mr. Phu.

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,240
Are you taking me
to Ms. Kan's engagement ceremony?

126
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,880
You are a part of my family.

127
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,400
How could I not take you?

128
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,480
I'm going to take your measurements.

129
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,000
Excuse me.

130
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,920
Hang on a second.

131
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,920
Shoulders, 15.5.

132
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,440
Next… Excuse me.

133
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,240
That's 82 cm.

134
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,919
All done.

135
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,120
Mr. Phu.

136
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,160
Is she your girlfriend? She's beautiful.

137
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,960
Yes.

138
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,680
I'll give you some privacy.

139
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,760
I'll be back with the patterns
and the fabrics.

140
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,680
- Sure.
- Make yourselves at home.

141
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,320
Why are you embarrassed?

142
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,240
What makes you think I'm embarrassed?

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,400
Well,

144
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,600
I've been observing you.

145
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,480
Whenever you feel embarrassed,
you touch your earlobe.

146
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,880
I didn't know you had been observing me.

147
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,960
Let's grab something to eat after this.

148
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
Mr. Phu.

149
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,040
Given the recent incident,

150
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,520
aren't you afraid
of paparazzi following us?

151
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,520
Well…

152
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,400
Not where I'm taking you.

153
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,520
I dare them to come.

154
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,560
What would you do to them?

155
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,320
She would shoot them.

156
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,800
She needs to teach them
not to mess with her son.

157
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,200
Your mom is a sharpshooter.

158
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,680
Honey.

159
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,800
I wouldn't waste my energy on them.

160
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,400
I would call the police

161
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,200
and ask them to handle it.

162
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,160
I'd rather save my energy
to cook for my children.

163
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,080
Phu.

164
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,640
Have you found out who sent the fax?

165
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,280
What about you, Laor?

166
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,120
Do you suspect anyone?

167
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,760
I don't know who to suspect.

168
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,040
I left Thailand when I was young

169
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,760
and I only returned a few months ago.

170
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,520
I don't know anyone in Thailand
besides my colleagues.

171
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,520
Did you outbid a company

172
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,080
for a project, Phu?

173
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,320
Maybe you upset a competitor.

174
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,040
If this were a business conflict,

175
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,680
they would have done worse than this.

176
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,080
They would probably
have threatened my life.

177
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,000
This person just wants
to tarnish our reputation.

178
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,000
Don't worry. Kanthika, the journalist,
has agreed to help us.

179
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,720
We'll find the culprit in no time.

180
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,480
Of course.

181
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,320
After all, Laor will be
a member of my family soon.

182
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,560
I refuse to let anybody touch my family.

183
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,000
Good for you.

184
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,640
All right then.

185
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,880
Next time

186
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:39,040
you give Laor a ride,
be mindful of your surroundings.

187
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,240
Don't let anybody
take photos of you again.

188
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,000
Next time,
there might be worse repercussions.

189
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
Sure.

190
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,640
He might have to announce
their wedding next time.

191
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,080
Kan.

192
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,400
I can't wait for that to happen.

193
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,640
Dad,

194
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,160
I assure you that
the next photos of us leaked

195
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,320
will be our pre-wedding photos.

196
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,760
- Slow down, Phu.
- Mom.

197
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,080
By the way, Phu,

198
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,920
doesn't the prince arrive
for his official visit tomorrow?

199
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,480
Yes, we are having a welcome party
for him in the evening.

200
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,000
However,

201
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,440
he told us to keep the party simple.

202
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,000
Do you have a dress to wear
to the party yet, Laor?

203
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,000
I took her to get one made.

204
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:24,920
What?

205
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,040
Really?

206
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,720
Stop right there.

207
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:34,000
You are so sweet that even your mom's
curry will taste bland in comparison.

208
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,360
Let's start eating.

209
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,920
Laor, dig in.

210
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Thank you.

211
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,760
Try this, Mom.

212
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,360
<i>Your parents are very kind.</i>

213
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,280
So am I.

214
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,440
I know. Your whole family is very kind.

215
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,200
It was so heartwarming.

216
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,360
I will remember this day
for the rest of my life.

217
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,880
Not just today.

218
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,000
You will be happy
for the rest of your life.

219
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,880
Just let me know when you are ready.

220
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,320
Thank you very much

221
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,360
for protecting my honor and dignity today.

222
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,240
I was protecting my love.

223
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,800
It would kill me to see you get hurt.

224
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,040
Despite all that, I wouldn't mind

225
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,880
a little reward from you.

226
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,600
No. I don't want to be on the news.

227
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,160
Go get some rest. We have a long day
ahead of us tomorrow.

228
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,160
You too. Rest well

229
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,760
and dream about me.

230
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,600
I'm going to go.

231
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,160
See you later.

232
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,440
See you.

233
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,920
Sun.

234
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,800
Laor.

235
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,120
I'm sorry.

236
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,720
I couldn't find a chance to leave.

237
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,520
Don't worry about it.

238
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,600
I texted you many times

239
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,480
but you didn't answer.

240
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,240
I realized something was up

241
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,160
so I postponed our appointment with Moo

242
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,600
until tomorrow.

243
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,080
You could have texted me all that.

244
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,480
You didn't need to come in person.

245
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,440
I wanted to come.

246
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,320
I wanted to see your face.

247
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,680
Sun.

248
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,360
I also want to know how you are going to
get into the engagement ceremony.

249
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Have you got any updates for me?

250
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,320
Yes, Mr. Phu is taking me to the ceremony.

251
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,960
Are you sure he won't change his mind?

252
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:44,800
I'm sure. Today, he took me
to have a dress made for the ceremony.

253
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,600
He must truly love you.

254
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,520
He wants to introduce you to his family.

255
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,400
Well, I don't know.

256
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,920
Do you love him?

257
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,520
I don't care how I feel about him, Sun.

258
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,120
I only care about my mission.

259
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,480
Whatever it takes

260
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,640
to get my hands on the sapphire third eye,

261
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,200
I'll do it.

262
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,680
I believe in you.

263
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,280
Once the mission is complete,

264
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,880
I will get you out right away.

265
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,119
LAMDUAN APARTMENT

266
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,800
See you.

267
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,040
How have you been?

268
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,040
Laor.

269
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,520
Where have you been these past few days?
Why didn't you come home?

270
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,560
It's my life.

271
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,240
Do I need to tell you everything
that goes on in my life?

272
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,800
Listen, Veena.

273
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,920
Colonel Wachira
is getting engaged in a few days.

274
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,000
But he's not engaged yet.

275
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,120
Therefore, I can do whatever I want
until that day comes.

276
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,560
Veena!

277
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,920
Veena!

278
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
We have to go, Laor. We'll be late.

279
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,440
LAMDUAN APARTMENT

280
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,200
See you, Veena.

281
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,800
LAMDUAN APARTMENT

282
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,480
WE'RE MEETING MOO TOMORROW INSTEAD,
I'LL PICK YOU UP

283
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,840
This is the place.

284
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,520
GENERAL

285
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,360
Who are you here to see?

286
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,960
Moo.

287
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,400
You're in the wrong place.

288
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,160
The king.

289
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,600
Room 201.

290
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,160
Take the stairs on the left.

291
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,840
STAIRS TO LEVEL 2

292
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,960
Who are you here to see?

293
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,440
A friend, sir.

294
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,880
He took a girl upstairs.

295
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,360
You can't enter.

296
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,760
Can I enter now?

297
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,160
Take the stairs on the left.

298
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,000
STAIRS TO LEVEL 2

299
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,000
You're good to go.

300
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,800
Sun, here you are.

301
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,480
- Wait a second.
- Okay.

302
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
Ready.

303
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,760
No, don't do this.

304
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,440
Come here. Quick.

305
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,760
I'm going to tell your wife.

306
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,440
Come here.

307
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,120
No.

308
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,760
I'll tell your wife.

309
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,280
No, don't do that.

310
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,200
I'm going to tell your wife.

311
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,600
What's going on?

312
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,360
One at a time, please.
I can't handle both of you at once.

313
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:55,520
I'm sorry. I was looking for the restroom.

314
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,360
You're unbelievable.

315
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,200
Hey.

316
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,080
Where are you going? Hey!

317
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,200
What's up?

318
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,840
Those two were followed here.

319
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,760
I'll take care of it.

320
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,840
Okay.

321
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:17,200
DINING ROOM

322
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,440
Is this the girl?

323
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
Yes.

324
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:30,200
It's the same safe, Sun.

325
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,880
You managed to find one

326
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,680
the same brand and model.

327
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,360
You must be a real gangster.

328
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,720
I'm familiar with every safe
model and brand.

329
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,320
I often send men
to rob rich people's safes.

330
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,760
Those millionaires
have enough money for everyone.

331
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,800
Can we borrow it for practice?

332
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,320
No.

333
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,600
I don't trust you.

334
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,360
You have two minutes.

335
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,800
- What?
- What?

336
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,680
Are you kidding?

337
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,360
How can we open it in two minutes?

338
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,640
That's all the time you get
in a real situation.

339
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,200
Don't waste your time arguing.

340
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,640
You were followed here.

341
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,280
He's heading this way as we speak.

342
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,240
- Mr. Phu.
- Mr. Phu.

343
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,000
I'm going to time you.

344
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,360
Sit down and close your eyes.

345
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,760
Try to focus.

346
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,120
I'm sorry.

347
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,440
I'm sorry. I got the wrong door.

348
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,160
Start.

349
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,200
I'm sorry.

350
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,360
I'm looking for a friend.

351
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,560
I'm sorry.

352
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,960
Focus and try again.

353
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,000
You have 30 seconds.

354
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,960
Ten more seconds.

355
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,080
Who's there?

356
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,760
Someone wants to see you.

357
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,120
His name is Mr. Phu.

358
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,440
Send him in.

359
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,960
After you.

360
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,680
How may I help you, Mr. Phuthaneth?

361
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,800
Do you know who I am?

362
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,560
Everybody knows M.L. Phuthaneth Jutathep.

363
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,960
You're a famous guy.

364
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,480
You came all the way here.
What can I do for you?

365
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,880
I heard you own this place.

366
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,760
I have some questions for you.

367
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,400
I'm looking for some friends.

368
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,400
They came in here.

369
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,120
A man or a woman?

370
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,080
One man and one woman.

371
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,200
I know.

372
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,760
Sun and Laor, right?

373
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,880
You know them?

374
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,080
Sun comes here often.

375
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,160
But it's Laor's first time.

376
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,080
They booked a room together.

377
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,400
I can ask my staff

378
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,240
to take you to them.

379
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,520
Shiang.

380
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,760
Take Mr. Phuthaneth to see those two.

381
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,040
This way.

382
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,320
This is the room.

383
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,400
- Mr. Phu.
- Mr. Phu.

384
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,880
What are you doing here?

385
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,320
You see,

386
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,280
my mom asked me to buy
some Chinese herbs for her near here.

387
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,320
I thought I saw you two from a way away.

388
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,640
I just came to check
if it was really you guys.

389
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,560
I brought Laor here.

390
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,960
They serve good dim sum.

391
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,440
It's an old restaurant
that my family loves.

392
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,240
I invited my friends to try it.

393
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,720
Is that so?

394
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,120
Mr. Phu, these are
our friends from France,

395
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
Sophie and Christian.

396
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,760
This is Mr. Phuthaneth Jutathep, my boss.

397
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,480
Our friends are taking a train
to Chiang Mai at eleven o'clock.

398
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,840
Sun and I came to send them off.

399
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,640
Join us for some dim sum.

400
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,800
I'm sure you will love it.

401
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,920
The chef quit a while ago

402
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,440
so I had to beg him
to come back and cook for us.

403
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,920
I reserved this room
to surprise my friends.

404
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,840
Please take a seat.

405
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,840
All right then.

406
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,160
Thank you.

407
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,800
Enjoy.

408
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,160
Thank you.

409
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,840
I have somewhere to be.

410
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,560
You can go to work with Mr. Phu.

411
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,320
Let's go to work.

412
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,400
Why did you follow me?

413
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,880
I…

414
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,840
I was worried about you.

415
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,560
You were worried

416
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,560
or you don't trust me?

417
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,440
Fine.

418
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,400
I don't trust your friend.

419
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,880
How could he bring you
to a place like this?

420
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,679
Do you realize now
that you were wrong about him?

421
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,360
You shouldn't trust him so much.

422
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,400
Mr. Phu, me trusting him or not

423
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,280
has nothing to do with your trust in me.

424
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,560
Do you think I'm the type

425
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,159
to let people take advantage of me?

426
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,719
I'd rather die than have that

427
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
happen to me.

428
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,360
Fine.

429
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,400
I'm sorry

430
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:58,240
for making you feel this way.

431
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,680
Please don't be mad, Laor.

432
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,680
Please.

433
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,520
Please, Laor.

434
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,840
What kind of secretary

435
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,120
lets their boss beg for forgiveness?

436
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,200
Do you forgive me or not?

437
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,720
If not,

438
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,480
I'll carry you home.

439
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,640
Wait, Mr. Phu.

440
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,400
Don't do that.

441
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,080
Somebody might see us.

442
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,720
Do you forgive me?

443
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,320
I promise

444
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,640
to trust you

445
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,560
from now on.

446
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,720
It won't happen again.

447
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,880
I'm sorry, Laor.

448
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,080
Let's go to work.

449
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,680
Okay.

450
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,800
Let's go.

451
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,360
Somebody might see us.

452
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,000
Jaree speaking.

453
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,520
<i>Is Laorchan there?</i>

454
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,120
Yes.

455
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,200
<i>Tell her to come and see me.
Tell her to make me coffee too.</i>

456
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,560
Sure, she will be right there.

457
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,680
<i>- Don't keep me waiting.
</i>- Yes.

458
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,800
Laor.

459
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,680
You have been summoned.

460
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,600
Mr. Phu is at the convention hall,
preparing for the event.

461
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,600
I didn't ask so don't bother telling me.

462
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,520
You are bold

463
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,000
throwing yourself at Phu like that.

464
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,840
It was just a kiss.

465
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,600
How could you kiss a man on the street?

466
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,280
Have you no shame?

467
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,920
We don't need to be ashamed
because we are in love.

468
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,360
Don't tell me you didn't kiss anyone

469
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,320
during your time abroad.

470
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,760
Don't talk back to me.

471
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,440
You and I are of different
social statuses.

472
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,880
I'm going to tell Phu
that you are rude to me.

473
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,400
A woman like you

474
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,440
doesn't deserve Phu.

475
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,520
Mr. Phu

476
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,200
will be the judge of that,

477
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,600
not you.

478
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,800
Do you see what someone like me
is capable of now?

479
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,920
How dare you do this to me?

480
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,520
It didn't require any courage.

481
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,600
I mean you well.

482
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,280
I did that to remind you

483
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,040
that you shouldn't mistreat anyone

484
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,560
because they have the right to fight back.

485
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,080
I'm going to tell Phu to fire you.

486
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,440
Are you a prince or a ninja?

487
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,600
You teleport like one.

488
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,560
Bangkok is only a little over an hour
away from Viengphukhum.

489
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,680
I had to attend the opening ceremony
of a school in Paderm province.

490
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,320
Did it go well?

491
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,720
Yes.

492
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,200
We owe a debt of gratitude to JT Holding
for your support with the project.

493
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:15,000
Thanks to you
the school was completed on time.

494
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,600
Please pass
my parents' gratitude to yours.

495
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,920
Viengphukhum is my mom's second home.

496
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,960
By the way,

497
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,680
are the rebels

498
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,520
still causing trouble?

499
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,400
They've been lying low recently,

500
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,040
but we can't lower our guard.

501
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,400
After all,

502
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,760
still water runs deep.

503
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,400
Phu.

504
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,520
Hi there, Ying.

505
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,120
What happened to your outfit?

506
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,960
Is it a part of the design?

507
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,160
Shut up. It's none of your business.

508
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,960
I just…

509
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,920
Stay out of it.

510
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,560
Ying, how could you be so rude to him?

511
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,920
Apologize this instant.

512
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,320
It's okay, Phu.

513
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,960
She's probably upset about something.

514
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,320
Yes, so just shut up.

515
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,440
Phu, come with me.

516
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,240
Have fun, Phu.

517
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,080
All right. Now that you're both here,
tell me what happened.

518
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,320
Your secretary splashed me

519
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,480
with syrup and milk.

520
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,760
My outfit, which is worth
almost 100,000 baht, is ruined.

521
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,720
Why don't you tell him

522
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,760
what you did to me first?

523
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,800
You insulted me first.
I had to teach you a lesson.

524
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,120
Wait a minute.

525
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,240
Are you lying to get away with it

526
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,720
or do you actually have dementia?

527
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,240
You were the one who started it.

528
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,840
Listen to her talk back to me.

529
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,160
I'm your guest, Phu.

530
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,080
Doesn't your secretary know

531
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,800
that she needs to respect
her boss's guests?

532
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,800
Don't you know

533
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,840
that you shouldn't mistreat

534
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,160
- a fellow human?
- We are of different social statuses.

535
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,480
Why are you making this about class?

536
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,400
Hold on.

537
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,480
Didn't you learn in school

538
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:13,080
that they ended slavery a long time ago?

539
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,040
- Did you just call me stupid?
- Ying.

540
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,000
I won't allow this, Phu.

541
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,880
I won't let this go
until she apologizes to me.

542
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,760
Do you want me to apologize?

543
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,760
Fine.

544
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,200
If that's what you want,

545
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,480
I will apologize to you.

546
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,760
I'm sorry.

547
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,080
Are you happy now?

548
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,400
Do you see how easy it was
for me to apologize?

549
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,800
Therefore, you owe me an apology too.

550
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:45,480
You threw coffee on me first.

551
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,600
Why would I apologize to you?

552
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,360
Never mind.

553
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,800
After all, I've done my bit.

554
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,640
I'm sorry

555
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,280
I ruined your beautiful outfit

556
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,360
by making it all smelly and sticky.

557
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,360
Phu!

558
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,080
Listen to her!

559
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,080
Laorchan has already apologized to you.

560
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,560
What else do you want?

561
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,560
You are spoiling her and taking her side.

562
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,160
Your obsession with her is blinding you.

563
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,600
You will regret this one day.

564
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,000
You didn't go easy on her.

565
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,160
No, I didn't.

566
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,960
I repay people's kindness.

567
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,720
I splash back what people splash at me.
I also reflect people's--

568
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,960
People's spitefulness. It's only fair.

569
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,080
Am I right?

570
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,840
Get out of the way.

571
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,160
What's with you?

572
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,920
You walked into me.

573
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,760
Why didn't you get out of the way then?

574
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,040
You are poor and careless.

575
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,040
If I had fallen and broken my leg,

576
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,320
I would have sued you
for everything you have.

577
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,200
Who are her parents?

578
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,800
How did they raise her?

579
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,600
Wachira, it's okay.

580
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,200
I'll tell her who you are.

581
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,280
I won't allow her
to disrespect you like that.

582
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,480
Don't bother.

583
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,520
I only saw her true colors
because she doesn't know who I am.

584
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,240
Forget about it.

585
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,320
WELCOME PARTY FOR
THE CROWN PRINCE OF VIENGPHUKHUM

586
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:46,600
WELCOME PARTY FOR
THE CROWN PRINCE OF VIENGPHUKHUM

587
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,200
You look like the prettiest
and the richest girl at the party.

588
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:10,400
Other girls cannot compare to you.

589
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,800
Of course, Mom.

590
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,480
I'm getting tired

591
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,680
just thinking about the line of men
I will have to turn down

592
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,360
when they ask me for a dance.

593
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,560
Phu is the only man I will dance with.

594
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:28,000
Good evening, General Saksit

595
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:31,280
and Lady Sineenuch.

596
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,520
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

597
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,800
How have you been?

598
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,680
You clearly made an extra effort
to dress up

599
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,480
to match the theme of the event.

600
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,760
Are you staring at me?

601
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,200
How dare you?

602
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:09,720
Ying, Phu has arrived.

603
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,720
Who is he waiting for?

604
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,200
Thank you.

605
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,160
Let's say hello to Phu.

606
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,240
He's here with another woman.

607
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,520
Come on. This way, Ying.

608
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:31,560
This way.

609
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,960
Come on.

610
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,600
The party looks amazing.

611
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,680
Thank you.

612
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:38,760
Phu, let's take a photo together.

613
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,360
The cameraman is over there.

614
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,240
Good evening,
Lady Sineenuch and General Saksit.

615
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,200
- Good evening.
- Have you been well?

616
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,880
Yes, we have, Phu.

617
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,880
You did a great job organizing the party.

618
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,760
Everything is perfect.

619
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,840
Laorchan, my secretary,
should take the credit.

620
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,440
Good evening.

621
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:06,080
So this is your new secretary.

622
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,720
It's a shame Ying took so long
to return to Thailand.

623
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,240
Otherwise, she could have been
your secretary.

624
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:14,240
She studied in England.
As the managing director,

625
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,400
you should have a secretary who
graduated from abroad working for you.

626
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:21,080
But nowadays,
Thailand has good universities too.

627
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,000
Which university did you graduate from?

628
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:26,880
I graduated from the University of Paris,
which is in France.

629
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,800
Is that so?

630
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,480
Laorchan has been extremely helpful,

631
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:41,680
as she speaks four languages.

632
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:52,560
Did you buy that necklace
just for this party?

633
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:56,880
Oh, my goodness. I love how small it is.

634
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,600
I didn't even notice it
until you brought it up.

635
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,480
Well, I'm sure she doesn't attend
many social events.

636
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,240
She doesn't know
how to pick the right accessories.

637
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,800
You clearly bought a knockoff.

638
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,160
Why didn't you at least pick
a bigger necklace?

639
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,600
Sometimes,

640
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:16,840
simple is best.

641
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,640
That's why I selected
a simple necklace for her.

642
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,080
Good evening, General.

643
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,360
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

644
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,320
Actually,

645
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:35,320
I bought that necklace for Sroi
for our wedding anniversary this year.

646
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:37,960
Dad.

647
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:42,040
Are you sure it's not a knockoff?

648
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,320
No, I bought it from Frank's Jewelry.

649
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,480
I wanted to buy a bigger necklace,
but your mom didn't like it.

650
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,080
It may be small,
but the diamonds are four-G,

651
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,240
D-color, and premium cut.

652
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,600
The necklace has GIA certification.

653
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,200
Have you been well?

654
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,680
Yes.

655
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,880
Isn't that…

656
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:09,360
Mr. Thomas.

657
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,600
Are you well?

658
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,360
Isn't that the brand manager
of Claudia Pilo?

659
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:20,640
I'm actually interested
in importing their products.

660
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,520
Can I borrow your secretary for a second?

661
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,520
- I--
- Come with me. Come on.

662
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,000
I remember you expressed
an interest in this brand too.

663
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,520
You should talk to him,

664
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,920
since we have an interpreter
from the University of Paris with us.

665
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,320
Let's go.

666
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,640
Come.

667
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,200
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

668
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,800
Sure.

669
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,600
Let's do that.

670
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,920
In that case,

671
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,680
have your boss call me.

672
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:25,400
All right, thank you.

673
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,560
You're welcome. Have a great evening.

674
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,040
What did he say?

675
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,840
He agreed to work with JT Holding.

676
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,040
Seriously?

677
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,920
But I asked Laorchan
to talk to him for me,

678
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,920
as I was interested in the brand.

679
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,400
You are not the only person
who expressed an interest.

680
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,680
I have contacted

681
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,240
and spoken to him many times in Paris,

682
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:01,760
but we couldn't reach a deal.

683
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,960
You are incredible.

684
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:07,120
Didn't you reach out to him
a bunch of times,

685
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,600
but he never got back to you?

686
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,920
General.

687
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,040
Phu, you chose the right secretary.

688
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,280
Great job.

689
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,120
I think you should give her a raise

690
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:27,720
and make her sign a lifetime contract.

691
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,600
That's a good idea, Dad.

692
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,160
Why don't we register
our marriage right now?

693
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,160
Oh, my.

694
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,320
Distinguished guests,

695
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,480
Prince Satarasamee
has arrived at the party.

696
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:57,960
Please join us in welcoming His Highness.

697
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,400
Laorchan looks beautiful today.

698
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,120
I think I should ask her for a dance.

699
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,800
Dream on, Your Highness.

700
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,960
This is General Saksit Eknawin.

701
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,000
He assisted us
with the preparation of the hall.

702
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,640
And this is Lady Sineenuch, his wife.

703
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,040
This is Woranuch, his daughter.

704
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,720
It's nice to officially meet you, Ying.

705
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,360
What?

706
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,360
Yes.

707
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:09,040
Likewise, Your Highness.

708
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,360
Good.

709
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:12,200
It's time for your speech, Your Highness.

710
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,240
WELCOME PARTY FOR
THE CROWN PRINCE OF VIENGPHUKHUM

711
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:33,400
I feel honored to have been invited

712
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,760
to host an exhibition in Thailand.

713
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,600
Thank you

714
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:43,080
for warmly welcoming me
and my team from Viengphukhum.

715
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,960
I'd like to thank JT Holding

716
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,760
for making

717
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:50,640
this beautiful exhibition possible.

718
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,120
In a few days, it will be open

719
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:54,920
to interested visitors.

720
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:59,600
The world will learn more
about our country,

721
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,360
and especially the Ajna Chakra Necklace,

722
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,480
which will be displayed at the exhibition.

723
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:08,280
The necklace has been

724
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:12,120
in the possession of our dynasty
for several decades.

725
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,600
I'm delighted

726
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,800
that the tale of Lord Naga Trinetr,

727
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,400
the great naga of Viengphukhum,

728
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,200
will be told once again.

729
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,840
What's going on?

730
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,880
WELCOME PARTY FOR
THE CROWN PRINCE OF VIENGPHUKHUM

731
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:33,320
Next,

732
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,920
I would like to invite

733
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,080
Prince Satarasamee
to commence the dancing…

734
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,840
Thank you for allowing Lord Naga Trinetr
to be tonight's highlight.

735
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,520
It's Laorchan who deserves your praise,
Your Highness.

736
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,720
In that case, may I have this dance?

737
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,360
Excuse me, Your Highness.

738
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,320
I would like to speak with you.

739
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,560
Could you spare me
a few minutes of your time?

740
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,400
I think you should dance

741
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,840
with this beautiful lady.

742
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,120
Let's dance.

743
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,200
- Allow me.
- My pleasure.

744
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:42,920
General, a moment, please.

745
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,560
I feel terribly guilty

746
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,600
about the way I treated you.

747
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,000
I'm truly sorry, Your Highness.

748
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,880
You can speak to me casually.

749
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,440
Drop the formalities.

750
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,000
It would be great

751
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,640
for you to learn

752
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,400
from this lesson

753
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,040
and stop judging people on their looks.

754
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,720
Fine. I mean, yes, Your Highness.

755
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,120
It seems like Ying won't be

756
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:24,080
following Phu around tonight.

757
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,120
It's just for one night.

758
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,440
The prince is flying back

759
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,320
to Viengphukhum right after the party.

760
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,120
Well, Ying is a beautiful girl.

761
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,680
Do you not think

762
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,880
the prince will show an interest in her?

763
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:45,240
My nephew is smart.

764
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:49,040
He can read people
and he has good taste in women.

765
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,600
That's kind of mean.

766
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,600
Our daughter is perfect for the prince.

767
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,320
Have you already forgotten about Phu?

768
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,480
I can't help it.
He doesn't know what he's missing.

769
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,160
He's refusing to grab the diamond

770
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,560
in front of him.

771
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:12,160
It's his loss if he wants to grab
a handful of gravel.

772
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,720
Look at our daughter.

773
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:18,480
I think she's going to marry the prince.

774
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,200
Who knows,

775
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,040
in the future,

776
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:24,960
we might have to call her
Princess Woranuch.

777
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:29,240
My dear Princess Woranuch.

778
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,760
They look perfect together.

779
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,680
You look beautiful today, Laor.

780
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,000
This isn't our first encounter today.

781
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:54,800
What's with the compliment?

782
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,760
The truth is, I wanted
to compliment you in the car,

783
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,760
but my parents were there.

784
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,240
Also,

785
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:04,680
I was too shy to say it.

786
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,640
It's not your first time being shy
in front of a girl, is it?

787
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,960
Of course it is.

788
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,760
You are

789
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,480
my first love,

790
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:18,560
my only love, and my last love.

791
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,400
Nobody knows what the future holds.

792
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,520
Change is natural.

793
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,520
But my heart will never change.

794
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,680
I'm not just looking for a soulmate, Laor.

795
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:39,160
I'm also looking for a confidant.

796
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,040
And you've proven to me today

797
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,840
that you are the perfect confidant for me.

798
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,520
How did it happen

799
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,040
if no one did anything?

800
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:00,760
Could that be a warning

801
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,720
from Lord Naga Trinetr?

802
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:06,080
Viengphukhum experiences
a mishap every 18 years.

803
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,720
General Segong attacked
and took over Viengphukhum

804
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,880
18 years before I was born.

805
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,880
Then we took back the country
18 years later,

806
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,840
but my dad passed away that same year.

807
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,920
And 18 years after that,

808
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,920
Prince Satarasamee's brother passed away

809
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,120
and there was a disease epidemic.

810
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,400
Are you sure that the technical team

811
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:34,280
didn't do that
and it wasn't a misunderstanding?

812
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,520
I'm sure.

813
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,480
I talked to the technical team
and the staff,

814
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,640
but no one knows how it happened.

815
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,120
No matter how it happened,

816
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,240
the press cannot hear about it

817
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,680
or it will cause a big problem.

818
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:53,440
Kan.

819
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:56,120
Do not tell Wachira about this.

820
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,200
I don't want to worry His Highness.

821
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:03,920
Let's wait until after
the engagement and the exhibition.

822
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,880
Yes, Mom.

823
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:13,120
I hope there won't be another surprise
waiting for us at the engagement ceremony.

824
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,600
There won't, Dad.

825
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,600
Laor and I will host the ceremony.

826
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,480
We will do our best

827
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:28,280
as it's the first auspicious event
in 30 years of our family.

828
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:48,280
Try on the necklace, Mom.

829
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:51,000
- Let's see.
- I'll hold a mirror for you.

830
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,320
What do you think?

831
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:57,480
It looks stunning, Mom.

832
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,720
I'm going to wear it
to your royal wedding.

833
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,960
Gosh, Mom. Don't get ahead of yourself.

834
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:08,720
But I actually have my eyes on
this famous designer's wedding dress.

835
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,240
That's great. You are amazing.

836
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,240
I'm your daughter after all.

837
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:15,840
What a sweet talker.

838
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:21,240
By the way, should I apply
for a visa to Vieng…

839
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,320
What's it called again?

840
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:26,200
Viengkongkhum?

841
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,880
What's the name again, Mom?

842
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,280
I don't know.

843
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,120
Honey.

844
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:35,440
Which country is the prince from again?

845
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,240
Viengphukhum.

846
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,360
Yes, Viengphukhum.

847
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:44,400
Don't you want to marry
into the Jutathep family anymore?

848
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,600
Someone with distant royal blood

849
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:49,080
is no match for an actual prince.

850
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:50,600
Am I right, Mom?

851
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,440
Am I smart?

852
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:54,440
You got your intelligence from me.

853
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:57,520
You don't need a visa
to go to Viengphukhum.

854
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:59,960
Thai people can visit
Viengphukhum visa-free.

855
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:01,920
That's great then.

856
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,440
It will be easy to get there.

857
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,720
You want to marry him,

858
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,880
but you don't even know where he's from.

859
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,400
You always have to criticize, don't you?

860
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,400
Let's get back to the necklace.

861
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:15,360
- Great idea.
- Which one do you like?

862
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:16,800
- How beautiful.
- What do you think?

863
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,760
- I like these earrings.
- Let's try them on.

864
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:22,040
- Let's see.
- Let me look in the mirror.

865
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:38,560
Are you sure about this?

866
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,920
You are aware of the consequences
if you screw up, aren't you?

867
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,040
I've been waiting for
this opportunity my whole life, Sun.

868
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,160
It might be our only chance.

869
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,240
I refuse to let the world
condemn my family any longer.

870
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:56,040
But it's very dangerous.

871
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,840
I have no choice.

872
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:03,480
I'm the last in my family line.

873
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,200
Only descendants of my great-grandparents
have the power to remove the curse.

874
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,240
Tomorrow, I'm going to the palace
to discuss the event with Mr. Phu.

875
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,200
We will come up

876
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,400
with a plan later.

877
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,040
Remind me later.

878
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:42,960
Hello.

879
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:47,760
Vit told me

880
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:50,880
Phu's new secretary looks like an angel.

881
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,120
But I think

882
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,560
you are prettier than any angel.

883
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:56,760
What?

884
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:02,040
I'm Captain M.L. Ronnajak Jutathep.

885
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,760
It's nice to meet you,

886
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,760
Ms. Laorchan Pundheva.

887
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:08,520
Likewise.

888
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:11,520
And I am

889
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,360
Pilot Officer M.L. Ronnapoom Jutathep.

890
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,280
Hey, hold it.

891
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,800
- What's going on, Jak?
- Phu.

892
01:05:23,640 --> 01:05:26,520
I haven't introduced her to you,
yet you already knew her name.

893
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,800
Of course.

894
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:31,160
I need to do my research
before meeting such a beautiful lady.

895
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:45,680
Let go of her hand already, Poom.

896
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,640
Let's go inside, Laor.
It's not safe out here.

897
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:53,400
Please excuse me.

898
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,600
Phu, you are being overprotective.

899
01:05:58,240 --> 01:05:59,880
Gosh.

900
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:08,720
I've reserved this zone here

901
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,520
for the guest of honor.

902
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,160
So what time will the ceremony end?

903
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,320
At around 10:09 a.m.

904
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,720
We only have 30 minutes, right?

905
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,880
This is a rough layout of Jutathep Palace.

906
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:22,760
Location 2
is the library where the safe is.

907
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:24,960
The plan to steal the sapphire third eye.

908
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,240
I, Colonel Wachira Wongsawan,

909
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,560
<i>love Kan with all of my heart.</i>

910
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:34,880
- Here.
