1
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,000
Only then will Anodard Pond be revealed.

2
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,040
What are you discussing?

3
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,880
Prince Siwilai moved to Pailin.

4
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,520
The temple we are looking for
is the Three Pagoda Temple in Pailin.

5
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,160
Where did the gunshot come from?

6
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,400
The forest Mr. Phu and Laor entered.

7
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,200
Freeze! Drop the gun.

8
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,120
Sun!

9
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,280
Do you have any idea

10
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,400
how devastated I was
when I thought you were dead?

11
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,920
You guys get some rest.

12
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,480
Yes, sir.

13
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,080
It's late, Your Highness.
You should sleep.

14
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,400
We have a long journey tomorrow.

15
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,040
There's no need to be so formal, Veena.

16
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,640
Talk to me like when we were kids.

17
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,240
I was young then.
I didn't know any better.

18
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,200
I might've said inappropriate things.

19
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,720
I'm grown up now.

20
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
I know now what I should and shouldn't do.

21
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,720
What you should do now is sleep.

22
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,600
How can I do that

23
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,680
when you still won't go to bed?

24
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,960
I have things to think about.

25
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,960
From now on,

26
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,400
I'm going to visit
more people in remote areas.

27
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,200
I'll go all over the country.

28
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,560
I'll be right by your side
wherever you go, Your Highness.

29
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,960
No matter how rough the journey may be.

30
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,240
Will you come just as my bodyguard

31
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,440
and nothing more?

32
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,560
Well…

33
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,480
That's my job, Your Highness.

34
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,760
Maybe I spent too long studying abroad.

35
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,760
You must've forgotten

36
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,880
what you said to me over ten years ago.

37
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,240
When you went to study in England,

38
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,960
I was just a kid.

39
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,360
Did I say something to you?

40
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,960
You didn't say it.

41
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,320
You shouted it.

42
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,800
You shouted,

43
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,920
"I want to be your bodyguard.

44
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,880
I want to marry you."

45
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,960
Mee.

46
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,880
What did you just call me, Tiny?

47
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,120
Mee, stop it.

48
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,560
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

49
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,120
Gosh. I'm getting sleepy.

50
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,320
Please excuse me.

51
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,760
I think that

52
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,920
we can give some food to the villagers.

53
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,840
-It should help.
-Mr. Phu.

54
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,560
I brought you coffee.

55
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,480
-What do you think?
-Thank you.

56
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,680
How much food do you want to give them?

57
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,960
How much food do you want to give them?

58
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,600
Are you looking for someone?

59
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,160
Is it Sun?

60
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,080
Yes.

61
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,080
Is he coming with us?

62
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,760
Why do you look so uncomfortable with it?

63
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,600
I'm not uncomfortable.

64
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,600
I'm okay. I'm fine.

65
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,720
I'm absolutely fine with it.

66
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,040
I just don't get why

67
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,080
he keeps following you around

68
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,320
when he's just a friend.

69
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,920
You don't have to worry.

70
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,760
I already told Sun not to come with us.

71
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,000
Really?

72
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,320
I'm so happy that you did that for me.

73
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,160
I did what I did

74
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,280
for other reasons.

75
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,080
I just don't want Sun to get
in trouble because of me again.

76
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,680
So,

77
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,080
did he agree?

78
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,440
Yes.

79
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,680
He's

80
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,640
not stubborn like someone else I know.

81
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,080
Thank you so much

82
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,360
for sharing your supplies with us.

83
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,960
We'll never forget
what you have done for us.

84
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,720
It's no problem.

85
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
We're all citizens of Viengphukhum.

86
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,920
We must help one another.

87
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,920
We wish you the best of luck.

88
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,680
-Travel safe.
-Thank you.

89
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,040
Where are you guys going anyway?

90
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,760
Pailin.

91
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,080
The main road is cut off.

92
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,360
Several days ago,

93
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,160
there was a storm in Mangaew.

94
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,520
There was a flash flood.

95
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,640
Large trees fell
on the road in many places.

96
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,160
Your vehicles won't reach Pailin.

97
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,600
You need to pass through
Mangaew to get there.

98
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,520
If we can't use the main road,

99
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,960
we'll take another route.

100
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,520
Do you mean we have to walk there?

101
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,520
Do you have any advice for us?

102
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,159
It's safer for you
to go around the mountain,

103
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,000
but the journey will take about ten days.

104
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,120
If you want to reach
your destination faster,

105
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,640
you must head towards Pha Ngai
and pass through Sansambai village.

106
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,600
Is that a good idea?

107
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,960
What's the problem, Elder Khumtai?

108
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,160
Is it difficult to get there?

109
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,560
In that case,

110
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,320
will you tell me

111
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,960
how we can get there?

112
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,280
Go around this mountain.

113
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,920
This way is the shortcut.

114
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,720
Pha Ngai is here.

115
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,680
Sansambai is here,

116
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,880
just beyond Pha Ngai.

117
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,720
If you want to take this route,

118
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
just go straight.

119
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,520
Doctor!

120
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,960
Hi, everyone.

121
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,960
Chat.

122
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,960
How did you get here?

123
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,480
Is it really you?

124
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,320
You're really here.

125
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,800
Now we have a doctor.

126
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,000
I feel much safer already.

127
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,160
Gosh.

128
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,040
You see, Poom told us that

129
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,960
you guys are heading to Pailin
on an important mission.

130
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,560
So I rushed here.

131
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,400
Poom said that

132
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,680
your team could use someone like me.

133
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,280
He thinks we need a doctor?

134
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,440
Should I be happy or worried?

135
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,760
It's because Poom knows

136
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,760
that this journey is dangerous.

137
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,320
That's why we need a doctor on our team.

138
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,240
We actually thought about this.

139
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,840
Having the royal physician on our team

140
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,920
would draw people's attention to us.

141
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,880
This mission is top secret.

142
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,120
We can't have anyone knowing about it.

143
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,080
Don't worry.

144
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,920
You don't have a royal physician,

145
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,800
but now you have me.

146
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,760
Let me know if I can help with anything.

147
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,000
I came prepared.

148
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,080
I heard that the King and the Queen

149
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,200
visited Pailin a few years ago.

150
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,800
The way there is so treacherous.

151
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,480
I wonder how they got there.

152
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,480
They rode in a car,

153
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,480
then rode on a wagon,

154
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,720
and got there on horseback.

155
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
On horseback?

156
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,360
Stop!

157
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,360
Stop right there!

158
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:52,920
Sun.

159
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,160
Everybody, get down!

160
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,720
My gosh!

161
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,880
Sun.

162
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,240
Are you okay?

163
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,080
What are you doing here?

164
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,880
Elder Khumtai sent me to warn you

165
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,040
that it may be faster to take this route

166
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,720
to Pailin,

167
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,120
but it's very dangerous.

168
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,280
The bandits and the rebels
plant bombs on this route

169
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,640
to kill local officials.

170
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,440
You saw what happened.

171
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,000
The elder sent me to protect you.

172
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,840
Thank you so much, Sun,

173
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,280
but we have several soldiers with us.

174
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,960
We are all trained at bomb disposal.

175
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,800
We don't want to trouble you.

176
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,160
These bombs aren't just threats.

177
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,960
They're meant to kill you.

178
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,440
Only locals are able to tell
where those guys

179
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,920
might've planted the bombs.

180
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,960
You can't get this information from books.

181
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,360
Sun.

182
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,720
I don't want you
to risk your life for us again.

183
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,840
Everyone here is risking their life, Laor.

184
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,960
Mr. Phu and the doctor

185
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,360
aren't even from Viengphukhum,

186
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,200
yet they're here.

187
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,840
I was born and raised here.

188
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,520
Can I not help to protect my own country?

189
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,760
But…

190
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,560
If my being here

191
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,160
makes everyone uncomfortable,

192
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,920
I understand.

193
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,400
If you think
you don't need me on this mission,

194
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,600
I'll leave.

195
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,120
But without your help,

196
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,440
the explosion earlier

197
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,320
would've blown us and our cars to pieces.

198
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,400
I need Sun on my team.

199
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,160
We have to leave the cars here.

200
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,720
How far away is Sansambai?

201
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,400
According to the elder,

202
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,560
we have to walk down this path
for about 2 km.

203
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,200
If you want to take a shortcut
through the village to Pha Ngai,

204
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,440
we have to go on foot

205
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,760
because the area is full of steep cliffs.

206
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,600
It's pretty risky.

207
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,520
Right.

208
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,520
No wonder

209
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,840
the elder seemed hesitant

210
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,960
when he suggested that we take this route.

211
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,360
In that case, we should get
to the village before dark.

212
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,600
Wachira.

213
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,800
Take only our tents,
our supplies, and necessities.

214
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,760
From this point,
we'll go on foot to Pailin.

215
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,680
Radio the nearest military base

216
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,040
to come and get the cars and Sun's horse.

217
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,840
Have the drivers wait here
until the soldiers arrive.

218
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,320
Yes, sir.

219
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,760
I'll prepare the medicine we might need.

220
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,720
Let's go.

221
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,880
Are you good?

222
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,160
I'm good. You?

223
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,080
I'm okay.

224
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,640
Come on. Let's keep moving.

225
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,400
Let's go. Let me help.

226
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,640
It's all right, Mr. Phu.

227
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
I can manage.

228
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,560
Okay.

229
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,320
-Be careful.
-Come on, Laor.

230
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,960
I'm fine, Sun.

231
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,360
Gosh.

232
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,280
Laor.

233
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,720
Well…

234
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,480
I'm fine now.

235
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,880
Thanks for your help.

236
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,160
-I think we're at this point here.
-Right.

237
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,200
Hey.

238
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,520
A gunshot.

239
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,280
The village should be close.

240
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,080
Let's hide behind that bush.

241
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,440
Come on.

242
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,520
Careful, Laor.

243
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,920
Gosh.

244
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,480
I hope this isn't a bandit's den.

245
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,840
The elder would've warned us.

246
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,960
Does anyone know

247
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,640
where the gunshot came from?

248
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,120
Gosh.

249
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,440
I don't know.

250
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,680
I just know they're coming closer to us.

251
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,000
Find her. We must catch her.

252
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,040
If she resists, kill her. Let's split up.

253
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,800
My gosh.

254
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,720
Gosh!

255
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,920
Who are you people?

256
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,400
Gosh!

257
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,000
-Damn it.
-Gosh.

258
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,360
Gosh. What's all this?

259
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,960
Who are these guys?

260
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,680
Elder Khumtai was right

261
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,560
for pointing you to our village.

262
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,120
All the other roads are blocked.

263
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,080
The elder and I are close friends.

264
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,240
We hunted down illegal loggers together

265
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,760
on several occasions.

266
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,160
Huean.

267
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,480
Were you guys out hunting animals?

268
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,480
I wish it were an animal.

269
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,520
At least we could see it then.

270
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,560
That's not the case, though.

271
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,120
So what were you hunting

272
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,480
if not an animal?

273
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,280
-An ogre.
-An ogre.

274
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
What?

275
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,240
An ogre?

276
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,720
Like in the movies?

277
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,720
Do they exist?

278
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,720
-Yes.
-Yes.

279
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,280
Nhu See is possessed by a demon.

280
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,560
We tied her up,

281
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,960
but she escaped.

282
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,560
She's probably out in the woods
eating deer's guts right now.

283
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,440
All our pigs and chickens are dead.

284
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,440
-She killed them all.
-Right.

285
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,440
What makes you think Nhu See did it?

286
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,280
She never sleeps at night.

287
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,440
People see her standing
outside their house shaking.

288
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,280
She has hollow eyes and yellow skin.

289
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,040
She can't find anything to eat,
so she wants to eat our guts

290
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,280
like she did her husband and kid.

291
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,400
Gosh.

292
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,120
Earlier this month,

293
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,240
the villagers saw the bodies
of her husband and her kid in the woods

294
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,880
with their guts spilling out.

295
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,400
Nhu See had their blood on her body.

296
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,440
Some said she still had their guts

297
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,280
in her mouth when they saw her.

298
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,680
Seriously.

299
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,680
So these people,

300
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,600
did they actually see what happened?

301
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,960
Or did they just hear about it?

302
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,680
Come on.

303
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,240
Everyone was talking about it.
Of course they saw it.

304
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,040
Right.

305
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,440
My cousin was once possessed.

306
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,160
We had to ask a monk
to come and bless the whole village.

307
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,640
Do you remember Aunt Suk?

308
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,680
Gosh. Of course I remember.

309
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,120
No one dared go out at night.

310
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,720
They just hid in their beds.

311
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,080
It's true.

312
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,040
Can this be real?

313
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,480
Have you seen it?

314
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,040
Before we discuss
whether ogres exist or not,

315
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,520
I think we should go and wash ourselves.

316
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,320
My whole body is itching.

317
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,440
All right.
The ladies can wash up at the well.

318
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,840
The men can go to the lake over there.

319
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,200
Thank you.

320
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,960
Let's go, guys.

321
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,960
An ogre?

322
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,560
I really need to wash up.

323
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,280
What are ogres like?

324
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,280
They're like what he just said.
They're really scary.

325
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,760
Gosh.

326
00:21:59,120 --> 00:21:59,960
Okay.

327
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,480
Hey, Mr. Chat.

328
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,760
I thought you went with Mr. Phu.

329
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,160
This is for you.

330
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,120
-What?
-It's from Kan.

331
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,560
-I see.
-She knew I was coming here,

332
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,480
so she made these for you.

333
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,720
Thank you for bringing
this for me, Mr. Chat.

334
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,760
Kan would kill me if I didn't.

335
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,800
She kept reminding me

336
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,400
to be careful with it
and not to break what's inside.

337
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,080
Thank you.

338
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,440
Are you sure

339
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,760
you didn't break it?

340
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,400
I'm itchy. I'll go and bathe.

341
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,720
Right.

342
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,240
Hey.

343
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:01,800
What are you doing?

344
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,200
Mr. Chat.

345
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,560
Kan also sent you a hug.

346
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,160
Right. I'm going.

347
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,000
Thank goodness

348
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,360
she didn't send me a kiss.

349
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,560
My dear Colonel, it's been
a long time since we last spoke.

350
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,600
Where are you now on your journey?

351
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,600
MY DEAR COLONEL

352
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,160
It's torture not knowing
how your loved one is doing.

353
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,200
I hope that you're doing well
wherever you are.

354
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,000
May God keep you all safe

355
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,520
and help you complete your mission.

356
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,280
I asked Chat to bring you
your favorite meringues.

357
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,440
We first met over these meringues.

358
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,840
Do you remember?

359
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,560
WE FIRST MET OVER THESE MERINGUES

360
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,200
Mr. Phu.

361
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,360
Mr. Phu.

362
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,920
I--

363
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,120
-Wait.
-Hey.

364
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,200
Are you a thief?

365
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,640
-Get out!
-Wait. Stop.

366
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,840
Damn it.

367
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,080
Hey.

368
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,080
Wait. I can explain.

369
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,400
I--

370
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,880
Are you a thief?

371
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,800
Stop.

372
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,920
-Stop screaming.
-Let go of me!

373
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,120
Help! Somebody help me!

374
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,560
-Let me go!
-Stop screaming.

375
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,240
Come on.

376
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,720
What are you two doing?

377
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,120
Phu.

378
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,280
Phu!

379
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,200
Phu, he's a thief.

380
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,200
Call the police.

381
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,000
Are you crazy?

382
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,080
A thief?

383
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,320
He's not a thief, Kan.

384
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,640
Take a good look at him.

385
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,600
Don't you recognize him?

386
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,680
Don't you remember him?

387
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,800
This is Wachira.

388
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,640
He's Uncle Joi's son.

389
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,800
Take a good look.

390
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,880
You mean that scrawny kid that looked like

391
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,720
a walking stick?

392
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,680
That's right.

393
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,560
So you're Kan?

394
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,800
You were that chubby kid
with frizzy hair, right?

395
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,240
Gosh.

396
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,440
So when did Ms. Kan get here?

397
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,280
This morning.

398
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,560
She went straight to the kitchen to bake.

399
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,760
Let's have coffee and snacks
while we wait for the prince.

400
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,800
Try the meringues.
Kan just made them. They're delicious.

401
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,560
-They really are.
-I know.

402
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,000
They're incredible.

403
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,040
Gosh.

404
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,560
You've had tons of them.

405
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,360
Of course they're delicious.

406
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,920
Excuse me.

407
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,840
It's good.

408
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,680
Love and miss you always.

409
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,680
Kan.

410
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,600
Hey, there.

411
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:07,000
Hey, Huean.

412
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,400
What are the branches for?

413
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,360
We use jujube branches to trap ogres.

414
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,640
When Nhu See comes back,

415
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,160
we'll kill her.

416
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,640
By the way,

417
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,520
you should go back to your tent.

418
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,160
Get changed then come and eat with us.

419
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,600
Hurry.

420
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
All right.

421
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,720
Watch out for Nhu See.

422
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,960
Hey, Phu.

423
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,240
Will you be done soon?

424
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,520
The others are at the lake.

425
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,200
I've just finished.

426
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,280
I'll take off now.

427
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,280
Wait.

428
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,000
It's kind of creepy here.

429
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,440
Can you stay with us?

430
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,920
Are you afraid of ghosts, Captain?

431
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,120
Come on, Veena.

432
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,560
We should let
Mr. Phu and Mr. Chat go and bathe.

433
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,640
You have me.

434
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,160
Also, you're handy with a gun.

435
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,520
We'll be fine.

436
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,760
Ghosts aren't afraid of guns.

437
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,320
-Gosh.
-Right.

438
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,400
Don't be scared.
There's no such thing as ghosts.

439
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,240
Come on, Chat.

440
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,920
These ladies need us.

441
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,360
We're gentlemen.

442
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,480
It's our duty to protect them.

443
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,240
Let's stay with them.

444
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,360
Let's go.

445
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,040
My gosh. Look at you.

446
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,440
You're so charming.

447
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,200
No girl could turn you down.

448
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,840
I'm impressed, Phu.

449
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,160
Tell me what other moves
M.L. Phuthaneth has

450
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,600
to win a girl's heart.

451
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,760
Gosh.

452
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,880
Girls these days.

453
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,320
They're easily frightened.

454
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,960
It's fine, Chat.

455
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,040
Thank you, Mr. Phu and Dr. Chat.

456
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,280
Slow down, Veena.

457
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,960
What's with them?

458
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,640
They're done already?

459
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,320
Are they that scared?

460
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,360
Let's go and bathe.

461
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,200
I don't think it's just
Laorchan and Veena who are scared.

462
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,600
I think all the villagers
are scared of ghosts.

463
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,040
Back in med school,
we used to spend all day with corpses.

464
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,760
I never saw anything spooky.

465
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,720
But my friends did.

466
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,880
Some actually saw ghosts.

467
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,720
Some saw shadows.

468
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,880
Some only heard voices.

469
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,960
Chat.

470
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,680
-What?
-Did you hear something?

471
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,040
Hear what?

472
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,360
My gosh.

473
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,200
Don't tell me you're scared too.

474
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,520
It's probably the sound
of animals in the forest.

475
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,760
Animals?

476
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,000
Yes.

477
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,120
You're such a scaredy-cat, Phu.

478
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,880
I dropped my towel.

479
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,160
Be careful, Chat.

480
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,640
I know.

481
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,680
What is it?

482
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,840
I got you.

483
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,680
Damn it, Chat.
This is no time to be joking.

484
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,080
You must be really scared, Phu.

485
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,200
All right.

486
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,680
Hey.

487
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,440
What? What the hell?

488
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,640
Come on, Chat.

489
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,200
You can't fool me twice.

490
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,720
I won't fall for it this time.

491
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,720
Gosh.

492
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,400
Hey.

493
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,360
Huh?

494
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,320
What are you playing at?

495
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,560
We only have fish and bamboo shoots.

496
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,840
Like I told you,

497
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,760
all our pigs and chickens are dead.

498
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,200
Is there any news about Nhu See, Huean?

499
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,920
Hurry, Chat.

500
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,760
Mr. Phu!

501
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,400
Mr. Phu. Mr. Chat. What's the matter?

502
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Why were you running?

503
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,600
Don't tell me

504
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,080
you saw a ghost.

505
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,440
Did you see a ghost?

506
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,640
Bees.

507
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,320
Was it bees or hornets?

508
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,760
-Hornets.
-Hornets.

509
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,080
You see, we went out

510
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,640
to get dressed under a tree.

511
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,480
And there was

512
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,520
a hornet's nest.

513
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,200
The hornets thought
we wanted to set their nest on fire.

514
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,680
Isn't that right, Chat?

515
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,240
Right.

516
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,280
The hornets attacked us,

517
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,960
so we ran all the way here.

518
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:32,160
That's right.

519
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,120
What a relief.

520
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,960
I thought Nhu See came back here.

521
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,720
We've formed a team to hunt her down.

522
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,160
She wouldn't dare return.

523
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,480
Well, come and sit with us and eat.

524
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,680
-All right.
-Have a seat.

525
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,520
Here are the plates.

526
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,040
All right.

527
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,960
Have some water, Mr. Phu.

528
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,320
Thanks.

529
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,320
Sure.

530
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,600
Mr. Phu.

531
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,520
Well…

532
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,680
I'm thirsty.

533
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,560
Here, Mr. Chat.

534
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,400
Here, Chat.

535
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,240
Easy there.

536
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,760
Jeez.

537
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,920
It's just me.

538
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,400
We should've taken a proper look

539
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,639
to see if it really was a ghost.

540
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,000
True.

541
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,120
Could that be

542
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,880
the woman named Nhu See

543
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,840
and not an ogre?

544
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,400
If that was her,
she didn't look all there.

545
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,000
She looked half dead.

546
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,679
Whether it was a human,
a ghost, or a half-dead woman,

547
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,480
we should've found out for sure

548
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,920
instead of running away.

549
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,760
You're right.

550
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,080
But…

551
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,240
it's not too late to find out.

552
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,520
-Let's go.
-Okay.

553
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,320
Chat.

554
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,120
Men like us aren't scared of anything.

555
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,520
-Let's do this.
-Let's go.

556
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,920
Is it what I think it is?

557
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,440
Where did she go?

558
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,440
Gosh.

559
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,080
My leg's stuck on something.

560
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,520
It's really stuck.

561
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,360
I need to free my leg.

562
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,720
Let me free my leg from her grasp.

563
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,520
Hey, she's burning up.

564
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,120
She has a fever.

565
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,760
She's alive. She's not a ghost.

566
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,160
Could it be…

567
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
-Nhu See?
-Nhu See?

568
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,160
She must be Nhu See.

569
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,920
Poor thing.

570
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,600
She's been beaten all over her body.

571
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,000
How is she, Chat?

572
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,960
She has a high fever.

573
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,520
It looks like she has malaria.

574
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,640
Can you treat her?

575
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,160
I have mefloquine with me.

576
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,760
I'll try giving her some.

577
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,960
If her symptoms improve,
we're on the right track.

578
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,360
What if it's not malaria?

579
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,360
Sir.

580
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,760
Huean and the villagers

581
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,920
are coming here to take Nhu See away.

582
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,320
What?

583
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,240
What's going on?

584
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,280
Someone saw Nhu See around here.

585
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,920
Where are you hiding her?

586
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,960
We're not hiding her.

587
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,640
She's unconscious inside the tent.

588
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,120
Let's go get her.

589
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,400
Tie her up with the jujube branches.

590
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,320
Ogres can't stand them.

591
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,120
They will drive the spirit out of Nhu See.

592
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,440
Hurry up and get her.
Don't let her get away.

593
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,120
Wait. Stop.

594
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,160
Hey.

595
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,200
Excuse me, ma'am.

596
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,640
Nhu See won't go anywhere.

597
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,360
She can barely open her eyes.

598
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,480
That ogre is very devious.

599
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,280
Even Granny's guardian spirit

600
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,680
couldn't defeat it.

601
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,240
Nhu See is just sick. She isn't possessed.

602
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,440
What do you mean?

603
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,520
She has pale skin and trembling lips
and a rabid look on her face.

604
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,080
She has malaria.

605
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,600
What is that? I've never heard of it.

606
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,920
Go get Nhu See.

607
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,200
-Hey, stop.
-No.

608
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,120
You can't move her when she's sick.

609
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,640
She lives in my village.

610
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,080
I have the right to take her away.

611
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,560
But Nhu See is now Dr. Chat's patient.

612
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,720
Do you want to die?

613
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,480
Stop. Put your guns down.

614
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
Put them down.

615
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,160
Right now.

616
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,040
Please let us try.

617
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,240
Let Dr. Chat try treating Nhu See first.

618
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,920
I only need three days.

619
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,960
We'll take turns watching over her.

620
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,920
We won't let her leave the tent.

621
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,200
If she doesn't get better,

622
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,840
we'll accept that
she's possessed by a demon.

623
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,400
We'll hand her over to you.

624
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,520
If you don't trust us,

625
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,040
you can come watch her during the day

626
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,040
or send someone to keep watch over her.

627
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,640
Do we have a deal?

628
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,800
I'll give you three days.

629
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,720
Let's go.

630
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,280
We only have three days.

631
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,240
Can we really change their beliefs?

632
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,280
I'm not trying to do that.

633
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,960
I just want them to understand
that Nhu See is sick.

634
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,240
She isn't possessed by
some supernatural spirit,

635
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,800
and her condition can be treated.

636
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,400
You need to find a way
to cure Nhu See fast, Chat.

637
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,960
She needs to be able to talk
at the very least.

638
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,960
We must convince the villagers
that Nhu See is really sick

639
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,800
and that she's gradually getting better

640
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,320
after taking the medicine.

641
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,400
She should recover soon

642
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,960
with medication every six hours.

643
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,080
She can get food, water,
and medicine if she stays here.

644
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,320
She won't be homeless.

645
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,120
Right.

646
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,160
I just gave her
her first dose of medicine.

647
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,520
I'll give the second dose
to her in six hours.

648
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,560
If Nhu See doesn't get better

649
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,120
after three days,

650
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,480
we'll have to hand her over

651
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,320
to Huean as we agreed.

652
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,360
And we must leave right away.

653
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,680
The villagers may be angry with us

654
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,760
for stopping them from catching the ogre.

655
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,800
It could set us back

656
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,920
and hamper our mission.

657
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,600
I'm happy to see that
the people in Khammouane district

658
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,040
are well and happy.

659
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,840
To be honest, I didn't agree
with your decision to go there.

660
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,320
That place used to be a rebel base.

661
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,240
Some of them might be hiding
among the villagers.

662
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Though they're rebels,

663
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,960
they're still my people.

664
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,920
I have to treat everyone equally.

665
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,560
Have you heard
from Satarasamee, Prince Anucha?

666
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,080
The military base in
Pha Ngai just sent word

667
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,440
that at the moment,

668
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,440
they are heading to Sansambai village.

669
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,040
If nothing goes wrong,

670
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:37,160
they should reach Three Pagoda Temple
within three or four days.

671
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,520
Thank you.

672
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,920
You should get some rest.

673
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,760
I'll visit the people
in Phuchampa tomorrow.

674
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,880
My brother.

675
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,880
That's where the rebels' hideout is.

676
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,560
It's dangerous.

677
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,840
That's why I have to go there.

678
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,880
I want to reassure people

679
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,080
that I haven't abandoned them.

680
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,080
King Rangsimun.

681
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,480
You've visited your people
for several days straight.

682
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,640
You should rest.

683
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,240
Then we can announce
the schedule of your visit.

684
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,560
What do you think?

685
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,520
I'd prefer to go there unannounced.

686
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,360
I want to see

687
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,560
if the government officials
are doing their jobs well.

688
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,120
Let's go.

689
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,600
Are you sure it's malaria, Chat?

690
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,320
Yes.

691
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,600
Her fever has come down
and her overall condition is better,

692
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,440
but she's still weak.

693
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,160
I hope Nhu See gets better tomorrow.

694
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,160
Nhu See!

695
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,280
Come out right now!

696
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,480
Let's drag her out!

697
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,920
-Come out!
-You fiend!

698
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,360
-Come on, guys.
-Come out, Nhu See.

699
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,560
Come out.

700
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:00,080
Stop right there.

701
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,440
-I'll kill you, Nhu See!
-Wait.

702
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,720
Get out of my way!

703
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,760
Calm down.

704
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,040
Calm down, Huean.

705
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:09,200
Let's talk about this.

706
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,440
The day hasn't ended yet.

707
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,480
You can't take Nhu See away.

708
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,760
My daughter Mai

709
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,400
suddenly started acting like Nhu See.

710
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,560
Nhu See must've let the spirit

711
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,840
possess my kid out of spite.

712
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,680
You demon! Come out!

713
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,400
Stop it right now!

714
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,840
Stop it, everyone.

715
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,760
Nhu See, you evil ogre!

716
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,920
I'll kill you with my own hands today.

717
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,800
That's enough, Huean.

718
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,800
I'm not an ogre.

719
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,120
Huean, Nhu See can talk normally now.

720
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,560
Dr. Chat has been giving her medicine.

721
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:50,840
Of course she's better.

722
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,000
She got better

723
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,320
because the demon left her body
and possessed Mai instead.

724
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:59,040
My kid is now shaking with a fever,

725
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,400
just like she was.

726
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,960
-You fiend!
-That's right.

727
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:02,960
What did you say?

728
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,960
Does Mai have the same condition?

729
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,720
Could it be that

730
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,400
she also has malaria?

731
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:14,720
What's malaria, Huean?

732
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,600
I don't know.

733
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,280
We need to lock her up in a cage
made of jujube branches

734
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,360
and beat her until
the demon leaves her body.

735
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,880
-Right.
-That's right.

736
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,240
Look at her.

737
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,720
She's clearly possessed.

738
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,680
Right.

739
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,200
Please don't beat Mai
like you did Nhu See, Huean.

740
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:41,120
Please don't lock her up
in a cage with jujube branches.

741
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:42,480
I'm begging you.

742
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,760
But Mai's possessed by a demon, Granny.

743
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,920
Even your guardian spirit
couldn't help cure her.

744
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,640
How can we let her roam free?

745
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,000
That's right.

746
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,240
If we don't lock her up,
she'll come to eat our guts.

747
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,480
That's right.

748
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:58,520
Huean.

749
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,400
Mai isn't possessed.

750
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,800
What do you mean?
You were going to kill Nhu See earlier

751
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,120
for sending the demon to possess Mai.

752
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,480
Her temperature is 39 degrees Celsius.

753
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,440
I'll give her an antipyretic first.

754
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,360
If my kid dies,
who will take responsibility?

755
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,120
Huean.

756
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:23,360
You have two options.

757
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,760
The first option is
to let Dr. Chat treat Mai.

758
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,440
She might get better.

759
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:31,720
The second option is to let the demon
eat the insides of your kid.

760
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,600
It's your choice.

761
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,040
Dad.

762
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,160
Dad.

763
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,200
Mai, you poor girl.

764
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:48,120
What did we do to deserve this?

765
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,880
It's going to be okay, dear.

766
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,440
Please give her medicine, doctor.

767
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,880
I don't know what else to do.

768
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,280
If Mai isn't better by tomorrow,

769
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,840
you must lock her up
in a cage of jujube branches

770
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,240
like you did Nhu See.

771
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,840
-Right.
-That's right.

772
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,320
We'll ask Kaew from Kokkong to come here

773
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,800
to beat Mai and drive the demon away.

774
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,920
-That's right.
-Right.

775
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,040
Let's go, guys.

776
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,400
-Let's go.
-Mai.

777
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,440
Please don't die, Mai.

778
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,760
-Here you go.
-Take the medicine, dear.

779
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,040
Drink up.

780
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:37,640
My poor girl.

781
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:47,400
Are we almost at Pandao village,
Prince Anucha?

782
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

783
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,040
The village isn't far from here.

784
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,640
Once this paved road ends,

785
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,680
we'll reach the most rugged path

786
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,840
in Phuchampa district.

787
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:00,160
Why doesn't this road lead
all the way to the village?

788
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,400
Goodness.

789
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,240
-Watch out.
-My gosh.

790
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,520
Get down.

791
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:13,560
Follow me.

792
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,600
Hold on.

793
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:18,920
What's going on?

794
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,560
We're being ambushed.

795
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,640
What?

796
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,880
You need to hide in the forest.

797
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,840
You stay with them.

798
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,600
Gosh!

799
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,120
Be careful. Hurry.

800
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:42,680
Are you sure

801
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,960
that Nhu See has malaria?

802
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,880
Yes.

803
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,600
Malaria tends to spread
in the border regions

804
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,760
as well as dense forest.

805
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,760
Judging by her symptoms,
I think this is what she has.

806
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,240
This is my fault.

807
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,200
I didn't help them.

808
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:05,600
I didn't know life was so hard for them.

809
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:08,520
This place is only 300 km
from the capital.

810
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,080
Yet they have no health center.

811
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,120
There are no doctors and nurses here.

812
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,160
There are monks

813
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,960
and shamans who can help treat people.

814
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,840
I've seen them cure people
with my own eyes.

815
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,680
Your beliefs can give you faith.

816
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,680
And it's your faith

817
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,800
that gives you hope.

818
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,080
It pushes you to fight

819
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,280
and gives you the courage
to face your pain.

820
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,960
People who are seriously ill

821
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,560
may recover if they have faith.

822
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,840
Beliefs and faith are one thing.

823
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,320
But we can't deny that

824
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:54,480
if the villagers had access to education

825
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,760
and health services like in the capital,

826
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,480
things would be different.

827
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,440
But this can be a good thing.

828
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:04,880
We got to see with our own eyes

829
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,720
the problems people have.

830
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,200
If we ever encounter these problems again,

831
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,760
we'll know the best way to solve them.

832
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:27,160
Hurry.

833
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,480
Be careful.

834
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,920
-Whoa.
-My gosh.

835
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,600
Take cover over there.

836
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:37,520
Let's go.

837
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,560
Hide here.

838
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,040
Gosh!

839
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,040
Stay right here, Your Majesty.

840
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,960
I'll have a look around.

841
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:50,880
Okay.

842
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,880
It's safe, Your Majesty.

843
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,280
All right.

844
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,200
Watch out.

845
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,160
Are you okay?

846
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,280
King Rangsimun.

847
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,400
Careful.

848
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:16,120
No!

849
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,600
Kedsada.

850
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,200
So you're the leader

851
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,960
of the Thapana Association?

852
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,280
Your time as king is over now.

853
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:27,240
Drop the gun.

854
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,080
If you don't want your wife to die,

855
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,280
drop the gun.

856
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,400
King Rangsimun.

857
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:36,080
Kedsada.

858
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,360
Let go of Queen Chanta.

859
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,640
We can talk about this.

860
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:42,760
Drop the gun.

861
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:43,960
I said drop it.

862
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:45,400
Drop it.

863
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,360
Go on.

864
00:51:58,120 --> 00:51:59,200
Do you want to talk?

865
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,880
Like how you want
to talk things out with my friends?

866
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:12,000
All along,

867
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,560
no matter what it was you wanted,

868
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,360
I was always prepared
to negotiate with you.

869
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,160
You know that.

870
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:22,280
Negotiate?

871
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:23,960
All right.

872
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,200
Return the rightful property
of the Manolom dynasty.

873
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:32,600
If it weren't for the Phukhumwong family,

874
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:34,720
who stole the throne from us,

875
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,480
I would now be

876
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,200
King of Viengphukhum,

877
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,720
not you.

878
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,760
My dad was the one

879
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,920
who reclaimed Viengphukhum

880
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,520
from General Segong.

881
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,320
Thapana Association and I could've handled

882
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,000
General Segong ourselves.

883
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,120
Your family

884
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,960
and those Jutathep men

885
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,720
took all the glory for yourselves.

886
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,360
You stole what should have been mine.

887
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:04,840
You grew up in Thailand.

888
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,400
You did nothing for this country.

889
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,160
It was me

890
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:10,760
and my soldiers

891
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:13,960
who fought for Viengphukhum for decades.

892
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,440
The time has come

893
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:19,160
for me to reclaim the throne.

894
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,640
You know very well

895
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:25,920
that you can't do that.

896
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,920
We have palace laws
in place here in Viengphukhum

897
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,880
which can't be violated.

898
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:37,160
With you and Satarasamee dead,

899
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,400
we will be able to defy the royal law.

900
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,880
I'm very sorry

901
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:45,880
that you won't be there

902
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,480
when Viengphukhum has a new king.

903
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,240
This is the end

904
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,480
of the Phukhumwong dynasty.

905
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,680
Let me go!

906
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:55,800
Queen Chanta!

907
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,160
Queen Chanta!

908
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,240
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

909
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:06,040
No.

910
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,520
I want Kedsada alive.

911
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:34,920
I spent years searching
for the leader of Thapana Association.

912
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:38,680
You've finally shown your face.

913
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,600
You traitor.

914
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,560
Anucha, you--

915
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,160
No.

916
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,840
Please don't hurt me.

917
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,040
Why do you want to go to Kokkong?

918
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:09,520
My husband was from Sansambai.

919
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,240
Now that he and my kid are dead,

920
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,400
I want to return home.

921
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,160
You can go once you've eaten.

922
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:21,960
Here.

923
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:23,560
Thank you.

924
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:27,680
Nhu See!

925
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,720
Where did you take my kid?

926
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,400
You bitch.

927
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,480
What now, Huean?

928
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,400
Mai is missing.

929
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,720
You kidnapped my kid, didn't you?

930
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:39,640
Tell me the truth!

931
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,760
Tell me or I'll kill you.

932
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,960
Huean.

933
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,640
Nhu See never left the tent.

934
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:49,320
We took turns to keep an eye on her.

935
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,600
We would've seen

936
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,080
if she'd gone outside.

937
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:57,680
Besides, Nhu See has just
recovered from her illness.

938
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,080
She's too weak

939
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,680
to have kidnapped anyone.

940
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,760
She had the demon do her dirty work.

941
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:04,240
Where did you take my kid?

942
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,640
I can assure you that
Nhu See hasn't left the tent

943
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,200
and Mai isn't here.

944
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:12,240
But for our peace of mind,

945
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,920
we'll help you look for Mai.

946
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,040
If I can't find my kid,

947
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,040
I'll blame it

948
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,600
on you lot.

949
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:21,400
Let go of me!

950
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,600
-Let me go!
-Hey.

951
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,120
Gosh.

952
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,080
You should go back to Kokkong.

953
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,440
It's not safe here.

954
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,240
It's okay, Nhu See.

955
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:47,960
Mai.

956
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,280
Baby.

957
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,400
Where are you?

958
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,840
-Baby.
-Mai.

959
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:53,880
Mai.

960
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:55,440
-Mai.
-Mai.

961
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:56,760
Where are you, Mai?

962
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:58,720
-Mai.
-Daddy's here, Mai.

963
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,240
Mai.

964
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,520
Where are you, Mai?

965
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,480
-Mai.
-Dad's here, Mai.

966
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,840
Where are you?

967
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,960
-Mai.
-Mai.

968
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,240
Where are you, Mai?

969
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,520
That's Mai's.

970
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,000
Why did you leave me so soon, baby?

971
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,400
You must've been in so much pain.

972
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,960
Why couldn't it be me instead?

973
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:56,520
Whichever fiend or evil spirit

974
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,760
did this to my baby,

975
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,840
I damn them

976
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,360
to rot in hell for eternity.

977
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,520
This is all your fault!

978
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,320
You're to blame for this.

979
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,720
Well…

980
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,360
Calm down, Huean.

981
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:29,600
We're sorry about what happened,

982
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,960
but we haven't found Mai yet.

983
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:34,720
She might still be alive.

984
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:36,880
Maybe she's not dead.

985
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,720
Calm down.

986
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,160
If you hadn't stopped me,

987
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,880
Nhu See would be dead by now.

988
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,760
You told me Nhu See was sick

989
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,120
and that you could cure her.

990
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,000
Now look what's happened!

991
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,160
Nhu See isn't the only one
to blame for Mai's death.

992
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,240
You all had a hand in killing her too.

993
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,080
Damn you!

994
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,360
Dad!

995
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,480
-Mai!
-Dad!

996
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,640
Mai.

997
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,440
Mai.

998
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:23,800
Dad.

999
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:29,440
My baby.

1000
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:37,160
This may hurt a little.

1001
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:38,880
That hurts.

1002
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,200
Serves you right.

1003
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:42,000
-You had it coming.
-It hurts.

1004
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,520
Be gentle.

1005
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,680
That hurts.

1006
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,680
You need stitches.

1007
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,680
Maybe about ten stitches.

1008
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,520
Let me find a needle.

1009
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,520
No way, doctor.

1010
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,120
I'll just put some balm on it.

1011
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,120
Go ahead, doctor. Give her 20 stitches.

1012
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,840
We almost killed each other
because of you.

1013
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:09,160
I already told Granny

1014
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,880
I was going to forage for bamboo shoots,

1015
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,840
yanang leaves,

1016
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,840
and some mushrooms

1017
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,680
to make soup for our visitors.

1018
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,800
I wanted to thank them

1019
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,960
for helping me get better.

1020
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,560
You can ask Granny.

1021
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,480
Jeez.

1022
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,560
Granny took some offerings to Kokkong.

1023
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,040
I couldn't ask her.

1024
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:34,160
Gosh.

1025
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:37,320
I want to apologize to all of you.

1026
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,200
I wasn't thinking straight.

1027
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,880
I'm really sorry too.

1028
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,520
I'm sorry.

1029
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,160
How could we not forgive you
after seeing that smile?

1030
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,040
Why were you running?

1031
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,640
That's why you tripped and hurt yourself.

1032
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,520
I was in a hurry.

1033
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,600
She asked me
if she could go into the woods.

1034
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:05,400
I told her she couldn't go,

1035
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,080
but she snuck out anyway.

1036
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:09,600
She ran so fast she fell down.

1037
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,120
What a stubborn child.

1038
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,040
You're such a naughty kid.

1039
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,880
You did the wrong thing,
but your intentions were good.

1040
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:20,680
We forgive you.

1041
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,720
Thank you.

1042
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:23,760
All right.

1043
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,240
Come here, you monkey.

1044
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,760
Dr. Chat.

1045
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:31,640
Give her 20 stitches.

1046
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,320
-Good idea.
-No way.

1047
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,480
How about just ten stitches?

1048
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,880
No. I don't want stitches.

1049
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:39,960
Gosh.

1050
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:41,240
Come here.

1051
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,160
You need stitches.

1052
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:45,000
No, thank you.

1053
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:46,640
What a cheeky girl.

1054
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:54,600
I think

1055
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:56,840
you should rest at the hospital

1056
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,080
for a couple of nights, Prince Anucha.

1057
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,320
I'm fine, Your Majesty.

1058
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:04,960
It's just a minor injury.

1059
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:06,480
All right.

1060
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:08,600
Thank you.

1061
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:10,720
I'm truly thankful.

1062
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:15,000
I will protect both of you with my life.

1063
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,280
Have a seat.

1064
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:26,120
All right.

1065
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,800
I can't believe that

1066
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,640
someone that you trusted like Kedsada

1067
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,520
could be the leader
of Thapana Association.

1068
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:36,400
I know.

1069
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,600
If only I'd had a chance to talk to him,

1070
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,320
he might've opened up to me.

1071
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:44,760
Things would have ended differently.

1072
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:48,160
The rebels have always known

1073
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,400
that you were willing
to negotiate with them.

1074
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:53,880
Yet they never consider it.

1075
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,400
They know that negotiation is pointless,

1076
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,920
since you'll never
give them what they want.

1077
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,440
But on the bright side,

1078
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,760
now that the association has no leader,

1079
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,800
it might reduce conflict
within our country.

1080
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,520
The association could appoint
a new leader.

1081
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:21,040
We still can't let our guard down.

1082
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,720
Your Majesty.

1083
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,640
The military base
in Pha Ngai just radioed us

1084
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:35,400
saying that Colonel Wachira is now
departing Sansambai.

1085
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:49,400
I'll send a doctor to give you
health checkups a few times a year.

1086
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,720
Who are you?

1087
01:03:55,720 --> 01:03:56,680
I am…

1088
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,000
a citizen here just like you.

1089
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,280
I can tell

1090
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,720
that you're a man of power.

1091
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:07,560
If you won't tell me,

1092
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,200
it's fine.

1093
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:10,800
I won't pry.

1094
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,240
Remember, Huean,

1095
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:16,800
if anyone develops symptoms
like Mai and Nhu See had,

1096
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,040
the medicine I gave you can help.

1097
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:21,440
Just read the instructions I left you

1098
01:04:21,520 --> 01:04:23,960
on how to take it
and how to care for patients.

1099
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,360
Thank you for your help

1100
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:27,960
and for the magic potion.

1101
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:30,360
By the way,

1102
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,040
where are you guys heading?

1103
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:35,520
We're heading to
Three Pagoda Temple in Pailin.

1104
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,680
Three Pagoda Temple?

1105
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,040
The way there is very treacherous.

1106
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:44,880
Do you have a guide?

1107
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,080
The path by the swamp

1108
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:48,720
is now impassable.

1109
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:54,160
Has anyone been to Pha Diao Dai Cliff
and Three Pagoda Temple?

1110
01:04:58,560 --> 01:04:59,920
No one's ever been there?

1111
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,320
Can we go there by ourselves?

1112
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:05,720
You'll get lost

1113
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:08,160
before you even go up the cliff.

1114
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,480
The path there is like an enigma.

1115
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,680
You need an experienced guide.

1116
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,360
I've never managed

1117
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,200
to get there myself.

1118
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,240
My husband went there,

1119
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:23,640
but he's dead.

1120
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:27,400
A hunter named Thongchan
has also been there.

1121
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:29,960
Is he here, ma'am?

1122
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,200
He was Nhu See's hubby.

1123
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,880
But

1124
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,880
he just passed away as well.

1125
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,040
What?

1126
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,040
Gosh.

1127
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,520
Why is this so hard?

1128
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:43,960
So…

1129
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,360
How will we get there?

1130
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:47,920
I'll be your guide.

1131
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,880
The forest is cursed.
Whoever enters the forest disappears.

1132
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,080
This is your last chance.

1133
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,120
You either return to the village safely
or go up and risk never returning.

1134
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,040
I'm going up, even if I have to go alone.

1135
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:13,840
Did you cut down vines

1136
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,800
without asking the forest spirits?

1137
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,640
When two people like each other,

1138
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,720
they usually want some privacy.

1139
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:21,400
Are you sure you love me?

1140
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:22,320
Yes.

1141
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,240
It won't follow us.

1142
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,720
I'm here.

1143
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,600
What are you playing at, doctor? Get up.

1144
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,400
