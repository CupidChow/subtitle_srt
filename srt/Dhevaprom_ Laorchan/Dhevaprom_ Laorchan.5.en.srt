1
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,080
Attack on my signal.

2
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,040
Spare no one.

3
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
That's impossible.

4
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,920
What makes you think that?

5
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,960
This book presents
a different perspective of Prince Siwilai

6
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,480
from the time
after he received the sapphire.

7
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,919
We have to move forward.

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,960
I will have that necklace

9
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,160
before the opening of the exhibition.

10
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,120
What's the meaning of this?

11
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,480
You have to give me a chance

12
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,880
You can't introduce me to her

13
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:23,800
for the first time,
and then tell me you are engaged.

14
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,960
Will you be my girlfriend, Laor?

15
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,480
Laor!

16
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,400
Laor.

17
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,720
Laor, are you okay?

18
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,320
Are you hurt?

19
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,360
I didn't do it. It wasn't me.

20
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,440
Laor.

21
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,520
Will he be okay?

22
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,840
You need to calm down.

23
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,160
I'll call the police.

24
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,520
We should get out of here.

25
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,640
Okay?

26
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,600
Mr. Phu.

27
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,480
We…

28
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,960
We're at my place.

29
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,120
You should go.

30
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,320
I think I'm safe now.

31
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,240
No.

32
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,560
What if they follow you here?

33
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,640
What will you do?

34
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,200
I've never had a problem with anyone.

35
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,360
Why are those guys hunting me down?

36
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,840
We don't know who they are,

37
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,760
so we need to be careful.

38
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,400
You put yourself in danger because of me.

39
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,640
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,280
I'm willing to do it.

41
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,600
What happened today made me realize that

42
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,920
every second you spend with loved ones

43
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,040
is precious.

44
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,600
The second after I heard the gunshot,

45
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,280
I could only think about

46
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,160
what I would do

47
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,520
if you got shot.

48
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,600
I realized in that moment

49
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,240
I wouldn't be able to bear it.

50
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
Mr. Phu.

51
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,360
There's a very thin line

52
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,360
between life and death.

53
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,600
So there's no good reason

54
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,080
for us to hide our feelings

55
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,800
from the ones we love.

56
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,840
Before this,

57
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,840
my insecurity held me back.

58
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,080
I was unsure.

59
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,560
I was afraid of getting hurt.

60
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,520
But I no longer care about that.

61
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,040
I just want to let you know that

62
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,800
I love you,

63
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,680
Laorchan.

64
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,240
Mr. Phu.

65
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,800
I think it's too soon.

66
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,560
What's too soon?

67
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,920
This isn't soon enough.

68
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,640
I fell in love with you

69
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,720
the moment I saw you in Paris.

70
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,480
Do you know how happy I was

71
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,160
when I saw you again at my house?

72
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,160
Mr. Phu, I'm still not--

73
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,680
Don't turn me down just yet.

74
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,760
Give me time to make peace with it.

75
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,760
You should go home.

76
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,200
It's late.

77
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
Good night.

78
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,440
Mr. Phu.

79
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,480
When you get home,

80
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,760
can you message me to let me know?

81
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,280
Okay.

82
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,680
Good night.

83
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,200
Good night.

84
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,520
You seem happy.

85
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,240
Sun.

86
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,840
What do you want to know?

87
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,760
I'm a man.

88
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,360
I know how Mr. Phu feels about you.

89
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,440
He loves you.

90
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,600
Am I right?

91
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,960
I'd never thought about it.

92
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,280
Things aren't always the way they seem.

93
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,800
But you're right.

94
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,160
Mr. Phu has feelings for me.

95
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,480
He just told me.

96
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,000
And…

97
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,880
how do you feel about him?

98
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,720
I told you.

99
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,160
I won't think about love

100
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,240
until our mission is complete.

101
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,520
You made him fall in love with you,

102
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,120
so we're halfway there.

103
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,080
But I hope that

104
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,520
this is all just part of the plan

105
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,000
to help us get our hands
on the sapphire third eye

106
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:36,960
and nothing more.

107
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,240
That's the plan.

108
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,280
There's nothing more going on.

109
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,000
Is this color too dark?

110
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,960
I think

111
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,560
it's too dark.

112
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,320
Hey, there.

113
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,280
Phu.

114
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,280
Hey.

115
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,360
You're all here.

116
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,640
Why are you up so late?

117
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,200
I'm picking out a sarong

118
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,040
for the photo shoot tomorrow.

119
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,480
Why were you sneaking in like that?

120
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,640
Something happened today.

121
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,200
I went to see Mr. Wuthichai
to talk about work.

122
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,120
Afterwards,

123
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,840
I was going to take Laorchan home.

124
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,360
However, a gunman suddenly showed up
and started firing at us.

125
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,560
Laorchan and I had to run for our lives.

126
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,360
At least we didn't get hurt.

127
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,840
Wait.

128
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,640
This is crazy.

129
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,280
You can't go around
dodging bullets every day.

130
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,040
Could it be that

131
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,680
they got the wrong girl?

132
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,800
I don't think so.

133
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,920
Tell me the truth.

134
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,360
Does Laorchan have a problem with anyone?

135
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,920
I've asked her
and done a background check on her.

136
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,120
That doesn't seem to be the case.

137
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,440
But I already informed
the police about this.

138
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,760
I'm glad you're both safe.

139
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,360
Is there any good news?

140
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,080
I saw you smiling from
ear to ear when you came in.

141
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,120
Something else must've happened
that made you so happy.

142
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,400
Am I right?

143
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,040
I almost got shot today.

144
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,960
It's no time to be teasing me.

145
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,160
You almost got shot?

146
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,840
It looks like you were struck
by Cupid's arrow.

147
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,240
Love is definitely in the air.

148
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,480
Did you declare your love to someone?

149
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,840
I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed.

150
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,880
Your ears are all red, Phu.

151
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,360
Stop rubbing them.

152
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,080
You'll make them even redder.

153
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,200
Leave me alone.

154
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,520
<i>This is 1152 call center.
What's your number?</i>

155
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,480
3-6-6-3-6-6.

156
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,000
<i>What's your message?</i>

157
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,880
Eagle 3. Space. 2-4. Space. 2-0-4.

158
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,120
Space. 8-2-3.

159
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,960
Goodnight.

160
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,960
Eagle 3 is Mr. Phu.

161
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,720
"2-4.

162
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,520
I'm home.

163
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,280
2-0-4.

164
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,640
I'm safe.

165
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,160
8-2-3. I miss you.

166
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,720
Good night."

167
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,520
Here she is.

168
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
You look beautiful, Mom.

169
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,200
She hasn't changed into her outfit yet.

170
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,600
Imagine how beautiful she will look
when she's all dressed up.

171
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,760
I'm getting old.
I'm not as beautiful as I once was.

172
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,000
You're really beautiful, ma'am.

173
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,360
I'm nervous as I'm worried

174
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,920
that I won't do your beauty justice.

175
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,400
Goodness.

176
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,920
You're a sweet talker.

177
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,480
You'll get a big tip from my dad, Nui.

178
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,480
Right, Mom. I need to get to work.

179
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,960
I have a lot of meetings today.

180
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,240
Hold down the fort for me.
I'll join you once I'm done here.

181
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,200
Mom, once your hair and makeup are done,

182
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,080
come down with Dad.

183
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,080
All right.

184
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,320
- Let's go.
- Okay.

185
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,680
Are you sure

186
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,400
you want to do this?

187
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,440
I'm sure.

188
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,640
I don't have much time.

189
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,880
We need to nip this in the bud.

190
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,320
If you're sure,

191
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,000
we'll do it.

192
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,440
Hello, everyone.

193
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,960
- You're early, Your Highness.
- Hey.

194
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,760
I'm excited

195
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:00,360
to see your mom wearing
the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

196
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,400
She's getting dressed at the house.

197
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,400
She'll be here soon.

198
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,680
All right.

199
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,120
Would you like tea or coffee?

200
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,120
I already had some at home.

201
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,320
I'll go upstairs to check
how the set is looking.

202
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:13,800
Okay.

203
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,800
Ma'am.

204
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,200
Excuse me.

205
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,680
You can't go in there.

206
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,000
Ma'am.

207
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,720
Ma'am. Wait.

208
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,040
Ma'am.

209
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,200
Excuse me.

210
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,680
Hey.

211
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,880
I was wondering who you were.

212
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,120
It's just you, Laor.

213
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,240
You look

214
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,600
stunning today.

215
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,240
Anyway,

216
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,160
when did you change your mind?

217
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,640
When I asked you to come,

218
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,840
you just kept saying no to me.

219
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,520
No one told me you were coming.

220
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,440
By the way,

221
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,080
have you eaten?

222
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,960
Let me get you a hot drink.

223
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,480
Wait for me here.

224
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,640
Well…

225
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,160
The crew should be here soon.

226
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,000
Wait here. I'll be right back.

227
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,440
Hey, Nikom.

228
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,080
Have you had breakfast?

229
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,560
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

230
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,360
Good. My mom isn't here yet.

231
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,360
We can do some shots with Laorchan first.

232
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,280
Yes, sir.

233
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,280
How did you convince her

234
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,240
to agree to do it?

235
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,640
Don't forget who you're talking to.

236
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,960
It was easy-peasy.

237
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,200
Excuse me.

238
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
I'm so sorry I'm late.

239
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,000
The bus I was on

240
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,320
got hit by another bus.

241
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
What?

242
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,840
Are you all right?

243
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,560
I just scratched my elbow.

244
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,400
I already put some ointment on it.

245
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,080
I can still work.

246
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,120
It should be fine.

247
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,040
All the royal dresses
for court ladies have long sleeves.

248
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,120
What do you think, Mr. Phu?

249
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,840
Mr. Phu?

250
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,360
What?

251
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
What do you think?

252
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,040
- Hey.
- Hey.

253
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,920
What's with him?

254
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,880
Come and sit down, Laorchan.

255
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,119
Sit down.

256
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,079
Thank you.

257
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,560
Hey, Phu.

258
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,800
Stop staring.

259
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,440
Should we start photographing your mom?

260
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,320
Laorchan's makeup isn't done yet.

261
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,920
Wait a second, Your Highness.

262
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,840
Do you want to photograph me?

263
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:09,200
I already told Mr. Phuthaneth that

264
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,120
I don't think I'm worthy.

265
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,760
But Mr. Phu just told us

266
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,800
that you changed your mind.

267
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,160
Well…

268
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,080
This isn't about

269
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,160
being worthy or not.

270
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,640
This is the prince's idea.

271
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,720
He wants you to do it.

272
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:34,960
But I'm afraid it might be inappropriate.

273
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,480
Well…

274
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,160
This was the prince's idea.

275
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,400
So that makes it appropriate.

276
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,720
Laorchan.

277
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,440
Go get your hair and makeup done
and get changed.

278
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,720
I know you can do it
and you'll do it well.

279
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,960
But ma'am--

280
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,240
Just do your best
as an employee of JT Group.

281
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,080
I can't wait to see
the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

282
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,000
You'll see it soon.

283
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,880
Please wait here, everyone.

284
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,920
All right.

285
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,360
Phu will come and get you
once we're ready for you.

286
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,440
- Okay.
- Let's go.

287
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,200
Straighten up a bit. Tilt your head back.

288
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,960
Sit up straight.

289
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,200
Chai Lek.

290
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,560
Your wife is as beautiful as ever.

291
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,520
Gosh.

292
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,000
Prang is pretty too.

293
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,760
No question about that.

294
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,040
She's the only one in my heart.

295
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,680
Laorchan is here.

296
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,200
I think I'll take a break.

297
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,960
All right.

298
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,680
I wore that outfit
when I was about 18 years old.

299
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,120
It's an honor for me, ma'am.

300
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,120
You look really beautiful
in our royal attire.

301
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,520
You're so pretty I want to make you
a princess of Viengphukhum.

302
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,440
Excuse me.

303
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,640
Well…

304
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,320
Thank you, Your Highness.

305
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,200
Let's get back to work.

306
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,080
We still have to do
an interview with Chai Yai.

307
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,440
Mom, you can go get changed

308
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,600
for the photo shoot with Laorchan.

309
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,560
All right.

310
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,720
Help your mom with the necklace.

311
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,080
All right.

312
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,960
Can you get it off?

313
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,000
Yes, Mom.

314
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,840
There you go.

315
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,960
I'll take your mom to get changed.

316
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,440
- Okay.
- Let's go, dear.

317
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,960
Have a seat, Laorchan.

318
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,560
She's pretty.

319
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,640
She is.

320
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,800
Right.

321
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,280
Let me put this on for you.

322
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,640
We can have her sit there.

323
00:21:58,720 --> 00:21:59,920
Okay.

324
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,600
Sir.

325
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,160
Excuse me. Shall we start shooting?

326
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,960
- Get out of the way.
- Sorry.

327
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,840
We'll start now.

328
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,160
Sit up straight and look up.

329
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,280
That's good.

330
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,760
That's pretty. You look so elegant.

331
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,720
All right. Give us a smile.

332
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,280
Good.

333
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,360
- That's good.
- You look very pretty.

334
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,840
Good.

335
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
She's pretty.

336
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,600
That's very nice.

337
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,480
That's a gorgeous smile.

338
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,240
Let's eat.

339
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,880
Would you like some?

340
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,720
I came to say goodbye.

341
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,200
I have to get back to the office.

342
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,480
What?

343
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,000
Stay and have something to eat first.

344
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,080
Right.

345
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,520
Come on. Phu.

346
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,520
Are you making her work too hard?

347
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,000
Tell her she can stay.

348
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,720
Well…

349
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,280
Have some food, Laor.

350
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,600
We'll go back together.

351
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,480
It's all right, Mr. Phu.

352
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,520
You enjoy yourself.

353
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,520
I heard you have to stay
to welcome the colonel's dad.

354
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,520
Don't worry about work.

355
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,160
I'll take care of everything.

356
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,200
How will you get back to the office?

357
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,400
Do you need a ride?

358
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,960
My friend will pick me up.

359
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,200
Who?

360
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,360
Is it Sun from Viengphukhum?

361
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,520
Yes, Your Highness.

362
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,920
Excuse me.

363
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,720
My friend messaged me
that he's in front of the house.

364
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,280
Goodbye, everyone.

365
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,440
- Eat up.
- All right.

366
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,400
Well, we're finally alone.

367
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,480
Tell me what the big secret is.

368
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,600
I saw the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

369
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,920
What?

370
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,800
So it's really here?

371
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,360
I don't know when the prince gave it
to Mr. Tharathorn,

372
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,640
but I know for sure

373
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,000
the necklace is in Jutathep Palace.

374
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,480
I got to wear it
and modeled it for a photo shoot.

375
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,720
What?

376
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,720
That's awesome, Laor.

377
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,240
But how will we get
the necklace out of there?

378
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,040
They must have it in a safe.

379
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,200
More importantly, how can we be sure

380
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,440
they will keep it there
after the photo shoot?

381
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,160
Aren't they pretty?

382
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,160
They're so pretty.

383
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,320
You both look gorgeous.

384
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,640
Smile at the camera.

385
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,520
I think we have enough photos.

386
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,040
All right.

387
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,600
The crew will have a hard time
choosing the photos.

388
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,120
All of them look gorgeous.

389
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,120
It will be hard to edit down
your interview as well.

390
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,080
It's thanks to the person

391
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,800
who came up with the questions.

392
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,680
Thank you, Laorchan.

393
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:10,120
It's an honor to serve you,

394
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,400
Your Highness.

395
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,760
Feel free to have some snacks
before you leave, everyone.

396
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,880
The maid has set the table for you.

397
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,840
Thank you.

398
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,840
You're welcome.

399
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,640
- Right, Colonel.
- Yes, sir.

400
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,760
What time will the general be here?

401
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,080
- Three o'clock.
- Okay.

402
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,400
If you and Mr. Phu are free,

403
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,720
I'd like you to be there.

404
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,440
- All right.
- Okay.

405
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,320
Let's put the necklace somewhere safe.

406
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,960
It's very valuable.

407
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,160
I think it will be best
if Chai Yai keeps it.

408
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,640
All right.

409
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,160
Let me help you.

410
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,320
Are you tired?

411
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,680
No.

412
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,520
Don't worry. I got it.

413
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,440
I'm an expert at taking things off you.

414
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,560
- Your Highness.
- Thank you.

415
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,080
Sorry.

416
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,160
Laor.

417
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,360
Will you try on some necklaces for me?

418
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,760
Sure, ma'am.

419
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,320
Come and sit here.

420
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,240
Which one should she try on?

421
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,560
Let's try this one first.

422
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,520
It's so pretty.

423
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,640
This one is really beautiful.

424
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,360
It sparkles in the light.

425
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,640
Right.

426
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,160
This one is really sparkly.

427
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,520
We got this necklace
on our trip to Europe.

428
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,760
I see.

429
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,320
Mr. Phu.

430
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,880
Can you come and take a look?

431
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,840
Does it suit me?

432
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,760
Okay.

433
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,760
What do you think?

434
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,680
Well…

435
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,120
You know what?

436
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,520
I have another one. Let's try that one on.

437
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,440
Let's try a smaller one.
What do you think?

438
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,680
It's simple and classy.

439
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,040
It will go better with her outfit.

440
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,000
Sounds good.

441
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,800
- The color goes well with her sarong.
- You're right.

442
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,440
But I think it's a bit too colorful.

443
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,040
I think Laor should wear something

444
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,160
simple and elegant.

445
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,080
So you know where the safe is

446
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,120
and how to open it.

447
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,120
But we need to practice opening it.

448
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,440
I'll handle that.

449
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,640
I'll get us passports as well.

450
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,000
We'll leave for Viengphukhum
as soon as we get the sapphire.

451
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,880
But how are you going
to get into Jutathep Palace?

452
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,560
You already interviewed Mr. Tharathorn.

453
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,560
Today, General Jumphol

454
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,920
is coming to talk
about the engagement between

455
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,480
the colonel and Ms. Kan.

456
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,120
Are you planning

457
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,600
to steal the sapphire
during the engagement party?

458
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,840
There will be people everywhere.
How will you do it?

459
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,320
It's too dangerous, Laor.

460
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,120
The most dangerous spot

461
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,800
is the safest place for us.

462
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,520
I will find a way to get into the party.

463
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,760
I see that these two kids love
and care for each other.

464
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,280
So I've asked the prince

465
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,560
to make a proposal on behalf of my son.

466
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,640
I think this is a wonderful thing.

467
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,720
I've known these two since they first met.

468
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,840
To this day,

469
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,200
their love for each other
hasn't wavered at all.

470
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,720
I have no objection.

471
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,600
My kids are free to choose

472
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,640
whom they want to be with.

473
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,400
If Kan loves him,

474
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,840
I'll love him too.

475
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,040
I agree with my husband.

476
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,520
We're her parents.

477
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,120
We only want our daughter
to find a good partner

478
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,840
whom she can build a loving family with.

479
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,560
And I can see

480
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:29,520
that you are a good man.

481
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,640
Just like your dad.

482
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,360
Thank you so much, Your Highness.

483
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,640
Goodness.

484
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,080
There's no need
for such formality, Bak Joi.

485
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,280
Oh, my.

486
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,480
I wouldn't dare.

487
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,640
You are the princess of Viengphukhum.

488
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,320
I already gave up my title.

489
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,680
I'm a commoner just like you.

490
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,240
I promise that I will always love

491
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,880
and cherish Kan.

492
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,520
I promise I won't disappoint you

493
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,880
and the princess.

494
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,000
The princess?

495
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,840
I told you two to stop calling me that.

496
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,200
Sorry.

497
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,000
Since there are no objections,

498
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,880
let's discuss the dowry.

499
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,160
Goodness.

500
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,360
I don't want

501
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,520
any dowry from the groom.

502
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,840
But if you want to abide by traditions,

503
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,120
you may arrange things as you see fit.

504
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,080
Yes, sir.

505
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,360
The most valuable thing you can offer us

506
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,080
is your virtue.

507
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,560
There's nothing

508
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,960
more valuable than that.

509
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,160
Yes, ma'am.

510
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,480
Congratulations, Colonel.

511
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,480
Welcome to our family.

512
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:00,680
Thank you, Mr. Phu.

513
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,760
Thank you both so much.

514
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,040
Please get up.

515
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,920
You're actually quite
a regular guest here, General.

516
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,240
And right now,

517
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,760
the colonel is also part of our family.

518
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,720
You two should stay in our guesthouse.

519
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,680
There's no need to stay at a hotel.

520
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,040
Thank you so much, sir.

521
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,360
But I have official matters
that I need to discuss with the prince.

522
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,520
It will be more convenient
if I stay at a hotel.

523
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,520
Besides, Prapasee and our relatives
will fly here the day after tomorrow.

524
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,040
I have to go and get things ready
for the engagement party.

525
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,520
I bid you farewell.

526
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,360
If you don't mind,

527
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,600
I'd like to talk to the prince
about the exhibition.

528
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
Go ahead.

529
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,480
Let's get going.

530
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,960
All right.

531
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,440
Your Highness.

532
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,440
Let's go.

533
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,920
Hey, let me ask you something.

534
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,920
Do you have a relative from Viengphukhum
who looks like Laorchan?

535
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,160
No.

536
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
Why do you ask?

537
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,120
Think carefully.

538
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,640
Maybe you have a distant relative
who looks similar.

539
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,760
I would've said something

540
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,880
if that were the case.

541
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,320
Why? Did you see someone
that looks like Laorchan?

542
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,680
It's nothing.

543
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,240
I was probably mistaken.

544
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,320
You're so infatuated with her

545
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,360
that you start seeing her everywhere.

546
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,840
Snap out of it.

547
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,840
Get out of here.

548
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,760
So you just wanted to talk about a girl.

549
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:16,239
We've set up the equipment
in the exhibition hall.

550
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,600
We just need the video
that we'll play on the day.

551
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:22,040
I've also set up displays
where we'll display the posters

552
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,320
once they're ready.

553
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,679
My team is almost done
developing the films.

554
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:27,960
We'll have them ready

555
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,960
for the meeting tomorrow.

556
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,280
We're still editing
the interview that we did

557
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,600
with Mr. Chai Yai.

558
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,800
As for the documentary
that's about to air,

559
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,800
the commercial time slots
are almost sold out.

560
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,520
Our clients are the bank
who's sponsoring the documentary

561
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,280
as well as travel agencies
and some airlines.

562
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,400
Sir, we should think about
doing a marketing campaign for them.

563
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,480
Viengphukhum could use more tourists.

564
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,200
The prince probably wants
his country to develop sustainably.

565
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,040
What about the script?

566
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,880
I'm working on it.

567
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,960
Then I think that's all for today.

568
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,440
We'll look at the photos
and sum up everything tomorrow.

569
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,080
Thank you.

570
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,080
Yes, sir.

571
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,720
Wait, Laorchan.

572
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,600
What time did you get to the office?

573
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,560
I got here just after three o'clock.

574
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,800
Isn't that what Nujaree told you?

575
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,320
Well…

576
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,720
I thought maybe you stopped somewhere.

577
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,720
Mr. Phu.

578
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,040
First and foremost,
there should be trust between us.

579
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,560
If you don't trust me,

580
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,760
how can we move forward together?

581
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,920
I'm sorry.

582
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,120
I do trust you.

583
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,360
I just don't trust any man
that comes near you.

584
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,120
Sun is my best friend.

585
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,200
Okay.

586
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,040
Please don't be mad at me.

587
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,840
Let me make it up to you this evening

588
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,560
by taking you out for dinner, okay?

589
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,760
Please?

590
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:38,920
Come on. Let's go home.

591
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,240
Should I take a motorbike or a bus home?

592
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,680
I have a ride.

593
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,280
- Oh, my.
- Hey, there.

594
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,080
Looks like the whole gang's here.

595
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,600
Shall we go grab a bite?

596
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,800
We rarely get a chance
to hang out after work.

597
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,600
Ling, let's go grab a cold beer.

598
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,720
I can't. I have to go.

599
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,120
My girl called and asked me
to go and fix her brother's bike.

600
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,800
You're totally whipped.

601
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,080
What do you say, Jang?

602
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,120
My mom isn't feeling well.
I have to go and look after her.

603
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,840
I have tons of work to do.

604
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,760
Ms. Kan will fire me
if I don't finish it by tomorrow.

605
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:18,640
What about you, Jaree?

606
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,880
Gosh.

607
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,520
I can't.

608
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,840
My whole life is dedicated to Tee Yai.

609
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,440
I have to hurry home

610
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,080
to show his parents I'll make a good wife

611
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,680
so they approve of me.

612
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,280
Gosh. Tee Yai is here for me.
I have to go.

613
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,600
Bye. See you.

614
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,560
Sister, wait for me.

615
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,880
Goodbye.

616
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,240
We'll hang out next time.

617
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,400
Goodness.

618
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,880
- They all left.
- Right.

619
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,080
Hey, Laor.

620
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,440
Do you want to grab a bite?

621
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,240
Well, I…

622
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,920
Don't tell me you're busy.

623
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,520
I am. I have to…

624
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,880
Your man's picking you up.

625
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,240
That's right.

626
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,040
I'm going for dinner with my boyfriend.

627
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,080
Don't worry about it.

628
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,760
I'll see you tomorrow.

629
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,120
- All right.
- Okay.

630
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,320
- Let's go.
- It's just us.

631
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,480
It's always just us.

632
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,080
Gosh.

633
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,760
Where are you going?

634
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,840
We arranged to have dinner, didn't we?

635
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,560
In that case, let's get going.

636
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,840
All right. Let's go.

637
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,040
Thank you.

638
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,560
You're really not like other girls.

639
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,160
Most girls would want
to tell the world they're with me.

640
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,600
Only you want to date me in secret.

641
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,200
I don't like to be in the spotlight
if I can avoid it.

642
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,440
If one day,

643
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,840
something happens
that causes us to break up,

644
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,840
we can end things quietly.

645
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,480
Just like how things started.

646
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,800
Do you still have doubts
about our relationship?

647
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,720
Did I do something to make you unsure?

648
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,280
Maybe it's not something you did.

649
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,880
Maybe you're right.

650
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,360
You still have Sun

651
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,640
lurking in the shadows, waiting for you.

652
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,920
I could say the same about Ying.

653
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,440
Why are we talking about other people?

654
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,440
Look at us.

655
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,160
We could've had
a romantic dinner by the river.

656
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,400
Instead, you wanted
to have late-night porridge.

657
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,200
People would recognize you

658
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,480
if we went to a fancy place.

659
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,160
Remember what happened with Mr. Wuthichai?

660
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,600
We would never have privacy

661
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,840
at a place like that.

662
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,720
We can have a private meal

663
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,040
at a roadside diner like this.

664
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,440
Laor.

665
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,400
Are you here with your boyfriend?

666
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,320
What a coincidence.

667
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,000
You should introduce us.

668
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,400
- Mr. Phu!
- Mr. Phu!

669
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,160
Join us.

670
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,040
It's all right, sir.

671
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,840
- Go get a table inside.
- Let's go.

672
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,000
Please excuse us.

673
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,080
Well?

674
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,880
Didn't you say

675
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,720
we would have privacy at a roadside diner?

676
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,000
Let's just eat.

677
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,840
The food will get cold.

678
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,920
You're right.

679
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,880
It's so private.

680
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,840
Yes.

681
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,800
Is everything all right?

682
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,320
You didn't say a word all the way.

683
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,760
I'm worried about tomorrow.

684
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,960
Nikom and Duangdao saw us together.

685
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
So what if they saw us?

686
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,120
A boss can have dinner with his secretary.

687
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:26,920
That's normal.

688
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,560
There's something more to the situation.

689
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,480
Here's the thing.

690
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,280
As I was leaving the office,

691
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,800
I ran into those two.

692
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,320
They asked me to have dinner with them,

693
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,000
but I told them

694
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,720
that I already had plans

695
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,120
with my boyfriend.

696
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,320
Well, they got that right.

697
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,680
Does that mean you agree

698
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,160
to be my girlfriend?

699
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,680
That's not it, Mr. Phu.

700
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,640
I…

701
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,480
I need more time to think.

702
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,600
All right.

703
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,840
I'll give you three minutes.

704
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,680
If you can't give me an answer by then,

705
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,040
I'll punish you.

706
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,560
I…

707
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,400
I think…

708
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,960
I'm not good enough for you.

709
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,160
I'm just an ordinary woman.

710
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,640
I want to be with an ordinary woman

711
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,480
named Laorchan.

712
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,960
You have two minutes.

713
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:45,560
Mr. Phu.

714
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,040
This isn't something
you should joke about.

715
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,920
If you want to be with someone,

716
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,800
you have to be sure.

717
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,600
Or the other person could get hurt.

718
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,880
Do you still think I'm joking?

719
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,680
I've been chasing after you all this time.

720
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,000
I'm sure.

721
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,840
And I'll never hurt you.

722
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,560
You have one minute.

723
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,040
I…

724
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,080
- Hey.
- I have to go.

725
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:27,040
You can't walk away at the last minute.

726
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,720
Your time is up.

727
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,400
Now I'll punish you.

728
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,400
Wait.

729
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,640
Is that your way of saying yes to me?

730
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,720
Well, that's just

731
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,680
how Westerners say good night.

732
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:21,440
I wish you'd say it all the time.

733
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,600
Oh, my.

734
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,040
I think

735
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:28,760
you should go home.

736
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,600
It's late.

737
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,520
Go on.

738
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,480
Drive safely.

739
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,480
Good night.

740
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,280
Good night.

741
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,080
Gosh.

742
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,880
Veena.

743
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,760
Were you working tonight?

744
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,360
You made some good money.

745
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,600
The nightclub just paid me.

746
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,320
I don't think your part-time job
pays you this well.

747
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,960
Did you get a side job?

748
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:56,640
That's right. The customer tipped me.

749
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,080
Is his name Wachira?

750
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,720
Why did you lie to me?

751
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,160
Did you see us?

752
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,920
It wasn't just me.

753
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,960
Mr. Phu almost saw the two of you.

754
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:13,960
If I hadn't…

755
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,960
Listen, Veena.

756
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,800
Do you realize what you're doing?

757
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,840
Today, the colonel just had his boss

758
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:28,160
and his dad asks
for Ms. Kan's hand in marriage.

759
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,360
They are having
an engagement party in a few days.

760
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,960
Don't you know any of this?

761
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:34,840
I do.

762
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,400
You do?

763
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,360
Yet you still went to see him?

764
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,760
Why did you do it?

765
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,800
I just wanted
to be with him one last time.

766
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,160
If you'd ever loved someone,
you'd understand

767
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,720
how painful it is to break things off

768
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,360
with the man you love.

769
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:56,360
But you promised me, Veena.

770
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,080
If you had left him after we talked,

771
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,640
you wouldn't have been in pain like this.

772
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,520
But I love him.

773
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,520
He takes care of my family.

774
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,000
Veena.

775
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,400
This is wrong.

776
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,120
You have to stop seeing him.

777
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,160
Otherwise, I will tell Ms. Kan.

778
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:20,640
Go ahead and tell her.

779
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,160
Do whatever you want.

780
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,920
Hey.

781
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:26,000
Wait, Veena.

782
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:27,680
Veena!

783
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:30,880
Damn it.

784
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,080
Hey, there.

785
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,880
Well, well.

786
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,680
He's in even worse shape
than last night, don't you think?

787
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,400
Looks like we might have
another wedding soon, Sroi.

788
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,800
You're right.

789
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,080
I'll have both a son
and a daughter-in-law.

790
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,840
That's good. I want to have grandkids.

791
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,360
Phu is going to have such adorable kids

792
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,880
since they'll have a gorgeous mom.

793
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,160
Hang on.

794
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,200
Who are you talking about?

795
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:20,760
Tell me who she is.

796
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,200
Goodness. I don't think I should, Dad.

797
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,400
I'll let Phu tell you himself.

798
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:26,800
All right.

799
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,120
Remind me again, Phu.

800
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,760
What's the name of your secretary?

801
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,240
Wait.

802
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,680
So it's Laor?

803
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,120
I wouldn't have guessed
if you hadn't told me.

804
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:41,040
That's right.

805
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,760
- Look.
- Look at him.

806
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,080
He's rubbing his ear.
So it really is Laor.

807
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,320
Knock it off. Stop teasing me already.

808
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,480
You're all ganging up on me.

809
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,280
Well, you wouldn't tell us.

810
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,680
We had to get it out of you.

811
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,120
You're the worst one.

812
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,920
- Get over here!
- No! Stop!

813
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,960
Phu, knock it off!

814
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,120
We're not kids anymore.

815
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,320
I said stop it. I'm tired.

816
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,040
Phu, no!

817
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,600
Look at them.

818
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,480
Who would've thought that

819
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:21,720
the board members of JT Holding
would be so childish

820
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,520
when they are at home.

821
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:24,960
Well, you know,

822
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,200
they're siblings.

823
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,400
Be careful, dear.

824
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,000
Be careful not to trip and hurt yourself.

825
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:34,360
No! Dad, help me! Stop it, Phu!

826
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,640
- I can't breathe.
- I'm not done.

LAMDUAN APARTMENT

828
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,360
Are you okay, Laor?

829
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,520
You look stressed.

830
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,960
I yelled at Veena last night.

831
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,640
She got mad and stormed out.

832
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,640
I don't know where she went.

833
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:12,680
Maybe she went to a friend's place.

834
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,920
She works a lot of jobs.

835
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,200
She has a lot of friends.

836
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,680
Anyway, do you need
my help with something?

837
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,360
You're here kind of early.

838
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,280
I got us a place
to practice picking safes.

839
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,000
We can also get our passports there.

840
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:30,040
Let's go there after work.

841
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,880
Mr. Phu.

842
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,200
Hello, Mr. Phu.

843
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:45,720
Hello.

844
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,880
I'm here to take Laorchan to work.

845
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,320
I see.

846
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,360
I was telling her some news
about our friend in France.

847
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:56,680
I see.

848
00:51:58,480 --> 00:51:59,400
See you, Laor.

LAMDUAN APARTMENT

850
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,440
What does Sun do for a living?

851
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,760
Why does he follow you around
like a shadow?

852
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:38,680
Hello, Mr. Phu.

853
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,760
Hi, Wisarn.

854
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:46,960
Hi, Kanchid.

855
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,400
Phu!

856
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:56,000
Here comes your shadow.

857
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,760
Why are you with Phu?

858
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,680
Why do you ask, Ying?

859
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,360
We're colleagues,
so we come to work together.

860
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,680
What about you? Why are you here so early?

861
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,920
Are you here to see Kan?

862
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,800
I'm here to see you, but it's about Kan.

863
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,800
I want you to help me pick a dress
for the engagement party.

864
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,640
I have meetings all day.

865
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:24,240
It's fine. I can wait.

866
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:26,360
I'll wait as long as it takes.

867
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:29,880
Let's go.

868
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,640
Come on.

869
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,480
Here's the new color.

870
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,240
- It's from this month's catalog.
- It's gorgeous.

871
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,240
My gosh!

872
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,360
- Sister.
- What?

873
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,760
Look at this.

874
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,480
Stop yelling at me, Ling.

875
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,600
My gosh! What is this?

876
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,640
Sister! Have you seen this?

877
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,240
Have you seen this?

878
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,640
What is it, Jeab?

879
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,600
Goodness. Did your department
get the photo too, Jeab?

880
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,760
Yes.

881
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,240
What is going on?

882
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,880
Hey, what are you looking at?

883
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,920
Goodness.

884
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,080
We have to tell Laor

885
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,760
and give her a heads-up.

886
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,480
- My gosh!
- Goodness.

887
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:16,560
Sir.

888
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,120
Where are you all going?

889
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:21,240
What? We're not going anywhere, sir.

890
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,320
What's wrong?

891
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,560
Nothing's wrong.

892
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,280
What's that in your hand?

893
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:28,800
Is it the meeting minutes?

894
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,160
Yes. Isn't that right, guys?

895
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,600
- That's right.
- Yes.

896
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:33,840
Let me see it.

897
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:37,680
Well, let me make you a new copy.

898
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,840
The printer ran out of ink,
so the text is a bit blurry here.

899
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,800
That's right. We're on our way
to make more copies.

900
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,320
Please excuse us. Let's go.

901
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,320
Excuse us.

902
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,520
I'll go tell Laor.

903
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,320
Where is she?

904
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,320
Phu.

905
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,120
We have a problem.

906
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,720
What is it, Kan?

907
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,240
My gosh! What is this?

908
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,840
What did she do to you?

909
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,920
This could hurt your reputation, Phu.

910
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,960
Phu's reputation will be fine.

911
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,800
It's her reputation that will suffer.

912
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,760
Look at the photo, Kan.

913
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,480
The girl was clearly coming on to him.

914
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,680
Maybe

915
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:53,080
this is her plan to trap you.

916
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,640
That's right.

917
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,440
Laor might plan to use this photo
to blackmail you.

918
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,360
Phu.

919
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:06,320
Phu.

920
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,560
Who faxed you this photo?

921
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,200
I don't know,

922
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:20,680
but I'm not the only one who got it.

923
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,840
Other people got it as well.

924
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,760
Every department?

925
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,640
I think so.

926
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:30,960
Sister.

927
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,480
We have to figure out
how we're going to fix this.

928
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:36,600
That's right.

929
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,840
Or people won't shut up about it.

930
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,520
What should we do?

931
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,680
How are you going to help me?

932
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,960
No one can help me.

933
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:51,040
Nujaree.

934
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:53,560
Call a meeting with all department heads.

935
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,080
You have ten minutes.

936
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,520
Yes, sir.

937
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,240
I want you to have a look
at the photos in your envelopes.

938
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,160
She's gorgeous.

939
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:56,280
My gosh! Laor!

940
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,480
You look so pretty.

941
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,720
These six photos
of the Ajna Chakra Necklace

942
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,240
are the photos that we'll use
to promote the exhibition.

943
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,680
The first and second photos

944
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,640
will be featured in the brochure
that we'll send out

945
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,440
to various organizations.

946
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,400
As for the third photo,

947
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:29,240
we'll enlarge it

948
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,440
and put it up here at JT Center.

949
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,920
As for the fourth and fifth photos,

950
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,520
we'll enlarge them and put them up
in the exhibition hall.

951
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:39,160
Each department can start working

952
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,720
on their assignments.

953
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,640
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

954
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,120
Now let's talk
about the photo that I think

955
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,440
you all probably received this morning.

956
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:54,880
Do you suspect that

957
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,480
the person who did this

958
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,840
might be someone

959
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,760
who wants the world to know

960
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:03,320
she's your special someone?

961
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,040
When you say, "the person who did this",

962
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,640
who do you mean exactly?

963
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,640
You tell me.

964
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,960
I don't have an answer to that question.

965
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:14,880
I never thought
of doing something like this.

966
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,880
The person who did this

967
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,640
must be mentally unstable.

968
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,000
Who do you mean?

969
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,280
I just asked Phu a question.

970
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,880
Why are you being defensive?

971
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,480
Laorchan isn't being defensive.

972
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:34,320
The person who's bothered by this

973
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,280
is me.

974
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:48,680
Since things have come to this,

975
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,280
you all should know that

976
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:53,240
Laorchan and I

977
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,640
are in a relationship.

978
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:56,880
- Phu.
- Mr. Phu.

979
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,920
There's nothing wrong
with two people who like each other

980
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,360
expressing that affection.

981
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,480
The one in the wrong

982
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,200
is the person who leaked
this photo of Laorchan and me

983
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:09,920
to the public

984
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,760
without our consent.

985
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,400
If anyone here did this

986
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,520
and won't come clean,

987
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,000
you'd better keep quiet.

988
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,640
Do not let me catch you.

989
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:25,400
Because if I find out who did this,

990
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:27,440
I'll fire that person

991
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,680
and take legal action against them.

992
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,160
That includes anyone
who keeps a copy of this photo

993
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,280
or passes it on to others.

994
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,760
That's all I want to say.

995
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,680
You're dismissed.

996
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,880
Congratulations, sir.

997
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,600
You're perfect for each other.

998
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,560
Congratulations, sir.

999
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,160
Congratulations!

1000
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,400
This is great.

1001
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:54,680
I'm so happy for you.

1002
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,200
Phu.

1003
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:25,440
How come you don't
suspect Laorchan at all?

1004
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,920
Think about it.

1005
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,720
Who do you think benefits the most

1006
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,760
from this situation?

1007
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,320
What about you?

1008
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,280
What do you gain from this?

1009
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,520
Why are you getting so worked up

1010
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,520
as if it was you in that photo?

1011
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,320
I don't want to see you get played.

1012
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:46,440
Anyone can tell from that photo

1013
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:48,560
that she was trying to trap you.

1014
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,160
If she could have had a photo taken
in bed with you,

1015
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:52,560
she would've done it.

1016
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,640
Ying.

1017
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:58,480
I was the one pursuing her.

1018
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,680
Phu.

1019
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,520
You might have a head for business,

1020
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:04,880
but you're so naive
when it comes to women.

1021
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,560
No woman in this country

1022
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,280
would say no to you.

1023
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:11,960
What that woman did

1024
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,560
was just a trick to increase
her worth in your eyes.

1025
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,760
Ying!

1026
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,320
Stop talking trash about Laorchan.

1027
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:20,760
No man in this world would stand by

1028
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,920
and let other women talk trash
about the woman he loves.

1029
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,000
And I'm no different.

1030
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,360
Someday,

1031
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:29,720
you're going to regret

1032
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:31,360
not listening to me.

1033
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,160
No one here wants to get sued.

1034
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:54,120
That's right.
It's expensive to get a lawyer.

1035
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,520
I don't want to risk
getting fired over this.

1036
01:02:57,600 --> 01:02:58,880
Right.

1037
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,120
Is that all of them?

1038
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,080
- Here's one.
- Take it.

1039
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,040
Give me that.

1040
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:18,600
I'M WAITING IN FRONT OF YOUR OFFICE

1041
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,160
What a mess.

1042
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:33,720
Is this all of them?

1043
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:35,720
Gosh.

1044
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:37,480
I don't want any trouble.

1045
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:39,840
Hey, Jaree.

1046
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,560
I have to go

1047
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:45,840
to take care of some business
outside the office.

1048
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,840
It's really important.

1049
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,960
I'll be back before one o'clock.

1050
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,200
You'd better not be late, Laor.

1051
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:53,360
I mean…

1052
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:57,120
Please don't be late, Ms. Laor.

1053
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,560
Come on. Don't be like that.

1054
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:03,440
Just hurry back.

1055
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,080
All right. I'll be back soon.

1056
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:08,560
Don't be late.

1057
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,520
My goodness.

1058
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,640
You're good at kissing ass.

1059
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:16,080
That's right, you ass-kisser.

1060
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,800
You're the best at it.

1061
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,160
Sun.

1062
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:30,400
Laor.

1063
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,360
Hello.

1064
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,360
<i>Would you like to know</i>

1065
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:55,280
what that woman
that you're so protective of

1066
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:56,880
is doing right now?

1067
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,880
Will you drop this already?

1068
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,360
Drop it? This is only the beginning.

1069
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:05,000
It seems that your lover

1070
01:05:05,080 --> 01:05:06,720
has quite a few suitors.

1071
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:09,280
She shared a kiss with you last night

1072
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,320
<i>and now she's flirting with another man
in front of the office.</i>

1073
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:14,800
<i>I don't think I have to tell you</i>

1074
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,040
that the man I'm talking about is

1075
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:19,680
Sun.

1076
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:33,560
Yes, sir.

1077
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:36,560
Nujaree, have Laorchan
come and see me immediately.

1078
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,480
Laorchan left to take care
of some business.

1079
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,560
It seemed urgent.

1080
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,960
She said she'd be back before one o'clock.

1081
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,240
<i>Is there something you need?</i>

1082
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,680
It's nothing.

1083
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,400
I wanted to ask her about work.

1084
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:50,440
I see. All right.

1085
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:01,440
Hello, Man.

1086
01:06:01,520 --> 01:06:03,280
Did you see my secretary outside?

1087
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,040
<i>I saw her earlier,</i>

1088
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,640
<i>but she's not here anymore.</i>

1089
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:29,640
Hey.

1090
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:31,760
Are you going somewhere?

1091
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,920
I'm heading out to see a client.

1092
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:37,720
What about you?

1093
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,440
Nujaree said you had
urgent business to take care of.

1094
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,400
Why are you back so soon?

1095
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,800
Is there something urgent?

1096
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,840
I got us an appointment with Moo.

1097
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:50,760
Shall we go?

1098
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,520
Is something wrong, Laor?

1099
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,040
I'm just thinking about

1100
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:01,560
what excuse I'm going to give
to Mr. Phu if I get back late.

1101
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:04,360
Something happened
at the office this morning.

1102
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,920
Mr. Phu lost it

1103
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,240
in the middle of a meeting.

1104
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,960
What happened?

1105
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:11,880
It was…

1106
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,040
It was just some petty scandal.

1107
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,520
But it made me realize

1108
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,640
how much Ms. Woranuch despises me.

1109
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:23,320
She really hates me.

1110
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,120
Don't turn around.

1111
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,560
Why?

1112
01:07:38,640 --> 01:07:40,600
The person you're talking about

1113
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:42,160
is watching us.

1114
01:07:47,080 --> 01:07:48,320
This doesn't look good.

1115
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:50,880
Let's meet up later.

1116
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,640
That woman could ruin our plan.

1117
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,720
I will remember this day
for the rest of my life.

1118
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,480
Just let me know when you are ready.

1119
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,240
Whatever it takes

1120
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:19,640
to get my hands on the sapphire third eye,

1121
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:21,479
I'll do it.

1122
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:22,680
A woman like you

1123
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:24,720
doesn't deserve Phu.

1124
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,479
You have two minutes.

1125
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,720
- What?
- What?

1126
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,399
You were followed here.

1127
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:40,760
Mr. Phu.

1128
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,760
My gosh.

1129
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:30,200
