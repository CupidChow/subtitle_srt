1
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,600
This is your last chance.
You have two options.

2
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,280
I'm going up.

3
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,120
This is the ultimate punishment

4
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,400
for those who dare
to betray the Thapana Association.

5
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,639
We will not stop
until we conquer Viengphukhum.

6
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,280
Three Pagoda Temple

7
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,320
is not far from the foot of the mountain.

8
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,800
He said we would find

9
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,080
the four animals
stationed in each direction

10
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,760
with the temple located
in the middle of Anodard Pond.

11
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,600
How come we haven't found anything?

12
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,800
Point me in the right direction

13
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,040
so I can find the temple.

14
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,720
I couldn't sleep.

15
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,000
I keep thinking about Anodard Pond

16
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,320
and the secrets it holds.

17
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,360
It doesn't do you good
to get too stressed out

18
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,640
about something.

19
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,320
There may be something
that you want to find,

20
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,880
but you just can't find it

21
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,720
no matter where you look

22
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,880
or how hard you try.

23
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,400
Then one day,

24
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,880
it's just there in front of you.

25
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,520
The sky is so pretty tonight.

26
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,160
It's full of stars.

27
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,720
Anyway,

28
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,960
isn't your birthday in March?

29
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Hey.

30
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,280
You remembered?

31
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,960
I remember everything about you.

32
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,800
Your star sign

33
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,680
is Pisces.

34
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,880
It's right there.

35
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,560
Where is it?

36
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,960
I don't see anything.

37
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,160
Then come with me.

38
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,120
Come on.

39
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,560
Watch your step.

40
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,040
There.

41
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,440
It's right there.

42
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,920
Can you see it?

43
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,520
Well…

44
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,640
It's meant to be two fish.

45
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,280
It doesn't look like fish to me.

46
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:16,160
Let's pretend that it does.

47
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,640
Anyway,

48
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,399
you're an Aries, right?

49
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,280
Where's your constellation

50
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,600
that looks like a lamb?

51
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,440
Let's see.

52
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,960
There.

53
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,920
It's right there.

54
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,840
It's over there.

55
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,360
Right next to yours.

56
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,640
I see.

57
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,960
It doesn't look like a lamb.

58
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,400
I'm trying to use my imagination,
but I just don't see it.

59
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,160
Let's see.

60
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,600
Take that mountain, for example.

61
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,240
I can tell right away

62
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,760
what it looks like.

63
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,680
That mountain looks like

64
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,120
a horse's head.

65
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,880
You're right.

66
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,920
A horse's head?

67
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,520
That's the North Star.

68
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,960
That way is south.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,200
That's east.

70
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,040
That means

71
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,920
the west is in that direction.

72
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,880
The horse's head is in the west.

73
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,960
My gosh.

74
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,720
Hey, look.

75
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,040
Does that mountain
look like a lion's head?

76
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,080
Mr. Phu.

77
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,080
It looks like a huge lion
with its mouth open.

78
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Look.

79
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
That one looks like an elephant's trunk.

80
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,840
Right.

81
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,080
Look at that mountain.

82
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,200
That mountain looks like a cow's head.

83
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,080
It's in the south. My gosh.

84
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,480
We're standing
in the middle of Anodard Pond.

85
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,200
Well, then.

86
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,240
Okay. All right.

87
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,280
I'm going to tell everyone.

88
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,600
See you.

89
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,880
Laor.

90
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,560
Come on. Your priority should be
to celebrate with me right now.

91
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,160
We're almost there.

92
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,040
We should continue without Nhu See

93
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,480
for her own safety.

94
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,520
Where are you heading to next?

95
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,320
I thought this place was your destination.

96
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,400
We'll head to the center

97
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,880
of these four mountains.

98
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,080
Pimpa City.

99
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,360
Did you know

100
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,840
that Pailin was once called Pimpa?

101
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,360
My dad told me that

102
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,520
the border town near Savannakhet

103
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,960
used to be called Pimpa.

104
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,680
But it was destroyed long ago

105
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,760
by the great naga

106
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,560
named Trinetr.

107
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,560
Lord Naga Trinetr? What about him?

108
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,520
People said that

109
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,720
the King of Pimpa

110
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,880
stole Lord Naga Trinetr's third eye.

111
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,840
Lord Trinetr was furious

112
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,320
and destroyed the whole city.

113
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,920
Several hundred years later,
the King of Viengphukhum

114
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,000
had his men build a temple

115
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,280
and a statue of Lord Naga Trinetr
to ask for his forgiveness.

116
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,440
The statue was adorned
with a blue sapphire

117
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,960
to represent the third eye.

118
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,360
But that sapphire was also stolen.

119
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,560
How did your dad know so much about this?

120
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,240
The person who stole the sapphire

121
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,120
was my great-grandfather.

122
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:42,000
What was his name?

123
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,120
It's Khum.

124
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,960
Our family was never allowed back to Pimpa

125
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,200
after offending Lord Trinetr.

126
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
My great-grandfather was killed over it,

127
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,400
but my grandfather was still afraid that

128
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:05,000
Lord Trinetr would come to take revenge

129
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,520
on the rest of us.

130
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,920
When you go into Pimpa,

131
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,280
you must be very careful.

132
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,760
There are people

133
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,680
who have survived Pha Diao Dai Cliff.

134
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,320
But no one has ever returned…

135
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,720
from Pimpa City.

136
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,400
Once we cross this river,

137
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
we should be close to the temple.

138
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,520
Let's get going then.

139
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,360
Once Kanthika finishes talking to Kampan,

140
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,600
take her to the alley at the back.

141
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,640
I'll have my men go and seize her.

142
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,120
Today, Your Highness?

143
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,840
Thank you.

144
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,760
Well, well.

145
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,760
You sure take good care of your officer.

146
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,200
Would you give me a hand too?

147
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,240
Wait for me.

148
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,920
-You're on your own.
-Fine.

149
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,720
Thank you.

150
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,440
Are we going
to the radio station to get updates?

151
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,280
That's right.

152
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,320
Let's go.

153
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,680
I'd like you both to come with me

154
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,160
to Pailin.

155
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,600
Has Satarasamee found the temple?

156
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
This is sooner than we expected.

157
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,120
How will we get there?

158
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,920
The cliffs there are very steep

159
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,160
and there are no helipads.

160
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,920
It will take us several days

161
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,640
if we travel there by car.

162
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:25,040
We'll fly to Savannakhet

163
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,320
which borders Viengphukhum.

164
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,600
They have helipads
where we can land our helicopter.

165
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,680
Furthermore,

166
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,640
I've already informed their officers
that we're coming.

167
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,360
Very well.

168
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Let's get going then.

169
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,160
Come on.

170
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,520
Mr. Phu.

171
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,560
It's really here.

172
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,280
It's hidden in the mountain.

173
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,840
No wonder we couldn't find it.

174
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,560
Gosh.

175
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,920
Well, shall we have a look inside?

176
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,680
Let's go.

177
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,800
-Come on, guys.
-Okay.

178
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,080
There are tons of stalactites.

179
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,480
Watch your heads, guys.

180
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,640
Watch your step.

181
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,960
Be careful.

182
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,120
Gosh.

183
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,480
It's okay, Veena.

184
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,800
Veena.

185
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,200
They probably came
looking for the treasure.

186
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,760
So there's really treasure here.

187
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,240
In my great-grandfather's journal,

188
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,880
he said there were gold and jewels

189
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,360
that the people of Pimpa left as offerings

190
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,200
to Lord Naga Trinetr.

191
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,600
They're probably where the statue is

192
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,360
at the far end of the temple.

193
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,440
Let's keep moving.

194
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,760
-Gosh.
-Gosh.

195
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,520
Let's go.

196
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,000
Everyone, we can go this way.

197
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,840
No, wait.

198
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,120
Wait for me.

199
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,560
Come on.

200
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,720
It's okay.

201
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,440
Come on, Veena.

202
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,200
-Watch out!
-Chat!

203
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,760
Be careful, doctor.

204
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,400
That was close, Chat.

205
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,640
What happened?

206
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,480
My gosh.

207
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,440
This is like a maze of booby traps.

208
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,440
How can we pass through this?

209
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,280
Jhao, what should we do?

210
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,960
Sun, thank you so much.

211
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,360
-Are you okay, doctor?
-I'm fine.

212
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,720
We need to keep moving.

213
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,520
We need a plan.

214
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,720
Right.

215
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,920
Close.

216
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,360
Forward.

217
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,480
Twirl.

218
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,760
Forward.

219
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,200
Close.

220
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,600
Twirl.

221
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:03,160
How romantic. Dancing in a cave.

222
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,560
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

223
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,760
-Five, six, seven, eight.
-Five, six, seven, eight.

224
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:15,520
-One, two, three, four.
-One, two, three, four.

225
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,560
-Five, six, seven,
-Five, six, seven,

226
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,320
-eight.
-eight.

227
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,840
Good job, darling.

228
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,160
Remember this.

229
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,400
These dance steps will come
in handy when you grow up.

230
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,560
I think I know what to do.

231
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,160
What is it, Laor?

232
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,320
Are you sure

233
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,280
that this will work?

234
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,600
I'm not.

235
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,800
Mr. Phu.

236
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,960
You can still change your mind.

237
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,200
No, I'm ready to do this with you.

238
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,440
Then just follow my lead.

239
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,160
-Okay.
-Are you ready?

240
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:13,839
One.

241
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,599
Two.

242
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,920
Three.

243
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,680
Mr. Phu!

244
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,119
Watch out!

245
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,680
-Gosh.
-My gosh.

246
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,720
Careful!

247
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,440
Mr. Phu!

248
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,600
Watch out!

249
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,040
-It's gone quiet.
-Don't move.

250
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,840
Hey.

251
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,680
-Laor.
-We did it.

252
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,080
-We did it!
-It worked!

253
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,440
It worked! We did it!

254
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,520
That's incredible.

255
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,200
This means we can pass through now.

256
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,160
Wait.

257
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,000
I'll go first.

258
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,640
Careful.

259
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,480
Come on.

260
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,360
Are you okay?

261
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,840
Phu!

262
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,520
That was awesome!

263
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Totally.

264
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,600
Let's keep moving.

265
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,520
Let's go.

266
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,760
It's an ancient alphabet.

267
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,360
Can you read it, Laor?

268
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,440
"Those who dare

269
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,400
to steal the offerings
that the people brought to me

270
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,120
out of faith,

271
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,600
I damn them to meet

272
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,320
-A fateful death.
-a fateful death."

273
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,840
The treasure must be hidden here.

274
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,800
I don't see any hiding place.

275
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,200
Split up and look.

276
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,040
Okay.

277
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,920
Come on.

278
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,760
Guys.

279
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,160
There's an entrance here.

280
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,760
Well done, my nephew.

281
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,040
Uncle.

282
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,640
How did you get here?

283
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,720
I came here via the Savannakhet border.

284
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,840
It's not far from here.

285
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,920
What about my parents?
Are they at the palace?

286
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,480
Don't you worry.

287
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,080
Salika is taking good care of them

288
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,760
and Ms. Kanthika.

289
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,000
Kan?

290
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,280
How did you know we were here?

291
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,160
The last time I radioed the base,

292
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,720
I didn't tell them we were coming here.

293
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,800
You didn't,

294
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,680
but someone on your team did.

295
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,240
Someone on our team?

296
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,840
Who?

297
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,560
Gosh. Thank you so much.

298
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,960
You managed to gain Laor's trust.

299
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,600
You had her fooled.

300
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,520
It really was worth sending you to France.

301
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,360
Look here.

302
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
This is a tracking device

303
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,560
that was with you every step of the way.

304
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,400
Sun.

305
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,480
In life,

306
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,480
there are some things we just can't avoid.

307
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,760
This is Sun's necklace.

308
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,400
Sun.

309
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,400
Keep it.

310
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,600
The sun and the moon belong together.

311
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,600
You asshole!

312
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,000
Did you use Laor?

313
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,920
-Asshole!
-Stop it!

314
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,960
-Mr. Phu!
-You son of a bitch!

315
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,640
Laor.

316
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,600
Come with me.

317
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,080
I'll keep you safe.

318
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,720
Laor.

319
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,040
This was your plan from the beginning.

320
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,120
You knew who I was
and what I wanted to do.

321
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,800
You know my background
better than I do myself.

322
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,760
So you used me

323
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,560
and you lied to everyone.

324
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,760
I should've never shed a tear over you.

325
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,440
How could you do this to me, Sun?

326
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,280
-Laor, I--
-Stay away from me.

327
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,360
Just go, Sun.

328
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,240
Go.

329
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,640
It was not easy raising

330
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,840
a rebel's child.

331
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,720
You know

332
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,840
how to prove your loyalty to us.

333
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,960
Let's go.

334
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,680
It's all right, kid.

335
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,200
I'll look after you.

336
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,520
But it was way harder to prove my loyalty

337
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,360
to the Phukhumwong family.

338
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,640
I fought by your side.

339
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,200
I dedicated my life to you.

340
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,560
And yet,

341
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,840
you accused me of being a rebel

342
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,880
just because Prince Sankham was my uncle.

343
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,480
My uncle was a rebel.

344
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,560
Does that mean I must be a rebel too?

345
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,240
Manolom one, do you copy?

346
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,200
This is Manolom one. Go ahead.

347
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,560
Anucha, I'm begging you.

348
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,040
Father.

349
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,680
Let those who have
nothing to do with this go.

350
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,720
I'll take full responsibility for this.

351
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,320
We can talk things out.

352
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,840
I promise

353
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,920
you will be treated fairly.

354
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,760
It's too late for that.

355
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,600
I was unfairly imprisoned.

356
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,440
Get in there.

357
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,840
I didn't get a chance to plead my case.

358
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,920
I shouted and shouted,

359
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,720
but no one heard me.

360
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,800
As you probably know,

361
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,840
the Manolom family

362
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,160
used to reign over Viengphukhum
even before the Phukhumwongs.

363
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,200
Who are you?

364
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,120
I'm your father's bodyguard.

365
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,640
I joined General Segong

366
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,600
in overthrowing King Suriyawong.

367
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,960
General Kampan.

368
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,800
My trial was postponed

369
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,240
for days and then months.

370
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,400
Then months became years.

371
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,760
One, two, three, four,
five, six years went by.

372
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,600
Do you know why?

373
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,280
It was because

374
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,440
all of you were busy
celebrating King Suriyawong

375
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,280
and his ascension to the throne.

376
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,040
But less than two years later,

377
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,600
you were arranging his funeral.

378
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,200
All the wailing

379
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,080
that could be heard throughout
the land had not died down

380
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,000
before the sound of fireworks
for another celebration began.

381
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,800
People were celebrating

382
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,880
King Rangsimun's ascension to the throne.

383
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,680
All of you were enjoying the celebration

384
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,040
and forgot about the soldier
who had fought by your side.

385
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,400
I was locked up for six years.

386
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,840
Six years.

387
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,600
Those six years in jail opened my eyes

388
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,520
to reality.

389
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,760
Bring me the treasure.

390
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,640
Go!

391
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,920
Otherwise, I'll kill you all.

392
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,840
My goodness.

393
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,240
How dare you!

394
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,280
Nevin.

395
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,920
Yes, sir.

396
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
Leave Laor alone.

397
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,120
Don't you dare touch me.

398
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,800
You have your principles

399
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,200
and I have mine.

400
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,240
We are two parallel lines
that will never meet.

401
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,480
Remember that.

402
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,120
You're right.

403
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,800
You're trying to fulfill
your duty to your family.

404
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,320
I want to do the same.

405
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,280
Let's go.

406
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,480
Go and get me the treasure.

407
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,320
-Let's go.
-Satarasamee

408
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
and the girl

409
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,520
stay here.

410
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,520
Jhao.

411
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,760
-Move it.
-Get off me.

412
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,040
Get them out of here.

413
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,200
Move it.

414
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,320
Let's go.

415
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,240
Move it.

416
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,520
Keep walking.

417
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,640
I said keep walking.

418
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,320
Move it.

419
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,600
So the leader of the Thapana Association

420
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,720
wasn't Kedsada, was it?

421
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,200
You killed your fellow ideologues

422
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,400
just to keep your position as the leader.

423
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,120
It took you far too long

424
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,440
to finally see the truth.

425
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,880
My dear nephew.

426
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,720
Why must you be so barbaric?

427
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,800
It was your husband

428
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,520
who had all the rebels punished.

429
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,440
Don't you find that barbaric?

430
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,480
There is a process

431
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,000
of investigation for this matter

432
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,440
which is clearly specified by the law

433
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,320
and cannot be violated.

434
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,840
I may be king,

435
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,720
but I must also abide by
the constitution just like you

436
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,640
and everyone else in this country.

437
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,360
We found the treasure.

438
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,480
Bring it up here.

439
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,600
Hurry.

440
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,080
Go bring us the treasure.

441
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,040
Move it.

442
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,080
Hurry up.

443
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,360
Keep walking.

444
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,520
Mr. Phu.

445
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,800
Shall we take them out now?

446
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,800
We should wait.
The others may be in danger.

447
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,640
Hey, why are you talking?

448
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,200
Bring the treasure out.

449
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,440
Move it.

450
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,480
Hurry up.

451
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,240
Let's go.

452
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,600
Move it.

453
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,719
Be careful with it.

454
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,440
Bring the treasure here.

455
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:31,960
Go and join the others.

456
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,800
Go on.

457
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,440
Hurry up.

458
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,360
Move it.

459
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,040
Let's go.

460
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,600
My gosh.

461
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,160
Okay.

462
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,880
Very nice.

463
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,960
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

464
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,920
-Back off!
-Stop it!

465
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,600
You asshole!

466
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,840
Let go!

467
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:53,600
All the treasure and wealth in this land,

468
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,120
belongs to me.

469
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,040
That includes the sapphire third eye.

470
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,520
The best hiding spot

471
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,880
is the most obvious one.

472
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,880
Did you think

473
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,000
you could fool me?

474
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,440
You little imbecile.

475
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,520
You cannot take the sapphire third eye.

476
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,800
The sapphire third eye

477
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,320
represents the people's faith

478
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,760
in Lord Naga Trinetr.

479
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,840
We need to return it to him.

480
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,960
Why should I listen to you?

481
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,240
Who do you think you are
to tell me what to do?

482
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,080
I won't let you take
the country's treasure.

483
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,200
If it's money that you want,

484
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,440
go back to the palace.

485
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,000
My father will give you his own money

486
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,000
in exchange for this treasure.

487
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,960
Listen.

488
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,480
The day that I finally become king,

489
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,240
no one will have to go without again.

490
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,840
I'm going to take this treasure

491
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,120
and sell it.

492
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:24,560
Your money means nothing
compared to what this treasure's worth.

493
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,640
So you want to throw money at people.

494
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,000
Of course.

495
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,800
Money can make anything happen.

496
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,280
All of you

497
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,880
in the Phukhumwong family
are nothing but fools.

498
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,560
Your time is over now.

499
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,840
From now on,

500
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,600
the Manoloms will rule this country.

501
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,600
Manolom two, do you copy?

502
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,920
Kill them.

503
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,880
No!

504
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,040
-Jhao!
-Father!

505
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,240
-Father!
-Mr. Phu!

506
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,600
-No!
-Stop!

507
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,000
You asshole!

508
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:14,840
Mr. Phu.

509
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,240
All of you.

510
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,200
Go get the treasure.

511
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,120
Bring it outside.

512
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,400
Go!

513
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,320
Let's go. Move it.

514
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,360
Keep walking.

515
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,320
Let's go.

516
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,840
Move it.

517
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,080
Keep walking.

518
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,240
Come on.

519
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,040
Hurry up.

520
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,120
Let's go.

521
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,480
Keep walking.

522
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,480
Move it.

523
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,320
Get the treasure.

524
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,440
Move faster.

525
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,480
Hurry up.

526
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,200
Keep walking.

527
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:20,800
Move it.

528
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,120
Keep walking.

529
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,640
Hurry up.

530
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,680
Eagle four. Two, zero, four.

531
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,040
Eagle four. Two, zero, four.

532
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,600
Nevin.

533
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,760
Who was that on the radio?

534
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,360
It must've picked up a nearby signal.

535
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,880
Everyone at the palace is safe.

536
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,160
Manolom two, do you copy?

537
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,760
Is everything okay?

538
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,040
It's all taken care of.

539
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,960
If we go in now,

540
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,280
we could put the King, the Queen,
and Ms. Kanthika in danger.

541
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,080
It may be too late if we don't act now.

542
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,040
We'll have to risk it.

543
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,240
All right.

544
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,960
Hey. There's a fire.

545
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,000
Put it out. Hurry.

546
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,320
-Come on.
-Freeze!

547
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,600
-What?
-Get down.

548
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,760
On your knees.

549
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:00,760
Get down.

550
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,240
Put your hands up.

551
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,440
Don't move.

552
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,160
Kill them.

553
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,440
-No!
-What?

554
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,040
Hey, stop!

555
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,840
Kan.

556
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,200
Drop your weapon, Salika.

557
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,080
If I have to die,

558
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,960
I'll take your king with me.

559
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,400
Gosh.

560
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,240
Kan.

561
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,000
It's over, Salika.

562
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,840
Seize her.

563
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,960
She really takes after her mom.

564
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,200
Right.

565
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,440
I'm starting to worry about Wachira.

566
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:19,160
From now on,

567
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,760
the Manoloms

568
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,760
will rule this country.

569
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,120
And this blue sapphire

570
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:34,680
will make me

571
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,520
the most powerful man in Viengphukhum.

572
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,000
Do you really think

573
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:57,360
that sapphire can make you
more powerful than everyone else?

574
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,640
Are you blinded by greed,

575
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,280
or are you just too stupid

576
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,960
to tell the difference between
what's real and what's fake?

577
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,080
Admit it, Uncle.

578
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,160
You lost.

579
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,120
Do you think I'll fall for that?

580
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,960
You little twerp.

581
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,840
If that's what you want to think,

582
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,000
be my guest.

583
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,880
Do you want more?

584
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,920
-Gosh.
-Hey.

585
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,360
But this one…

586
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,440
looks a little cracked.

587
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,120
Or you can have this one.

588
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,720
I have one too.

589
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:48,560
Or do you want this one?

590
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,800
Here.

591
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,000
Let's keep moving.

592
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,600
Everyone, we can go this way.

593
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,760
-Wait for me.
-Veena.

594
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:22,680
Wait.

595
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,200
This is your chance.

596
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,560
Keep the sapphire third eye safe.

597
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,640
Return it to Lord Naga Trinetr.

598
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,560
But…

599
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,320
I'm counting on you.

600
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,480
I will do my best

601
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,880
to fulfill my duty.

602
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:27,400
That's a lie.

603
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,400
You're lying.

604
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,600
This blue sapphire…

605
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,920
It's mine.

606
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,000
The sapphire third eye

607
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,360
is mine and mine alone!

608
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,440
-Shoot them!
-No!

609
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,360
Jhao!

610
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:44,920
Jhao.

611
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,280
Get Jhao out of here.

612
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,640
Let's go. Come on.

613
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,280
Get over here.

614
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,400
Back off!

615
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,160
Go, Veena.

616
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,560
Go! Let's go!

617
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,560
Guard the treasure.

618
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,960
Return the sapphire to Lord Trinetr.

619
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,520
Mr. Phu.

620
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,400
Wait for me here.

621
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,520
Be careful, Laor.

622
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:16,960
Go!

623
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,520
Freeze! Drop your weapons!

624
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,760
Get them!

625
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,880
Capture all of them
and put them over there.

626
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,240
On your knees.

627
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,040
Get down.

628
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,240
Damn it!

629
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,920
Take this!

630
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,120
Gosh.

631
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,000
You traitor!

632
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,480
You ruined everything.

633
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:53,400
If you hadn't butted in,

634
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:54,600
Laor would've loved me.

635
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,360
I was always there for her.

636
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,360
You asshole!

637
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,400
You should die!

638
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,040
A guy like you doesn't even deserve

639
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,040
to be Laor's friend.

640
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,360
It was me who was always there for her.

641
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,800
Then you came along

642
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,440
and ruined everything.

643
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,440
Die, you asshole!

644
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,040
Great-Grandmother.

645
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:50,760
Great-Grandmother.

646
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,520
We didn't come this way last time.

647
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:16,800
Great-Grandmother.

648
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,400
Great-Grandmother.

649
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,160
It's the room we were in.

650
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,600
Why did you lead me back here?

651
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:45,360
Let me tell you something.

652
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,440
It was me

653
00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:51,640
who killed your brother.

654
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:55,960
You scumbag.

655
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,320
You're a superstitious bunch.

656
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,440
The legend about the naga

657
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,760
is nothing but a myth.

658
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,760
How is it possible

659
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:23,920
that you're here all along,

660
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,480
yet no one can see you?

661
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,000
No matter how I try to conceal myself,

662
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,920
corrupt humans like yourself

663
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,160
always manage to find me.

664
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,920
You know that
I would've overcome any obstacle

665
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,760
to find you here.

666
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,840
That's because nothing
can stop human desire.

667
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,000
You're right.

668
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,400
I am human.

669
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,080
I have desire.

670
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,080
And my only desire

671
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:16,960
is to return
the sapphire third eye to you.

672
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,320
You conniving human.

673
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,320
You are all liars.

674
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:24,440
Your words

675
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,240
cannot be trusted.

676
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,080
I'll give you a chance.

677
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:36,400
I want all of you

678
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:39,160
to leave this place.

679
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,160
You're dead!

680
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:23,360
Damn it.

681
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,640
Are you all right, Mee?

682
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,640
I'm okay.

683
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:33,200
Come on.

684
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,200
I'll give you one last chance.

685
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:02,400
Get out of here.

686
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,000
You know that I won't go anywhere.

687
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,200
You're doing this

688
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,320
out of fear.

689
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,280
You fear meeting a human
who isn't filled with greed.

690
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,600
How dare you!

691
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,200
You fear you might show them mercy.

692
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,760
Wasn't it your love

693
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,840
and mercy for humans
that caused your demise?

694
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:35,640
Laorchan!

695
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,040
No!

696
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:44,560
Be careful.

697
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,160
Where do you think you're going?

698
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:51,520
Let's see

699
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,840
if the naga that you worship

700
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,080
will come to save your life.

701
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:01,280
Let's see whether the great naga

702
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,640
can take a bullet.

703
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:09,360
Lord Naga Trinetr

704
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:12,920
doesn't scare me.

705
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,200
You beast!

706
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:39,680
Stop!

707
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:10,240
Laor!

708
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,120
Laor.

709
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,440
Laor.

710
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,960
Get up slowly, Laor.

711
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:41,120
Mr. Phu.

712
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,520
I did it, Mr. Phu.

713
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,320
I did it.

714
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,400
I did it, Mr. Phu.

715
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:58,440
I finally did it.

716
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,480
Veena.

717
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,600
I finally managed

718
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:08,080
to return the sapphire third eye
to Lord Naga Trinetr.

719
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,440
I did it.

720
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,800
I did it.

721
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,320
I did it.

722
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,480
Thank you all so much.

723
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,640
I finally did it.

724
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:57,640
How is Sun doing?

725
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:00,800
His condition is serious,

726
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:02,480
but he's out of surgery.

727
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,960
He was having difficulty breathing,

728
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,320
so he had to be given oxygen.

729
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,120
We'll have to monitor him
closely for a while.

730
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,960
Is his injury that serious, Chat?

731
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:16,840
Let's hope he gets better soon.

732
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:39,520
Sun.

733
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:41,840
Sun.

734
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,960
I think I get why he did it.

735
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,440
Prince Anucha saved his life.

736
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,440
He's like Sun's family.

737
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:04,400
Sun probably wanted to repay him

738
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,120
as best as he possibly could.

739
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,240
-You're right.
-Yes.

740
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,200
He was put in a difficult position.

741
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,920
He had to make a tough choice.

742
01:03:15,320 --> 01:03:18,160
Well, at least Sun's doing all right now.

743
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:21,560
Besides, Chat is keeping
a close eye on him.

744
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:23,720
I'm sure he will recover soon.

745
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:30,960
So where's Laorchan?

746
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:33,920
I'll tell her the news.

747
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,920
Sun will make it, right?

748
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:46,840
Don't you worry about that.

749
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:52,120
"I did it to protect you.

750
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,880
But since it has come to this,

751
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,040
I must tell you the truth."

752
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:03,080
Are you still hurt that Sun deceived you?

753
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:04,720
I'm just worried

754
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,000
that the Dhevaprom family won't accept me

755
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:09,000
