1
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,720
I will remember this day
for the rest of my life.

2
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,200
Just let me know when you are ready.

3
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,760
A woman like you

4
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,760
doesn't deserve Phu.

5
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,160
You have two minutes.

6
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,800
-What?
-What?

7
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,080
You were followed here.

8
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,440
-Mr. Phu.
-Mr. Phu.

9
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,880
The engagement ceremony
will take place here in this room.

10
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,240
I hope you don't mind, Uncle Chai Yai.

11
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,520
I'll have the decorator come tomorrow.

12
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,440
Be my guest.

13
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,320
This palace belongs to all of us
in the Jutathep family.

14
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,480
I've reserved this zone here

15
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,560
for the guest of honor.

16
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,200
The bride will sit on the left

17
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,720
and the groom will be on the right.

18
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,800
The guests will be sitting

19
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,480
on both sides here.

20
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,200
This side is for the Jutathep family.

21
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,720
This side is for the groom's family
from Viengphukhum.

22
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,360
As for the food,

23
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,080
there will be a Thai buffet

24
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,720
for both breakfast and lunch.

25
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,160
As for the wedding,

26
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,400
are you okay with having it
in the middle of the year, Kan?

27
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,920
What about the schedule for the ceremony?

28
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
All staff must be here before 4:00 a.m.

29
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,440
I've put Laorchan in charge
of all the preparations.

30
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,360
The groom's family procession
will set off at 9:00 a.m.

31
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,000
The auspicious time
for the exchange of rings is at 9:39 a.m.

32
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,040
Mr. Phu.

33
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,320
If the exchange of rings
takes place at 9:39 a.m.,

34
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,000
what time will the ceremony end?

35
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,040
I think

36
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,080
the ceremony will be over
at around 10:09 a.m.

37
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,200
I have 30 minutes.

38
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,760
Right, Jak.

39
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,160
You're in charge
of security at the reception.

40
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,840
Copy that.

41
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,080
Thank you all so much

42
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:16,920
for coming together
and making this happen for me.

43
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:21,160
When it's your turn,
I'll be your wedding planner.

44
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,320
Goodness.

45
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,360
You can start by planning
your brother's wedding.

46
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,920
He can't wait to get married.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,960
I can tell.

48
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,080
I agree.

49
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,600
Gosh.

50
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,760
You'll be married soon, Phu.

51
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,360
You might have to go through a lot

52
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,960
before that day comes.

53
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,960
But if it's for Laor,

54
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,760
I'm sure you would do anything.

55
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,560
Well…

56
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,240
He's doing it again.

57
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,640
He's rubbing his ear again.

58
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,960
-Damn. Look at him.
-My gosh.

59
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,640
-He's blushing.
-Phu.

60
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,640
Now that you're with Laor,

61
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,040
you've gone from being a tiger
to being a kitten.

62
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,120
He's totally whipped now.

63
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,160
Please don't mind them, Laor.

64
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,920
They are always like this
when they get together.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,520
Don't be alarmed.

66
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,280
Just wait until the whole gang is here.

67
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,800
Let me tell you,

68
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,880
-they raise hell.
-They raise hell.

69
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,280
I'm actually very shy.

70
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,440
Please.

71
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,920
Poom, you're the opposite of shy.

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,920
-Okay.
-Come on now.

73
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,160
Guilty as charged.

74
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,000
See? I called it.

75
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,400
You're all troublemakers.

76
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
LAYOUT

77
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,400
This is a rough layout of Jutathep Palace.

78
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,200
We're lucky they put you in charge

79
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,640
or you couldn't have done this

80
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,360
without raising suspicion.

81
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,760
Location 1 is the reception.

82
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,720
LOCATION 1

83
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,040
This is Location 2.

84
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,120
LOCATION 2

85
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,360
It's the library where the safe is.

86
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,320
Location 3 is the back door.

87
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,240
LOCATION 3

88
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,680
That's where I'll make my exit.

89
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,360
I'll run into the garden

90
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,040
which connects to the back wall.

91
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,440
I'll go to the far end.

92
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,400
GARDEN

93
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,640
There's a small door that opens

94
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,560
from the inside only.

95
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,960
That's Location 4.

96
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:18,920
LOCATION 4

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,160
You'll wait for me
outside at the Location 5,

98
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,120
which is this tree.

99
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,040
LOCATION 5

100
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,040
We only have 30 minutes, right?

101
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,720
Right.

102
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,600
I'll sneak out when everyone
is busy with the ceremony.

103
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,080
The ceremony starts at 9:39 a.m.
and ends at 10:09 a.m.

104
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,040
That means you should be out before 10:09.

105
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,280
If I'm not out by then,

106
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,120
it means our plan has failed.

107
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,640
You should get out of there quickly.

108
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,480
Don't let anyone find out

109
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,120
that you're involved with the plan
to steal the sapphire third eye.

110
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,600
No, I couldn't leave you.

111
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,320
I'll need you to help me from outside.

112
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,680
If we both get caught,

113
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,640
who's going to finish what we started?

114
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Before the big day,

115
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,160
you should scout out the palace.

116
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,680
All right.

117
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,360
Are you sure you don't need help

118
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,200
from my dad's men?

119
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,640
I'm sure.

120
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,880
It's easier if I do this alone.

121
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,480
Be careful, Sun.

122
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,560
Are you sure about this, Laor?

123
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,040
On the day,
I'll be at the palace from dawn.

124
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,040
Be on standby
at our meeting point at nine o'clock.

125
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,960
Wait for me there until exactly 10:09.

126
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,360
If I'm not out,
get out of there as fast as you can.

127
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,360
You'll make it.

128
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,240
We'll leave together.

129
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,280
We'll head to Nong Khai

130
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,360
and cross the river to Viengphukhum.

131
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,480
WACHIRA: SEE YOU IN 2 HOURS

132
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,360
How dare you snoop through my stuff?
You've crossed the line.

133
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:15,160
The colonel gave you this pager,
didn't he?

134
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,720
Give it back to him.

135
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,400
It's mine now. Why should I give it back?

136
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,920
If you do this,

137
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,520
you'll only have his things,

138
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,480
but you'll never have his heart.

139
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,120
Do you understand?

140
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,120
Gosh.

141
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,720
Hey, Veena.

142
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Veena.

143
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,840
Will you leave me alone?

144
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,600
Give it to me.

145
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,520
Look what you've done.

146
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,520
Now it's broken.

147
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,040
Stop meddling in my life.

148
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,320
Veena.

149
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,440
The colonel will be engaged in two days.

150
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,560
You should have realized by now

151
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,720
what you should do.

152
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,240
Are you really going to carry on
being his mistress?

153
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,280
There's no way you'd do that.

154
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,040
That's not who you are.

155
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,720
You think you know me,

156
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,040
but you don't know me at all.

157
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,400
What do you mean?

158
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,440
My life is mine to live.

159
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,480
I can choose my own path.

160
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,560
If you can't accept that,
you don't have to put up with it

161
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,200
because I'll be out of your life.

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,320
Veena. Wait, Veena.

163
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,160
Gosh.

164
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,800
Phu is bringing
his new secretary to meet you.

165
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,280
She's really beautiful.

166
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,240
Is that so?

167
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,760
Hey, Laor.

168
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,200
Will you make sure everything's ready?

169
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,560
All right.

170
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,920
There he is. Hey, Phu.

171
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,600
Phu is here.

172
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,160
-Hello.
-Hello.

173
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:17,280
It's going to be a busy day
for you as the party planner.

174
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,160
It's Kan's engagement party.

175
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,360
I'll do my best.

176
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,280
You're the best brother ever.

177
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,080
You bet.

178
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,080
Right, Laor.

179
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,480
This is Uncle Ronnaphee
and Aunt Peangkwan.

180
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,760
They're Jak and Poom's parents.

181
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,760
Everyone, this is Laorchan.

182
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,000
She's my secretary.

183
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,240
Hello.

184
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,360
Laorchan.

185
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,320
She's pretty, don't you think?

186
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,880
These two boys told me

187
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,120
that you have a girlfriend, Phu.

188
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,720
It wasn't me.

189
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,040
I didn't say anything.

190
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,440
This is Mr. Chinnakorn and Ms. Kedsara.

191
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,680
They own the jewelry shop
where you met Chavit.

192
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,000
Hello.

193
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,880
Were you talking about me, Phu?

194
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,120
Hello, Laor.

195
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,760
Hello, Mr. Chavit.

196
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
I'm honored to be of assistance to you

197
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,640
on this occasion.

198
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,240
Phu took you to our shop, didn't he?

199
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,880
Did Vit take good care of you
when you were there?

200
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,800
You can tell me if he was rude to you.

201
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,600
Not at all.
Chavit took great care of Laorchan and me.

202
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,840
I wouldn't be surprised
if Vit even flirted with her a little,

203
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,000
since she's so pretty.

204
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,520
Come on now, Poom.

205
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,360
I took good care of them.

206
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,280
By the way,

207
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,120
do not mention this to Lisa and Cheewa.

208
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,640
You boys are unbelievable.

209
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,840
Hey. It looks like Chai Yai is here.

210
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,600
Boys.

211
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,080
We should let Phu go and welcome Chai Yai.

212
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,240
All right.

213
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,040
Please excuse us.

214
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,360
Goodbye.

215
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,880
Vit, come and sit down.

216
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,360
Mom. Dad.

217
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,360
She's the one.

218
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,160
She's the girl I told you about.

219
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,680
Hello, Uncle Chai Yai.

220
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,280
Hello, Aunt Ravirumpai.

221
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,280
Hi, Phu.

222
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,840
Hello.

223
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,200
Hi, Laor.

224
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,320
Is this Laor,

225
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,040
your new secretary?

226
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,880
You should know by now that

227
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,360
there are no secrets
between Jutathep family members.

228
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,160
That's true.

229
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,880
Right, Laor.

230
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,040
This is Aunt Ravirumpai,
Uncle Chai Yai's wife.

231
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,440
This is Petch,

232
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,240
M.L. Asira Jutathep.

233
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,160
He's the chairman of the board
of JT Property Group.

234
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,840
And this is Ploy,

235
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,560
M.L. Anittha Jutathep.

236
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,240
She's the director of finance
and accounting at JT Property Group.

237
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,640
Hello.

238
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:26,720
It's nice to meet you two,
Mr. Petch, Ms. Ploy.

239
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,520
Hello.

240
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,760
Kan told me that Phu's secretary

241
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,200
is very capable and very pretty.

242
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,800
I'm glad we've finally met.

243
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,880
It's nice to meet you, Laor.

244
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,440
Likewise.

245
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,000
So why did you pick Laorchan
to be your secretary?

246
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,520
Is she right for the job

247
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,720
or right for you?

248
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,560
Well…

249
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,160
It was both.

250
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,080
I see.

251
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,200
Please come inside.

252
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,640
Uncle Phee is over there.

253
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,080
All right. Let's go in, everyone.

254
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
Okay.

255
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,560
Phu.

256
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,720
Hello, Uncle Phudhipat and Aunt Krongkaew.

257
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,880
Hello.

258
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,760
This is Uncle Phudhipat
and Aunt Krongkaew.

259
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,240
They're the parents of--

260
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,360
Hello, Laor.

261
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,880
I'm Major Dr. M.L. Chatklao Jutathep.

262
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,840
Have you met Laorchan before?

263
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,680
Or did someone tell you about her?

264
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,560
She's all everyone talks about.

265
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,200
I must say she looks exactly the way

266
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,960
everyone has described.

267
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,840
Poom and Jak got every detail right.

268
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,720
Dr. Chat is the eldest son

269
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,560
of Uncle Phudhipat and Aunt Krongkaew.

270
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,520
He has a sister named Pokked Jutathep.

271
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,560
She's now studying
fashion design in France.

272
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,240
Nice to meet you, Laor.

273
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,120
Nice to meet you too,
Ms. Krongkaew, Mr. Pat.

274
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,160
Please come inside.

275
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,440
Everyone's in there.

276
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,400
How's your love life?

277
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,400
-I can--
-Come on.

278
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,000
I can give you advice.

279
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,160
Let's go.

280
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,960
Come on in, Chai Rong.

281
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,480
Hey, Phu.

282
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,280
Have you greeted
Chai Rong and Ms. Wanrasa yet?

283
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,960
Hello, Uncle Chai Rong and Aunt Wanrasa.

284
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,960
Hello.

285
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:41,120
It's a shame Ruj has to be
in Switzerland with the ambassador,

286
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,680
or the whole gang would be here.

287
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,720
Right.

288
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,360
The whole gang would cause you
so much trouble.

289
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,280
Come on. They're not that bad.

290
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,520
Today's ceremony is the first
of many more to come

291
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,480
among these troublemakers.

292
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,720
So you'd better watch and learn.

293
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Okay.

294
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,160
The next one will probably
be Phu's wedding.

295
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,160
Well…

296
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,800
Let me know in advance
if you're having a wedding.

297
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:10,079
I'll tell Saruj so he can be here for it.

298
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,560
All right.

299
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,480
You two should head inside.
Everyone is already in there.

300
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,160
-Go on.
-Come on, dear.

301
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,359
Mom, Dad. Shall we check on Kan?

302
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,360
Good idea.
It's almost time for the ceremony.

303
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
In that case,

304
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,080
I'll go check on things downstairs.

305
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,040
Go ahead, dear.

306
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,880
You look so beautiful today, Kan.

307
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,040
You're all grown up

308
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,320
and you're ready to start your own family.

309
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,920
You know,

310
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,280
I'm going to miss you so much

311
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,760
once you move to Viengphukhum.

312
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,920
Is it too late to call off the engagement?

313
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,600
-Dad!
-You could stay home with me.

314
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,000
It's too late for that, Dad.

315
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,880
-Is it?
-I'm telling you.

316
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,640
Great-Grandma Orn
has a name ready for Kan's baby.

317
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,120
She has a name already?

318
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,360
Also, we have a plan to open
a department store in Viengphukhum.

319
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,560
Kan can run the business there.

320
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,480
All right. Okay.

321
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,520
That's good.

322
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,360
No matter where I am,

323
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:44,360
I'll always be your daughter.

324
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
My girl.

325
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,800
Thank you

326
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,200
for all your love and support.

327
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,520
You're a very lucky girl.
Do you know that?

328
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,480
Things have been
smooth sailing between you

329
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,480
and Wachira.

330
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,320
Your mom and I,

331
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,080
we weren't so lucky.

332
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,360
We faced so many obstacles.

333
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,560
So many.

334
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,920
But it has been almost 30 years
since then.

335
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,240
Your love for each other
has only grown stronger.

336
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,440
That's right.

337
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,160
-Mom.
-Yes?

338
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,440
What's the secret to a happy marriage?

339
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,640
Well…

340
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,960
-You should care for each other.
-Yes.

341
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,520
-Also, be kind to each other.
-Right.

342
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,560
Respect each other.

343
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,400
-Am I right?
-Well…

344
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,440
Yes.

345
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,080
You're right.

346
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,800
You see…

347
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,160
You!

348
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,160
You bring bad luck.

349
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,320
Hey, Sroifha.

350
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,480
Did you take a knife to our wedding?

351
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,320
I don't need anyone to cut this for me.

352
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,720
Hey.

353
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,320
You can sleep
by yourself tonight, Chai Lek.

354
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,600
You see, your mom has always

355
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,080
treated me with respect.

356
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,120
She's taken care of me

357
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,480
since the day we met

358
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,400
until today.

359
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,440
Yes.

360
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,640
I'm serious.

361
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,800
Come in.

362
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,840
Hey, there.

363
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,120
Excuse me.

364
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,200
It's almost time
for the ceremony, Ms. Kan.

365
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,760
The groom's procession
is at the front gate.

366
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,440
Are you ready?

367
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,840
Yes.

368
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,680
Well…

369
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,320
Phu, Laor has been running around all day.

370
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,840
Did she get any sleep?

371
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,360
I doubt it.

372
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,520
-She barely had time to eat.
-What?

373
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,720
These past few days,

374
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,560
she has been busy with the documentary
and Kan's engagement.

375
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,960
She's had no time to rest.

376
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,320
-I see.
-Listen.

377
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,640
Don't forget to get her
something to eat, Phu.

378
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,800
You don't want her to fall ill.

379
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,240
Yes, Dad.

380
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,560
After my wedding,

381
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,360
let's have a monk find you
an auspicious date for your engagement.

382
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,320
Right. That's a good idea.

383
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,320
-Well…
-Look at him.

384
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,120
I think it's a good idea.

385
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,440
I think so too.

386
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,040
-Right.
-I'd like that.

387
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,520
-All right.
-Okay.

388
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,560
That's good.

389
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,520
It's good to know what you want.

390
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,160
Hey, son.

391
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,560
Yes, Dad?

392
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,520
I want to tell you something.

393
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,440
Here are the keys
to a long and happy marriage.

394
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,160
You must be faithful to your partner.

395
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,240
Be patient with each other.

396
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,960
Learn to forgive each other's mistakes.

397
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,840
You're a man, so you must take the lead.

398
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,680
But you must also respect your wife.

399
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,880
Yes, Dad.

400
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,920
It's like that old saying.

401
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,760
The husband is the elephant's front legs.

402
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,520
And the wife is
the elephant's hind legs, right?

403
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,040
That's not always the case these days.

404
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,160
Then what's the wife supposed to be?

405
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,920
The wife is the elephant handler.

406
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,480
Isn't that right, dear?

407
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,360
That's right.

408
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,440
-The elephant handler?
-Yes.

409
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,640
So you'd better behave yourself.

410
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,760
Goodness.

411
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,920
Well, it's time.

412
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,560
Let's get into position.

413
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,800
Get ready, everybody.

414
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,440
All right.

415
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,720
Okay.

416
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,480
Here we are.

417
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,040
-Colonel.
-Yes?

418
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,520
Introduce yourself.

419
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,880
I, Colonel Wachira Wongsawan,

420
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,720
love Kan.

421
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,360
-What was that?
-Say it louder.

422
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,120
I didn't hear you. Can you say it again?

423
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,920
Say it louder. Come on.

424
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,760
I, Colonel Wachira Wongsawan,

425
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,680
love Kan with all my heart.

426
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,400
All right.

427
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,240
-That's good.
-Here, everyone.

428
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,200
Here you go.
Come get your envelope of cash.

429
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,880
Ms. Kan.

430
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,920
I wish you a very happy marriage.

431
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,280
You don't have to say it now.

432
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,600
You can do that later
since I won't let you leave early.

433
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,960
You must stay for the party.

434
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,200
Wait, Colonel.

435
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,040
You must prove that you're strong

436
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,320
since you're a soldier.

437
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,880
Do 100 push-ups now.

438
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,080
Yes, sir.

439
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,320
Can I just do five for now

440
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,840
and do the rest later?

441
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,120
He's negotiating.

442
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,400
Copy that!

443
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:56,560
-All right.
-Let's see what you're made of.

444
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,720
-One, two, two, two!
-One, two, two, two!

445
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,320
-Two!
-Two!

446
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,560
Okay. That's enough.
Let's hear it for him.

447
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
He looks flushed.

448
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,920
All right.

449
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,320
-Here's your envelope.
-Thank you.

450
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,480
Here you go.

451
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,320
I don't think it's enough.

452
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,920
-Oh, my.
-Goodness.

453
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,560
She got me good.

454
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,680
Thank you.

455
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,120
She'll be rich after this.

456
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,000
-You may pass.
-Thank you.

457
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,320
Hold on.

458
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,560
I think you need to give us
a little something too.

459
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,480
-Right.
-That's right.

460
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,440
I knew this would happen.

461
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,040
All right. He expected this.

462
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,000
-Here.
-Thank you, Colonel.

463
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,400
Lottery tickets.

464
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,120
-They're lottery tickets?
-I see.

465
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,440
Here you go.

466
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,080
-Here.
-Is it enough?

467
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,680
I don't think it's enough.

468
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,080
It's not enough.

469
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,160
We want more.

470
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,080
Have some more then.

471
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,680
Pass them around.

472
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,800
This one is for you, Mr. Phu.

473
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,040
You can have two.

474
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,160
That's all I have.

475
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,360
Okay.

476
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,960
Your money is also my money.

477
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,800
A husband's money is also his wife's.

478
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,280
But a wife's money

479
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,120
is hers alone.

480
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,360
Wait a minute, Ploy.

481
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,560
-I don't think that's right.
-That's wrong.

482
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,720
Colonel.

483
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,480
What's mine is also my wife's.

484
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:40,200
-Damn.
-Damn.

485
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,720
-What a good man.
-Right.

486
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,000
Gosh.

487
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,160
She has you whipped.

488
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,400
It's a good answer.

489
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,920
Shall we let him through?

490
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,920
Okay.

491
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,480
-Yes.
-All right.

492
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,680
You may pass.

493
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,720
Go on ahead.

494
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,320
You did well, Phu.

495
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,640
Give me some of the money you got.

496
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,280
Hey, Colonel.

497
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,080
Get a move on, will you?

498
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,840
-Hurry up.
-It's hot out here.

499
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,040
Go inside already.

500
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,560
Your bride's waiting, Colonel.

501
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,160
-Hurry up.
-Let's go.

502
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,760
Come on, guys.

503
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,880
Let's go inside.

504
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,120
Hello, dear.

505
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,560
All right.

506
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,520
Okay. Thank you, dear.

507
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,040
Go to your seat, Mr. Phu.

508
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,120
The ceremony's about to start.

509
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,120
But you look really pale, Laor.

510
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,520
You should sit down.

511
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,040
I'm worried about you.

512
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,840
Okay.

513
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,120
After you.

514
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,680
-Here.
-Thank you.

515
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,440
Welcome to the family.

516
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,320
Thank you.

517
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,880
Thank you, dear.

518
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:43,920
All right.

519
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,560
-This is for you.
-Thank you.

520
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,000
-This is for you.
-Thank you.

521
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,160
Thank you.

522
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,000
Okay.

523
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,320
I wish you happiness.

524
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,200
Take care of her.

525
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,400
Yes, sir.

526
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,160
The bride is okay-looking.

527
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,600
I'm so much prettier.

528
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,120
That's right.
You're the prettiest one here.

529
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,160
Laor, are you okay?

530
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,800
Are you sick?

531
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,840
I feel a little lightheaded

532
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,000
and I'm short of breath.

533
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,520
How about

534
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,840
you go and rest in Kan's dressing room?

535
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,280
-I'll go with you.
-No.

536
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,480
It's okay, Ms. Ploy.

537
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,880
I can go by myself.

538
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,720
You should stay here for the ceremony.

539
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,840
You can't go alone.

540
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,720
What if you faint on the way?

541
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,280
Phu will be so angry with me.

542
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,880
Come on. I'll take you.

543
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,160
Come on. I insist.

544
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,600
Come on in.

545
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,000
Have a seat here.

546
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,320
I'll get you some medicine.

547
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,720
Thank you.

548
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,280
But I think

549
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,320
I'll be all right.

550
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,320
I'll feel better once I've had some rest.

551
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,280
You should get back to the ceremony.

552
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,720
They will exchange rings soon.

553
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,080
Okay.

554
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,040
Then you stay here and rest.

555
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,640
Join us once you feel better.

556
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,400
I'll take care of everything.

557
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,600
Don't worry.

558
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,400
Thank you.

559
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,640
It's 9:38.

560
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,760
It's time.

561
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:29,800
You may exchange rings.

562
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,880
That diamond is so tiny, Mom.

563
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,360
I think the diamond ring we have

564
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,600
is so much bigger.

565
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,080
You're right.

566
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,720
You should've worn it today
to show these people up.

567
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,880
All right.

568
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,440
What a mediocre reception.

569
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,360
You're right.

570
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,600
Ploy, where's Laor?

571
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,720
She isn't feeling well.

572
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,520
She's in Kan's dressing room.

573
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,920
I offered to get her some medicine,
but she didn't want any.

574
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,360
Excuse me, Ploy.

575
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,480
All right.

576
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,840
The most important thing in a marriage

577
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,360
is to have trust.

578
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,600
Always cherish the love

579
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,280
that you have for each other.

580
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,000
Hurry and give me grandchildren, Kan.

581
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,880
-Great-Grandma.
-All right, Colonel?

582
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,200
Give me grandchildren soon.

583
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,040
There, there. Don't cry, dear.

584
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,680
You're all grown up.

585
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,000
Here.

586
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,080
Laor.

587
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,040
Laor.

588
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,840
Is she in the bathroom?

589
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,800
Laor.

590
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,120
Laor.

591
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,760
I'm coming in.

592
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,080
Laor.

593
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,760
Come on.

594
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,440
Damn it.

595
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,360
Okay.

596
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,480
Damn it.

597
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,600
Oh, no.

598
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,880
Hey, Phu.

599
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,440
Your dad's looking for you.

600
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,800
It's time to give our blessings.

601
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,320
All right.

602
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,240
Gosh.

603
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,760
It's almost ten o'clock.

604
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,440
Calm down, Laorchan.

605
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,440
You can do this.

606
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,360
Lord Naga Trinetr.

607
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,560
Please help me.

608
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:08,880
Yes.

609
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,480
I did it.

610
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,240
Yes.

611
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,560
Uncle Chai Yai.

612
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,640
Your Highness.

613
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,200
Phu, come with me.

614
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,680
What's the matter?

615
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,680
Someone stole the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

616
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,560
Come on.

617
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,840
What are you doing here,

618
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,840
Lieutenant Khumpheng, Sergeant Phathana?

619
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,840
We want the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

620
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,280
Hey.

621
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,640
Hello, Your Highness.

622
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,600
Laor.

623
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:39,200
Let's check over there.

624
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,760
We need to talk,

625
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,760
Princess Laorchan Phukhumwong.

626
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,640
You've been following my every move.

627
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:44,560
You know exactly
when I got back to Thailand.

628
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,280
You know why I came back.

629
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,240
I know you're Prince Veerawong's daughter.

630
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:54,040
Your grandpa is Prince Peerapong,

631
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,480
the sole heir of Prince Siwilai.

632
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,320
Which means you are
the great-granddaughter of Prince Siwilai.

633
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,520
I know where you're staying and with whom.

634
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,400
I even know Sun took you to martial arts

635
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,160
and weapons training.

636
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,760
You want the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

637
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,160
You knew about this all along,

638
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,320
yet you never told me.

639
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,040
I'm sorry, Phu.

640
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,160
I wanted you to be happy.

641
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,120
Happy?

642
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:31,400
It was all just a lie.

643
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,840
She must have her reasons.

644
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,480
She risked everything for the necklace.

645
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,040
Do you mean you knew all along?

646
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,440
I know who you are.

647
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,480
I knew you wanted the necklace.

648
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,160
But I wasn't sure why.

649
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,040
The only way to know for sure

650
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,640
was to give you a chance
to steal the necklace.

651
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,840
You let me see you open the safe.

652
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,240
Did you do that on purpose?

653
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,920
So you came and got me earlier because--

654
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,920
I knew Laorchan
was breaking into the safe.

655
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,160
This was the only way

656
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,520
to know for sure whether
she really wanted the necklace.

657
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,520
Who are you stealing it for?

658
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,520
Why do you want it?

659
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,200
Do you realize

660
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,560
that the necklace you stole

661
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,200
is a fake?

662
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,320
I didn't know that.

663
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,640
I didn't know you were playing me.

664
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,360
Just like I didn't know

665
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,240
that you were playing me all along.

666
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,640
Did you get close to me

667
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,440
just to get to the necklace?

668
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,040
Since you caught me,

669
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,000
you may do with me as you please.

670
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:21,960
I want to know who you work for.

671
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,280
Who's the leader of
the Thapana Association?

672
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,280
Where is he?

673
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,640
How would I know that?

674
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,280
I'm not one of the Thapana rebels.

675
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,640
But you're the sole surviving descendant
of Prince Siwilai,

676
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,080
who was the leader of the rebels.

677
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,800
He wasn't one of them.

678
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,320
The history books from
Viengphukhum may say he was,

679
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,520
but I swear

680
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,560
on my life

681
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,160
that the information
in those books is all lies.

682
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,520
That's why I need to make sure

683
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,920
that you're not one of them.

684
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,080
Do you think I'm the only one

685
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,960
who sent people
to keep an eye on you in France?

686
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,160
The rebels also want
the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

687
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,680
They know that you're the only one

688
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,400
who can bring them the necklace.

689
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,240
And they also know that

690
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,320
you're Prince Siwilai's flesh and blood.

691
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,120
That's impossible.

692
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,160
My dad took me

693
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,920
to live in France for almost 20 years.

694
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,480
My grandpa and my dad
never engaged in politics.

695
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,640
How could I be

696
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,600
a pawn in their political game?

697
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,440
Then answer our questions.

698
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Why do you want the necklace?

699
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,400
Who are you stealing it for?

700
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:55,840
Answer me.

701
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,920
Don't just sit there.

702
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,040
You want the Ajna Chakra Necklace

703
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,760
so badly that you were willing
to lie to me

704
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,280
and everyone else to get it.

705
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,680
What do you plan to do with it

706
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,560
if you're not part of
the Thapana Association?

707
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:15,680
Laorchan, if you insist
you're not one of the rebels,

708
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,880
can you tell me

709
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,800
why you want the necklace?

710
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:26,120
I just want to restore the reputation

711
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:29,600
and the dignity of my family.

712
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:32,600
I'll clear my great-grandpa's name

713
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,960
of all the things
he has been wrongly accused of.

714
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,720
How can a necklace

715
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,320
clear your family's name?

716
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,760
Isn't this necklace the reason

717
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,280
that my great-grandpa has been branded

718
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,320
a rebel leader up until this day?

719
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,960
If I can solve the mystery
that's hidden within this necklace,

720
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,240
everyone can finally learn
the secrets of the past.

721
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:03,400
It will change the history

722
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,960
of Viengphukhum.

723
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:06,920
Do you mean the mystery

724
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,400
that's hidden within
the Ajna Chakra Necklace

725
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,320
which can lead us to the temple

726
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,560
and the lost kingdom?

727
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,040
That's right, sir.

728
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,880
So the Ajna Chakra Necklace

729
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,160
really does contain a map,

730
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,680
just like the elders said?

731
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,840
Do you know where the map is hidden?

732
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,640
I don't know, Your Highness.

733
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,000
But if I can bring

734
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:42,120
this necklace back to the royal palace,

735
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:44,720
my dad told me that

736
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,000
something will show me the way.

737
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:51,320
On his deathbed,

738
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,560
my dad told me that

739
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,520
only a descendant of Prince Siwilai

740
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,360
can solve this mystery.

741
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:06,680
And I am his last remaining descendant.

742
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,040
This journal contains

743
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,520
your great-grandpa's account
of what happened.

744
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,240
It differs from what is taught
to kids in Viengphukhum.

745
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,040
Your great-grandpa was painted

746
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:27,640
as the leader of the Thapana Association,

747
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,240
which is not true.

748
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,560
I won't let my great-grandpa
be remembered as

749
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:36,360
a rebel leader any longer.

750
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,280
These are his letters.

751
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,560
They were passed down to your grandpa

752
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,120
and he passed them on to me.

753
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:56,720
It's our duty as Phukhumwongs
to clear our family name.

754
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,440
But I let my family down.

755
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,040
I couldn't do it.

756
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,320
My great-grandpa wanted
to protect the temple's treasure.

757
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,880
He didn't want the rebels
getting their hands on it.

758
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:11,840
How can it be that

759
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,160
The Thapana Association doesn't know this?

760
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,400
My dad said that General Luecha

761
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,000
only knew that there was treasure

762
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,760
hidden inside the lost kingdom.

763
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,520
He didn't know its location.

764
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,120
If we find the treasure,

765
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:30,160
we'll be able to prove that Prince Siwilai

766
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,400
never betrayed my great-grandpa.

767
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,400
That's right.

768
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,920
My great-grandpa not only
wanted to protect the treasure,

769
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,640
he also wanted us to return the sapphire

770
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:49,480
to the statue of Lord Naga Trinetr.

771
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,480
Where is Prince Siwilai's journal?

772
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:56,520
After Grandpa Peerapong moved to France,

773
00:53:58,040 --> 00:54:00,120
his house in Pailin City burned down.

774
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,280
All his remaining possessions

775
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,760
are probably kept in the royal museum.

776
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,680
If my great-grandpa's journal

777
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,800
wasn't lost in the fire,

778
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,200
it's probably there.

779
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:23,800
Wait.

780
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:26,480
Besides the Ajna Chakra Necklace,

781
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:29,000
did you also plan to steal the journal

782
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,000
from the Royal Museum?

783
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,040
Laor.

784
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,840
Sun.

785
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:53,080
Are you okay? You're safe, aren't you?

786
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,400
I was worried sick about you.

787
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,240
You didn't come out,
so I thought they caught you.

788
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,280
Things were so hectic at the reception.

789
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:07,560
I didn't get the chance
to see the plan through.

790
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,320
It's all right.

791
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,640
I'm just happy that you're safe.

792
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:18,160
But you could've let me know
you were safe.

793
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,040
It was torture

794
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,200
not knowing what happened to you.

795
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,640
I'm sorry I worried you.

796
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,800
Mr. Phu really works you hard.

797
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,400
Anyway,

798
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,680
what will we do about the necklace?

799
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,520
Mr. Phu and the prince might work out
what we're doing

800
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,520
if we don't act soon.

801
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,960
If they know who you are
and what you want,

802
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,360
it will be very dangerous.

803
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,840
I haven't changed my mind.

804
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:57,280
I'm going to find a way
to steal that necklace

805
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,960
after the exhibition is over.

806
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,240
We still have time.

807
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,840
I can never make you change your mind.

808
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,840
Very well.

809
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,960
I'll be with you every step of the way,

810
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,600
come hell or high water.

811
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,120
I won't change my mind either.

812
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,400
Thank you so much, Sun.

813
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,200
If I didn't have you,

814
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,240
I don't know what I'd do.

815
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,760
Without you,

816
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,040
I would have nothing to live for.

817
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,200
I promise

818
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,560
I will protect you with my life.

819
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,440
Even if I had to fight
every person on this earth,

820
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:02,440
I'd do it.

821
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,360
Thank you, Sun.

822
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,960
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.

823
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,720
Okay.

824
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,480
What's Suriya's role in this?

825
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,160
Sun has nothing to do with this.

826
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,760
But he could be

827
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,200
part of the Thapana Association.

828
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,520
That's impossible.

829
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,320
Sun is my best friend.

830
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:24,160
He's never shown an interest in politics.

831
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,560
I am confident that
Sun has nothing to do with them.

832
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,800
So you're taking his side.

833
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,560
I'm speaking up for my friend.

834
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,400
Sun has warned me many times

835
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,760
how dangerous this is.

836
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,760
I didn't listen to him.

837
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,560
I think I know him well enough.

838
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,440
Am I just a clown in your eyes?

839
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:53,480
All my life,

840
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:56,440
I've never trusted anyone easily.

841
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:58,760
You're the first one

842
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,040
who won me over

843
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,560
and you completely fooled me.

844
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,240
Hats off to you, Laorchan.

845
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,680
So your purpose is

846
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,720
to clear your great-grandpa's name?

847
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:29,640
That's right.

848
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,320
That's my ultimate goal.

849
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,240
Then I think we have to work together.

850
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,120
We'll uncover the truth

851
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,240
about your great-grandpa,

852
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,120
about Suriya,

853
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:54,120
and about the sapphire third eye.

854
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,200
But Suriya

855
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:01,680
cannot know what happened today.

856
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,080
Okay?

857
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,920
Princess Laorchan.

858
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,840
Mr. Phu.

859
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,600
I'm sorry.

860
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,480
I'm really sorry.

861
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:11,720
HAPPENING

862
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,400
Let's finish our conversation
from earlier.

863
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,640
What is it?

864
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:56,800
Will you be my girlfriend, Laor?

865
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,440
First and foremost,
there should be trust between us.

866
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,000
If you don't trust me,

867
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,240
how can we move forward together?

868
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,040
When you get home,

869
01:03:17,120 --> 01:03:19,360
can you message me to let me know?

870
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,360
Okay.

871
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:27,120
If something happens
that causes us to break up,

872
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,040
we can end things quietly.

873
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,680
Just like how things started.

874
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,160
Phu.

875
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,880
It's okay.

876
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:08,520
Come on, Phu.

877
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,440
I never thought…

878
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,320
that trusting

879
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,640
and confiding in someone

880
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:22,160
would make me feel like this.

881
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,120
I never thought

882
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:29,960
a girl would use me like this.

883
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:35,720
I know how you feel.

884
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,360
If it were me,

885
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,560
I would be angry too.

886
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,240
I just want to tell you that

887
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,040
I don't want you to make a decision

888
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,520
when you're still upset like this.

889
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:51,560
All right?

890
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,440
Wait until you've calmed down.

891
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,320
Then you can talk to Laor.

892
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,200
It's obvious, Dad.

893
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:14,560
I got played.

894
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,760
That woman

895
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,360
only came into my life

896
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:24,640
because she wanted that necklace.

897
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:28,720
And once she has the necklace,

898
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,560
she will walk out of my life.

899
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:37,320
But if I were Laorchan,

900
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,760
I would have done the same thing.

901
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,880
Protecting my family

902
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:46,560
is the most important thing to me.

903
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,360
But to use someone
by making them fall in love with you,

904
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,520
making them trust you,

905
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:53,720
and care for you,

906
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:56,040
that's just unacceptable.

907
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,240
What she did to me,

908
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,840
she might as well have killed me.

909
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,440
But I believe that

910
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:05,560
Laorchan is willing to do anything.

911
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:08,800
She's putting her life at stake for this.

912
01:06:10,040 --> 01:06:11,360
I'm not saying that

913
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:14,560
what Laorchan did was right.

914
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:16,920
But I want you

915
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:20,040
to look at things from her perspective.

916
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,640
Phu.

917
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:34,600
Come here.

918
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:48,160
You know what?

919
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:53,200
I don't think

920
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,360
you're the only one

921
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,040
who's hurt

922
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,280
and heartbroken.

923
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,600
The person

924
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,400
who tells a lie

925
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,440
might feel heartbroken,

926
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,720
perhaps even more so

927
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:14,960
than the person who has been lied to.

928
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:23,840
Phu.

929
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:29,920
It's all right.

930
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,720
It will be very dangerous.

931
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:45,360
I've already decided,
I'm willing to die for this.

932
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:48,280
Laor has taken on
one of the most dangerous tasks.

933
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:49,880
That woman

934
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,920
means nothing to me now.

935
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,920
I want you to follow the plan
that you have made with Sun.

936
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:57,040
I believe that Sun will lead us

937
01:07:57,120 --> 01:07:59,520
to the true leader of
the Thapana Association.

938
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,200
Get in there.

939
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:05,960
You really are a descendant
of Prince Siwilai.

940
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,640
Do you trust us?

941
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,240
If I didn't trust you,

942
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:11,000
I wouldn't be here.

943
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:54,319
