1
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,960
-Watch out.
-My gosh.

2
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,280
You've finally shown your face.

3
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,040
You traitor.

4
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,440
Anucha, you--

5
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,400
"I want to marry you."

6
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,600
Mee.

7
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,840
-She's alive. She's not a ghost.
-Could it be…

8
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,040
-Nhu See?
-Nhu See?

9
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,960
We're heading
to Three Pagoda Temple in Pailin.

10
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,440
Do you have a guide?

11
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,120
I'll be your guide.

12
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,440
The old lady said only a few hunters have
ever returned from Pha Diao Dai Cliff.

13
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,040
Your husband must have been
a skillful hunter.

14
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,040
Skills are not enough.

15
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,640
Remaining calm is the key.

16
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,280
My husband and I almost died
trying to leave the forest.

17
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,200
Is the forest that scary, Nhu See?

18
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,880
The forest is cursed.

19
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,240
Whoever enters the forest disappears.

20
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,960
Those who make it out alive

21
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,760
either fall ill or go crazy.

22
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,880
We have no choice,

23
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,000
but to pass through the forest.

24
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,760
How much further do we have to travel
after we pass through the forest?

25
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,360
We'll worry about that
if we manage to get out alive.

26
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,840
Let's go.

27
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,160
It's the way to the cliff.

28
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,200
It's a cursed valley.

29
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,480
Everyone must pray to the spirits
before entering to ensure their safety.

30
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,440
I'm going to perform a ritual to ask
the spirits for permission to enter.

31
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,920
Put your hands together, focus,
and repeat after me.

32
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,560
Dear spirits

33
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,520
and guardian angels of Pha Diao Dai Cliff,

34
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,360
we promise to adhere

35
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,040
to the five precepts

36
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,680
and cleanse our bodies and minds.

37
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,760
-We will not disrespect you
-We will not disrespect you

38
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,600
-or touch anything unpermitted.
-or touch anything unpermitted.

39
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,760
If we break our promise,

40
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,720
you may punish us.

41
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,360
Amen.

42
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,400
Hey.

43
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,440
How scary can it be to cross one mountain?

44
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,320
The elders likely made up
the curse to deter people

45
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,280
from hunting and logging.

46
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,520
I agree.

47
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,240
This is your last chance.

48
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,680
You have two options.

49
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,520
You either return to the village safely
or go up and risk never returning.

50
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,880
I'm going up, even if I have to go alone.

51
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,600
We have come too far to turn back.

52
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,640
What's happening?

53
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,320
Let's go.

54
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,200
We came directly here

55
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,480
from signing a training contract
with the Marine Corps

56
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,760
after our flight arrived in Bangkok

57
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,640
from England.

58
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,080
This isn't an ordinary visit, is it?

59
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,960
Is there something
we need to know, Bak Joi?

60
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,160
Yes.

61
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,480
Not many people know about this.

62
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,160
His Majesty asked me not to tell you

63
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,160
since he didn't want you to worry.

64
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,560
But I think it's important that you know.

65
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,760
What is it?

66
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,960
Three days ago,
there was an attempted assassination

67
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,720
on the King and Queen
while they were visiting the people.

68
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,840
Are they safe?

69
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,920
Yes, they are.

70
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,920
The King was almost shot.

71
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,200
Fortunately, Prince Anucha
used himself to shield the king.

72
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,000
Prince Anucha?

73
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,960
Yes.

74
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,720
So,

75
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,320
was Prince Anucha

76
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,760
badly hurt?

77
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,280
He's fine now, sir.

78
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,600
We managed to kill
four Thapana Association leaders,

79
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,480
including

80
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,240
Prince Kedsada.

81
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,720
He was one of the leaders.

82
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,520
Now that the leaders are dead,

83
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,000
does this mean it's over?

84
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,880
Not necessarily.

85
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,000
The problem we must address

86
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,840
is how the rebels found out

87
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,880
about the trip.

88
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,280
Do you think

89
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,280
there might be a spy close to them?

90
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,360
Everybody in the palace is a suspect.

91
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,480
Kan.

92
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Book me on the next flight
to Viengphukhum.

93
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,320
Me too.

94
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,160
I had plans to go there
to check on the site for the planned mall.

95
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,680
Let me come with you.

96
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,840
The easiest route

97
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,520
through the forest

98
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,120
is to head north.

99
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,520
But the problem is our surroundings

100
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,240
don't match the map.

101
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,960
I think Sun can help us.

102
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,240
Sun, I need your help with the map.

103
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,640
I'm coming.

104
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,280
Sub-Lieut. Khumpheng.

105
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,800
Where are Sgt. Maj Manee
and Sgt. Maj Phathana?

106
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,440
They went to collect
bamboo shoots, Colonel.

107
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,800
-I wonder what we'll find.
-We should be able to find something.

108
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,840
Look.

109
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,680
Jackpot. It's a bamboo tree.

110
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,520
-We'll have a feast. What?
-Hold on. Wait a second.

111
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,200
-You always disappear when I need you.
-I'll be right back.

112
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,480
I can't hold it anymore.

113
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,840
Dear spirits, please grant us permission

114
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,800
to take the fruits and plants to eat.

115
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,640
Hey, what are you doing?

116
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,560
Ask the spirits for permission first.

117
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,120
It's too late for that.
I couldn't hold it anymore.

118
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,200
You can still pray now.

119
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,640
Did you bring a rope with you?

120
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,880
No, I only have a knife.

121
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,680
Find a rope.

122
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,240
-Wait here.
-Okay.

123
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,560
Be careful.

124
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,760
Nhu See.

125
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,200
How many more days
until we get through this forest?

126
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,040
When I was here with the hunters,
we traveled for over a week on foot

127
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,840
and honored every promise
made to the spirits.

128
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,120
I found a rope.

129
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,680
-I got it.
-Bring it to me.

130
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,880
Stay away.

131
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,720
-Don't bite me.
-What's wrong with you?

132
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,720
-Stay away.
-Hey.

133
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,680
-I'm out of here.
-Hey.

134
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,280
-I'm out of here.
-Hey.

135
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,280
What's with you? Where are you going?

136
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,520
What's with him? Hey, wait for me.

137
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,280
-Hey.
-Help.

138
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,320
Hey, stay here.

139
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Don't follow me. I'm scared.

140
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,680
What the hell was that?

141
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,840
Manee.

142
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,200
No.

143
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,400
No.

144
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,520
Manee, calm down. What's wrong?

145
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,480
Manee.

146
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,040
Get off me.

147
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,040
Leave me alone. Get off.

148
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,360
Did you cut down vines
without asking the forest spirits?

149
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,400
I think so. What do we do?

150
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,800
Go help him.

151
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,360
Get off me.

152
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,400
No.

153
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,600
Phathana.

154
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,400
Manee, pull yourself together. Manee.

155
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,240
Get off me.

156
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,640
Go away.

157
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,000
-Don't follow me.
-Manee.

158
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,040
Manee.

159
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,440
Manee.

160
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,400
Manee.

161
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,240
Manee.

162
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,440
Mr. Chat.

163
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,800
My brother.

164
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,680
You must be careful
of those closest to you.

165
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,960
You must be referring to Prince Anucha.

166
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,520
Honestly speaking,

167
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,400
these past years,

168
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,840
he has proven

169
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,000
his loyalty to me

170
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,800
and Viengphukhum.

171
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,480
He even showed that he was willing

172
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,240
to sacrifice his life for mine.

173
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,680
You can trust him, but not blindly.

174
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,440
Even if Prince Anucha isn't the spy,

175
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,800
it's someone

176
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,640
who knew your itinerary.

177
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,920
It'll be someone unexpected

178
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,480
or someone you overlook.

179
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,040
We don't have evidence

180
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,600
tying Prince Anucha
to the Thapana Association.

181
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,640
As far as I can see,

182
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,040
he is working hard
to investigate the assassination,

183
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,880
and he blames himself

184
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,800
for failing to protect me
and Queen Chanta.

185
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,760
He warned us about Prince Kedsada.

186
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,160
We cannot lower our guards
just because he's dead.

187
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,760
Thapana Association

188
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,640
might appoint someone to replace him.

189
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,319
This is the ultimate punishment

190
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,680
for those who dare
to betray the Thapana Association.

191
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
Our ideology is strong.

192
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,600
We are Thapana brothers.

193
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,880
The heart of Viengphukhum.

194
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,600
-The heart of Viengphukhum.
-The heart of Viengphukhum.

195
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,880
-The heart of Viengphukhum.
-The heart of Viengphukhum.

196
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,840
-The heart of Viengphukhum.
-The heart of Viengphukhum.

197
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,560
We will not stop

198
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,840
until we conquer Viengphukhum.

199
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,160
Let's go.

200
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,360
Wait.

201
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
Do us a favor

202
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,400
and let us catch our breath.

203
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,600
What's happening, Nhu See?

204
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,880
It's the spirits.

205
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,640
The meringue.

206
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,240
Is that all of you?

207
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,080
It's ruined. It's completely ruined.

208
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,960
Laor, are you okay?

209
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,320
I'm fine.

210
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,040
Look at you. You're bleeding.

211
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,840
I'm so glad you are worried about me.

212
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,640
Mr. Phu, it's not the time to joke around.

213
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,040
Does it hurt?

214
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,440
I don't mind the pain
as long as you are safe.

215
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,400
Mee, are you okay?

216
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,600
Are you hurt?

217
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,040
I'm glad you still remember that name.

218
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,400
My apologies, Your Highness.
I didn't mean to do that.

219
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,120
It's your job

220
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,680
as my bodyguard to protect me.

221
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,520
Are you all right?

222
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,400
Jhao.

223
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,840
Jhao, where are you?

224
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,160
Jhao.

225
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,160
Are you here?

226
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,600
-Jhao.
-This way.

227
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,440
-Jhao.
-Let's go.

228
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,040
Jhao.

229
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,560
Are you hurt?

230
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,960
No, I'm fine.

231
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,040
What about you? Are you all right?

232
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,560
I'm fine.

233
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,120
Are you sure?

234
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,360
Did falling down the hill make you blush?

235
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,160
I said I'm fine.

236
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,640
Where is everyone else?

237
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,680
Stay with him. I'll find the others.

238
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,200
Okay.

239
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,040
Are you okay, Mr. Phu?

240
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,400
Yes.

241
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,480
But… Oh, no.

242
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,280
My head hurts so much.
I've lost a lot of blood.

243
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,000
It's the other side.

244
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,720
Oh, no. It hurts so badly.

245
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,280
How can it hurt so much?

246
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,920
Let's just go.

247
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,000
Can you save the romance
for another time, Phu?

248
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,240
That was Chat.

249
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,240
Chat.

250
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,240
Chat.

251
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,840
Chat, where are you?

252
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,040
Up here.

253
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,640
It's you, Chat.

254
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,640
What are you doing up there?

255
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,720
Mr. Phu. Ms. Laor.

256
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,760
Are you okay, Mr. Phu?

257
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,680
I'm fine.
Chat's the one you should worry about.

258
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,160
Where is he?

259
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,720
Up there.

260
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,960
Mr. Chat.

261
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,720
What are you doing up there?

262
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,560
What do you think I'm doing?

263
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,440
Have you never heard of a fight or flight?

264
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,680
I got an adrenaline rush while fleeing.

265
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,360
I climbed up here like a pro.

266
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,400
But now I can't get down.

267
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,120
Let's go, everyone.

268
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,160
Phu.

269
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,400
That's not funny. Help me first.

270
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,720
Wait there. We'll save you.

271
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,840
Let's do this.

272
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,400
He's unbelievable.

273
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,200
-How do I get down?
-Give us your bag.

274
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,640
Give us your bag first.

275
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,320
I can't let go.

276
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,520
-Be gentle, doctor.
-Endure the pain.

277
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:29,000
You will likely develop a fever tonight
so don't take a bath.

278
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,720
The river is too far away.

279
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,200
Clean yourself with a damp cloth.

280
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,720
I'll do it for you.

281
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,120
No, thanks. I can do it myself.

282
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,040
Come on, let me take care of you,
my brother-in-law.

283
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,840
Save your energy to collect water
from the river, my brother-in-law.

284
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,760
Let's go and bathe.

285
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,160
Send our soldiers to collect water
for the ladies to shower here.

286
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,160
After that, we'll eat dinner and rest.

287
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,680
Yes.

288
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,640
Go and collect water for the ladies.

289
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,480
Sun, let's go.

290
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,320
Okay.

291
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,400
Phu.

292
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,840
Don't forget to act sick.

293
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,840
Go and bathe already.

294
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,320
Use this to clean yourself.

295
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,200
Thanks.

296
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,160
Nhu See, what's the matter?

297
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,080
You look troubled.

298
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,200
A storm. An earthquake.

299
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,680
The spirits are clearly warning us
that danger is approaching.

300
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,800
What could be worse than Manee's death?

301
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,280
No matter how dangerous it is,

302
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,920
we will get through it

303
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,720
by sticking together. Trust me.

304
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,760
Everything will be okay.

305
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,280
It's you, Laor.

306
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,880
How long have you been there?

307
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,600
Let me do it.

308
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,320
Lately, we haven't had a chance
to speak in private.

309
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,200
I'm here now.

310
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
So if you have something to say,

311
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,120
now is the time.

312
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,360
So?

313
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,080
I forgot what I was going to say.

314
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,600
My mind went blank
while looking at your face.

315
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,040
You are very attractive.

316
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,840
Have you finished cooking already?

317
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
Yes.

318
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,880
Why don't we go for a walk?

319
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Sure.

320
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,680
Hey, isn't that Phu and Laor?

321
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,600
What are they up to?

322
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,600
Wait, Sun.

323
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,320
Laor…

324
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,880
They are just taking a walk.

325
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,840
When two people like each other,

326
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,320
they usually want some privacy.

327
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,520
He's right. Let's not bother them.
They will be back soon.

328
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,000
But it's dark now, doctor.

329
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,440
They won't go far. They will be back soon.

330
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,480
We should head back.

331
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,400
-Let's go.
-Come on.

332
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,640
Let's go.

333
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,440
It's time to head back.

334
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,920
Isn't it pretty?

335
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,520
Yes.

336
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,600
As beautiful as a painting.

337
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,560
Both the stars

338
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,640
and the woman I love.

339
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,080
Do you really like me?

340
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,960
Do you still doubt my love for you?

341
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,400
Even a blind person would be able to see

342
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,000
how much I love you.

343
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,920
Are you sure you love me?

344
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,440
Yes.

345
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,040
Stop dragging me.

346
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,120
Let go of me already.

347
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,840
Fine, I'll stop.

348
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,639
I'll take care of it.

349
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,480
Tiny.

350
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,800
What are you cooking?

351
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:58,520
I'm grilling the fish and
the salted beef Huean gave us.

352
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,840
It's nothing special.

353
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,840
It smells delicious.

354
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,480
The food may not be special,

355
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,320
but the chef is.

356
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,600
Isn't that right?

357
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,120
He didn't say it. I said it for him.

358
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,920
I can read him like a book.

359
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,440
Just smell that.

360
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,440
It's the smell of love.

361
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,480
Go away.

362
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,440
-Is this ready to eat?
-Yes.

363
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,160
We're back.

364
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,480
Wait.

365
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,240
Where's Phu?

366
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,520
He was washing in his tent when I left.

367
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Where did he go?

368
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,600
But he was with you.

369
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,760
What?

370
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,360
Laor has been with me. We went to
collect mushrooms and chilis.

371
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,280
See?

372
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,240
But we saw Mr. Phu with you earlier.

373
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:06,400
Yes.

374
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,720
I can confirm that Laor left with Nhu See.

375
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,920
What?

376
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,280
Who was Phu with then?

377
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,440
Stop!

378
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,600
It's a werecat.

379
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,840
Phu.

380
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,280
Khumpheng, watch out.

381
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,560
Hey.

382
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,840
I'm the person you want.

383
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,160
Phu, are you hurt?

384
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,280
Just a little.

385
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:53,080
Mr. Phu, behind you!

386
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,640
Oh, no.

387
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,160
Shoot the lantern!

388
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,240
-Mr. Phu!
-Phu!

389
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,480
-Mr. Phu!
-Mr. Phu!

390
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,840
Are you hurt?

391
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,280
Just a little, Chat.

392
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,120
I couldn't believe my eyes.
I had never seen a werecat before.

393
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,920
What kind of creature is it?

394
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,360
We couldn't shoot it or stab it.

395
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,000
Legend has it they are people
with powerful magic

396
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,720
who can transform into a tiger.

397
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,360
But some hunters say
they are tigers that are possessed

398
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,640
by one of the human souls they fed on.

399
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,480
Werecats shapeshift into their prey,

400
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,960
including women,

401
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,640
children, elders,

402
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,600
or even monks,

403
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,240
to lure people into the forest

404
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,560
so they can eat them.

405
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,080
I see.

406
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,400
I thought we were having a romantic time.

407
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,680
But it turned out she almost ate me.

408
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,680
Why did the werecat choose me
as her prey though?

409
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,000
Was it because

410
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,960
I was the most handsome one?

411
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,840
She knew you were injured.
She could smell your blood.

412
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,840
If the werecat was indeed
a magical creature,

413
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,640
why couldn't you stop it
with your enchanted knife?

414
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,040
Because a werecat's heart

415
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,520
lies in the flame she brings with her.

416
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,640
I see. I get it now.

417
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,600
Laor destroyed her soul

418
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,400
when she shot the lantern.

419
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,120
We have to be more careful.

420
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,720
From now on, no one is allowed
to wander around alone.

421
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,920
Please protect my brother
and the Queen, Anucha.

422
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,720
It's my duty to protect them.

423
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,080
I wish I could stay longer,

424
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,840
but Sroi and I must fly back to sign
a contract for the hotel construction.

425
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,640
However, Kan will stay behind
as she has further business here.

426
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:43,520
I'm planning to buy a plot of land
for the upcoming mall before I return.

427
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,240
I see. You can stay
at the palace with us then.

428
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,960
That's all right.
It's more convenient to stay at a hotel.

429
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,160
Since Kan will need
to go outside every day,

430
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,440
she might disturb people at the palace.

431
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,480
I see.

432
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:05,200
In that case, she needs
someone to keep her safe.

433
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,760
Send a trusted female bodyguard

434
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:12,640
to protect and help Kan
at the hotel, Anucha.

435
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

436
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,560
Salika used to work
with the Department of Lands.

437
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,000
She should be well acquainted
with matters of city planning.

438
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,040
I believe

439
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,200
she will be the perfect advisor for Kan.

440
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,640
I have requested her presence.

441
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,760
Salika is a good candidate.

442
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,560
She's a distant relative of mine.

443
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,520
She's competent and trustworthy.

444
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

445
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,600
General.

446
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,080
I heard you are going on
a business trip today.

447
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,040
I have a meeting in Japan.

448
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:56,200
I will return promptly
once the meeting is over.

449
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,240
Have a safe flight.

450
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,920
Thank you, sir.

451
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,920
Did you want to see me, Your Majesty?

452
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,920
I would like you

453
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,120
to take care of my niece during her stay.

454
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,040
What do you say?

455
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,680
I'd be happy to.
It's an honor to serve you.

456
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,440
Salika.

457
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,880
This is Kanthika, my niece.

458
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,600
Kanthika, this is Salika.

459
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,680
Greetings, Kanthika.

460
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,160
Hello.

461
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,760
Thank you for your help, Salika.

462
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,120
You are very welcome.

463
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,960
All right then. We should go.

464
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,480
Goodbye.

465
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,240
See you, General.

466
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,960
Jhao, we should find somewhere to rest.

467
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,720
We've walked a long way.

468
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,760
I believe the entrance is that way.

469
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,760
Let's get some rest.

470
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,840
Let's go.

471
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,160
Follow me.

472
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,440
Would you like water, Veena?

473
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,080
Why is he so energetic?

474
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,320
Be careful.

475
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:03,200
This place is safe. We can sleep here.

476
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,000
-Guys, would you like some water?
-Yes.

477
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,520
-Actually, I have water.
-I'm so thirsty.

478
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,640
Let Veena drink first.

479
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,320
We have to cross to this location.

480
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,480
It's quite far.

481
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,080
Our journey here will be a little rough.

482
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,640
Do you think Nhu See is familiar
with the path?

483
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,960
We are here.

484
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,080
-Pass it on.
-Here.

485
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,440
We will have to walk
for a while to reach this spot.

486
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,680
Mr. Phu.

487
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,320
Thank you.

488
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,440
Laor.

489
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,200
Your hand is freezing cold.

490
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,920
You could be coming down with a fever.

491
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,360
Chat.

492
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,800
Come and look at this.

493
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,760
Come.

494
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,600
Here we are. How many days do you think
it will take us to reach the temple?

495
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,120
You are fine.

496
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,800
According to the map,

497
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,520
the path will get tougher as we go.

498
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:31,840
It will take us…

499
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,840
Unless Nhu See is familiar with the path.

500
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,840
Who's there?

501
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,640
It's a ghost!

502
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,560
Run!

503
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,120
-Go!
-Hurry!

504
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,000
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

505
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,160
Hurry.

506
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,120
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

507
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,520
Faster.

508
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,360
Faster.

509
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,880
Mai!

510
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,440
-Mai!
-Phathana.

511
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,040
Let go of me.

512
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:17,960
Let go.

513
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,800
Faster.

514
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,000
Come on.

515
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,480
It's a cave. Let's hide in there.

516
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,640
Let's hide here. Come on.

517
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,040
We are not dead yet, are we?

518
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,120
My heart is still beating.

519
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,120
We're still alive.

520
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,800
Where are Sawan and Samai?

521
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,880
They sacrificed their lives

522
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,480
to keep us safe.

523
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:19,600
Why did the ghost come after us?

524
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,320
Do you know, Nhu See?

525
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,440
I sensed black magic from the ghost.

526
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,000
I think somebody summoned it.

527
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,240
Black magic?

528
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,120
Could it be

529
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,760
the pot I stepped on?

530
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,200
What did you say?

531
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,160
Wait. How did that slime get on your shoe?

532
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:57,560
I think it got there
when I stepped on a pot

533
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:59,480
at the previous spot.

534
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:02,280
There was a small pot.

535
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,000
What's the matter, Nhu See?

536
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,080
I think

537
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,080
Mr. Chat broke the pot
that contained the ghost.

538
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,320
What?

539
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,400
What ghost?

540
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:23,920
They say

541
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,720
these ghosts used black magic on people,

542
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,320
but the spell was reversed.

543
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,600
They possess humans, using them as hosts.

544
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:36,440
It's following you

545
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,200
because its slime got on you.

546
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:44,360
No.

547
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,280
No.

548
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,400
Mr. Chat.

549
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:57,520
The noise has stopped.

550
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:58,920
It won't follow us.

551
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,680
I'm here.

552
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:08,280
What are you playing at, doctor? Get up.

553
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,800
It's not the time to joke around.

554
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,080
What's wrong with you?

555
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,920
Phu.

556
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,440
What's wrong?

557
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,880
He's possessed.

558
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,040
The enchanted knife, Nhu See.

559
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,760
-The enchanted knife.
-The enchanted knife won't work.

560
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,800
Everyone, hold him.

561
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:45,680
-All of you will die!
-Hold him!

562
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,720
-Doctor.
-Chat.

563
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:50,760
-Chat.
-Let go of me!

564
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:52,360
Phu, what's wrong with him?

565
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,960
-I don't know.
-Let go of me!

566
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,440
All of you will die!

567
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,040
-Let go of me!
-Dr. Chat, calm down.

568
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:00,880
-Let go of me!
-Doctor, calm down.

569
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,360
-Phu, what's wrong with him?
-I don't know.

570
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,520
Calm down, Dr. Chat.

571
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,920
Doctor.

572
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,720
Let go of me!

573
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,640
Calm down.

574
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,120
Can I help you with anything?

575
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,600
Did they upset you?

576
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,000
They were trespassing on my land.

577
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,200
I believe

578
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,360
it wasn't their intention to disturb you.

579
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,080
They only wished to borrow your home

580
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,800
to set up a temporary camp.

581
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:49,640
Forgive them.

582
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:53,240
Why should I listen to you?

583
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,000
Why?

584
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,120
Take a good look at yourself.

585
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,520
Are you happy with your current being?

586
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:11,640
By showing them mercy,

587
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,720
you will be able to go

588
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,960
to a better place.

589
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,320
Forgive each other.

590
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,360
Guys.

591
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,360
-Mr. Chat.
-Mr. Chat.

592
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,040
-Mr. Chat.
-Mr. Chat.

593
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:55,720
-Doctor.
-Mr. Chat.

594
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,560
-Mr. Chat.
-Mr. Chat.

595
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,160
-Doctor.
-Slowly.

596
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:02,520
-Dr. Chat.
-Be careful.

597
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:03,560
Chat.

598
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:10,760
Is that you?

599
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,120
What's with you?

600
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,320
You were possessed by a ghost.

601
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,440
No, I wasn't.

602
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,280
You were.

603
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,080
No, I wasn't.

604
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,760
We all saw it. I'm certain.

605
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,040
Was I possessed by a ghost?

606
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,440
Yes.

607
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,120
I invite you

608
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:50,440
to spend the night here with me.

609
00:53:52,840 --> 00:53:55,720
I wouldn't know what to say
to Great-Grandma Orn if you died.

610
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,080
Tomorrow, Yingfah will take you to see
a plot of land in Feuangvieng

611
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,600
at 10:00 a.m.

612
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,760
Thank you.

613
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:14,320
To be honest, you don't need
to stay at the hotel with me.

614
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,120
You can stay at the palace.

615
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,120
The King ordered it.

616
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,800
Don't worry about it.

617
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,240
Thank you.

618
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:25,840
I'll see you in the lobby
at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow then.

619
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,200
Okay, Ms. Kan.

620
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,040
I'll see you then.

621
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,200
See you. Bye.

622
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,040
Can I ask you something?

623
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:16,760
You are probably wondering who I am

624
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,720
and what I'm doing in the forest.

625
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:25,520
I came to the forest seeking true peace,

626
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:31,600
with the hope to ordain
and fully commit to Buddhism.

627
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,400
I see.

628
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:37,920
Then why don't--

629
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,320
Tonight,

630
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,680
we will meditate together

631
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,160
to spread merit

632
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:46,920
to all life forms.

633
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:49,800
The merit of this good deed

634
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:52,440
will help all of you

635
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,120
achieve your goal.

636
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,440
All life forms in the world
are subject to fate.

637
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:12,080
Any unethical actions

638
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:15,760
will ultimately bring suffering.

639
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:19,800
However, if those actions

640
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:23,440
are guided by compassion,

641
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,400
they will bring happiness

642
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,360
to both the giver and the receiver.

643
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,880
May all of you unite in heart

644
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,000
and set your mind on generosity.

645
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:40,760
Memory is the past,

646
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:44,120
thoughts are the future,

647
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,440
and breath is the present.

648
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:52,840
Set awareness to your next breath.

649
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,480
-Do you feel better?
-If we don't get it,

650
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:09,000
-then we will…
-Be gentle or I'll ask Laor to do it.

651
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,160
Let me see.

652
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,760
Wait.

653
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,520
Does your wound still hurt?

654
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:25,560
Not really. It hurts because
you're poking me in the head.

655
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:27,720
Where did the wound go?

656
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,280
Yes, what happened to the wound?

657
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:31,520
You're right.

658
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,200
Share it among yourselves.

659
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,320
Thank you very much.

660
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:52,880
Chat.

661
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,680
I bet it wasn't easy making your way here.

662
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,880
Our journey here

663
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,960
was unimaginably challenging.

664
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:08,240
By the way, thank you
for your help yesterday.

665
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,040
Thank you.

666
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,000
Thank you.

667
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,160
Your destination,

668
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,240
Three Pagoda Temple,

669
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,360
is not far from the foot of the mountain.

670
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,600
Watch your step.

671
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,720
Is that the temple we're looking for?

672
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,880
I don't know.

673
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,640
We have to go closer.

674
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,560
Come on.

675
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:56,520
We made it!

676
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,600
Finally, we're here.

677
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,400
You're amazing, Chat.

678
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,120
Good job, everyone.

679
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,760
Why is no one here?

680
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,320
I don't see any monks or villagers.

681
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,400
The monks probably

682
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,520
went on a meditation retreat.

683
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,160
That's good. It will be more convenient
for us to work with no one around.

684
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,360
Find Anodard Pond and the four animals.

685
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,360
Let's go this way.

686
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,880
Sure.

687
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:50,160
-Let's go, guys.
-Yes.

688
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,160
Come on.

689
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,160
Laor.

690
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,320
Look.

691
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,920
Is that the one?

692
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:16,440
No.

693
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,360
Let's keep searching.

694
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,360
Mr. Phu.

695
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:30,720
Is it this one?

696
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,400
No.

697
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,560
Let's keep going.

698
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,120
Come on.

699
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,680
Is it this one?

700
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:10,120
No, Captain.

701
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:44,040
What should we do, Mr. Phu?

702
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:45,040
I don't know.

703
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,320
Could it be over there?

704
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:55,920
Did you find anything?

705
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,560
How did it go, Veena?

706
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,520
Nhu See, did you find anything?

707
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:10,040
No.

708
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,240
Sun.

709
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:15,720
I couldn't find it.

710
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,040
Did you see it by the stairs?

711
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:25,960
We didn't find an elephant, a horse,
a cow, a lion, or the Anodard Pond.

712
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,720
I'm guessing they are small statues.
Why couldn't we find them?

713
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,280
I believe they're here.

714
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,280
We'll continue tomorrow.

715
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,960
Let's search for water.
We are sleeping here tonight.

716
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,160
Yes.

717
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:44,240
Everyone.

718
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,600
The villagers must have left
these clothes here.

719
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,280
We can wear them tonight.

720
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,240
-Thank you.
-Let me help.

721
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:00,320
What's on your mind, Laor?
You look stressed.

722
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,240
I'm thinking about
my great-grandpa's diary.

723
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,400
He said we would find the four animals

724
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,840
stationed in each direction

725
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,080
with the temple located
in the middle of Anodard Pond.

726
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:16,000
How come we haven't found anything?

727
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:18,280
We will.

728
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:21,160
Don't worry. I will help you find them.

729
01:04:24,200 --> 01:04:25,720
Thank you, Sun.

730
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,560
Don't worry, Laor.

731
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:35,920
We are all here
to help you uncover the truth.

732
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,040
I won't stop until we find them.

733
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:47,240
We haven't looked everywhere yet.
We will find them.

734
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:50,400
Yes. Don't give up yet, Laor.

735
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:54,960
Thank you so much, everyone.

736
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,440
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

737
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,760
Great-Grandma Fuangphet.

738
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,480
What happened to you?

739
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,120
Please lead me

740
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,320
to Anodard Pond.

741
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,960
Where's the old man?

742
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,840
He was right here. Where did he go?

743
01:06:44,920 --> 01:06:46,000
I don't know.

744
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:48,520
Everyone.

745
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,680
Do you believe in nagas?

746
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:55,680
Nagas?

747
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:57,440
Why do you ask, Nhu See?

748
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:01,320
Think about it.
Who would live alone in the forest?

749
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,760
He doesn't eat meat.

750
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,120
What would prevent him

751
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:09,080
from committing to Buddhism
if he were human?

752
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:10,840
He's a naga.

753
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,560
Thank you very much for your help. Amen.

754
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,800
Amen.

755
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:25,960
Lord Naga Trinetr.

756
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,520
You know…

757
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,640
that I'm here to do
the right thing, don't you?

758
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,640
So please…

759
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,000
point me in the right direction

760
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:45,600
so I can find the temple.

761
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,920
Darn it, Mr. Phu. I thought you were Lord…

762
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,440
Who did you think I was?

763
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:12,560
It doesn't matter.

764
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,880
You sneaked up on me.

765
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,680
You scared me.

766
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,680
It's dangerous to wander around
by yourself at night.

767
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:23,640
Did you have trouble sleeping?

768
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,560
Yes.

769
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:37,240
There are people

770
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:40,080
who have survived Pha Diao Dai Cliff.

771
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:42,359
But no one…

772
01:08:42,439 --> 01:08:43,439
Great-grandpa.

773
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,680
…has ever returned from Pimpa City.

774
01:08:46,359 --> 01:08:49,000
I damn them to meet

775
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,479
-a fateful death.
-a fateful death.

776
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:52,720
Chat!

777
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:55,040
Watch out!

778
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,840
How did you know we were here?

779
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,880
I didn't tell them we were coming here.

780
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:00,600
You didn't,

781
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:03,640
but someone on your team did.

782
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,080
Laorchan!

783
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:51,439
