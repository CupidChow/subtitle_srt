1
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,240
It's the library where the safe is.

2
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,520
The plan to steal the sapphire third eye.

3
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,880
Someone stole the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

4
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,360
We need to talk…

5
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,880
Princess Laorchan Phukhumwong.

6
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,000
Who's the leader of
the Thapana Association?

7
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,040
Where is he?

8
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,880
You may do with me as you please.

9
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,360
That woman only came into my life

10
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,560
because she wanted that necklace.

11
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,880
I'm truly sorry about everything.

12
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,760
I have no excuse.

13
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,920
Throughout his life,

14
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,120
Prince Siwilai was accused
of being a rebel.

15
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,720
He never got the chance to clear his name.

16
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,440
I would do the same as you

17
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,960
if I were his descendant.

18
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,560
It's lucky your plan failed though.

19
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:08,600
If the rebels found out
you had the necklace,

20
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,920
you'd be in grave danger.

21
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,280
What are you going to do?

22
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,080
The prince has proposed a plan.

23
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,760
But I heard this mission
will be very dangerous.

24
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,360
I've already decided,
I'm willing to die for this.

25
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,760
It wasn't a difficult decision at all.

26
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,320
What about Phu?

27
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,240
Have you talked to him?

28
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,040
Not yet.

29
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,920
He probably doesn't even want
to look at me right now.

30
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,400
I understand though.

31
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,080
I would feel the same way if I were him.

32
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,200
What about you?

33
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,360
How do you feel about him?

34
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,760
My feelings don't matter right now.

35
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,960
My priority is to fulfill
my duty to my family.

36
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:15,360
Is there a way for you
to fulfill your family's duty

37
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,480
while maintaining
a good relationship with Phu?

38
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,079
I think so.

39
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,920
At least, I won't hurt his feelings
any more than I already have.

40
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,520
Are you really going to fire Laor?

41
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,800
Are you sure that's what you want?

42
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,720
Shouldn't you give her a second chance?

43
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,800
It's pointless.

44
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,960
Liars are insincere.

45
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,720
I can't work with insincere people.

46
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,680
But you should at least
talk it out with her.

47
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,640
Ever since the incident,

48
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,720
you and Laor haven't talked in private.

49
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,080
Laor lied to discover the truth

50
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,520
and protect her family.

51
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,400
Maybe she didn't lie
about her personal matters

52
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,720
and her feelings for you.

53
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,080
By giving her a chance,

54
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,080
you will also be giving yourself a chance.

55
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,880
Everyone, thank you very much

56
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,640
for your hard work on the exhibition.

57
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,280
Since the opening ceremony is approaching,

58
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,080
I'd like to check in
with you one last time.

59
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,080
-Jaree.
-Yes.

60
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,240
Is the script ready?

61
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,520
Laor is in charge of the script.

62
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,240
It's ready. I've placed
the final draft on Mr. Phu's desk.

63
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,840
What about the video for the ceremony?

64
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,400
-About that--
-Have you edited it?

65
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:14,000
Laor is also in charge of the video.

66
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,520
Ask her then.

67
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,840
Is it ready?

68
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,600
Yes.

69
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,840
As for the pamphlets,
the publisher will ship them

70
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,360
to us soon.

71
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,280
What she said.

72
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,640
Have you invited the press?

73
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,840
Yes.

74
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,200
Yes.

75
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,520
Okay.

76
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,560
This concludes our meeting.

77
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,040
I have another meeting with a client.

78
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,120
-Jaree.
-Yes.

79
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,000
I'm meeting with the crew
from Viengphukhum.

80
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,200
I have to go.

81
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,200
I'll come back and follow up
on all the preparations later.

82
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,400
Okay.

83
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,320
-What was that?
-Sister, I'm confused.

84
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,160
-What just happened?
-I know.

85
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,240
They were all lovey-dovey a few days ago.

86
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,080
I know but they wouldn't even talk
or look at each other today.

87
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,880
Sister, you must know what happened.

88
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,080
How would I know?

89
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,960
I'm as confused as you guys.

90
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,960
-What?
-What was that?

91
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,920
They wouldn't say a word to each other.

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,360
-Yes.
-What happened?

93
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,880
I want you to follow the plan
that you have made with Sun.

94
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,880
You're going to use his plan against him.

95
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,280
That's right.

96
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,680
Therefore, we cannot
remove Sun from the plan.

97
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,520
I believe Sun will lead us

98
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,960
to the true leader of
the Thapana Association.

99
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,840
You still suspect him of being a rebel.

100
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,400
What will you do to him

101
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,520
if that's true?

102
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,560
I will bring him to justice

103
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,200
and make him testify.

104
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,440
I don't think

105
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,720
Sun has anything to do with the rebels.

106
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,600
If anything happens to him,

107
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,720
I will feel responsible
for the rest of my life.

108
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,760
I understand how you feel.

109
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,640
I promise I will take good care of him.

110
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,360
I will protect you and Sun.

111
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,360
Approaching the rebels
with the necklace in our possession

112
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,520
is like a fish swimming to eat bait.

113
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,320
To me, it's a duty I must fulfill.

114
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,840
But that's not the case

115
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,760
for Sun.

116
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll give you a chance then.

117
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,120
Talk to Sun.

118
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,760
Persuade him to withdraw from the mission.

119
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,080
If he agrees,
we will come up with another plan.

120
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,960
But if he insists on going with you,

121
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,040
I promise to protect him as best I can.

122
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,560
Can you promise me one more thing?

123
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,440
Yes.

124
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,480
Once the mission is accomplished,

125
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,800
you must let Sun go.

126
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,960
I promise.

127
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,800
I give you my word
as the crown prince of Viengphukhum.

128
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,520
Welcome. How many people?

129
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,160
-Two. Thanks.
-Wait a moment.

130
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,400
What brings you
to such an upscale restaurant?

131
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,320
I assume you're not here to eat.

132
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,800
Could it be

133
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,800
that you work here?

134
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,120
Feel free to let
your imagination run wild.

135
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,560
Are you the manager or the owner?

136
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,240
Neither.

137
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,200
-Are you perhaps…
-Looking for a date?

138
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,560
Unfortunately, no.

139
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,920
I'm meeting my girlfriend here.

140
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,800
Oh, no. I'm heartbroken.

141
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
I was about to hit on you.

142
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,120
Hey, you didn't tell us
you had such a handsome friend.

143
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,600
We could have asked him to join us.

144
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,040
I don't mind that you are taken.

145
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,440
You could just sit there and be eye candy.

146
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,920
-This way, please.
-Thank you.

147
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,560
Let's go shopping.

148
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,160
He's so hot.

149
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,960
Are you trying to kill me?

150
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,200
I talked to Laor today.

151
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,960
I don't want to hear her name.

152
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:41,400
Laor has agreed to my plan.

153
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,760
That's good.

154
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,800
Good for you and that woman.

155
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,760
She was your first love, wasn't she?

156
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,200
Laor has taken on
one of the most dangerous tasks.

157
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,040
If you have a problem with that

158
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,520
and you don't want Laor risking her life,

159
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,240
you can tell me.

160
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,080
That woman means nothing to me now.

161
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,080
She can do what she likes

162
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,200
or go wherever

163
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,880
she wants.

164
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,960
It's none of my business.

165
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:42,120
This is Bangkok. This area is Nong Khai.

166
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,160
We will use secret routes.

167
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,320
Sun.

168
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,640
How will we

169
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,160
cross the Viengphukhum border
without getting caught by the prince?

170
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,280
I've already talked to my dad.

171
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,480
He told us to avoid the highways.

172
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,280
Look, we will travel
to Nong Khai from Bangkok

173
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,040
by car.

174
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,000
After that, we'll proceed
to the Mekong River

175
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,320
using secret tracks in the forest
used by smugglers.

176
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,840
And at this point,

177
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,920
we will cross the Mekong River together
and enter Viengphukhum.

178
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,280
Are you sure the fake passports will work?

179
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,720
Look, you have nothing to worry about.

180
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,600
Moo did an amazing job.

181
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,280
He changed your name
and forged a Thai immigration stamp.

182
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,960
All we need to do is cross the river.

183
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,320
Have you got the enlarged photos?

184
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,200
Yes.

185
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,080
Nikom just finished in the photo lab.

186
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,080
I'm here.

187
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,240
Meet me in the lobby immediately.

188
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,960
Yes.

189
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,160
Phu, I have something important
to tell you.

190
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,040
What is it, Ying?

191
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,120
It's about your beloved secretary.

192
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,080
She was caught flirting with another man

193
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,280
just days after your relationship
was announced.

194
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,560
How embarrassing.

195
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,880
Did you see her
with your own eyes this time?

196
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,400
No, I didn't.

197
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,800
But these photos,
dropped by a well-meaning person,

198
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,760
prove that

199
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,760
you are not the only man she's dating.

200
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,480
Now that you know the truth, wake up.

201
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,720
Who is this well-meaning person?

202
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,040
Could these two be the well-meaning
people you are looking for?

203
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,520
Who are they? Do they work here?

204
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,600
I've been keeping an eye on them
for a while.

205
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,720
After the last incident,

206
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,960
I quietly installed
security cameras in the office.

207
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,360
The footage revealed

208
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,960
these two developing photos
at four o'clock in the morning.

209
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,920
Here's proof.

210
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,520
You have broken the law,
as well as company policy.

211
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,000
I remember them now.

212
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,440
They are the ones
who bad-mouthed Laor to me.

213
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,760
I was a fool to believe them.

214
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,359
You two are horrible.

215
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,880
You caused a misunderstanding
between me and Laor.

216
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,040
You are terrible people.
I can't believe you.

217
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,200
You didn't plan
all this yourselves, did you?

218
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,000
Tell me right now who put you up to it.

219
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,800
They wouldn't talk,

220
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,800
so I called the police
to investigate this.

221
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,640
I'm glad you are here.
You can be our witness.

222
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,200
I have plans.

223
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,480
Lalana Magazine wants me on their cover.

224
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,280
The interview is today.

225
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,960
I'm sorry about that.

226
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,040
Oh, no. It's time. I should go.

227
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,640
I have to go, Phu.

228
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,640
Do you realize what kind of person
your boss is now?

229
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,080
I see.

230
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,840
No wonder you left the house
so early this morning.

231
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,400
You were trying to catch the culprits.

232
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,040
I had to catch them red-handed

233
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,720
to get them to confess.

234
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,120
Let's go.
Ms. Ying is waiting in the lobby.

235
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,040
-Ms. Kan.
-Ms. Kan.

236
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,840
Can I see what's in the envelope?

237
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,440
What should we do, Phu?

238
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,960
We didn't want to do it, Mr. Phu,

239
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,560
but Ms. Ying threatened us
and left us with no choice.

240
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,480
Would you kill someone

241
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,800
if she told you to?

242
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,600
I remember giving you
a chance once already.

243
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,600
Look back at what you've done.

244
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,720
-Please don't fire us.
-Please don't fire us.

245
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,160
Give them another chance.

246
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,560
This time, they confessed

247
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,920
and cooperated with us.

248
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:15,040
I brought them here to show them

249
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,880
where their loyalties should lie,

250
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,360
JT Center or their old boss.

251
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:25,240
We swear we won't do it again.

252
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,600
Please have mercy on us.

253
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,800
You'll be on probation.

254
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,280
Don't break the rules again.

255
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,640
This is your final chance at this company.

256
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,960
-Yes.
-Yes.

257
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,960
Get back to work.

258
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,600
We finally solved it, Phu.

259
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,360
I should get back to work then.

260
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,440
Sure.

261
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,680
I brought the video
that will be shown during the event.

262
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,680
Leave it on the table.

263
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,680
Throw away the trash on the sofa.

264
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,840
I understand.

265
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,840
Take care, son. See you soon.

266
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,640
How is the exhibition going?

267
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,440
What is the feedback?

268
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,880
Satarasamee said

269
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,280
both Thais and foreigners

270
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,920
are very interested

271
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,280
in our culture and local products.

272
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,960
Wachira mentioned that the number
of visitors has been increasing each day.

273
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,640
Woven fabric and handicraft products
have been selling well.

274
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,440
We've received many orders, Your Majesty.

275
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,520
The prince is a smart man.

276
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,960
He was one of the top students
in England after all.

277
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,320
When is he returning?

278
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,560
I will welcome him
with a parade of soldiers.

279
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,520
Tomorrow morning. You don't need
to meet him at the airport though.

280
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,760
His return will be unofficial.

281
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,040
The flight he's taking
must be kept a secret

282
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,560
as he's bringing back
the necklace with him.

283
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,280
I agree with you.

284
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,280
The rebels are very attentive.

285
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,040
If they find out
which flight he's taking home,

286
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,160
they will definitely ambush him
to steal the necklace.

287
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,560
Yes.

288
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,880
I've been wondering

289
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,000
why the rebels yearn to possess
the necklace so badly.

290
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,560
The necklace isn't
one of the crown jewels.

291
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,840
It might not be a crown jewel,

292
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,400
but it's worth a fortune.

293
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,560
With the necklace in their possession,

294
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,520
money and power would flow their way.

295
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,680
They would exploit the villagers' belief
in Lord Naga Trinetr

296
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,440
as a tool to manipulate them

297
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,480
into doing what they want.

298
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,080
Yes. The rebels

299
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,640
must have found out that

300
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,880
the necklace is the key

301
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,840
to the finding the treasure
under the abandoned temple.

302
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,120
Beneath the temple

303
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,320
lies an unimaginably vast stash
of ancient treasure.

304
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,840
They intend to utilize this treasure

305
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,960
to finance the activities
of their association.

306
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,680
Is that true?

307
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,320
I thought it was only a legend.

308
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,880
I think it's true

309
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,440
because my dad told me the story himself.

310
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm leaving early tomorrow morning,

311
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,760
so I thought I should say
goodbye to you today.

312
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,760
Thank you for all your help.

313
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,560
It's our pleasure.

314
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,200
Have a safe flight home, Your Highness.

315
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,840
Thank you, sir.

316
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,160
Tomorrow, I'll send my people
to follow Laor and Sun to Nong Khai.

317
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,200
Those two will cross the river
to Viengphukhum.

318
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,840
We will finally see the face
of the Thapana Association's leader.

319
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,400
Please protect her.

320
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,240
Don't let anything happen to her.

321
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:10,680
She's my relative after all.

322
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,400
I'm sending my best team on this mission.

323
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,120
Their top priority
is to protect Laor with their lives.

324
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,760
I hope the mission is successful.

325
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
It's time peace returned to the land.

326
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,440
Thank you.

327
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,960
Anyway, has Phu left for work?

328
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,080
Phu has been leaving the house very early

329
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,880
and coming home late at night.

330
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,760
We haven't seen him for days.

331
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,840
He's probably keeping himself busy

332
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,440
with work.

333
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:00,800
Even though he knew
about Laor's mission tomorrow,

334
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,280
he still offered to attend a meeting
in Phuket on Kan's behalf.

335
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,480
He's unbelievable.

336
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,480
Has Phu really decided to move on?

337
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,600
Is that why he's avoiding her?

338
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,080
Is that the document for Mr. Phu, Jan?

339
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,680
Colonel.

340
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,600
Let's watch a movie tonight.

341
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,040
But…

342
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,360
I thought you were leaving early tomorrow
on an important mission.

343
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,800
That's work.

344
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,520
Today, I need to spend time with my love.

345
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,800
We haven't gone on a date

346
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,560
since our engagement.

347
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,080
I don't know when I will see you again.

348
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,000
I'll fly there soon.

349
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,040
I have to check out the land
for the planned mall anyway.

350
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,440
Right now, you need to go home and rest.

351
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,440
I have to obey you, don't I?

352
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,200
Are you really not going
to watch a movie with me?

353
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,800
We have a lifetime
to watch movies together.

354
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,560
Your well-being

355
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,080
is the most important thing right now.

356
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,920
Your mission depends on your well-being.

357
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,120
Give me some moral support then.

358
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,480
You can kiss my cheek as many times

359
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,200
as you'd like.

360
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,520
You won't leave
until I kiss you, will you?

361
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,720
I will set up a tent here
until you kiss me.

362
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,840
Fine.

363
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,120
Close your eyes then.

364
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,560
I can't wait for our honeymoon.

365
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,920
When should we go?

366
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,840
We'll go after you're back
from this mission.

367
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,320
Are you really leaving?

368
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,360
Think about it again.

369
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,920
Talk to us if you are dealing
with any problems.

370
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,760
We'll help you.

371
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:31,960
-That's right.
-That's right.

372
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,400
Thank you all very much

373
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,920
for your love and support.

374
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,640
But I have to go.

375
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:45,160
I have something important
to take care of.

376
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,480
You don't need to quit your job for that.

377
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,120
You can take a day or two off,

378
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,160
or even a week.

379
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,480
She's right.

380
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,440
Did you fight with the boss?

381
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,520
You did, didn't you?

382
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,040
It must have been a big fight.

383
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,240
I noticed you two during the exhibition.

384
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,720
You didn't say a word to each other.

385
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,240
Are you mad at each other or something?

386
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,600
No, we are not.

387
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,320
My resignation
has nothing to do with Mr. Phu.

388
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,080
I just realized

389
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,800
that I wasn't good enough
as his secretary.

390
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,920
Come on, my dear.

391
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,560
If you aren't good enough,

392
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,080
we will have to invite an angel
from heaven to do this job instead.

393
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,400
I agree.

394
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,200
Every employee here would vote for you

395
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,480
to pass the probation evaluation.
Am I right?

396
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,000
-Yes.
-Yes.

397
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,600
Even if I passed the probation,

398
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,680
I still wouldn't be able to stay.

399
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,480
I have an important matter
to take care of.

400
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,440
Is it more important than the boss?

401
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,240
Yes.

402
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,760
It's more important
than anything in the world.

403
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,080
It's the most important thing in my life.

404
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,720
Laor.

405
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,240
Will you really not change your mind?

406
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,280
I've already made up my mind.

407
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,920
I won't change it.

408
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,840
It's not that I want to leave.

409
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,800
Even though I've only been
working here for a few months,

410
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,760
I've grown attached

411
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,840
to the company and all of you.

412
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,640
We will see each other again…

413
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,720
if death doesn't part us.

414
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,480
Jaree.

415
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,040
Yes, sir.

416
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,960
Have you booked my flight to Phuket?

417
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,880
Yes, the flight is tomorrow at 6:15 a.m.

418
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,840
Here's your ticket, sir.

419
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,280
Are you really not going
to ask Laorchan to stay?

420
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,880
It's rare to find

421
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,840
a good secretary

422
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,840
who clicks with you.

423
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,200
In this entire country,

424
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,800
only Laorchan and I fit that description.

425
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,080
It's still not too late
to change your mind.

426
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,240
I think…

427
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,320
I should go.

428
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,640
Sir, I--

429
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,880
I won't ask any employees to stay.

430
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,200
-Okay, but--
-My word is final.

431
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,560
Don't you understand me?

432
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,000
I do. I understand you perfectly,

433
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,000
but if you continue trying to read
that report upside down,

434
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:06,000
you're not going to understand it.

435
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,360
I'm going to go.

436
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,360
My people will be following you
from a distance.

437
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,480
If something feels off

438
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,640
or danger is approaching,

439
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,560
press the button on the side of the watch
to send us a signal.

440
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,320
Our people will be notified right away.

441
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,320
Your people?

442
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,240
Colonel Wachira and another individual

443
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,920
who is neither Sub-Lieut. Khumpheng
nor Sgt. Maj Phathana.

444
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,240
You actually know this person well.

445
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,120
Come in.

446
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,520
Veena?

447
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,320
Greetings, Ms. Laorchan.

448
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,880
I'm Captain Veena Wongsawan

449
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,880
of the Special Investigations Unit
of Viengphukhum.

450
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,000
Captain Veena?

451
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,760
Does this mean

452
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:37,000
Veena has been working as your spy?

453
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,040
Yes.

454
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,560
I had to keep an eye on you

455
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,400
to protect you from the rebels.

456
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,280
I sent Veena to spy on you.

457
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:50,199
That means the first time we met…

458
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,440
I set up the situation

459
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,920
in order to approach you.

460
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,760
Go.

461
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,760
Give me your bag.

462
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,440
Give it to me.

463
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,080
Let me go!

464
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,280
Help! Somebody help!

465
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,640
-No!
-Let's go.

466
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,520
Help!

467
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,640
Let's go.

468
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,920
Thank you.

469
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,920
No problem.

470
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,040
It was the only way to gain your trust.

471
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,520
After that,
you asked me to be your roommate.

472
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:58,360
I had to keep you
as close to me as possible.

473
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,080
What about your relationship

474
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,440
with Colonel Wachira?

475
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,240
We are not having an affair
like you think.

476
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,000
Then why did you act like you were?

477
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,800
You saw me and Colonel
together at the hotel.

478
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,680
I had to deceive you,

479
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,880
otherwise our covers
would have been compromised.

480
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,960
But you two spent the whole night
alone inside a room.

481
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,960
Yes.

482
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,320
But if you had opened the door,

483
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,640
you would have also seen me,
Sgt. Maj Phathana,

484
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,480
and Sub-Lieut. Khumpheng.

485
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,160
We had an all-night meeting.

486
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,680
So you and Colonel Wachira

487
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,840
are just colleagues and nothing more.

488
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,480
No.

489
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,800
We love each other so much,
we would die for one another.

490
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,480
We are cousins.

491
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,040
Veena is my uncle's daughter.

492
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,400
We grew up in the same house.

493
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,640
We did everything together.

494
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,600
We also share the same last name.

495
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,760
What about the money and the pager?

496
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,240
The prince kindly gave me that money

497
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,080
and the pager was provided
so I could communicate with him.

498
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,960
WACHIRA: SEE YOU IN 2 HOURS

499
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,320
How dare you snoop through my stuff?

500
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,480
Hey, Veena.

501
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,240
SATARASAMEE: URGENT MEETING

502
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,440
Give it to me.

503
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,080
Will you leave me alone?

504
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,840
Look what you've done.

505
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,120
Now it's broken.

506
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,120
Stop meddling in my life.

507
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,120
Veena. Wait, Veena.

508
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,000
No wonder you were so upset with me.

509
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,160
I had to exaggerate my anger
so you would leave me alone.

510
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,240
I couldn't let you see the message

511
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,800
sent by the prince.

512
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,760
I wasn't aware

513
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,480
I was so important to you

514
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,160
that you had to keep me
under constant surveillance.

515
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,760
I admit

516
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:30,080
what I did wasn't right.

517
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,760
However, it was the only way

518
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,800
to get your cooperation.

519
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,880
I'm sorry

520
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,360
for lying to you.

521
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,000
But you should know
that my friendship was sincere.

522
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,880
You are truly my best friend.

523
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,480
Is that so?

524
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,640
Do best friends act so cold

525
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,520
toward each other?

526
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,120
Tell me.

527
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,760
Where the heck have you been?

528
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,760
Where have you been hiding?

529
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,360
You crazy woman.

530
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,680
Oh, no. I'm sorry, ma'am.

531
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,200
I mean, Laor.

532
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,640
Have you really forgiven me?

533
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,720
Are we still friends?

534
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,800
I can't stay mad at my best friend.

535
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,520
-Enough.
-Let me keep hugging you.

536
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,400
Hello, Sun.

537
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,440
I have the sapphire third eye.

538
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,240
Feel free to take a nap.

539
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,520
I'll wake you up.

540
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,200
It's fine. I'm not tired.

541
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,920
I'll keep you company.

542
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,200
Are you going to tell me
how you got the necklace?

543
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,640
I worked really hard

544
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,000
to prepare for the exhibition.

545
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,040
Also, I proved I was trustworthy
whenever I was near the necklace.

546
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,680
The prince

547
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,800
trusted me completely.

548
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,840
What about Mr. Phu?

549
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,040
Did a perfectionist like him
not suspect a thing?

550
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,120
I guess he trusted me from the beginning.

551
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,240
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
assigned me this task.

552
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,600
He loved you.

553
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,520
I would have died from a broken heart

554
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,680
if I had found out you were using me
to steal the necklace.

555
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,240
It was quite risky,

556
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,800
but it was definitely worth it.

557
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,120
Is everything all right, Sun?

558
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,520
Who are they?

559
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,200
My dad's men.

560
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,000
We have to switch cars.

561
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,160
Why?

562
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,320
Do you think

563
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,680
we were followed?

564
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,840
Better safe than sorry, Laor.

565
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,680
Let's go.

566
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,560
Laor has sent us a signal. Get ready.

567
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,800
Yes.

568
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,000
Make sure she reaches Viengphukhum safely.

569
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,080
Do you understand?

570
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,440
Yes, Your Highness.

571
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:34,840
Take care.

572
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,440
Do not let your guard down.

573
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,760
Yes.

574
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,120
You take care too, Wachira.

575
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,680
Go already.

576
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,200
Go.

577
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,640
Take me to the military airbase.

578
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,080
The governor of Sainyaburi province
has informed me that

579
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,960
the ceremony and the welcoming parade
are awaiting your arrival.

580
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:32,040
The royal private jet
is waiting for you as well.

581
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,680
That's good to hear.

582
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,000
All right, let's get going then.

583
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,120
I'm sorry to interrupt.

584
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,360
I have urgent news.

585
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,640
What is it?

586
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,040
The prince has postponed his flight home.

587
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:52,200
Did something happen,
Sub-Lieut. Khumpheng?

588
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,080
A thief has stolen

589
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,320
the real Ajna Chakra Necklace.

590
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,400
How could you let that happen?

591
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:06,600
I think we must have a mole.

592
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,760
The prince is well aware of that.

593
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,360
The spy was disguised as an employee.

594
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:15,440
She was trusted
to look after the necklace.

595
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,760
Is she one of the rebels?

596
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,600
The prince believes so.

597
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,800
Where is this woman right now?

598
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:26,640
She's sneaking into Viengphukhum.

599
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,360
The prince believes
she is bringing the necklace

600
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,920
to the leader of the Thapana Association.

601
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,040
Do you know

602
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,600
which passage she will be taking?

603
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,000
She's coming via Nong Khai.

604
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,400
There are numerous spots
to cross the river there.

605
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,160
This is a very serious problem.

606
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,960
But I cannot miss the ceremony.

607
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,800
I will assist Prince Satarasamee.

608
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,680
If that woman is indeed a rebel spy,

609
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,920
we will use her
to eradicate all the rebels.

610
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,760
Has the boat arrived, Sun?

611
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,160
I think so.

612
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,000
Let's head to the pier and see.

613
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,240
A Viengphukhum guide
wouldn't hold hands with a tourist.

614
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,560
Yes, you're right.

615
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,080
I'm sorry. I forgot.

616
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,480
In that case, this way, please.

617
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,600
Let's go.

618
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:19,360
My dad sent someone
to help us cross the river.

619
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,400
Are you Sun?

620
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:24,920
Yes, that's me.

621
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,160
We must hurry, my lady.

622
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:32,160
It will take us half an hour
to reach Khammouane province.

623
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,520
Let's do it.

624
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,960
-Get in.
-Thanks.

625
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,640
We'll proceed to the Mekong River

626
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:46,080
using secret tracks in the forest
used by smugglers.

627
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,000
The view on this side

628
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,680
is beautiful, my lady.

629
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,120
The target is approaching the border.

630
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,480
-Are we good?
-We have arrived at Khammouane province.

631
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,640
Thank you.

632
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,640
Laor.

633
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:07,400
Wait a second.

634
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,440
Let's go.

635
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,600
Why are you making that face, Laor?

636
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,080
You should go back to Thailand.

637
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,920
I'll be fine on my own.

638
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,680
What? What are you talking about?

639
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,720
We've come this far. I'm not leaving.

640
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:36,480
The mission will be complete
once I meet the general

641
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,400
your dad has sent.

642
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,800
I will contact you

643
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,680
right away after that.

644
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,000
You have done

645
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,480
enough for me.

646
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,680
When it comes to you,
nothing could ever be enough.

647
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,960
I'm willing to help you

648
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,520
for the rest of my life.

649
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,200
I don't want to be a burden on you.

650
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,720
We won't be each other's burden.

651
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:13,440
You are not a burden on me.

652
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,280
You are the person I love.

653
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,280
You know that, right?

654
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,680
Come on, let's keep going.

655
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:56,680
Welcome.

656
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,400
Where is the meeting point?

657
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,320
Here.

658
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,040
Why aren't they here?

659
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,760
Get in the car.

660
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,840
Who are you? Did Uncle Wisai send you?

661
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,560
You will find out soon. Walk.

662
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,080
-Walk.
-Walk.

663
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,000
-This way.
-Get in.

664
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,280
Sun.

665
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,560
Where are we?

666
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:41,360
I've never been here before.

667
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,160
Laor.

668
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:17,600
Get out. Now.

669
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:19,480
Go!

670
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,320
Come on.

671
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:30,960
Walk!

672
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:41,520
Be gentle with her.

673
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,040
Go!

674
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,640
Keep walking!

675
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:49,000
Come. Follow me.

676
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,920
Go.

677
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,760
Follow me.

678
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,040
Everything will be okay, Laor.
Stay close to me.

679
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,840
This is not an ordinary rice warehouse.

680
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,440
It's an arms trafficking site.

681
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,040
Follow me.

682
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,720
Hurry up!

683
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,560
Don't rush us.

684
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:33,600
-Hurry!
-Follow me!

685
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,160
Get in there.

686
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,480
It's nice to meet you, Laorchan.

687
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,680
Who is he, Sun?

688
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:15,320
I don't know, but the man
on the left is Uncle Wisai,

689
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,800
my dad's friend.

690
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,200
Take a seat.

691
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,560
Come.

692
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,840
Sit.

693
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,120
It's good to see you again, Sun.

694
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,640
I vaguely remember that I last saw you

695
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,160
when you were ten.

696
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:39,480
Hello, I'm Wisai,

697
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,160
the owner of the largest rice
and weapon export company

698
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:45,840
in Viengphukhum.

699
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,040
Hello.

700
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,120
Rice and weapons
are a strange combination.

701
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,000
I own various businesses.

702
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,960
Selling rice and guns

703
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,640
is just part of it.

704
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,880
This is General Lamnao,

705
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:04,200
Deputy Commissioner
of the National Police.

706
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,880
And that man

707
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,880
is General Soodsadakon,

708
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,040
the former Chief of Staff of the Army.

709
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,720
Currently, he is the leader
of the Manolom Party.

710
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,160
So they are the leaders.

711
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,800
There are ten guards outside,

712
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,240
and more inside probably.

713
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:26,040
There's also a unit ready to ambush us
on the second floor.

714
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,480
Colonel, Sgt. Maj Phathana,

715
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,840
lead a team to quietly take down
their ambushing unit.

716
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,520
Veena, Khumpheng,

717
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:35,240
come with me to the second floor.

718
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:38,120
We must clear the path for Wachira
to enter the building.

719
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,840
It's nice to meet you, Laorchan.

720
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,440
You too, Suriya.

721
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,800
Likewise. It's nice to meet you all.

722
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,280
Greetings, everyone.

723
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,000
I didn't anticipate

724
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:02,960
meeting so many powerful people
from Viengphukhum all at once.

725
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,400
Where is the Ajna Chakra Necklace?

726
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,800
Your Highness.

727
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,280
Phu.

728
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,360
Yes, it's me.

729
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:36,960
I knew you would come.

730
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:43,960
Laor turned on the radio transmitter

731
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,840
so we could hear what was going on inside.

732
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,960
What are you waiting for?

733
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,520
I'm waiting for you to confirm

734
00:55:57,600 --> 00:55:59,800
that our deal still stands.

735
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:07,560
You are careful and thorough.

736
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,720
You really are a descendant
of Prince Siwilai.

737
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:14,920
You have our word.

738
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,120
After you show us the necklace,

739
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,600
we will lead you

740
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,360
to the royal warehouse

741
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,120
so you can solve the mystery.

742
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,280
Once you figure out

743
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,880
the location of the abandoned temple,

744
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,480
we will personally deliver the message

745
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:39,840
to King Rangsimun ourselves.

746
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,360
And what do you get out of it?

747
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,560
Everything we do
is for the sake of our country.

748
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,320
Where's the necklace?

749
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,040
I'll lead the team.

750
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:34,560
Let me look at it closely.

751
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,880
Do you trust us?

752
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,720
If I didn't trust you,

753
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:50,360
I wouldn't be here.

754
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:08,480
For your safety, I will go up first.

755
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:58,640
This is the first time I've laid eyes
on the sapphire third eye.

756
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,040
It's beautiful.

757
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:07,880
Given its beauty,
it must be worth a fortune.

758
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,600
If I were to estimate its value,

759
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,920
I'd say it's worth about one billion baht.

760
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,600
No.

761
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,760
It could be higher than that.

762
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,360
If it were real, that is.

763
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:42,160
What do you mean?

764
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,880
Are you saying I brought you a fake one?

765
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:51,880
Maybe you're just saying this

766
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,960
to avoid honoring our deal

767
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,880
and to keep the sapphire for yourselves.

768
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,480
Nonsense.

769
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,000
How dare you deceive us?

770
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:03,520
Who sent you?

771
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,560
Why would she deceive you?

772
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:08,520
Laor infiltrated the palace
to uncover the truth.

773
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,320
She has been waiting for this day
her entire life.

774
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,880
It must be a misunderstanding.

775
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,720
I'll give you one last chance
to tell the truth.

776
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,400
Did you think you could fool me?

777
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,400
How can it be genuine

778
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:27,120
when it doesn't bear the royal stamp?

779
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,360
What is this?

780
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,480
It's a tracking device, isn't it?

781
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,880
Who is on the other end?

782
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,920
Who are you working for? Damn it!

783
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,440
They are onto them.

784
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,520
Go and rescue Laor.

785
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,400
Alpha, clear the second floor immediately!

786
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:05,480
Sir.

787
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:06,960
We have intruders.

788
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,560
Clear.

789
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,240
Take these two downstairs
and kill them quietly.

790
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:40,480
Where are you going?

791
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:42,880
-What the hell? Let me go.
-Come.

792
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,240
-Come.
-Let me go.

793
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,640
Laor. Let me go!

794
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,640
What are your thoughts about your uncle?

795
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,080
I have to presume
everyone close to us is a suspect.

796
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:00,040
Keep this safe for me.

797
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:02,840
Promise me that you will be back soon.

798
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:09,360
Laor…

799
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,280
Where is Laorchan?

800
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,520
Tell me where Laorchan is!

801
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:00,480
