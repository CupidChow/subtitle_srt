1
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,280
Thank you.

2
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,400
If you have nothing to do,
help me set the table.

3
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,800
When you work in the palace,

4
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,520
you must dress appropriately.

5
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,800
I am M.L. Phuthaneth

6
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,360
Jutathep.

7
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,560
I'll go to Thailand to look into this.

8
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,920
Prince Satarasamee is coming to Thailand
on a private trip.

9
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,480
Protect the royal vehicle.

10
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,360
Don't let anyone get
to the King and the Queen.

11
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,520
I have found you

12
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,000
the perfect secretary.

13
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,920
It's too sweet.

14
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,280
How much milk did you put in here?

15
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,720
Every cup of coffee

16
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,320
was brewed with water at 94 degrees.

17
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,800
Did you change how you take it?

18
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,120
I like my coffee
the way I've always liked it.

19
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,960
Laor.

20
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,000
Over here

21
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,640
Shall we?

22
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,160
How did it go? Did you get the job?

23
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,800
They said they'll call me later.

24
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,200
But don't worry.

25
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,040
I'll find my way into the company
no matter what.

26
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,400
Even if it means
I have to clean the toilets.

27
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,200
Hey, Sun.

28
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,320
Did you find out anything?

29
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,280
You were right.

30
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,440
Prince Satarasamee and Phuthaneth

31
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,480
studied in England together.

32
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,880
In that case,

33
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,880
the prince must be staying at JT Oriental.

34
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,160
I see.

35
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,920
Do you know why the prince came here?

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,680
I followed them to the dining room

37
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,640
and overheard them talking
about going to Jutathep Palace.

38
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,760
Something didn't seem right though.

39
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,200
Not only did the prince come
for personal reasons,

40
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,600
but he and his men were also in disguise.

41
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,920
Let's go.

42
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,240
Please take care
of the business we discussed.

43
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,000
Sure, I'll take care of it.

44
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,320
Is that them, Sun?

45
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,040
Should we follow them?

46
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,520
I have my car here.

47
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,079
No. We can't go inside the palace anyway.

48
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,000
The easiest way

49
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,680
is for me to become Mr. Phu's secretary.

50
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,320
It will be

51
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,800
my ticket to the palace.

52
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,680
-Hello.
-Hello.

53
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,320
This is my uncle,
M.R. Tharathorn Jutathep.

54
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,600
This is Prince Satarasamee,

55
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,080
the crown prince of Viengphukhum.

56
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,720
Nice to meet you.

57
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,440
That's Colonel Wachira,
the head of the royal guards.

58
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,120
He comes here often to visit Kan.

59
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,320
Lastly, those two are Sub-Lieut. Khumpheng
and Sgt. Maj Phathana.

60
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,480
Please take a seat.

61
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,000
Jutathep Palace welcomes all of you.

62
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,320
I last saw you over ten years ago.
You're now a handsome man, Your Highness.

63
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,920
Thank you very much.

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,240
Please drop the honorifics.

65
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,120
Let's talk casually
as it's easier to communicate.

66
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,520
As I informed you over the phone,

67
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,760
the reason for the prince's visit is that

68
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,920
he wants to learn more
about the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

69
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,480
The sapphire third eye.

70
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,680
That's right.

71
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,840
My uncle told me

72
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,120
you were the head archeologist

73
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,880
who excavated the ruins of Pailin City.

74
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,400
You might have information

75
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:50,280
or may have seen historical records
regarding the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

76
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,000
Are you saying

77
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,680
you need information to write
the program for the diamond exhibition

78
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,560
that will be held next month?

79
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,880
Yes, but that's not all.

80
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,840
The real reason is that I want to know

81
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,960
whether the curse of the Ajna Chakra
Necklace was ever actually recorded

82
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,680
or if it was just a myth
created by rebels to frighten people.

83
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,120
I see.

84
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,480
I received a historical text
from a professor,

85
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,680
but it was difficult to read
as it was written

86
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,360
in the ancient Viengphukhum language.

87
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,800
So I never took the time
to study it thoroughly.

88
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,360
Let me tell you,

89
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,400
I'll search for the book in the library.

90
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,880
I should be able to find something.

91
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,480
Thank you very much.

92
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,000
The book

93
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,320
will help us solve the mystery.

94
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,160
While we wait

95
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,560
for my uncle to find the book,
why don't you all come to my house.

96
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,320
Shall we, Colonel?

97
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,960
How is it going?

98
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,280
Has work been tough for you?

99
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,440
You look like you've lost weight
and you look rather pale.

100
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,360
Running a country

101
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,440
is physically tiring.

102
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,080
However,

103
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,200
dealing with the rebels
is what has really drained me.

104
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,240
As long as you allow people
to speak their minds,

105
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,040
those problems

106
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,040
will never truly go away.

107
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,320
On the other hand, if you can show them

108
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,120
that everybody can live in harmony
despite differences of opinion,

109
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,280
it will bring them closer
to reconciliation.

110
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,920
But I know

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,200
it's easier said than done.

112
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,640
Take a seat.

113
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,080
-Thank you.
-Please.

114
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
By the way,

115
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,920
how are your parents? Are they well?

116
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,840
Queen Chanta called me two days ago,

117
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,240
asking me to look after you.

118
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,280
They are well.

119
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,360
They sent their regards to you both.

120
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,680
Thank you.

121
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,640
They also asked me to bring wild honey
from Pailin City for you.

122
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,960
Mom.

123
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,840
What are we eating today?

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,480
Well, since the prince is visiting us,

125
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,920
we have to have his favorite.

126
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,480
Say no more.

127
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,960
We know what it is.

128
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,440
From the looks of it,

129
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,080
not everybody
will be joining us for a meal.

130
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,680
Greetings, Your Highness.

131
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Greetings, everybody.

132
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,080
Greetings, Kan.

133
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,640
Why did you come unannounced?

134
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,400
You should have called me.

135
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,920
The prince wanted to keep it a secret

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
as it could put him in danger.

137
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,120
But everyone in my family knew,

138
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,760
except me.

139
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,160
They must have thought
that what goes on in Viengphukhum

140
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,760
has nothing to do with you.

141
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,680
They probably think it's better
to inform you of matters related to you.

142
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,360
Matters related to me?

143
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,800
Do you mean

144
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,200
you know about that?

145
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,480
Colonel, what's wrong? Colonel.

146
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,800
It's my heart, Kan.

147
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,920
Your heart?

148
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,040
My chest feels tight.

149
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,560
Hold on.

150
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,880
It's difficult to breathe.

151
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,360
My heart is beating irregularly.

152
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,440
I think I'm having heart palpitations.

153
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,680
Heart palpitations?

154
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,400
Feel my heart.

155
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,800
Colonel…

156
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,840
Heart palpitations, you say?

157
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,040
How about I defibrillate your heart?

158
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,360
You could have proposed normally

159
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,760
without scaring me.

160
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,240
Wait.

161
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,760
What if I surprised you

162
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,880
and said no?

163
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,840
Kan.

164
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,720
Kan.

165
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,040
Colonel.

166
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,600
Kan.

167
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,920
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,720
Please forgive me.

169
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,200
I promise I won't do it again.

170
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,400
This is serious,
but you were messing around.

171
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,840
How can I possibly trust you after this?

172
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:02,160
Kan, I'm truly sorry.

173
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,320
I just wanted to surprise you.

174
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,200
Please forgive me.

175
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,680
Please, Kan.

176
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,520
How does it feel
to be on the receiving end?

177
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,240
Are you still having heart palpitations?

178
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,080
You almost gave me a heart attack.

179
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,360
So will you marry me?

180
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,640
Yes.

181
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,120
Keep the ring for now

182
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,760
and do it officially
in front of everybody else.

183
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,520
I only want to blush once.

184
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,480
Sure.

185
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,800
HISTORY OF VIENGPHUKHUM CITY

186
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,040
Is this the book?

187
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,600
I've never seen it before.

188
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,800
That's right.

189
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,120
This book

190
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,400
is one of the treasures

191
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,840
that survived the arson
committed by the rebels

192
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,280
at the palace of Prince Siwilai,

193
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,600
the brother of King Atitayawong,

194
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,120
your great-grandpa.

195
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,280
I received it

196
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,160
when I was the head archaeologist

197
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,200
exploring the ruins
of a northern city in Viengphukhum.

198
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,200
A northern city?

199
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,280
Pimpa Kingdom?

200
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,480
That's right.

201
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,720
Pimpa Kingdom

202
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,880
is the origin of the legend
of Lord Naga Trinetr,

203
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,320
whose third eye shone brightly

204
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,000
like a deep blue sapphire.

205
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,880
And I believe

206
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:34,040
that third eye has something to do
with the Ajna Chakra Necklace

207
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,120
that was passed down to you.

208
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,920
According to the legend

209
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,560
of Lord Naga Trinetr of Viengphukhum,

210
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,760
in the time before the Buddha,

211
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:07,480
there was a naga named Lord Naga Trinetr.

212
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,880
He lived in an underground city
beneath the large river

213
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,560
that flowed through the kingdom of Pimpa.

214
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,880
The naga would come ashore
and perform religious precepts

215
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,200
under a large banyan tree by the water

216
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,960
on the night of the 15th full moon

217
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,600
for 18 days once every 18 years.

218
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,640
When Jhao Chang Phuerk,
the ruler of the Pimpa kingdom,

219
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,320
heard the news, he brought offerings

220
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,200
to Lord Naga Trinetr

221
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,280
who was meditating deeply
with his eyes closed.

222
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,320
Lord Naga Trinetr received the offerings
from Jhao Chang Phuerk

223
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,520
and gave gold to Jhao Chang Phuerk

224
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,400
and the people of Pailin City
who accompanied him.

225
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,080
The villagers were amazed

226
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,240
at the gold Lord Naga Trinetr gave them.

227
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,080
But Jhao Chang Phuerk
was not interested in the gold at all.

228
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,720
He could not take his eyes off

229
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,840
Lord Naga Trinetr's beautiful sapphire eye

230
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,400
and thus became covetous,

231
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,320
wanting to possess the sapphire himself.

232
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,160
Jhao Chang Phuerk returned once again

233
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,280
with his retinue, offerings, dancers,

234
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,200
and a plan for his main concubine,
named Ouakhum,

235
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,880
to bring offerings

236
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,880
to Lord Naga Trinetr this time.

237
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,720
He wanted Ouakhum
to serve Lord Naga Trinetr personally,

238
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,000
but Lord Naga Trinetr was strict
in observing the precepts

239
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,840
and only accepted the offerings.

240
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,760
Once again,

241
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,560
he kindly rewarded
the Pailin villagers with gold.

242
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,080
Jhao Chang Phuerk ordered Ouakhum
to stay and serve Lord Naga Trinetr.

243
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,760
She was to offer him an unlimited supply
of food and liquor.

244
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,120
Yet again, Lord Naga Trinetr
turned her down,

245
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,960
strictly observing the precepts.

246
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,760
Ouakhum used her charms
to seduce Lord Naga Trinetr.

247
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,200
She got him drunk
and immersed him in defilement,

248
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,840
desire and lust

249
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,160
to the point that he abstained
from observing the precepts

250
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,560
that he had practiced continuously
for hundreds of years.

251
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,880
As his faith waned,

252
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,680
the power of the third eye weakened.

253
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,640
When the poison took effect,

254
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,400
the great Naga

255
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,360
lost all his strength

256
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,040
and became powerless.

257
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,320
Jhao Chang Phuerk took this opportunity

258
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,280
to remove the Naga's third eye,

259
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,080
a beautiful sapphire,

260
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,840
and keep it for himself.

261
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,800
Lord Naga Trinetr.

262
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,720
Laor, it's me.

263
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,360
Veena!

264
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,720
What's wrong with you?

265
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,360
What's with your outfit?

266
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,720
They had a Halloween party at the club.

267
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,000
The staff were told to dress up as well.

268
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,800
What's wrong? The whole neighborhood
must have heard you screaming.

269
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,520
I had a dream.

270
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,840
I saw a naga.

271
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,240
The elders in my hometown
say that's good luck.

272
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,680
If you dream about a naga,

273
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,560
it means someone will help you
when you're in trouble

274
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,840
and you will be lucky.

275
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,320
Did you just dream that you saw it
or did it put its body around you too?

276
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,040
If it's the latter,

277
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,760
then it means

278
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,400
you are about to meet your soulmate.

279
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,840
None of that.

280
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,800
He breathed fire on me.

281
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,960
Somehow, I could sense

282
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,280
his anger.

283
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,120
What happened next?

284
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,840
The steep mountainous area collapsed.

285
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:49,440
It became an open plain
covered with stones.

286
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,440
The legend continues,

287
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,360
saying that Jhao Chang Phuerk,

288
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,840
Ouakhum, the three executioners,
and the entire Pimpa kingdom

289
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,600
were engulfed in flames
for three days and three nights.

290
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,520
After the death of Lord Naga Trinetr,

291
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,320
the empire eventually collapsed.

292
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,240
My mom once told me

293
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,520
that before Lord Naga Trinetr died,

294
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,720
is it true that he put a curse

295
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,080
on the people of Pimpa Kingdom?

296
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,360
The details in the book are vague.

297
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,480
Also, it's an ancient language.

298
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,280
I need time to interpret the content.

299
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,600
All right.

300
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,160
It's getting late.

301
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,920
We'll resume tomorrow.

302
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,000
Besides translating the book,

303
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:42,720
I need your help with another thing.

304
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,040
How is the Ajna Chakra Necklace

305
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,240
connected to Lord Naga Trinetr?

306
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,920
Let me see what it looks like.

307
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,880
Gosh.

308
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,360
It's gorgeous.

309
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,520
The real gem

310
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,040
is a deep blue sapphire.

311
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,280
I see.

312
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,960
I heard Prince Satarasamee

313
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,480
will display the necklace
at a bilateral event to boost ties

314
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,080
between Thailand
and Viengphukhum next month.

315
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,960
You will be able to witness
the necklace with your own eyes

316
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,760
if you get the job with Phuthaneth

317
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,960
as the event will be held at JT Hall.

318
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,200
Lord Naga Trinetr.

319
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,520
Do you know him?

320
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,920
Yes.

321
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,960
How?

322
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,840
Come on, I'm from the northeast.

323
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,840
Of course I know the nagas.

324
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,400
The stories are in my blood.

325
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,080
Thai people worship Lord Naga Srisuttho.

326
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,640
Lao people worship Lord Naga Srisatta.

327
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,400
And people from Viengphukhum

328
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,360
worship Lord Naga Trinetr.

329
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,560
It's strange how your subconscious
is connected to Lord Naga Trinetr.

330
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,720
Who knows, maybe you were
from Viengphukhum in a past life.

331
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,400
Hey.

332
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,720
Phu, do you like Laorchan?

333
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,280
I just met her, Mom.

334
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,960
Mom meant, do you like her
as a potential secretary?

335
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,880
Not as your future wife.

336
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,640
I see.

337
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,280
Well,

338
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,360
I'm considering other candidates as well.

339
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,920
If you haven't found
the perfect candidate,

340
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,200
why don't you ask Woranuch
to fill the position?

341
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,280
She just came back from England
a few days ago.

342
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,160
That's a good idea, Dad.

343
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
Phu can be the glue
between the Jutathep family

344
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,200
and the Dhevaprom family.

345
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,240
After all, you didn't marry Sineenuch.

346
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:18,080
To make up for it,
Phu can marry her daughter.

347
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,560
No way.

348
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,560
Ying is too headstrong.

349
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,640
I couldn't handle her.

350
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,120
I like Laorchan.

351
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,160
She is smart and talented.

352
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,840
More importantly, I get on with her.

353
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,040
All right then.

354
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,600
The vice president has made her pick.

355
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,960
Your job is to follow her orders

356
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,440
as the managing director.

357
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,520
Meeting adjourned. Let's eat.

358
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:47,760
I think

359
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,440
Phu already had his mind set on her
before Mom said anything.

360
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,320
He was just pretending.

361
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,960
Am I right, Phu?

362
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,280
See, Mom? His ears have gone red.

363
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,480
You are acting suspiciously.

364
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,560
Is there anything else I should know?

365
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,720
Let's eat.

366
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,280
Hello, this is Laorchan.

367
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,360
JT Center has decided to hire you.

368
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,840
Really?

369
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,720
Would you be able to start

370
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,280
right away?

371
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,040
Of course. I could even start today.

372
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,720
Yes, of course.

373
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,040
Thank you so much.

374
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,400
Veena.

375
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,520
Mr. Phu gave me the job!

376
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,520
-Really?
-I'm so happy!

377
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,400
Congratulations.

378
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,520
You finally got a job at JT Center.

379
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,640
I'm so happy.

380
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,880
Congratulations, Laor.

381
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,000
Sun!

382
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,920
This is Sun.

383
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,160
He was my best friend
when I was studying in France.

384
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,000
Sun, this is Veena,

385
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,680
the best roommate I could ever wish for.

386
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,600
It's nice to meet you, Veena.

387
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,880
Likewise.

388
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,240
Not bad.

389
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,040
Your probation period is three months.

390
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,320
If you pass the probation,

391
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,720
you will become a regular employee,

392
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,000
receiving the same benefits
as your colleagues.

393
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,400
Understood?

394
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,360
Understood. I promise to do my best.

395
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,680
I won't let you down.

396
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,720
Good. Jaree.

397
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,640
Please teach Laor what she needs to know.

398
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,560
You can start with the secret code.

399
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,560
It will be a piece of cake.
I speak four languages.

400
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,800
I can learn new languages in no time.

401
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,600
Sure. Eagle3-321.

402
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,720
321?

403
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,880
Follow me.

404
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,000
The secret code is a language used
between him and his secretary.

405
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,440
21 = I DON'T WANT IT
22 = I WANT IT…

406
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,720
What?

407
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,760
Do I have to memorize all this, Nujaree?

408
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,040
Did you

409
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,120
memorize all this?

410
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,840
Not at first.

411
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,560
But after he criticized me so often,
I got it.

412
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,000
This is more complicated
than a military code.

413
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,080
I know. I thought it was unnecessary too.

414
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,400
But it turned out to be very handy.

415
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,600
If only

416
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:22,040
to rescue him from
all the girls who are after him.

417
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,960
Is your boss that charming?

418
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,040
Yes.

419
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,840
He's incredibly charming.

420
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,920
Girls love him.

421
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,840
He's the hottest man

422
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,880
in the whole downtown area.

423
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,600
Go search for a hotter man yourself.

424
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,720
I assure you
that you won't find one around here.

425
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,960
Do you go around

426
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,480
comparing me to all the men around here?

427
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:54,320
Sir, how long have you
been standing there?

428
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,720
Eagle3-66-13-13.

429
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,520
I'm going out for a few hours.

430
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,280
Laorchan.

431
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,320
Put all the documents from
the purchasing department into a folder.

432
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,680
I'll sign them when I get back.

433
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,920
Supervise her, Jaree.

434
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,040
321, sir.

435
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,040
Nujaree.

436
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,440
What does "Eagle3-66-13-13" mean?

437
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,240
Eagle3 is Mr. Phu.

438
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,200
Eagle1 is Mr. Rachanon.

439
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,040
Eagle2 is Mrs. Sroifha.

440
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,440
Eagle4 is Ms. Kanthika.

441
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,760
66 means come.

442
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,360
13 means quietly.

443
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,120
Therefore, 13-13 is…

444
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,360
Super quietly.

445
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,080
Come super quietly.

446
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,920
Mr. Phu, you came super quietly.

447
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,160
That's right!

448
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,760
You are smart.

449
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,240
321 means roger that.

450
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,960
You will be using it a lot
so you will remember it in no time. Okay?

451
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,080
321.

452
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,760
You are very smart.

453
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,160
I'm impressed.

454
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,960
Laor.

455
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,120
Here are
the purchasing department documents.

456
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,040
Thank you, Ling.

457
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,880
-Ling.
-Yes.

458
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,360
Don't you have work to do?

459
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,000
Get back to work!

460
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,480
Move.

461
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,040
Hello.

462
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,480
The plan is about to begin. Get ready.

463
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,640
What? They are cutting off
our electricity?

464
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:06,240
What do we do?

465
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,120
How could you forget to pay the bill?

466
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,360
Mr. Phu is out of the office.

467
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,560
I don't want to trouble him.

468
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,200
I'll ask my colleagues first.

469
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,880
Finish your work so we can get lunch.

470
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,440
Yes.

471
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,320
Nujaree.

472
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,960
Can I go and take care of something
for half an hour?

473
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,120
We must bring the item to the boss.

474
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,680
Are you ready? Let's go.

475
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,520
Sub-Lieut. Khumpheng
is in the bathroom, Mr. Phu.

476
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,480
Wachira, Phathana, go check the bathroom.

477
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,680
Yes.

478
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,120
What happened?

479
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,280
Those two stole Khumpheng's backpack.

480
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
Tu, call the police right away.

481
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,560
Tell them to stop a blue Peugeot 505

482
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,480
with the registration 6NG7998, Bangkok,
that just left the premises.

483
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,840
-Go now!
-Yes.

484
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,200
Sub-Lieut. Khumpheng.

485
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,600
Sub Lieutenant.

486
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,640
Sub-Lieut. Khumpheng.

487
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,760
Hey.

488
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,760
He's inside.

489
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,200
Sub Lieutenant!

490
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,600
-Khumpheng.
-Sub Lieutenant.

491
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,320
Sub Lieutenant.

492
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
We must have them arrested

493
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,520
and find out who they are.

494
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,280
I'm certain

495
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,280
they are rebel descendants
of General Segong.

496
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,760
How do you know?

497
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,160
We've sensed their presence
since our first day here.

498
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,920
It felt like we were being watched.

499
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,320
I think they are the rebels
who followed us here.

500
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,280
But we still need to make sure.

501
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,280
Here.

502
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,000
I didn't think it would be so easy.

503
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,600
My dad's former henchmen took care of it.

504
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,120
It was too dangerous for you.

505
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,720
Thank you very much, Sun.

506
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,320
I'm not going back to work there anymore.

507
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,760
They were too careless.

508
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:54,120
I bet they didn't suspect
anyone was following them.

509
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,480
They weren't careless, Sun.

510
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,240
Quite the opposite.

511
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,600
Sub-Lieut. Khumpheng volunteered
to be the bait to lure them out.

512
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,640
They are definitely rebels.

513
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:17,200
Before I passed out,

514
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,520
I heard them speaking
the Viengphukhum language.

515
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,600
Also,

516
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,640
the sedative must have contained

517
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,480
a substance only found in Viengphukhum.

518
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,680
He quickly recovered

519
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,360
after we gave him the antidote.

520
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,360
The antidote counteracted
that particular substance.

521
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,680
Most importantly,

522
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,520
it is not sold anywhere.

523
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,520
Only educated locals from Viengphukhum
would know of the substance.

524
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,800
I wonder where they are now
with the necklace.

525
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,880
The Ajna Chakra Necklace.

526
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,960
No wonder.

527
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,960
Sub-Lieut. Khumpheng wouldn't have
put down his backpack for a second.

528
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,440
It's my duty

529
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,120
to protect the royal treasure
with my life, Mr. Phu.

530
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,440
-Hey, Sat.
-It's Sata.

531
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,080
Why didn't you tell me?

532
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,240
I could have increased security.

533
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,480
It's okay. We wanted to keep it discreet.

534
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,880
I need you to keep
this necklace safe for me.

535
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,920
I couldn't leave it behind

536
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,080
as I believe this necklace is the key

537
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,960
to solve the mystery.

538
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,480
However, it would be dangerous
to carry it with us.

539
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:52,240
Do you have any objections?

540
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,480
I'm happy to help.

541
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,160
We have a secret vault
that will keep the necklace safe.

542
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,520
You have nothing to worry about.

543
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,040
The Ajna Chakra Necklace.

544
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,240
It's magnificent.

545
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,240
No wonder so many people want it.

546
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,520
I'm counting on you.

547
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,040
Don't worry.

548
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,920
I also want to know

549
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,480
if the curse comes from

550
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,440
a human or a mythical creature.

551
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:00,080
We can confirm that
the rebels plan to steal the necklace.

552
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,920
What I want to know is

553
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,440
the identity of the person
behind the rebels.

554
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,520
It doesn't matter who it is.

555
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,560
By now, they must have found out

556
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,440
what was in the backpack.

557
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,120
WE KNOW WHAT YOU WANT…

558
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,640
"We know what you want.

559
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,960
We will find out who you are."

560
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,480
Are you sure your men
weren't being followed?

561
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,040
They might be ambushing us as we speak.

562
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,920
It's unlikely. We had a good plan.

563
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,880
After I retrieved the backpack,

564
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,080
they abandoned the car on the street

565
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,440
and left on a motorbike
that was parked in an alley.

566
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,760
The prince couldn't have tracked us.

567
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,960
This is a device for Mr. Phu
to reach his secretary.

568
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,520
Thank you, Nujaree.

569
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,360
Listen.

570
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,920
Don't call me by my name.

571
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,360
Just call me Sister like everyone else.
It's more friendly.

572
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,240
Come back quickly
before the boss gets back.

573
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,520
Otherwise, it's me who will get it,

574
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:44,360
not you.

575
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,000
Okay.

576
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,680
"Eagle3 is heading back to the office."

577
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,920
15-33-33.

578
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,200
15 is go back.

579
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,440
No, I'm wrong.

580
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,120
It's come back.

581
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,640
33 is immediately.

582
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,480
Gosh. This is bad.

583
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,440
Mr. Phu is heading to the office.
Come back immediately.

584
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,760
Jaree.

585
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,200
Yes.

586
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,520
Where is Laorchan?

587
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,960
Well…

588
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,800
Where is Laorchan, Jaree?

589
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,480
Hold the elevator.

590
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,040
Let me go with you.

591
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,760
-Sure.
-Sure.

592
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,800
It's over the weight limit.

593
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,000
Jaree.

594
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,520
-Nujaree.
-Yes.

595
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,120
I…

596
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,320
Hello.

597
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,360
Mr. Kamjorn?

598
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,840
Today at 3:00 p.m.?

599
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,800
Sure.

600
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,720
Yes. Goodbye.

601
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,000
You're coming with me.

602
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,200
Where?

603
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,640
-Channel 3.
-What?

604
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,720
But sir, Tee Yai's family is coming

605
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,520
to meet mine today.

606
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,240
You authorized Laorchan
to leave work during office hours.

607
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,280
You must take responsibility.

608
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,200
What happened?

609
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:41,960
Mr. Phu, it's all my fault.

610
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,040
I asked Sister, I mean Nujaree,

611
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,880
if I could go and pay my electricity bill.

612
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,920
I couldn't say no to her.

613
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,560
They were going to cut her electricity.

614
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:54,320
Laor might burn down her apartment

615
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,760
if she sleeps with lit candles.

616
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,280
A well-organized person

617
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,600
would not forget to pay their bill.

618
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,400
You can deduct it from my salary.

619
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,360
It's a fair punishment.

620
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:11,640
Focus on passing your probation first.

621
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,760
I won't do it again.

622
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,520
Sir.

623
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:22,320
Since Laorchan is back now,

624
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,600
you don't need me anymore, do you?

625
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,040
Since my secretary is here, let her work.

626
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,480
It's her job after all.

627
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,520
I'm sorry again.

628
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,600
Don't worry about it.
Go quickly before he gets mad again.

629
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,400
Okay.

630
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,720
Drive safely, sir.

631
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,880
Tee Yai, here I come.

632
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,240
Hello, Mr. Phu.

633
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,160
Hello, Mr. Kamjorn.

634
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,280
Thank you very much for agreeing
to see me on such short notice.

635
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,200
I have a bit of time
before my next meeting.

636
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,120
Please take a seat.

637
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,240
How can I help you?

638
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,960
I need your advice.

639
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,640
I want to broadcast
a special one-minute documentary.

640
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,720
I think the period
between the evening news

641
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,960
and the dramas would be the best time.

642
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,800
The airtime

643
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,960
during prime time is quite expensive.

644
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,000
May I know what the program is about?

645
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,120
-Viengphukhum.
-I see.

646
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:35,360
I aim to introduce
Viengphukhum to the public

647
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:37,360
through the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

648
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:43,360
Sir, you have a board meeting.

649
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,000
Mr. Phu, I have to go. I have a meeting.

650
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,120
Sure.

651
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,160
-Thank you very much.
-No problem.

652
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,600
Mr. Phu, I'll get started
on the documentary

653
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:08,960
right away.

654
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,920
Mr. Phu.

655
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:14,440
Who's going to write the script
for the documentary?

656
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:18,160
We need to hire a scriptwriter.

657
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,320
Find someone and ask for a quotation.

658
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,560
Mr. Phu.

659
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:27,960
We don't need to hire anyone.

660
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,360
I'd be happy to do it myself.

661
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,240
But it's hard and we don't have time.

662
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,080
I'm aware of that.

663
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,640
But don't forget

664
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,760
that I majored in Southeast Asian history,

665
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,280
and I also wrote some scripts
when I was in France.

666
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,000
Most importantly…

667
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,240
What?

668
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,040
Why spend money on someone

669
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,520
when your employee is up to the task?

670
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,520
I'm confident

671
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,440
that I can do it. I promise to do my best.

672
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:04,760
Mr. Phu.

673
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,520
So

674
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,920
will you let me write the script?

675
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,320
Let's get started.

676
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,520
Mr. Phu.

677
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,800
-Laor.
-Yes.

678
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,320
The PR department wants the boss
to check the color photo sample.

679
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,880
Okay, I'll take it to him

680
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,120
once he's finished his coffee.

681
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,520
I'll head home then.

682
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,000
I need to stop by a salon first.

683
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:54,800
I'm meeting his parents today.

684
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,920
You can look your worst
in front of your parents,

685
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,400
but not your boyfriend's parents.

686
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,600
I need to look my best. I'm leaving.

687
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,880
-Bye.
-See you.

688
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,040
The Ajna Chakra Necklace.

689
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,240
The sapphire third eye.

690
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,920
I'm sure you've seen pictures
of the necklace.

691
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,720
Yes, I've seen them in books.

692
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,080
You'll see it in person one day.

693
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,760
Are you saying

694
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,720
the necklace is in Thailand right now?

695
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,280
I said one day, not today.

696
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,160
You seem very eager

697
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,680
to see the necklace.

698
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,200
Yes. The craftsmanship
might not be as delicate

699
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,760
as on the necklaces I've seen in Europe,

700
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:06,440
but…

701
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,320
something about the necklace

702
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,560
attracts me,

703
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:16,960
especially the blue sapphire.

704
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,640
It's beautiful.

705
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,920
Yes.

706
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,680
It's beautiful,

707
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,360
charming,

708
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,640
and mysterious.

709
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,520
Do you think so too?

710
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,320
Here you go.

711
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,960
It's from the PR department.

712
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,280
Listen.

713
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:15,440
I'm visiting my uncle this evening

714
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,800
and your house is on the way there.

715
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,200
I'll give you a ride.

716
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,360
Let's go.

717
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,440
Wait, Mr. Phu.

718
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:29,320
How do you know where I live?

719
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,080
Well, your address
was on your application form.

720
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,240
WAITING IN FRONT OF YOUR OFFICE - SUN

721
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,920
Is everything all right?

722
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,920
Is somebody picking you up?

723
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,560
Laor.

724
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,680
Hey, Sun.

725
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,600
Mr. Phu, this is Sun,

726
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,040
my friend from France.

727
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,160
Sun, this is Mr. Phuthaneth,

728
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,120
my boss.

729
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,200
Hello.

730
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:57,040
It's nice to meet you, Mr. Phuthaneth.

731
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:59,080
Likewise.

732
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,240
I'm sorry I'm late.

733
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,040
I was stuck in traffic.

734
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,920
Let's find something good to eat.
It's on me.

735
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:08,480
Please excuse us.

736
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:34,400
Sun, I almost didn't make it back
to the office in time this afternoon.

737
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,200
Why? What happened?

738
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,520
When I got to the building,

739
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,520
this woman pushed me out of the elevator.

740
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,640
I had to run up the stairs.

741
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,520
Did you run up the stairs?

742
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,040
-Yes, I'm serious.
-Seriously?

743
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,160
You still made it in time though.

744
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,760
You are one talented woman.

745
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,600
Do you know that?

746
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,840
You got Mr. Phu
to forgive you for being late

747
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,240
and trust you with
his documentary's script.

748
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,040
He doesn't want to spend money
to hire someone.

749
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:14,160
But I'm also quite persuasive.

750
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:20,040
What?

751
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,760
Why are you smiling like that?

752
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,720
Stop it.

753
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,040
You have a beautiful smile.

754
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,400
You know,

755
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,480
you have the most beautiful smile
on the planet.

756
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:40,040
My world lights up every time you smile.

757
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:44,520
I consider myself lucky
to be close to you.

758
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,160
You will realize you are unlucky

759
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,440
if we become closer.

760
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,200
I wouldn't mind

761
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,040
if it meant I could spend
the rest of my life with you.

762
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,400
I…

763
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,440
You know that I cannot get involved

764
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:14,760
or fall in love with anybody

765
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,480
until my mission is complete.

766
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,040
To me,

767
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,920
my family's honor comes first.

768
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:27,880
I know that.

769
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,560
That's not enough.

770
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:33,000
Everybody in Viengphukhum
will hear about it,

771
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:36,840
including the king

772
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,720
and the crown prince.

773
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,240
Hey.

774
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,320
-See you later.
-Come here.

775
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,400
Isn't that Veena?

776
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,520
Veena.

777
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,960
GRANDPA'S MUSSEL PANCAKE

778
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,440
Do you not have work tonight?

779
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:16,160
No, I'm taking the night off.

780
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,840
Why don't you come in for some coffee?

781
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,960
No, thank you. We are full.

782
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:25,840
Since Veena is here,

783
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,360
I'll head home then.

784
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,160
-See you later.
-See you.

785
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,960
Come here.

786
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,600
-Drive home safely.
-I will. See you.

787
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:46,920
Come on, let's go home.

788
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:50,760
-Wait. Isn't that--
-Let's go home.

789
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,760
I'm exhausted.

790
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,000
Come on.

791
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,040
Stop!

792
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,800
You scared me.

793
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:11,400
Tell me

794
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,120
who walked you home

795
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,040
today.

796
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,840
He's my boss. He owns the club.

797
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,720
Are you sure

798
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,120
that's all he is?

799
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,040
He's my boss.

800
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,160
Judging from your high-pitched voice,

801
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,120
he's definitely more than that.

802
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:37,920
What about Sun? Is he a friend

803
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,560
or your best friend?

804
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:42,160
My best friend.

805
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,480
Really?

806
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,960
I don't think he feels the same way.

807
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:52,040
Listen, let me tell you something.

808
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:53,960
I'm not interested in love at the moment.

809
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,400
I have an objective
that I need to achieve.

810
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,480
What objective?

811
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,720
Well…

812
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:03,880
My career.

813
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,600
In that case,
consider your objective achieved

814
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,400
for both your career and your love life.

815
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,800
Those two things

816
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,280
are coming your way as a package.

817
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:15,880
Nonsense.

818
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,720
What are you talking about?

819
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:23,560
Come here.

820
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,440
-Drive home safely.
-I will. See you.

821
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:34,480
What?

822
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,240
Mr. Phu was there?

823
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,400
Yes.

824
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,080
He was upset with me today.

825
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:43,280
Why would he come to see me?

826
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,400
You must have mistaken him
for someone else.

827
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,720
I've been a fan of his

828
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,760
since before you returned to Thailand.

829
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:52,480
How could I not recognize him?

830
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,480
Why would he come to see me?

831
01:00:57,760 --> 01:01:00,360
He was spying on you.

832
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,440
He was hiding behind a stall,

833
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:06,440
but I could see the passion in his eyes
when he looked at you.

834
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:10,400
However, his sweet eyes
turned into green lasers

835
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,200
when he saw you hugging Sun.

836
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,840
It might sound unreal but I'm serious.

837
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,360
I saw it with my own eyes.

838
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:21,560
Excuse me, ma'am.

839
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,960
How could you fall asleep

840
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,480
and leave me talking to myself?

841
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,240
I'm working at the club tonight.
Don't wait up.

842
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,560
Okay.

843
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,360
By the way,

844
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,840
does your boss act weird around you?

845
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,200
Does he use pickup lines on you?

846
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:46,360
-Tell me.
-No.

847
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:47,880
What are you talking about?

848
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:51,080
It's hard enough
just making it through the day.

849
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,840
You are wasting my time talking about him.

850
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,280
If I'm late,

851
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:57,360
he will kill me.

852
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,480
I doubt it.

853
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,400
What are you talking about?

854
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,400
Mr. Phu is scary and strict.

855
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,280
I can't even be a minute late to work.

856
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,760
You know,

857
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:13,240
I have to make coffee for him
and prepare documents.

858
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,240
Every time I bring him documents,

859
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,760
he questions me as if it's my PhD thesis.

860
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,560
That's just work.

861
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,280
Cool companies always have strict bosses.

862
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:27,800
I'm certain Mr. Phuthaneth
is the strictest of all.

863
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,840
Don't even think about defending him

864
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,840
because I won't let you, okay?

865
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,320
Listen, being strict means he's smart.

866
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,120
Him being the strictest boss makes him
the smartest boss. Don't you agree?

867
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,160
Well, you are right.

868
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:43,240
I won't disagree with you but…

869
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,560
Gosh. It's already half past seven.

870
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:49,640
I'll miss the bus.

871
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,040
See you later.

872
01:02:51,120 --> 01:02:53,960
-Don't take the bus then.
-Hey.

873
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,720
Do you expect me
to fly there or something?

874
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,960
Mr. Phu.

875
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,560
Good morning.

876
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:18,840
I'm on my way to work. See you later.

877
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,840
I came to give you a ride to work.

878
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:28,800
I see.

879
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,080
Good luck.

880
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:36,840
Thank you.

881
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,520
Will we be working
at Jutathep Palace today?

882
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,400
That's right.

883
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,640
This is Uncle Chai Yai,

884
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:21,040
M.R. Tharathorn Jutathep.

885
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,160
Next to him

886
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:25,840
is Prince Satarasamee,
the crown prince of Viengphukhum.

887
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:31,440
They are Colonel Wachira, Sub-Lieut.
Khumpheng, and Sgt. Maj Phathana,

888
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,520
the three musketeers of the leopard troop.

889
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,720
This is Laorchan Pundheva,

890
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,200
my secretary.

891
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:44,760
Laorchan will help write the script for
the Ajna Chakra Necklace documentary.

892
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,640
Hello, everyone.

893
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,920
It's nice to meet you all.

894
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,120
Please take a seat.

895
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:03,560
Phu told me

896
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,640
you majored in Southeast Asian history.

897
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,240
I look forward to working with you.

898
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:11,680
Likewise.

899
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:16,560
I'm open to advice
and comments from everyone.

900
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,360
In that case,
let's all head to the library.

901
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,440
-Yes.
-Let's get started.

902
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,600
-Okay.
-Yes.

903
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:25,200
Let's go.

904
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,240
She's gorgeous.

905
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:36,680
No wonder you woke up so early
to pick her up.

906
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:43,160
Well, she lives far away,

907
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,640
so I had to pick her up.

908
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:49,360
I see, so you did it out of sympathy.

909
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,160
You woke up at 5:00 a.m., left the palace,

910
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,080
sat in traffic, picked your secretary up,

911
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:57,800
and drove back here.

912
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,560
I want to be your secretary.

913
01:06:00,640 --> 01:06:01,600
Stop it.

914
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:05,160
-Mr. Phu.
-Yes.

915
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,240
Your uncle asked me to find you two

916
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:10,440
and ask you to come to the library.

917
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,200
That cold smile

918
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,560
kills you in silence.

919
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:24,960
You're screwed.

920
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:27,120
Wait, Your Highness.

921
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:52,080
After Jhao Chang Phuerk
sent his concubine, Ouakhum,

922
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,880
to seduce and poison Lord Naga Trinetr

923
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,560
so he could remove the sapphire third eye,

924
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:01,040
Lord Naga Trinetr was in excruciating pain

925
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:03,720
and he cursed
Jhao Chang Phuerk out of anger.

926
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:07,720
Last time, you ended the story
with the curse.

927
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,040
Yes.

928
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:13,600
But the language inscribed
on the stone was very ancient

929
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:15,720
and the inscription was faint.

930
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:18,320
When printed into a book,

931
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,920
it became even more faded,
making it very difficult to read.

932
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,120
Were you able to decipher the inscription?

933
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,760
I was able to interpret
some details regarding the curse,

934
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:32,600
but where it talks about the time,
I'm not sure.

935
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:35,120
It's too faint to read.

936
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,480
Laorchan might be able to help.

937
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:41,360
Yes, sir.

938
01:08:20,120 --> 01:08:22,120
I damn them

939
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:24,040
and all their descendants

940
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,319
to eternal suffering and ruin!

941
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:29,760
Why must the curse resurface
every 18 years?

942
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,439
So what happened
to the sapphire third eye and the temple?

943
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,240
They became lost, just like Pimpa Kingdom.

944
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:36,920
In the end,

945
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,359
the sapphire was used to make
the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

946
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:40,960
Laorchan.

947
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:44,279
Are you a Dhevaprom?

948
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:46,040
Dhevaprom?

949
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:51,319
So who is he interested in?

950
01:08:51,399 --> 01:08:55,479
If Phu brings a girl
to meet Great-Grandma Orn,

951
01:08:55,560 --> 01:08:57,319
that girl is the one for him.

952
01:09:36,520 --> 01:09:41,520
