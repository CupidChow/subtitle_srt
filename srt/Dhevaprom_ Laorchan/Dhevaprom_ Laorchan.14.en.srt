1
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,560
Kill them.

2
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,480
Let's see whether the great naga

3
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,560
can take a bullet.

4
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,840
And my only desire

5
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,560
is to return
the sapphire third eye to you.

6
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,400
Do you need company?

7
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,920
Do you want to tell me

8
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,840
what's bothering you?

9
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,560
I'm worried about Sun.

10
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,800
Don't worry.

11
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,920
Dr. Chat reported that
Sun's condition is serious,

12
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,200
but the surgery was a success.

13
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,680
Sun is expected to wake up in a few days.

14
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,840
Thank you very much.

15
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,720
Are you still hurt that Sun deceived you?

16
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,160
Yes.

17
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,680
I didn't know the real him at all.

18
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,560
My trust in him

19
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,400
and our friendship…

20
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,760
have been shattered.

21
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,640
I don't even
want to hear his name anymore.

22
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,520
But a part of you wants to forgive him.

23
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,560
I'm not mad at him.

24
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,320
But what he did

25
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,240
was far beyond what I could comprehend.

26
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,600
I'm sure Sun had his reasons.

27
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,800
You should know

28
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,480
how far someone would go

29
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,240
for their family.

30
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,520
Deep down, he didn't want to deceive you.

31
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,880
He had a choice to make.

32
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,920
Whatever you decide to do,

33
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:11,160
I just hope you make a decision
you won't regret.

34
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,400
Why don't you consider

35
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,840
the kindness that Sun
has shown you in the past

36
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,200
and weigh it against the mistake he made.

37
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,800
I think it should help.

38
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,440
Thank you so much

39
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,600
for keeping me grounded.

40
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,480
As I told you before,

41
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,600
you are not alone.

42
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,120
I will always be here for you.

43
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,040
I really mean it.

44
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,880
I will be waiting for your answer.

45
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,080
Thank you so much.

46
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,600
Thank you.

47
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,000
Don't cry.

48
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,120
Okay.

49
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,440
Hey.

50
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,560
How long will it take
to renovate the temple

51
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,200
to the point

52
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,040
where it can be used
for religious ceremonies again?

53
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,320
When I inspected it,

54
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,760
I saw that some parts are still stable.

55
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,160
However,

56
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,080
there are parts we need to rebuild.

57
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,920
The process could take a year

58
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,280
or maybe a few years.

59
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,000
It depends on the materials and labor.

60
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,480
I see.

61
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,600
No matter how long it takes,

62
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,240
we have to try our best
to return it to its original condition.

63
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,920
The people of Viengphukhum have feared
Lord Naga Trinetr's curse for some time.

64
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,800
Their fear will be replaced

65
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,400
by faith

66
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,600
if we let them worship him.

67
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,320
Yes, I agree.

68
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,400
Once the renovation is complete,

69
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,520
I will open the temple

70
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:55,320
to the public twice a year, so the people
can worship Lord Naga Trinetr.

71
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,920
That's a good idea.

72
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,040
By granting them permission
to enter twice a year,

73
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,680
they will visit the temple

74
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
only on special occasions.

75
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,160
It's a good idea.

76
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,000
That way, Lord Naga Trinetr
won't be disturbed.

77
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,200
He will be able to observe the precepts
diligently and peacefully.

78
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,640
Excuse me, Your Majesty.

79
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,280
Queen Chanta would like you
to join her in the library.

80
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,600
His Majesty and I

81
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,799
have agreed

82
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,080
that the painting of Princess Fuangphet

83
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,000
should go to you,

84
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,200
her descendent,

85
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,679
Laorchan.

86
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,560
We also found something hidden
inside the painting.

87
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,360
It's her ring.

88
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,840
This is a letter from her.

89
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,280
"My dear Prince Peerapong,

90
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,360
before deciding to write this letter,

91
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
I spent a long time contemplating.

92
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,120
It took me a while to realize

93
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,440
that there are no secrets in this world.

94
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,640
The letter you wrote me,

95
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,680
asking about your parentage,

96
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,600
got me thinking that you might have seen
the letter I wrote to Prince Siwilai.

97
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,920
I can't change what happened,

98
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,080
but I can face up to the truth

99
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,600
and apologize to you
for keeping the truth from you.

100
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,280
I did it to protect you.

101
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,160
But since it has come to this,

102
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,200
I must tell you the truth.

103
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,680
Your suspicions

104
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,880
are right.

105
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,520
Prince Siwilai…

106
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,160
is not your real dad."

107
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,040
Don't be sad, Laor.

108
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,160
His Majesty and I

109
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,680
consider you

110
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,960
a member

111
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,960
of our family.

112
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,680
We must thank you once again

113
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,400
for sacrificing your strength

114
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,840
and your spirit for us.

115
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,520
You were willing to do anything

116
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,920
to return the sapphire

117
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,800
to Lord Naga Trinetr.

118
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,800
It was a crucial mission

119
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,520
for Viengphukhum.

120
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,120
The whole nation of Viengphukhum,

121
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,200
including our family,

122
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,960
owes you a great deal.

123
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,720
So don't be sad.

124
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,760
I'm not upset

125
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,920
that I'm not from
the Phukhumwong bloodline.

126
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm just glad I could fulfill
my dad's wish.

127
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,800
He told many stories about Prince Siwilai.

128
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,040
I might not be related to him,

129
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,520
but he loved and showed
my grandpa kindness.

130
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,280
Therefore,

131
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm more than happy to repay his kindness.

132
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,520
I'm just sad

133
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,400
about Princess Fuangphet.

134
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,360
She didn't mention

135
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,800
who my biological great-grandpa was.

136
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,320
It's okay, Laor.

137
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,760
Even though she didn't mention him,

138
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,960
we will work together
to find out who he was.

139
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,600
The letter contains enough evidence
to lead us to the truth.

140
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,920
Also, my family has a lot of contacts.

141
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,800
It won't be hard to discover his identity.

142
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,560
I will help you.

143
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,080
Thank you so much.

144
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,960
Laor.

145
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,040
I'm heading back to Bangkok,

146
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,080
so I came to say goodbye.

147
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:40,240
Thank you for coming.

148
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,200
And thank you

149
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,320
for still thinking
of this horrible person.

150
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
Sun.

151
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,440
You told me yourself

152
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,040
that everyone makes mistakes.

153
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,000
I also deceived people

154
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,640
to get what I wanted.

155
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,120
And I succeeded.

156
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,720
Consider yourself lucky

157
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,320
that you are no longer
under someone's control.

158
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,600
You have the freedom

159
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,120
to think

160
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,080
and do whatever you want.

161
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,680
It depends on which path

162
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,640
you choose to take.

163
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,520
I'm alive today

164
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,720
because of Prince Anucha.

165
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,200
He saved my life.

166
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,920
He gave me a good life.

167
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,920
It was my duty to repay him,

168
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,240
and I did just that.

169
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,680
But being with the exploration team

170
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,840
allowed me to see life
from another perspective.

171
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,320
One I've never seen

172
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,680
or known before.

173
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,560
Witnessing Prince Satarasamee

174
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,120
help his people in need

175
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,800
made me realize

176
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,160
that everything I've been taught
since I was a child,

177
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,600
including social injustice,

178
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,120
the indifference,

179
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,640
and the king's abandonment of the people

180
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,240
were nothing

181
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,480
but rumors.

182
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:12,280
Thank you for the food
you've shared with us.

183
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,280
The supplies you gave us will last months.

184
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,160
The famine in your village

185
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,360
requires immediate attention.

186
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,800
I'll send a doctor to give you
health checkups a few times a year.

187
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,040
Who are you?

188
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,040
I am

189
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,600
a citizen here just like you.

190
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,760
I know what I have to do next.

191
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,320
Now that I think about it,

192
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,720
the money Prince Anucha used
to pay for my tuition

193
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,040
came from taxes that the people paid.

194
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,840
Therefore,

195
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,680
after I have served my sentence
for what I have done,

196
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,560
I will use all the knowledge I have

197
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,360
to improve the welfare
of everyone in this country.

198
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,680
You have my support.

199
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,319
I will wait to see you succeed.

200
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,680
Thanks again, Laor.

201
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,240
Thank you for forgiving
this friend of yours.

202
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,760
I may have lied to you about many things,

203
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,480
but I never lied about

204
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,160
my love for you.

205
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,200
I know,

206
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,560
and I can accept

207
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,280
that it won't work out between us.

208
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,720
But nonetheless,

209
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,640
I'm glad that we were once close,

210
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,520
and we were able to help one another.

211
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
You're wrong, Sun.

212
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,080
Our love

213
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,320
and friendship

214
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,440
will remain this way

215
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,600
forever.

216
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,800
Phu, thank you so much

217
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,680
for everything.

218
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,800
I hope you understand

219
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,720
that I hid my motives for the mission

220
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,320
from you

221
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,800
for Viengphukhum's sake.

222
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040
I never meant to hurt your feelings.

223
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,800
I'm sorry about that.

224
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,160
Sat.

225
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,600
It's Satarasamee.

226
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,280
Don't worry about it.
We've been through a lot together.

227
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,720
I thought about it,

228
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,080
and I understand

229
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,320
that you didn't have a choice.

230
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,600
It just goes to show

231
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,680
that people will do anything

232
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,800
for their loved ones.

233
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,400
I need to thank you too, Laor,

234
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,640
on behalf of everyone in Viengphukhum.

235
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,080
Thank you for your help.

236
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,160
And I apologize for what Veena did.

237
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,120
She was just following my orders.

238
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,400
Laor.

239
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,560
I'm sorry.

240
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,440
Our friendship may have
started from a scheme,

241
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,600
but now I've got to know you,

242
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,400
I'm really glad to be your friend.

243
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,080
You will always be my best friend,

244
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,760
Tiny.

245
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,840
It's okay, Mee.

246
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,840
Dr. Chat didn't have to say a word.

247
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,520
We realized what was going on.

248
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,240
Let's just say,

249
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,200
you have to tell me first
when you have good news.

250
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,800
I'll throw you a party at my hotel.

251
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,560
Fine.

252
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,680
Come here.

253
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,160
Don't be shy.

254
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,720
You should go.

255
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,520
Everyone's waiting for you.

256
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,480
Okay.

257
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,080
Let's go.

258
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,360
Shall we?

259
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,240
Thank you so much.

260
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,800
You live in Thailand,

261
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,640
but you show up

262
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,200
the moment our country needs help.

263
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,720
I have the blood of Viengphukhum
running through me.

264
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,400
You couldn't possibly expect me
to abandon the people.

265
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,960
I owe you my gratitude as well.

266
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,160
Don't say that.

267
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,640
It's me who owes you an apology

268
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,240
for leaving so soon.

269
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,640
We received news from Thailand

270
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
that Grandma Orn fell ill.

271
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,480
Please don't worry about

272
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,960
the temple renovation.

273
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:40,240
I'll draw up the plans
and send them to you as soon as possible.

274
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,320
I hope

275
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,160
you find your family.

276
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,480
Let me repeat myself

277
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,800
that His Majesty and I consider you

278
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,680
a member of the Phukhumwong family,

279
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:06,040
regardless of whether or not
you find your biological family.

280
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

281
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,800
Kan.

282
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,480
I will fly to Bangkok

283
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:24,840
to see you next week
after my mission is complete.

284
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,280
You'd better.

285
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,760
If you postpone the flight,
I'll cancel the wedding.

286
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,840
All right.

287
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,280
I'll accompany you to the airport,

288
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,680
then I'll cross the border
to Nong Khai with Laorchan.

289
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,600
Please send Great-Grandma Orn our regards.

290
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,400
I must apologize

291
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:56,040
for not going to visit her myself.

292
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,640
It's all right. You have
an appointment in Nong Khai.

293
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,600
My dad is taking care of her,

294
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,080
so you have nothing to worry about.

295
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,960
Shall we?

296
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,040
After you.

297
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,880
Are you sure

298
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,480
we will find documents
from my great-grandparents' era here?

299
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,760
According to Princess Fuangphet's letter,

300
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,320
she met your great-grandpa here.

301
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,880
Therefore,

302
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,480
the story most likely began in Nong Khai,
Princess Fuangphet's hometown.

303
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,400
My mom contacted Deputy Boonkerd

304
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,760
for assistance in searching
for the documents.

305
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,120
I first met your dad

306
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,480
when he was granted royal consent
to accompany Prince Prajaksilpakom,

307
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,840
who held the position

308
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:36,200
of Grand Lord of Udon Thani County
in Nong Khai,

309
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,400
so he could search for his missing sister.

310
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,240
He saved me from bandits
who threatened my life and property.

311
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,640
I then reciprocated by volunteering
to search for his missing sister.

312
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,360
Little did I know

313
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,240
that the mutual assistance would lead

314
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,560
to complications in the future.

315
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,560
Laor.

316
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,680
Laor.

317
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,040
Hello, Mr. Phuthaneth.

318
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,840
-Hello.
-Hello.

319
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,880
-Please come inside.
-Thank you.

320
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,240
Here's the file

321
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,160
containing a list of government officials
who accompanied Prince Prajaksilpakom,

322
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,240
the Grand Lord of Udon Thani County,

323
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,800
from the year 1909.

324
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,360
I instructed my subordinates to gather
all the documents they could.

325
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,800
That year,

326
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,200
His Highness went back

327
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,440
to report to His Majesty the King
at the Royal Palace,

328
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,240
and returned accompanied
by a team of ten aides.

329
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,400
Their names are listed in the file.

330
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,560
Thank you very much.

331
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,640
Were all ten of them

332
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,240
employed here as government officials?

333
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,720
No.

334
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,360
Only seven of them were.

335
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,600
The remaining three officers

336
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,560
accompanied His Highness
for different reasons.

337
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,840
May I know these three officers' names?

338
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,760
The first officer
was Khun In Ratchasunthorn.

339
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,800
The second officer was Wisut Setthaseni.

340
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,880
The third officer's name

341
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,520
was Chak, last name unknown.

342
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,360
Do you know the purpose of their visit?

343
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,720
No.

344
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,200
I only know that Khun In Ratchasunthorn

345
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:35,440
fell in love with the daughter of
a high-ranking official,

346
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,560
who was from a family
of renowned local jewelers.

347
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,760
A family of jewelers?

348
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
Yes.

349
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,920
Fuangphet's family were royal jewelers.

350
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,400
-Hello.
-Hello.

351
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,840
Let me know if you need anything.

352
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,120
Okay, thank you.

353
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,640
Are you here

354
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,240
about Princess Fuangphet?

355
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,960
Yes.

356
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,600
I had been in an accident in Phra Nakhon

357
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,160
at the time Princess Fuangphet left

358
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,000
to marry Prince Siwilai.

359
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,560
I was hospitalized

360
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,400
for many months.

361
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,080
For that reason, I couldn't follow her

362
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,840
to Viengphukhum.

363
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,560
I understand.

364
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,480
It's enough for me

365
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,080
just to hear

366
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,360
your recollections about this.

367
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,240
After I was discharged,

368
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,120
I heard that

369
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,400
she was pregnant with Prince Peerapong.

370
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,840
Did you keep in touch with her?

371
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,720
Yes.

372
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,080
When she

373
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,720
brought her son

374
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,840
to visit her dad in Thailand,

375
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,080
my mom brought the boy

376
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,720
to my house to play.

377
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,920
Unfortunately, I didn't get
a chance to meet him.

378
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,880
Back then,

379
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,120
I was studying abroad.

380
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,880
Princess Fuangphet's path and mine
never seemed to cross.

381
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,240
However,

382
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,560
I still miss her

383
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,320
and think of her all the time.

384
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,560
Perhaps it's because fate dictated
that you follow different paths.

385
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,800
I understand your side of the story.

386
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,640
I'm just wondering

387
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:17,680
why you didn't reply

388
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,920
to any of her letters.

389
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,160
Her letters?

390
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,760
I replied to every single letter.

391
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,720
Most of the time,

392
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,920
she wouldn't write

393
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,480
letters to me.

394
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,720
She would address
the letters to Sabaithip,

395
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,840
my wife,

396
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,800
because those two

397
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,640
were best friends.

398
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,240
They were childhood friends.

399
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,920
Wait.

400
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,720
Are you saying

401
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,800
you were not

402
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,920
in a romantic relationship
with Princess Fuangphet?

403
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,840
It's okay, Laor.

404
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,560
It may not be him,
but you still have two more candidates.

405
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,120
Who are these two candidates?

406
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,680
The first one is Wisut Setthaseni.

407
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,680
The second one is Chak.

408
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,520
His last name is unknown.

409
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,680
Setthaseni?

410
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,080
That name sounds familiar.

411
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,480
It's the name of an ambassador.

412
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,840
Ambassador Wichai Setthaseni,
who is currently stationed in Italy.

413
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,040
Saruj, Dad.

414
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,440
Yes.

415
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,360
I'm going to call him.

416
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,400
That's a good idea.

417
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,320
Hello, Saruj.

418
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,440
Are you free to talk?

419
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,680
Hello, Uncle Chai Lek.

420
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,880
Hello.

421
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,480
Hello, Auntie Sroi.

422
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,480
Hello.

423
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,560
Hello, Saruj.

424
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,600
It has been a while. How have you been?

425
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,240
Laorchan, this is M.L. Saruj Jutathep,

426
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,880
secretary to the Thai ambassador
in Switzerland.

427
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,400
This is Laorchan, my secretary.

428
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,880
Hello.

429
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,240
Hello, it's nice to meet you, Laor.

430
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,760
Poom and Chat told me

431
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,360
you are beautiful and smart.

432
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,240
Most importantly,
you keep this guy in check.

433
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,080
We finally meet.

434
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,400
Stop talking. Go sit.

435
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,280
-Sit here.
-Come here.

436
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,600
Laor, he knows
all about the diplomatic services.

437
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,920
Saruj, do you know anyone
in the Setthaseni family?

438
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,400
Of course.

439
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,760
Warat Setthaseni.

440
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,080
He's a friend of mine.

441
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,600
Is there something I can help you with?

442
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,800
That's right. My great-grandpa, Wisut,
went looking for his sister in Nong Khai.

443
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,240
At that time, my great-great-grandma
was very sick and she missed her daughter.

444
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,840
So she asked Wisut to go
and bring his sister home.

445
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,520
How long was he in Nong Khai for?

446
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,120
Well, it was a long time
before he found his sister

447
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,640
at Phra Boribanphuthorn's residence.

448
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,360
That's Princess Fuangphet's dad.

449
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,400
That's right.

450
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,480
My great-grandpa said
she was a princess from Viengphukhum.

451
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,160
Do you know her?

452
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,880
Yes.

453
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,480
She's my great-grandma.

454
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,560
What a small world.

455
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,400
My great-grandpa
always talked fondly of her.

456
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,880
He said she was extremely generous.

457
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,440
When she heard
he was looking for his sister,

458
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:25,960
she offered to help and found out
that she was working as a clerk.

459
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,480
Once he found his sister,

460
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,840
did he take her home right away?

461
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,440
Yes.

462
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,000
But their mom died
days after their return.

463
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,880
After that, he never returned
to Nong Khai again.

464
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,800
He wanted to

465
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,520
because he loved it there.

466
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,920
He planned to settle down there.

467
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,200
Why didn't he go back?

468
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,560
His sister who went missing, Vilai,

469
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,000
fell ill with pneumonia

470
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,120
and died not long after their mom.

471
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
Princess Fuangphet and Prince Siwilai

472
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,920
even attended their funerals.

473
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
It was a great honor for our family.

474
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,880
Does this mean Princess Fuangphet
and Prince Siwilai were already married

475
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,760
when Wisut went to Nong Khai?

476
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,199
Yes, my great-grandpa
was so close to Prince Siwilai

477
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,920
that he considered him a brother.

478
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,639
My family used to visit Princess Fuangphet
in Nong Khai every year

479
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,480
up until she died.

480
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,639
We lost touch with the family

481
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,280
after they moved to France.

482
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,920
Fortunately, I still have some photos.

483
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,480
Who is this?

484
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,120
This is Wisut.

485
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,080
This is Khun In.

486
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,320
Let me see.

487
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,720
May I take it out?

488
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,960
"Wisut Setthaseni."

489
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,600
"Chak."

490
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,760
No surname though.

491
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,760
"Khun In Ratchasunthorn."

492
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,520
So this is what Chak looks like.

493
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,400
May I borrow these photos for a few days?

494
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,200
Sure, no problem.

495
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,680
Thank you.

496
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,800
These photos are 70 to 80 years old.

497
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,000
His face looks familiar,

498
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,200
but I can't think of who he resembles.

499
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,080
Sroi, take a look.

500
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,400
Well.

501
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,360
If we had his last name,

502
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,520
we would have something to look into.

503
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,640
But it only says "Chak" here.

504
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,960
And we only know

505
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,680
that he was looking
for his sister in Nong Khai.

506
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,360
How do we continue the search?

507
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,360
I know someone who can help us.

508
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,720
-Poom.
-Poom.

509
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,560
Listen.

510
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,680
I don't usually believe

511
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,240
in these kinds of things.

512
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,160
However,

513
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,360
Poom just stopped by to have tea with me

514
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,520
on his way to visit Great-Grandma Orn.

515
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,840
I assume he's at her residence right now.

516
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,280
That's perfect.
I'll take Laorchan to visit her too.

517
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,560
I've been wanting to visit her as well.

518
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,400
Please take some banana cake

519
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,400
to Great-Grandma Orn for me.

520
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,800
Jaew.

521
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,400
Is Poom inside with Great-Grandma Orn?

522
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,320
He just left.

523
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,640
I just helped him load his car.

524
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,560
He had to hurry off.

525
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,200
Where's Great-Grandma Orn?

526
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,920
She's in the living room.
Please follow me.

527
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,840
This way.

528
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,680
Great-Grandma Orn,
my mom baked banana cake for you.

529
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,760
Thank you. Jaew, take it, please.

530
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,720
Allow me.

531
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,560
Thank you.

532
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,000
What are you doing here?

533
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,440
-Hello.
-Hello.

534
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,520
It's good to see you.

535
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,760
We took Laorchan to see Saruj's friend.

536
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,320
She's looking for her family.

537
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,760
I see. How is it going?

538
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,840
We only have photos.

539
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,880
Is that so? Let me see.

540
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,680
Here.

541
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,680
-What photos?
-Here.

542
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,080
Who are these people?

543
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,920
TAKEN ON

544
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,040
Oh, no.

545
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,120
The ancestors of the Dhevaprom family

546
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,760
must hold a grudge against us

547
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,400
for breaking the promise.

548
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,560
That's why Mr. Chakkarin has returned
to claim the promise.

549
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:50,160
Please forgive us.

550
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:53,040
Who were you talking about just now?

551
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,400
Mr. Chakkarin?

552
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,600
Him.

553
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,680
This man in the photo

554
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,040
is Prince Chakkarin,

555
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:04,440
the dad of M.R. Dhevapan,

556
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,200
the founding dad of the Dhevaprom family.

557
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,960
It was the biggest scandal

558
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,960
in Phra Nakhon back then.

559
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,920
Can you tell us about it?

560
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,840
Mr. Chakkarin

561
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,560
had to go after his sister, Ms. Jaithip,

562
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,760
who had run away

563
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,240
with a royal musician

564
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,840
to Nong Khai.

565
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,200
Ma'am.

566
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,840
Did he manage to find her?

567
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,320
Apparently not.

568
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,720
But he spent months in Nong Khai

569
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,840
searching for her until he heard a rumor

570
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,840
that she had fled to Korat.

571
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,560
He went to search for her in Korat

572
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,360
where he caught malaria.

573
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,160
Due to the illness, his dad sent people

574
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,880
to bring him home to be treated.

575
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,640
Did he ever see his sister again?

576
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,480
To this day,

577
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,560
nobody knows where she went.

578
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,960
He might have found her

579
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,680
had he lived longer.

580
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,560
Unfortunately, he passed away

581
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,880
at the age of 35.

582
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,560
What happened to him?

583
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,360
Was it a serious illness that killed him?

584
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,200
No.

585
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,080
He had reason to return to Nong Khai.

586
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,560
Unfortunately,

587
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,840
he got in a car accident

588
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,400
in Saraburi on his way to Nong Khai.

589
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,760
He was seriously injured.

590
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,760
He was brought back
to Phra Nakhon for treatment.

591
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,600
I remember it clearly

592
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,120
because I visited him
for two weeks at the hospital

593
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,800
before he passed away.

594
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,760
Why are you asking about him?

595
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,600
Is everything all right?

596
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,600
Well.

597
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,280
There's a chance

598
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,800
that he could be Laorchan's great-grandpa.

599
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,800
Sleep in here tonight.
Get a good night's sleep.

600
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,600
We'll figure out

601
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:01,080
what to say to the Dhevaproms tomorrow.

602
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,360
What's with the face?

603
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,600
Aren't you happy to find out
who your great-grandpa was?

604
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,640
I am happy to know

605
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,520
that he might be my great-grandpa.

606
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,760
I'm just worried that the Dhevaprom family

607
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,400
won't accept me
once they find out about this.

608
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,040
You'll find out tomorrow.

609
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,480
You have my support.

610
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,960
We'll see what they have to say.

611
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:46,240
Laor.

612
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,840
No one would turn their back

613
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,440
on a dignified, competent,

614
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,080
grateful,

615
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,840
and beautiful woman.

616
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,760
So you don't have to worry about them
not accepting you.

617
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,840
Thank you so much.

618
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,040
You always cheer me up.

619
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,560
Sleep tight.

620
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,000
Come on, Phu. Let her rest.

621
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,800
Phu,

622
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,240
you will have plenty of time
to stare at each other.

623
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,920
Come on. It's time to go.

624
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,520
All right.

625
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,480
Your dad and I had a secret relationship.

626
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,040
We went against tradition,

627
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,840
but we were in love.

628
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,080
I admit that the nearly one month
I spent with your dad

629
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:31,560
brought me immense happiness.

630
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,320
Soon after,

631
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:38,040
news came that his sister
had been spotted in Korat,

632
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,960
so he went there,

633
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,720
promising to return to me.

634
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:47,440
I waited for him for two months,
but he never returned.

635
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,440
Later, I found out

636
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:54,000
that your grandpa offered me
to Prince Siwilai

637
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,200
to establish ties between them.

638
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,840
I couldn't refuse the marriage.

639
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:04,120
I was sent to Viengphukhum
along with a child in my womb.

640
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,360
I confessed the truth to Prince Siwilai
as soon as I arrived.

641
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,880
Instead of getting angry,

642
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,280
he was understanding.

643
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:16,960
Unexpectedly, he loved
and cherished me even more.

644
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,520
Please stop asking me

645
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,640
about the identity of your real dad.

646
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,320
I sent him three letters

647
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,320
but received no response.

648
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,240
I even went looking for him
in Phra Nakhon myself

649
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,120
with you in my womb.

650
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,840
That was when I discovered the truth.

651
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,680
I had no choice but to endure the pain.

652
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,480
Please consider

653
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,360
Prince Siwilai as the only loving dad

654
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,720
in your life.

655
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,680
Prince Peerapong Phukhumwong,

656
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,000
you are dearly loved by Prince Siwilai.

657
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,280
Did he have the accident

658
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,480
on his way back to see her in Nong Khai?

659
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,600
My mom baked you a fruit cake.

660
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,600
Thank you

661
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,560
for still thinking of this old man.

662
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:34,640
You are welcome.

663
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:41,240
Come on, sit with me. Get up.

664
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:42,880
Thank you.

665
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,120
Do you live alone?

666
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,440
Yes.

667
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:09,080
Waew is also here to take care of me.

668
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,280
Ked has a family now.
She moved out decades ago.

669
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,360
As for Maratee

670
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,320
and

671
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,520
Vilairumpa…

672
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,960
I don't know where they are.

673
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,600
They do not

674
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,560
contact me anymore.

675
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,920
Anyway,

676
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,000
aren't you

677
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,560
Chai Lek's eldest child?

678
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,520
Yes, my name is Phuthaneth.

679
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,120
I have one younger sister named Kanthika.

680
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,000
This is Laorchan, my secretary.

681
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:06,840
I see.

682
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,240
Hello.

683
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,760
Is there a reason you came to see me,

684
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,440
other than to bring me this cake?

685
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,960
I have a question for you.

686
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:34,280
Did your dad have a younger sister?

687
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,920
Why do you ask?

688
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:45,080
Was her name Jaithip?

689
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,040
How do you know?

690
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:55,200
She disappeared from the palace

691
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,640
so Mr. Chakkarin went to look for her

692
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,160
in Nong Khai, right?

693
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,160
Where did you get that information?

694
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:05,840
Who told you that story?

695
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,680
What do you want? What brings you here?

696
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,160
Well, there's a small chance

697
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,480
that we are related.

698
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,840
What do you mean?

699
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,160
Are you saying

700
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,480
you are related to Aunt Jaithip?

701
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,640
Who are you?

702
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:41,760
Phu.

703
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,840
Who is this woman?

704
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,680
I don't consider

705
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,640
someone who ran away with a man

706
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:54,080
and then left her family humiliated

707
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,360
a member of my family.

708
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,600
Phu.

709
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,800
Get this woman out of my house.
She isn't welcome here.

710
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,720
I'm not saying

711
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,120
-I'm--
-What are you doing here?

712
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,680
Oh, no.

713
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:15,320
Grandpa, what's wrong?

714
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,120
What happened, Uncle?

715
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,480
Phu, why did you bring her here?

716
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,560
What happened?

717
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,200
This woman

718
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:29,280
is claiming

719
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,840
to be a descendant

720
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,560
of Aunt Jaithip.

721
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:42,320
How dare you make up a story
about being a Dhevaprom.

722
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:45,120
She's not making it up.

723
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,080
There's a possibility.

724
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,280
Get…

725
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,480
Get out!

726
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,120
Don't come back again.

727
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,760
This family

728
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,200
has been through enough already.

729
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,160
She vanished decades ago.

730
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,880
Why are you reopening old wounds?

731
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,400
Get out!

732
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,120
Get out!

733
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,200
Oh no. Mom.

734
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,480
EMERGENCY

735
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,840
Please wait outside.

736
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,520
EMERGENCY

737
00:52:35,600 --> 00:52:38,080
You'll have to pay for his hospital bills.

738
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,680
He wound up in here
because of your stupid story.

739
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,720
I'll take care of it.

740
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,720
Your silly joke
sent an old man into shock.

741
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,360
What would you do
if something happened to him?

742
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:54,400
Would you still want to be a Dhevaprom?

743
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,960
Nuch, what happened?

744
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,760
What caused him to go into shock?

745
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,320
I'll tell you what.

746
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,760
A strange woman

747
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:08,080
suddenly showed up
and claimed to be a Dhevaprom.

748
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:12,960
STAFF ONLY

749
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,360
Doctor, how is my dad doing?

750
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,520
He's experiencing chest pain

751
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,440
caused by acute coronary syndrome.
I've given him medicine.

752
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:24,040
We will wait for the patient's heart rate
and blood oxygen levels to normalize

753
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:26,840
before considering moving him
to a recovery room.

754
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,840
We'll need to monitor him
for a couple of nights.

755
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:29,920
I see.

756
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,320
-I have to go.
-Thank you very much.

757
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,720
Thank you.

758
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:37,720
Who will stay with the patient tonight?

759
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,120
Me.

760
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,640
-Okay, please sign a form inside.
-Sure.

761
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,720
Oh, my goodness.

762
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,280
What a shame.

763
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:50,000
If she didn't have an interview
with a magazine today,

764
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,240
she would gladly offer

765
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:54,360
to stay with her grandpa.

766
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,160
Isn't that right?

767
00:53:58,120 --> 00:53:59,960
Yes, Aunt Ked.

768
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,440
Oh, no. It's almost time, Mom.

769
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,920
We should go or we will be late.

770
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,440
-Let's leave then.
-Yes. Please excuse us.

771
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,920
-See you later.
-Thank you.

772
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,400
Goodbye.

773
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:16,760
I'm going

774
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,640
to check on Grandpa…

775
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,320
I mean, my dad.

776
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:25,280
Do you want me to tell Mr. Chinnakorn
and Chavit that you are here?

777
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,520
That won't be necessary.
Mr. Chinnakorn is in Hong Kong

778
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,760
exploring the gold market
with our children.

779
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,160
So it's just me. I have to go.

780
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,200
Goodbye.

781
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,720
-Ma'am.
-Ma'am.

782
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,120
Hey, Phu.

783
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,440
Why are you home so late?

784
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,520
Where's Laor?

785
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,040
She's with Mr. Dhevapan at the hospital.

786
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:18,000
Has Ked been informed?

787
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,240
Yes.

788
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,680
She met us at the hospital
but she fainted. She was fatigued.

789
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,360
I believe she's receiving IV fluids
in a room next to her dad's.

790
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,120
Hold on.

791
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:34,080
What caused Mr. Dhevapan
to be hospitalized?

792
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,400
Mr. Dhevapan.

793
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:24,640
Mr. Dhevapan.

794
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,240
Mr. Dhevapan, what's wrong?

795
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,520
Mr. Dhevapan.

796
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:35,640
Nurse.

797
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,000
Come quickly.

798
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:42,080
Mr. Dhevapan.

799
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,680
Mr. Dhevapan.

800
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,520
Mr. Dhevapan, what's wrong?

801
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,960
You might disagree with what I'm doing

802
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,520
but

803
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,560
I really need your support right now.

804
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:17,880
What are you doing here?

805
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,840
Mr. Dhevapan had an episode.

806
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,720
A nurse is taking care of him.

807
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,560
You look very concerned by this.

808
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,520
I don't know

809
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,560
if I'm really a Dhevaprom.

810
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,200
But if I am,

811
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,120
I'm worried that…

812
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:02,200
they won't accept me.

813
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,280
Is being a Dhevaprom

814
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,320
that important to you?

815
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,160
Yes.

816
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,680
Throughout my life, I have had to change

817
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,200
my surname continuously,

818
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:32,320
from Phukhumwong to Pundheva,

819
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,400
because my grandpa

820
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,840
was a political refugee.

821
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,960
I even had to change my surname

822
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:44,320
while I was in France

823
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,600
to Beaumont.

824
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,920
I couldn't let paparazzi
and reporters find out

825
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:53,840
that I was related to Audrey Roufier.

826
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,240
Audrey Roufier?

827
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,040
The French actress?

828
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,920
How are you related to her?

829
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,800
She's my mom.

830
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:09,800
You're Audrey Roufier's daughter?

831
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,520
Yes.

832
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,960
My mom came to shoot a movie in Thailand.

833
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,920
My dad was the producer.

834
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,760
They fell in love

835
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,800
and I was born.

836
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,720
However,

837
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,560
my mom couldn't let anyone find out.

838
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:31,000
She had to live in hiding in Bangkok

839
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,840
during her pregnancy.

840
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:36,840
She took me back to France
after I was born.

841
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,160
Do you see her often?

842
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,960
Occasionally.

843
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,440
But our encounters

844
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,160
are almost meaningless.

845
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,520
I lived in the same country as my mom,

846
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,040
but I barely had an opportunity

847
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:17,680
to talk to her.

848
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,560
Audrey.

849
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,200
Please!

850
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:30,200
How is the shooting going?

851
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,880
Have a good day.

852
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,120
I'll take your picture.

853
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,480
The only opportunity I had to meet my mom

854
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,840
was when someone picked me up

855
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,720
-and drove me to her house.
-You look pretty.

856
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,200
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

857
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:11,240
All done.

858
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:17,440
Mom, can you teach me
to walk like a model?

859
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,240
Of course.

860
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:29,720
But as you can probably guess,

861
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:33,440
my happiness

862
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,040
never lasted long.

863
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:37,880
Good job.

864
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,120
It's time to go.

865
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,960
I have to go to work.

866
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,200
Okay.

867
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,120
Can you give me a little something?

868
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,640
I'm leaving now.

869
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,040
-Bye.
-Bye.

870
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:21,720
As time passed,

871
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:26,760
I saw her less and less.

872
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,760
The only thing I could do

873
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,600
that no one could blame me for

874
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,840
was to send letters and postcards

875
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,440
to my mom.

876
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,360
It was to let her know

877
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,040
that I was thinking of her.

878
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,280
I know how you must be feeling, Laorchan.

879
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,160
Have you ever been mad at your parents?

880
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,360
Never.

881
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,520
I just didn't understand.

882
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,760
As a kid, I used to question

883
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,800
why I didn't have the things

884
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,160
other kids had.

885
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:06,880
As I grew up,

886
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,920
I realized

887
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,800
that everyone has their reasons
for what they do.

888
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,600
I had the opportunity to care
for my dad until his last breath.

889
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,320
I had the opportunity to meet my mom

890
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:27,760
and talk to her.

891
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,200
I couldn't have asked for more.

892
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,120
It's better than not meeting them at all.

893
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,560
But sometimes, I get tired.

894
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,120
Tired of having to discover
my background continuously…

895
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,880
much like I am right now.

896
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,200
Don't worry.

897
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:19,840
From now on,

898
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,520
you won't be alone anymore.

899
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,520
Whether or not you are a Dhevaprom,

900
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,120
or whether or not
they welcome you into the family,

901
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,200
I will always be here for you.

902
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,920
You really want people to believe

903
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,600
that you are related
to Jaithip, don't you?

904
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,640
I'm here as Fuangphet's
great-granddaughter.

905
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:20,120
How dare you invent a relationship between
my dad and your great-grandma.

906
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,840
Why don't you finish the letter?

907
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,560
I won't read it.

908
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:25,680
Perhaps he wasn't aware

909
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:29,240
that his dad was involved
with any women besides his mom.

910
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:31,800
I will prove to the Dhevaprom family

911
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,800
that Princess Fuangphet
had honor and dignity.

912
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,640
Did Princess Fuangphet even exist?

913
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,160
No one ever saw her.

914
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:39,640
I did.

915
