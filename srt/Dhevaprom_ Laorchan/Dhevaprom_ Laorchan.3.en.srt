1
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,640
In the time before the Buddha,

2
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,400
there was a naga named Lord Naga Trinetr.

3
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,240
How is the Ajna Chakra Necklace

4
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,240
connected to Lord Naga Trinetr?

5
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,680
It's magnificent.

6
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,400
No wonder so many people want it.

7
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,240
Is it true that he put a curse

8
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,960
on the people of Pimpa Kingdom?

9
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,120
I'd be happy to do it myself.

10
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,680
Laorchan will help write the script for
the Ajna Chakra Necklace documentary.

11
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,000
Hello, everyone.

12
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,280
Were you able to decipher the inscription?

13
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,520
I was able to interpret
some details regarding the curse,

14
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,200
but where it talks about the time,
I'm not sure.

15
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Laorchan might be able to help.

16
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,760
Yes, sir.

17
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,520
To those who dare

18
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,880
steal the third eye from me

19
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,120
which I've attained through merit-making

20
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,360
over hundreds of years,

21
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,320
I damn them

22
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,200
and all their descendants

23
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,440
to eternal suffering and ruin!

24
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,560
The curse will manifest itself
every 18 years

25
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,240
from now and for eternity!

26
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,360
Why must the curse resurface
every 18 years?

27
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,440
Because Lord Naga Trinetr
came up from the underworld

28
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,040
to observe the precepts on Earth

29
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,680
for a duration of 18 days

30
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,560
every 18 years.

31
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,640
Have you read this book before?

32
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
Yes.

33
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,920
I borrowed it from the library recently.

34
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,440
I haven't finished it yet.

35
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,120
The people of Pimpa worked together

36
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,560
to restore their kingdom.

37
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,040
The kingdom had many rulers from then

38
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,920
until the reign

39
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,920
of King Nantha.

40
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,360
That's correct.

41
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,880
King Nantha was the one

42
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,760
who gathered people
to build a temple near the cave

43
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,280
where Lord Naga Trinetr had perished.

44
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,200
He had his men build
a statue of Lord Naga Trinetr

45
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,400
and adorn it with a dark blue sapphire,

46
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,480
that was said to be the third eye,

47
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,640
as an offering to the statue

48
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,880
due to his fear of the curse

49
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,120
and all the horrifying myths.

50
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Maybe it was his faith that saved him,
but somehow

51
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,000
King Nantha reigned

52
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,560
over the kingdom in peace

53
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,360
for almost 50 years.

54
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,760
He was also the longest-living ruler.

55
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,360
After that,

56
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,280
many of his descendants

57
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,680
became the rulers of the kingdom

58
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,840
for many hundreds of years.

59
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,800
So,

60
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,040
what happened?

61
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,160
Why isn't the Pimpa Kingdom

62
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,600
on the ancient map of Viengphukhum?

63
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,320
Pimpa became a lost kingdom

64
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,440
when the Khmer kingdom rose to power

65
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,200
and there was also
an earthquake during that time.

66
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,880
So what happened
to the sapphire third eye and the temple?

67
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,360
They became lost, just like Pimpa Kingdom.

68
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,960
They were never seen again.

69
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,680
During King Atitayawong's reign
over Viengphukhum,

70
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:29,400
a hunter went into the woods in the north.

71
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,800
He was with a friend
who was a jeweler in the royal palace.

72
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,960
They came across the temple by chance.

73
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,760
The hunter and the jeweler

74
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,560
decided to go in and explore the temple.

75
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,080
They found a rock
inscribed with the curse.

76
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,280
But when they saw the statue

77
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,040
and the sapphire third eye
of Lord Naga Trinetr…

78
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:44,840
Let's do it.

79
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,320
They became covetous

80
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,720
and wished to take
the sapphire for themselves.

81
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,240
They climbed up the statue
and took the third eye out

82
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,760
and brought it back to Viengphukhum.

83
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,680
Did those two men actually manage
to steal the third eye?

84
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,680
Was it really that easy?

85
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,720
Maybe everything was fated to be that way.

86
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,799
They committed a sin,

87
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,000
so they had to face the consequences.

88
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,480
We all have to face

89
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,919
tests of love, greed, anger, and lust.

90
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,640
No one can escape it.

91
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,560
Laorchan makes a good point.

92
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,840
After that,

93
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:55,120
terrible things began to happen.

94
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,640
There are detailed records
about incidents in that period.

95
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,480
How did the sapphire third eye

96
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,680
end up on the Ajna Chakra Necklace?

97
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,360
Did it start with Prince Siwilai,

98
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,000
my great-grandpa's brother?

99
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,880
The brother of King Atitayawong,

100
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,560
your great-grandpa?

101
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,160
That means

102
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,200
he's my mom's grandpa.

103
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,480
That's right.

104
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,200
Prince Siwilai found out

105
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,520
about the third eye from the hunter

106
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,960
who was an old friend.

107
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,400
He went to the jeweler's house
hoping to buy the sapphire,

108
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,760
but the jeweler was panicking

109
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,600
because he was afraid
of Lord Naga Trinetr's curse.

110
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,600
He was planning to return
the sapphire to the temple.

111
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
But he couldn't

112
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,840
because…

113
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,160
My gosh!

114
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,400
No.

115
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,240
Don't!

116
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,520
Please don't.

117
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,920
No!

118
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,400
No! Stop!

119
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,200
Please don't hurt me!

120
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,200
I'm sorry!

121
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,760
Please don't kill me!

122
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,960
Please forgive me.

123
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,360
Please don't take my life.

124
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,360
Chiang.

125
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,520
Please.

126
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,040
What's the matter?

127
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,840
It's me.

128
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,720
Prince Siwilai.

129
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,240
I already told him

130
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,040
everything that happened.

131
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,640
The prince would like

132
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,600
to buy the sapphire from you.

133
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,440
Khum.

134
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,520
Didn't you tell the prince

135
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,000
what we did

136
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,440
and what we've been through?

137
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,360
We trespassed on sacred ground.

138
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,400
We stole an object

139
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,960
that belonged to our ancestors.

140
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,160
You and I need to take the sapphire

141
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,080
back to the temple.

142
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,600
I told you, Your Highness,

143
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,440
that he wouldn't agree to it.

144
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,200
This sapphire is cursed.

145
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,360
Please don't associate yourself with it.

146
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
Otherwise,

147
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,160
misfortune will be upon you

148
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,320
just like it's upon the two of us now.

149
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,440
No!

150
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,000
Don't!

151
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,080
Don't hurt me!

152
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,160
Please forgive me.

153
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,640
Your fear has made you delusional, Chiang.

154
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,920
Maybe you're not worthy

155
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,440
of possessing that sapphire.

156
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,960
I want to buy it for my brother.

157
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,480
Do you have a problem?

158
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,880
It makes you fear for your life.

159
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,160
But if you don't sell it to me,

160
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,360
I will kill you myself

161
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,440
as punishment

162
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,920
for stealing.

163
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,760
Not only that.

164
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,720
Your family

165
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,520
will also suffer because of this.

166
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,280
But…

167
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,080
this sapphire,

168
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,800
it already has an owner, Your Highness.
I'm afraid that--

169
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,400
Would you rather be killed

170
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,280
by your own delusions

171
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,440
or have your head cut off?

172
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,080
It's your choice.

173
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,280
Here, Your Highness.

174
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,120
Is that the sapphire third eye?

175
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
Did you lead me to the sapphire third eye

176
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,600
just so General Luecha could rob me?

177
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,480
I…

178
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,600
I had no choice, Your Highness.

179
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,440
Please forgive me.

180
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,760
Do you plan to keep
the sapphire third eye to yourself?

181
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,320
Did you forget the promise you made?

182
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,680
I didn't forget.

183
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,160
I just wanted to keep it a secret.

184
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,560
Right now,

185
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,240
there's talk about the rebels
wanting to stage a coup

186
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,360
against King Atitayawong.

187
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,920
I'll put this sapphire on a necklace

188
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,560
and give it to my brother.

189
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,760
To stop the rumor

190
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,680
that the King's brother
wants to dethrone him?

191
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,560
How clever.

192
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,720
How wise.

193
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,800
You'll make a good king
when you reign over Viengphukhum.

194
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,760
How long is it going to take?

195
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,280
How long must I wait?

196
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,600
After you become king,

197
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,760
who will get the necklace?

198
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,200
The Thapana Association.

199
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,560
In the end, that sapphire was used

200
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,000
to make the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

201
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,360
Prince Siwilai

202
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,880
gave the necklace
to King Atitayawong as a gift

203
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,640
on the 15th anniversary
of his accession to the throne.

204
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,720
Have you seen it?

205
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,440
What happened to the hunter

206
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,960
and the jeweler?

207
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,240
According to the statements
given by a snake charmer, the police,

208
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,360
and the witness who found their bodies,

209
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,200
those two died
in the woods near Pailin City.

210
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,400
The jeweler's mother said that

211
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,440
she saw him prepare offerings
to give to someone.

212
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,960
At the scene,

213
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,200
rice and flower offerings
were scattered everywhere.

214
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,880
How did they die?

215
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,960
Could it be that

216
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:00,840
their hallucinations

217
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,720
drove them to kill each other?

218
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,680
Venomous snakes bit them.

219
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,120
It was found that

220
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,560
they both had several
bite marks on their bodies.

221
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,600
Each mark

222
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,160
was from a different species of snake.

223
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,520
Venomous snakes
usually inhabit different regions.

224
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,400
Why were they in the same place?

225
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,400
It's so strange.

226
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,160
What's stranger is that

227
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,400
eighteen years later,

228
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Great-Grandpa Atitayawong passed away

229
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,040
from an unknown disease.

230
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,960
It's a photo of a corpse.

231
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,480
Why does he look like a snake?

232
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,400
Sahasarangsee. Satarasamee.

233
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,160
What are you doing in the prayer hall?

234
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,960
Mother, who is this in this photo?

235
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,319
Why does he look like a snake?

236
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,280
I'm scared, Mother.

237
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,560
It's a photo of King Atitayawong.

238
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,560
Your great-grandpa.

239
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,000
We still don't know

240
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,320
what disease killed him.

241
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,440
To this day, my parents
still keep those photos

242
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,680
in the prayer hall.

243
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,440
My grandpa told me that

244
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,120
when King Suriyawong ascended the throne

245
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,960
after King Atitayawong,

246
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,720
there was a lot of unrest.

247
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,240
He had to fight off the rebels
throughout his reign.

248
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,120
General Segong.

249
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,360
My mom once told me that

250
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,720
he led the rebels

251
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,800
to overthrow the Phukhumwong dynasty

252
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,400
which led Grandpa to flee the country.

253
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,400
He brought his family
and his loyal servants

254
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,040
to reside in Thailand

255
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,640
in Walahok Village.

256
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,240
That's where my mom grew up.

257
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,080
Eighteen years later,

258
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
myself,

259
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:15,960
Ruj,

260
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,320
Pat, Chai Lek, and Phee,

261
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,560
we helped King Suriyawong

262
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,000
reclaim Viengphukhum from General Segong.

263
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,360
But we lost King Suriyawong that year

264
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,520
after he handed the throne
to King Rangsimun.

265
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,000
My parents

266
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,920
have two children, who are myself

267
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,560
and my brother, Sahasarangsee.

268
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,760
Sahasarangsee

269
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,280
died of a heart attack

270
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,440
as he was riding a horse

271
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,600
down a mountain to visit flood victims.

272
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,680
The incident happened

273
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,320
after the 18th anniversary
of my dad's reign.

274
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,000
These unfortunate events
happened every 18 years.

275
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,200
It can't be a coincidence.

276
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,520
Could the curse be real?

277
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Or it could be the rebels' doing.

278
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,680
They could've staged everything

279
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,320
and made up a story
about the curse to scare the townsfolk.

280
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,400
Are there still rebels out there

281
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,280
after General Segong's death?

282
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,440
Yes.

283
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,640
These people founded
an association called Thapana

284
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,280
in my great-grandpa's time.

285
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,920
The group has had many different leaders.

286
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,720
Recently, their leader was General Segong.

287
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,320
But in its founding days,

288
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,600
we have evidence which shows that

289
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,840
Prince Siwilai was their leader.

290
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,040
Is that possible?

291
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,560
Prince Siwilai

292
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,520
was King Atitayawong's

293
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,400
own flesh and blood.

294
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,640
Please forgive me.

295
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,000
It's Madam Orn.

296
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,080
She fainted

297
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,120
as she was getting up.

298
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,000
I didn't know what to do,

299
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,440
so I had Sombun fetch you and Mr. Phu.

300
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,680
I already called Pat.

301
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,080
He's on his way here.

302
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,640
Her breathing is normal.

303
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,040
She should be fine.

304
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,000
Maybe she got up too fast.

305
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,880
We should let her rest.

306
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,320
You can get back to work.

307
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,320
Yes, sir.

308
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,240
Great-Grandma's awake.

309
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,360
Come on.

310
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,360
Get up slowly.

311
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,320
Okay.

312
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,160
All right.

313
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,160
How are you feeling?

314
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,680
I'm fine.

315
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,040
What are you all doing here?

316
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,760
Chai Yai.

317
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,400
Phu.

318
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,440
And you are…

319
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,320
Who are you?

320
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,440
Where are you from?

321
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,640
This is Colonel Wachira from Viengphukhum.

322
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,880
I see.

323
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,840
Hey, there.

324
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,760
Hello, ma'am.

325
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,720
Hello.

326
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,480
Viengphukhum.

327
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,360
Isn't that where Sroi came from?

328
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,400
-Yes.
-That's right.

329
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
I see.

330
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,000
Excuse me.

331
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,720
You can get back to work, Colonel.

332
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,000
Great-Grandma Orn is fine now.

333
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,160
She's her chatty self again.

334
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,760
Don't tease me.

335
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,960
See you this evening.

336
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,400
Then I'll get going now, ma'am.

337
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,400
All right. Goodbye, dear. Take care.

338
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,560
Goodbye, Chai Yai.

339
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,800
Bye.

340
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,280
-See you, Phu.
-See you.

341
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,320
-How are you feeling?
-Were you teasing me?

342
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,760
I was kidding.

343
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,120
I feel fine now.

344
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,840
I'm just a bit dizzy.

345
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,040
The police found Khumpheng's bag?

346
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,480
Where did they leave it?

347
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,840
So they were following us.

348
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,160
We've got nothing to lose now.

349
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,680
Let's lure them out.

350
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,320
Have our men spread the word that

351
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,960
we'll go out to party tonight.

352
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,560
All right.

353
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,720
We can finally fight them face to face.

354
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,520
But for now, we need to go to the hotel.

355
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,960
The police found their car and your bag.

356
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,200
Yes, Colonel.

357
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,280
Let's go.

358
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,320
What are you doing there?

359
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,920
I…

360
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,360
I was just

361
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,480
admiring the garden.

362
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,200
I wanted to say goodbye to the colonel,

363
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,280
but I just missed them.

364
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,400
Will you go back to the office now?

365
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,160
You should come inside.

366
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,720
Come and meet my great-grandma.

367
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,040
Hi. Hello, dear.

368
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,360
Hello, ma'am.

369
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,520
Hello.

370
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,280
You can sit here.

371
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,280
All right.

372
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,680
Thank you.

373
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,120
Great-Grandma.

374
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,240
This is Laorchan, my secretary.

375
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,680
I see. Laorchan.

376
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,600
What a beautiful name.

377
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,600
Your parents gave you a nice name.

378
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,320
Wait a second.

379
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,600
Have we ever met before?

380
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,320
Well…

381
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,600
I'm not sure, ma'am.

382
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,280
I lived in Thailand when I was young,

383
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,680
but I went to study in France.

384
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,280
I just came back recently.

385
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,360
Well, I think I've seen you before.

386
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,120
I'm sure of it.

387
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,640
It was at Dhevaprom Palace.

388
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,920
I saw you at Dhevaprom Palace.

389
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,520
Are you a Dhevaprom?

390
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,360
Well…

391
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,720
Dhevaprom?

392
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,160
Who are they?

393
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,640
Are you the daughter

394
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,440
of Maratee or Vilairumpa?

395
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,200
Well…

396
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,520
I've never heard
those names before, ma'am.

397
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,480
I don't think
Laor looks anything like those two.

398
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,360
She even looks mixed-race.

399
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,600
Still.

400
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,800
You look familiar.

401
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,280
So familiar.

402
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,040
I don't know.

403
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,720
You look like someone I know.

404
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,600
Madam.

405
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,920
It's time for your medicine.

406
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,080
I'll let you rest, Great-Grandma.

407
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,560
I have work to do.

408
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,760
What? I thought you would stay
and have snacks with me.

409
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,360
Jaew, go pack some snacks

410
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,440
for Phu and Laorchan
to take back to their office.

411
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,640
-Yes, ma'am.
-Go on.

412
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,720
All right.

413
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,480
Goodbye, Great-Grandma.

414
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,600
Goodbye.

415
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,760
Next time,

416
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,280
I'll bring Laor to have snacks with you.

417
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,520
All right.

418
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,640
Are you two into each other?

419
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,000
Are you?

420
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,640
Well…

421
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,800
Hey, listen.

422
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,920
Please don't mind her.

423
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,920
Great-Grandma Orn is very old.

424
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,880
She wants to see
her grandchildren get married.

425
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,960
I see.

426
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,280
Mr. Phu.

427
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,560
Can you tell me

428
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,560
who the Dhevaproms are?

429
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,960
Well,

430
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,040
the Dhevaproms

431
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
are my great-grandma's close friends.

432
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,280
The Jutatheps and the Dhevaproms

433
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,960
agreed to have their descendants

434
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,000
marry each other one day.

435
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,200
But…

436
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,040
it never happened.

437
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,720
Not my dad,

438
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,080
my uncles,

439
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,640
or any of my other relatives.

440
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,080
Now it's up to my generation.

441
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,800
Great-Grandma probably
hopes to see it happen.

442
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,280
So that's why

443
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,640
she thought I was someone

444
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,440
from the Dhevaprom family.

445
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,240
To tell you the truth,

446
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,640
when any of her grandsons
brings a girl home,

447
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,560
she always assumes
the girl is a Dhevaprom.

448
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,760
She probably wants to keep
the promise between the two families.

449
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,720
When that day comes,

450
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,320
Great-Grandma Orn
will surely feel relieved.

451
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,480
She's such a sweet lady.

452
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,960
Everyone I know in the Jutathep family

453
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,680
is very sweet and very kind.

454
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,760
You're so lucky

455
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,920
to have such a big and loving family.

456
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,000
We should get going.

457
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,720
All right.

458
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,240
Don't you have
any relatives here in Thailand?

459
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,840
No.

460
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,120
My parents got divorced.

461
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,840
My mom moved to France

462
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,040
and remarried.

463
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,400
My dad and I moved there later.

464
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,480
After my dad passed away,

465
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,120
I moved back here.

466
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,000
I've always felt like this is my home,

467
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,400
though I'm all alone here.

468
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,400
You're not alone.

469
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,080
You mean I have Sun and Veena?
You're right.

470
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,880
I'm very lucky to have them as friends.

471
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,480
Well…

472
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,160
I didn't mean those two.

473
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,760
I meant that

474
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,360
you also have me.

475
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,880
Mr. Phu and his secretary are here.

476
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,000
Come on in.

477
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,560
Are you here about the documentary crew?

478
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,920
It's all taken care of.

479
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,640
Who do we have?

480
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,760
I found you a PR manager

481
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,520
and a technical manager named Nikom.

482
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,480
I've reserved a meeting room for you.

483
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,080
All right. We'll have
the meeting at half past three.

484
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,120
Someone's here to see you, ma'am.

485
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,160
I'm sorry.

486
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,840
I didn't mean to interrupt.

487
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,800
You didn't interrupt anything.

488
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,440
I see you brought Kan flowers.

489
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,840
Go give them to her.

490
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,040
Why didn't you call
to say you were coming?

491
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,720
I wanted to surprise you.

492
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,920
Another surprise.

493
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,600
You sure are full of surprises.

494
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,160
Let's get back to work, Laor.

495
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,880
These two rarely get to see each other.

496
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,360
We should let them catch up.

497
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,240
Goodness, Phu.

498
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,560
Stop teasing me already.

499
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,840
You might find yourself in love

500
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,720
with someone close to you.

501
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,560
-Someone--
-Laor.

502
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,520
I have a call with Mr. Kamjorn
this afternoon, right?

503
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,760
We should go.

504
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,440
All right.

505
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,000
After you.

506
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,440
You should've told me you were coming.

507
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,880
Do you like them?

508
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,520
Yes.

509
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,880
Did you really not know

510
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,400
that Ms. Kan and Colonel Wachira

511
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,520
are engaged to be married?

512
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,800
I've never seen them together before.

513
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,040
How could I have known they were a couple?

514
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,240
Those two have been dating

515
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,440
since they studied in England.

516
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,480
The colonel's dad

517
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,320
is Ms. Sroi's best friend.

518
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,160
What's his name?
Ms. Sroi often talks about him.

519
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,960
His name is Bak Joi.

520
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,120
His real name is General Jumphol Wongsawan

521
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,880
and his wife is Lady Prapasee Wongsawan.

522
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,960
Goodness. Listen to you.

523
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:38,360
If there was a contest
for the biggest busybody in the office,

524
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,680
you would surely be the winner.

525
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,800
No one here is as nosy as you.

526
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,720
Everyone, give her a round of applause.

527
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,000
Stop it.

528
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,600
Gosh.

529
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,080
Goodness. I just remembered that

530
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,920
there's a documentary crew meeting.

531
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,800
I have to go.

532
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,680
I have to go check
the inventory. Sister, wait for me.

533
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,240
-See you, Laor.
-I should get back to work.

534
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,880
Jeab, where's the document I asked for?

535
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,400
I need that document, Jeab.

536
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,560
Well…

537
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,640
I also have to…

538
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,200
get to the meeting.

539
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,800
-Hello.
-Hello.

540
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,920
Please have a seat.

541
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,280
Let me introduce you.

542
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,440
This is Duangdao, the PR manager.

543
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,600
This is Nikom, the technical manager.

544
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,880
That's Cherd, Nikom's assistant.

545
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,520
Hello.

546
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,000
This is Laorchan.

547
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,440
She's Mr. Phu's secretary
and the scriptwriter for the documentary.

548
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,960
I'm sure you all know that our company

549
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:03,320
will be making a documentary
to promote an exhibition

550
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,920
that Thailand is hosting
with Viengphukhum.

551
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,920
The Thai government

552
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,160
has tasked us with organizing
everything for the event.

553
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,920
Although this isn't an official event,

554
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,240
the crown prince of Viengphukhum

555
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,480
will be attending the opening ceremony.

556
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,680
So everything has to be perfect.

557
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,840
I've started gathering information
for the script,

558
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,440
but there are some important points

559
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,760
concerning the Ajna Chakra Necklace

560
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,480
that need to be discussed further.

561
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
While we wait,

562
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,640
you should contact
the Viengphukhum government

563
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,880
to request footage of their landscape,

564
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,680
their agricultural products,
and all their craftwork.

565
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,680
Yes, sir.

566
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,560
That is all the announcements for today.

567
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,680
Laorchan.

568
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,320
There it is.

569
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,320
Yes?

570
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,920
Well…

571
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,160
Let me give you

572
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,280
a ride home.

573
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,880
Are you going to visit your uncle again?

574
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,360
What if I'm not?

575
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,800
Can't I give you a ride?

576
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,040
I mean,

577
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,920
my place is on the way
to your uncle's house.

578
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,719
What if…

579
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,000
I'm not going to see my uncle,

580
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,560
but I just want to take you home?

581
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,400
Would you mind that?

582
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,880
Well…

583
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,640
Goodness. You're so smooth, sir.

584
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,480
Are you hungry?

585
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,480
Do you want to go for a pad thai?

586
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,640
Well,

587
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,840
I think it might not be appropriate

588
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,600
if people see us hanging out together

589
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,080
after office hours.

590
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,120
Plenty of people work together
after office hours.

591
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,720
If you're not comfortable,

592
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,640
we can talk about work while we eat.

593
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,000
I'll pay you overtime.

594
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,080
Is that your solution?

595
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,960
We'll talk about work,
so it will be like we're working.

596
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,680
That's right.

597
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,880
Most girls want to have a meal with me.

598
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,560
You're the first one to turn me down.

599
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,200
Do you want me

600
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,480
to call your mom and ask her permission

601
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,680
to take you out?

602
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,280
If you don't want to involve your mom,

603
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,320
then you have to say yes.

604
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,720
Okay?

605
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,400
My gosh. I've missed you so much, Phu.

606
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,640
Let's go for dinner together.

607
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,440
1-9-1-3-3.

608
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:13,600
Shall we?

609
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,640
All right.

610
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,960
Let's go. I've missed you so much.

611
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,120
You're so cute.

612
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,320
1-9-1-3-3?

613
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,520
Foie gras,

614
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,120
boeuf bourguignon,

615
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,640
onion soup,

616
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,840
ratatouille

617
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,320
and…

618
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,600
Would you like anything else?

619
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,960
I'm good.

620
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,680
That'll be all.

621
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,960
Yes, sir.

622
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,560
It doesn't matter
how many years have passed.

623
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,880
You're still as handsome

624
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,360
and as sharp-looking as ever.

625
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,800
You're so cute.

626
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,080
I want to be near you all the time.

627
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,120
Excuse me.

628
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,920
Hello. Is there something urgent?

629
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,640
What?

630
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:19,120
You're the one who asked me to call you.

631
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,000
What? An emergency?

632
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,960
What? Wait a minute.

633
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,360
Did I misunderstand or are you confused?

634
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,680
Can't anyone else make the decision?

635
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,480
Hello?

636
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,480
Listen. I don't want to hear it.

637
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,360
I'll go sign the document myself.

638
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,760
Wait for me there.

639
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,960
What?

640
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,480
Eat with me first, Phu.

641
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,280
I ordered tons of food.

642
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,320
It's an emergency, Ying.

643
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,000
Phuchid.

644
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,000
Take good care of Ms. Woranuch.

645
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,080
Put the check on my tab.

646
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,520
Yes, Mr. Phu.

647
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:01,640
I think I--

648
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,440
Wait for me here, Ying. I'll be back soon.

649
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,760
But I want to go…

650
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,880
with you.

651
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,240
Hello. This is Paclink 143.

652
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,640
What's your number?

653
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,640
3-6-6-3-6-6.

654
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,760
"3-6-6-3-6-6."

655
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,480
What's your message?

656
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,080
Where are you?
I will give you a ride home.

657
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,640
"Where are you?
I will give you a ride home."

658
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,840
May I have your name?

659
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,960
It's Phuthaneth.

660
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,520
All right. All done, sir.

661
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:41,000
Thank you for using Paclink. Goodbye.

662
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,680
WHERE ARE YOU?
I WILL GIVE YOU A RIDE HOME

663
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,480
Gosh.

664
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,760
Give me a second, Sun.

665
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,200
You left?

666
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,560
Why didn't you wait for me?

667
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,600
You left to have a meal
and I thought you would be a while.

668
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,160
Besides, I'm already off work.

669
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,680
I wanted to go home.

670
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,640
Where are you calling me from?

671
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,440
Don't say you're at home.

672
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,960
You couldn't have made it home

673
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,440
in this traffic.

674
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,680
I'm using a public phone.

675
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,560
Where are you? I'll go get you.

676
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,000
It's fine. I'm with Sun.

677
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,760
If there's nothing else, I have to go.

678
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,400
See you tomorrow, Mr. Phu.

679
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:00,120
LAMDUAN APARTMENT

680
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,280
See you tonight, Sun.

681
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,440
Are you sure

682
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,960
you want to come tonight?

683
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,360
Why not?

684
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,160
You told me yourself that

685
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,360
your men heard that the prince
is going to a nightclub tonight.

686
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,600
That's the intel we got,

687
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,360
but I don't know if it's true.

688
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,480
That's why we need to go and see.

689
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,400
But it's dangerous, Laor.

690
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,000
It could be a ruse to lure the rebels out.

691
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,880
No one knows who we are.

692
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,480
More importantly, I want to know

693
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,560
who else, besides us,

694
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,040
wants to get their hands on the sapphire.

695
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,560
That way, we can deal with them.

696
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,760
Mr. Phu might get suspicious.

697
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,040
I know.

698
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:54,120
That's why I will be careful.

699
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,800
And remember our excuse.

700
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,160
We're going there

701
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,960
to celebrate my getting a new job.

702
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,040
Please, Sun.

703
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,480
All right. Fine.

704
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:13,120
You know I can't say no to you.

705
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,720
You're the sweetest.

706
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,400
I'll see you tonight.

707
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,520
Okay.

708
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,880
Here's some basil.

709
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,320
Thank you.

710
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,520
It smells good.

711
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,560
Goodness. That smells delicious.

712
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,680
What are you making, Mom?

713
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,360
I could smell it from outside.

714
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,920
It's run juan curry.

715
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,680
But as you know,

716
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,360
Kan doesn't eat beef.

717
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,000
So your mom used braised pork instead.

718
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,240
It's ready.

719
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,400
What do you think?

720
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,880
Gosh. It looks so appetizing.

721
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,160
Gosh. It smells amazing.

722
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,680
I bet it's delicious.

723
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,720
Goodness.

724
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,720
You must be starving, Phu.

725
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,560
I heard you went for a meal
with a gorgeous lady,

726
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,440
but you left before the food arrived.

727
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:53,280
I can't believe you heard about that.

728
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,240
That's right. I forgot.

729
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,800
You have your personal informants
who always bring you news.

730
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,160
Isn't that right?

731
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:05,880
Who are you talking about, dear?

732
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,360
Do you mean Ying,
the daughter of Sineenuch,

733
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,200
your dad's ex-fiancée?

734
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,320
Goodness.

735
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,080
Mom, how did you know?

736
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,560
Do not underestimate your mom.

737
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,000
You may know things,
but your mom has her own little birds.

738
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,960
Your mom used to work
for the intelligence agency.

739
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,040
That's nonsense.

740
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,840
Sorry. It's my mistake.

741
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,240
She's more of a fighter.
Intel isn't really her thing.

742
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,320
My bad.

743
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,960
Foie gras, boeuf bourguignon, ratatouille,

744
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:43,480
onion soup,

745
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,720
and red wine.

746
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,960
Isn't that what Ying ordered?

747
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,440
Mom!

748
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,480
Do you have flies
as your informants or something?

749
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,600
How do you know so much?

750
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,360
Your mom actually
didn't have to dig that deep.

751
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,680
I know that she isn't the one

752
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,400
that Phu's interested in.

753
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,040
What?

754
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,840
So who is he interested in?

755
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,320
Did your informant tell you that?

756
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,720
I don't know about that.

757
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,720
But I do know that

758
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,960
if Phu brings a girl
to meet Great-Grandma Orn,

759
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,600
that girl is the one for him.

760
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,240
Look at him.

761
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:35,920
His ears are red.

762
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,280
Look at his ears.

763
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:40,680
Gosh.

764
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,080
You can't keep secrets from us.

765
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,200
Let's go, Sun. I'm ready.

766
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
Phu.

767
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,720
Why are you dressed like a pirate?

768
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,760
You guys won't let me go with you.

769
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,920
You and the prince won't let me.

770
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,320
Even Wachira said no.

771
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,600
I don't know what will happen.

772
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,080
It could be dangerous.

773
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,640
It's better to be safe than sorry.

774
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,440
Hang on.

775
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,360
Are you going to a nightclub

776
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,840
or going to war?

777
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,280
-Well?
-Wait.

778
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:46,120
Does the prince think he can lure
the rebels out that easily?

779
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,320
The prince is probably acting on a tip-off

780
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,760
that he has received.

781
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,560
Very well.

782
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,880
Take good care of yourself, son.

783
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:58,280
-Okay.
-Don't let a girl get you drunk.

784
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,040
You never know.

785
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,440
Some girls can be deadlier
than a knife or a gun.

786
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,320
Right.

787
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,160
Is anyone home?

788
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,520
Goodness, Phu.

789
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,840
You look so handsome.

790
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:15,560
Gosh.

791
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,640
Hello, Uncle Chai Lek. Hello, Aunt Sroi.

792
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,160
Hi, Kan.

793
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,840
I'd like to take Phu
to a concert with me tonight.

794
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,760
We're going to Honey's Something
Special in the Right Eye concert.

795
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,000
Listen, Ying.

796
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,360
I'm really sorry.

797
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,400
I already have plans with my friends.

798
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,680
We're going to a club.

799
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,200
I have to go meet them now.

800
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,120
What?

801
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,400
Well…

802
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,040
You're feisty.

803
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:04,040
You bet, Phu.

804
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,920
So where are your friends?

805
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,560
-Shall we…
-Phu.

806
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,600
Let's go. Follow me.

807
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:22,840
Have a seat.

808
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,560
Right, Ying.

809
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,480
This is my friend. His name is…

810
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:38,720
I'm Jhao.

811
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,520
-It's Jhao.
-This is my friend, Wachira.

812
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,320
I'm Woranuch. You can call me Ying.

813
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,520
Did you go to school with Phu in England?

814
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,840
I met Phu in Viengphukhum.

815
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,680
We're from there.

816
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,040
So you're not from England.

817
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,400
Would you like punch or cocktail?

818
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:05,200
Get me a bottle of red wine.

819
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,840
Where are Khumpheng and Phathana?

820
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,200
They're outside.

821
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,080
They will radio us if something's off.

822
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,760
Are you sure about this?

823
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,440
I'm sure.

824
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:29,560
Sun.

825
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,360
Do you see the prince and Mr. Phu?

826
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:35,440
Not yet. Let's keep looking for them.

827
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,720
I think

828
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,840
things just got interesting.

829
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:48,960
What do you mean?

830
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,440
Laorchan!

831
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,120
What?

832
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,240
Here's your red wine.

833
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:10,960
Put it on the table.

834
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,400
Don't just stand there.

835
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,960
Pour it for me.

836
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,880
Mr. Phu, I didn't expect to see you here.

837
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:29,960
You're having a night out?

838
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,880
What about you two?

839
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,640
We're out to celebrate
Laor getting a job at JT Center.

840
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,560
I've been meaning to take her out,
but she has been busy.

841
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,920
She's only free tonight.

842
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:42,320
No wonder you were in a rush to go home.

843
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,120
You wanted to get ready for the party.

844
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,680
You should join us.

845
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,280
Come on, Laorchan.

846
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,800
And you are…

847
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,320
I'm Suriya.

848
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,880
You can call me Sun.

849
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,080
And you are?

850
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,400
I'm Jhao.

851
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,680
It's nice to meet you,

852
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,560
Sun.

853
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,520
Likewise.

854
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,280
Let's go.

855
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,200
After you.

856
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,040
You're here too?

857
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,200
I came with my friend.

858
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:28,280
-Where's your table?
-Right here.

859
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,960
I invited her to join us.

860
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,520
Please have a seat.

861
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,480
Please.

862
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,840
Wait, Phu.

863
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,520
You should sit here.

864
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,280
Come on.

865
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:44,440
Sit over here.

866
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,960
This is Suriya, Laorchan's friend.

867
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,440
Sun, this is Ms. Woranuch Dhevaprom.

868
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,920
It's nice to meet you.

869
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,440
Suriya?

870
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,080
Who names their kid Suriya these days?

871
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,160
What about it?

872
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:10,040
In Viengphukhum, Suriya means the sun.

873
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,160
I think it's cool.

874
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:16,240
What does Woranuch mean?

875
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,000
It means beautiful lady.

876
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,800
It's a fitting name

877
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,560
for a pretty lady like me.

878
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,680
Are you from Viengphukhum, Jhao?

879
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,360
It's nice to meet someone from home.

880
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,520
That's right.

881
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:33,520
This calls for a celebration.

882
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,800
Come on.

883
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,480
To the friendship between our countries.

884
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,640
I guess you don't get out much.

885
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,440
How rude.

886
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:02,120
Or can't you handle your drink?

887
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:18,680
Top me up.

888
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:25,440
Slow down.

889
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:30,920
Fill my glass too.

890
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:42,240
Wachira, can I have some more?

891
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,200
All right.

892
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,280
The music is so upbeat.
How about we go for a dance?

893
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:55,000
Laorchan.

894
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,160
Come and dance with me.

895
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,520
Let's go.

896
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,840
You little…

897
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:15,280
Let's go burn up the dance floor, Phu.

898
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,720
Meow.

899
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,080
Let's go.

900
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:29,840
-Gosh.
-Are you okay?

901
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:31,040
I'm exhausted.

902
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,160
Those two had three glasses of wine.

903
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,000
Look. They're still dancing.

904
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:43,440
Hey!

905
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,560
What's going on?

906
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,640
My gosh!

907
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:48,920
What's happening?

908
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,400
Who are you? What do you want from me?

909
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:00,800
Let me go.

910
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,320
Shut up.

911
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,240
Sun!

912
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,520
Are you okay?

913
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,720
Let's go.

914
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,840
Come on.

915
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,280
Hop on, Laor.

916
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,440
What?

917
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:18,440
Hurry or they will catch us.

918
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:19,840
Hop on.

919
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:24,880
Hey!

920
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,840
Huh?

921
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:12,960
What?

922
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:14,760
How…

923
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,400
How did I get here?

924
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,320
Gosh, no.

925
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,800
What?

926
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,720
What?

927
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:43,080
I see you're awake.

928
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,960
Are you still dizzy?
You can sleep a bit longer.

929
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:48,560
Did you bring me here?

930
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,960
What happened to my clothes?

931
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,360
Who took my clothes off?

932
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,920
Do you think I changed your clothes?

933
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,880
I'd never take advantage
of an unconscious woman.

934
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:01,800
Then how did I get here?

935
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,160
You had a lot of wine last night

936
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,960
and some men tried to hurt you.

937
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,720
You know, you should have
thrown up on those guys

938
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,280
instead of throwing up
on the guy who helped you.

939
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,480
-Hold onto me.
-What?

940
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,520
No.

941
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:22,200
I said hold onto me. Come on, Laor.

942
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,120
Did I really throw up on you?

943
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,320
Mr. Phu, I…

944
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,920
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to.

945
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,360
You passed out after you threw up.

946
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,240
So I brought you to this hotel
and had the maid

947
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,440
wash and change you.

948
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:09,600
I didn't dare take you home

949
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:12,160
because I was scared
you'd fall off the motorbike.

950
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,160
Why did you drink so much

951
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,280
if you know you can't handle it?

952
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,800
I don't like to be looked down on.

953
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:20,720
Did you drink to save face?

954
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:22,280
Next time,

955
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,600
choose another way to protect your pride.

956
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,920
If something bad happens,

957
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:28,480
it's not worth it.

958
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,840
If I hadn't been there
to save you from those guys,

959
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,560
who knows what would've happened.

960
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,040
I'm sorry.

961
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,320
I won't put you in that situation again.

962
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:40,280
It was no trouble.

963
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:42,320
I was just worried.

964
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:54,760
Well…

965
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,120
Do you want to shower and get changed?

966
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,720
I had the maid choose an outfit for you.

967
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:02,360
It's in the bathroom.

968
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,880
I estimated your size
when I carried you in.

969
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,040
It should fit you.

970
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,840
Gosh.

971
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,720
Where am I?

972
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:54,560
I don't live here.

973
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:56,800
Gosh.

974
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,520
No! Wake up right now!

975
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,960
-Wake up!
-What?

976
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,560
How could you do this?

977
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:15,800
When I get out of here,

978
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:17,480
I'll have you thrown in jail!

979
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,360
What are you talking about? Stop it!

980
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:22,120
My gosh.

981
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,240
I was taking a nap.

982
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,960
It was you. You kidnapped me, right?

983
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:27,920
You pervert!

984
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,240
Gosh!

985
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,640
You jerk!

986
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,640
Stop! Who said I kidnapped you?

987
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,200
Pull yourself together and look around.

988
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,160
We're still at the nightclub.

989
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,680
Then why am I in a car with you?

990
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,520
Or did you…

991
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,080
You drugged me!

992
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,640
You…

993
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,480
You took advantage of me, didn't you?

994
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,320
Sun, you pervert!

995
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,240
You took advantage of me.

996
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,920
I was leaving to find Laor
with Phu and Jhao.

997
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,360
Then you grabbed me
and wouldn't let me leave.

998
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,720
-Then you…
-Where are you going?

999
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:09,040
-Come here.
-Miss, wait.

1000
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,080
Gosh. What are you doing?

1001
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,400
Keep your hands off.

1002
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,800
Where are you going? Get back here.

1003
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:23,720
Where do you think you're going?

1004
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,480
What? Hey.

1005
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,680
Was I supposed to leave you like that?

1006
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,040
So I brought you to my car.

1007
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,320
Why didn't you take me home?

1008
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,080
Gosh.

1009
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,760
Should I have woken you

1010
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,480
and asked you where you live?

1011
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,200
Don't think that I took advantage of you.

1012
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:47,800
I already have someone I love

1013
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,560
and I would never cheat on her.

1014
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:51,720
And more importantly,

1015
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,520
you're not my type.

1016
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:58,480
You're not my type either, you jerk!

1017
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,040
Okay.

1018
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:02,520
Good. So we're clear on that.

1019
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,640
Just drive.

1020
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:08,280
I can't just drive.

1021
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:10,040
Where should I drive you?

1022
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:12,600
Just start driving.

1023
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:14,720
You're unbelievable.

1024
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,640
I can't pull it out. Can you help?

1025
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:21,920
Pull it gently.

1026
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:26,120
You could've just said so.

1027
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:29,720
Just drive.

1028
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,080
It fits like a glove. I'm good at this.

1029
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,640
You must do this often.

1030
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:11,880
Not really.

1031
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:13,880
Just occasionally.

1032
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,240
But I don't want to do this

1033
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,320
for anyone else anymore.

1034
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:22,480
I only want to do this for one person.

1035
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,840
Would you like to know

1036
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,320
who that person is?

1037
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,640
Well…

1038
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,360
Goodness.

1039
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:35,360
It's late. I should get to work.

1040
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,040
I made shrimp porridge for you.

1041
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:39,840
Eat with me first.

1042
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,600
Thank you so much.

1043
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:50,320
It's just that I don't know
how far this hotel is

1044
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,560
from JT Center.

1045
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,080
I don't want to be late for work.

1046
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,040
It's not far.

1047
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:00,280
You have a car,
so it's easy for you to get around.

1048
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,760
It's different if you have to take a bus.

1049
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,240
It's not so convenient.

1050
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,080
Traffic is bad in the morning.

1051
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,760
I sometimes have to let a few buses pass

1052
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,240
before I can finally get on one.

1053
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,000
You don't need to take a bus.

1054
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:13,720
It's only a five-minute walk

1055
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:15,160
from here.

1056
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:22,240
Don't tell me…

1057
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:25,560
you brought me to JT Oriental.

1058
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:29,600
That's right.

1059
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:31,840
We're at JT Oriental.

1060
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:33,080
My second home.

1061
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:35,280
What?

1062
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:38,360
Have breakfast with me.

1063
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,840
We can leave for work together.

1064
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,400
Goodness.

1065
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:02,480
Is it good?

1066
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:05,680
Or did all that throwing up
make you hungry?

1067
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:10,080
It's very good.

1068
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:13,160
I didn't know that you could cook

1069
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,160
such delicious food.

1070
01:06:17,160 --> 01:06:18,480
It's my mom's recipe.

1071
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,560
My mom used to be quite wayward,

1072
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:24,000
but once she got married and had kids,

1073
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,320
she decided to become a full-time mom.

1074
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:29,200
So she learned how to cook for her kids

1075
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,160
and she also taught us her recipes.

1076
01:06:33,240 --> 01:06:35,800
I got to try my mom's cooking
only a few times.

1077
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,320
But I still remember that

1078
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,280
it was very good.

1079
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,480
I bet that

1080
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,640
my cooking is just as good

1081
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,360
as your mother's.

1082
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:54,160
I'd love to cook for you every day.

1083
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,280
What should I do?

1084
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:01,760
Mr. Phu.

1085
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,840
I have a favor to ask you.

1086
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,640
Do you want me to cook
all your meals for you?

1087
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:10,320
It's not that.

1088
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,800
What I mean is,

1089
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,120
if people see the two of us

1090
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:19,320
leave the hotel
and go to the office together,

1091
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:22,160
I'm afraid it will look inappropriate.

1092
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,360
Why?

1093
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,320
Are you afraid people will say
that we slept together?

1094
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,920
Do you care about words that aren't true?

1095
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:35,440
Even if they're not true,

1096
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:38,480
it's hard for people to understand
or see this in a positive light.

1097
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,960
We should try to avoid a scandal

1098
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,040
if it can be avoided.

1099
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,960
Instead of avoiding it,

1100
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:49,400
why don't we make it true?

1101
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:50,840
It's way easier.

1102
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,560
Mr. Phu.

1103
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:54,880
Please don't joke about this.

1104
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,800
Please? Do it for me.

1105
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:01,920
Okay.

1106
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,480
You can leave first.

1107
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:05,120
I'll leave 15 minutes after you.

1108
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:06,160
Okay?

1109
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,120
Okay.

1110
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,160
Thank you.

1111
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,320
You're welcome.

1112
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:16,760
Attack on my signal.

1113
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,279
Spare no one.

1114
01:09:18,359 --> 01:09:19,359
That's impossible.

1115
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:21,160
What makes you think that?

1116
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:24,200
This book presents
a different perspective of Prince Siwilai

1117
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:26,720
from the time
after he received the sapphire

1118
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:28,160
We need to move forward.

1119
01:09:28,240 --> 01:09:30,200
I will have that necklace

1120
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:32,399
before the opening of the exhibition.

1121
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:34,920
What's the meaning of this?

1122
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,720
You have to give me a chance.

1123
01:09:38,800 --> 01:09:40,120
You can't introduce me to her

1124
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:43,040
for the first time,
and then tell me you are engaged.

1125
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,960
Will you be my girlfriend, Laor?

1126
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:48,000
Gosh!

1127
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,040
Hey! Back off!

1128
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:54,920
Laor!

1129
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:36,200
