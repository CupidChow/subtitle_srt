1
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,240
Laor has taken on
one of the most dangerous tasks.

2
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,240
If you have a problem with that,

3
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,800
you can tell me.

4
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,600
I want you to follow the plan
that you have made with Sun.

5
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,960
I believe that Sun will lead us

6
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,280
to the true leader of
the Thapana Association.

7
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,880
How can it be genuine

8
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,560
when it doesn't bear the royal stamp?

9
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,200
Boss.

10
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,360
We have intruders.

11
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,400
Who are you working for? Damn it!

12
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,440
Hey.

13
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,720
Stop right there!

14
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,160
Drop your weapon.

15
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,400
No!

16
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,720
I want to negotiate.

17
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,080
Take me to your boss.

18
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,240
My boss wants you all dead.

19
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,880
There will be no negotiation.

20
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,680
Veena, trust me on this.

21
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,200
Veena.

22
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,120
Veena.

23
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,720
Are you okay?

24
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

25
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,520
Hey!

26
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,720
Uncle.

27
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,600
Are you all right?

28
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,800
Your dad told me everything.

29
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,640
I came straight here.

30
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,080
Damn it.

31
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,040
These cocky rebels are pushing their luck.

32
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,880
They even tried to assassinate
the crown prince.

33
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,040
We must snuff out these rebels

34
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,960
before their spark catches fire.

35
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,720
I'm going to find the person
who's behind all of this.

36
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,880
Are you okay?

37
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,680
Yes.

38
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,600
We found another way out.

39
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,560
Let's go.

40
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,320
Where is Laorchan?

41
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,800
Tell me where Laorchan is!

42
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,720
Stop resisting. You'll die soon anyway.

43
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,920
You're a pretty girl.

44
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,520
Too bad you have to die here.

45
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,160
What's going on, Laor?

46
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,280
Why was the sapphire a fake?
Who did you call?

47
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,040
I wanted to prove to them

48
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,240
that you're not a rebel.

49
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,240
Them? Who is them?

50
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,520
Gosh!

51
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,280
Run, Laor! Run!

52
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,840
Run!

53
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,320
Hey.

54
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,920
What?

55
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,960
Hey, Wut.

56
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,240
Are you okay?

57
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,240
Go after them. They went that way.

58
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,600
-Okay.
-Hurry.

59
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,760
Go after them.

60
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,800
Are you hurt, Laor?

61
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,200
I'm okay.

62
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,480
You have to get out.

63
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,120
I'll lead them away from you.

64
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,800
No.

65
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,480
You must come with me, Sun.

66
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,200
We could both get killed
if we stick together.

67
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,360
I can focus better if I know you're safe.

68
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,080
Here.

69
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,120
Take this.

70
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,560
Keep this safe for me.

71
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,800
I'll come back for it.

72
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,120
What?

73
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,440
No.

74
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,840
No, Sun.

75
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,000
No.

76
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,640
This way. Come on.

77
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,560
Come out!

78
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,800
Don't worry.

79
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,800
I got this.

80
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:03,320
Promise me that you will be back soon.

81
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,280
Over here!

82
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,679
Laor.

83
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,640
Hey!

84
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,240
How are you doing, Soodsadakon?

85
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,040
Drop your gun.

86
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,560
I said drop it!

87
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,120
Drop the gun.

88
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,160
Arrest them.

89
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,560
-Take them away.
-Yes, sir.

90
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,520
Let's go.

91
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,440
Move it.

92
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,560
Get her!

93
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,520
Hey!

94
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,120
Shit.

95
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,240
Get her!

96
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:30,800
Come here.

97
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,880
-Get up.
-Let me go.

98
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,680
-Come here.
-Let me go.

99
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,720
Move it.

100
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,040
Stop resisting.

101
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,400
No!

102
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,840
Laor.

103
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,240
Laor.

104
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,880
I'm here to rescue you, Laor.

105
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,040
Laor, you're safe now.

106
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,080
Mr. Phu.

107
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,280
Mr. Phu, what are you doing here?

108
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,120
I'll get you out of here.

109
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,440
All the doors at the back are locked.

110
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,760
We can't get out.

111
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,480
We'll leave the way we came in.

112
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,560
Let's go.

113
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,480
Come on.

114
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,080
I think Sun is still inside.

115
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
I'm going back for him.

116
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,520
Wait. It's dangerous.

117
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,400
No. I have to go back for him. Let me go.

118
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,400
All right. I'll go with you.

119
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,440
Gosh!

120
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,640
Run!

121
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,320
Mr. Phu.

122
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,600
This place is going to blow up.
Hurry and get out of here.

123
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:42,520
Hurry. Come on.

124
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,000
Get out of here! Hurry!

125
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,600
Keep walking.

126
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,920
Move it.

127
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,080
Get in.

128
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,640
Get in there.

129
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,000
Uncle.

130
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,680
Are you all right?

131
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,640
I'm okay.

132
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,600
This place must be their armory.

133
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,400
I'll handle this.

134
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,640
Veena.

135
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,000
Colonel, do you copy?

136
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Colonel, do you copy?

137
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,800
Colonel, do you copy?

138
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,200
It's not safe, Your Highness.

139
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,760
No. I'm going to help my friend.

140
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,280
There he is!

141
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,040
Everyone, get down!

142
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,440
Phu.

143
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,160
Sun.

144
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,600
Sun!

145
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,880
Sun! Let me go!

146
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,840
Let me go to him!

147
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,280
It's dangerous, Laor.

148
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,120
Let me go! Sun!

149
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,120
-Sun!
-Come on.

150
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,240
Let me go! Sun!

151
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,360
Sun!

152
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,960
Let me go, Mr. Phu.

153
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,080
I'm going to help Sun.

154
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,720
It's dangerous in there.

155
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,880
No.

156
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,160
Sun! No!

157
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,440
Sun!

158
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,360
No.

159
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
Sun!

160
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,640
Sun!

161
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,320
No!

162
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,440
Sun.

163
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,840
Take Soodsadakon, Wisai, and Lamnao

164
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,960
to the royal guard's interrogation room.

165
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,280
Lock the rest up in the dungeon.

166
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,440
Yes, Your Highness.

167
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,760
Every one of them

168
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,360
deserves the death penalty

169
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,640
for treason.

170
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,760
We need to conduct an investigation

171
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,119
and give them
a fair trial according to law.

172
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,960
If we don't execute them

173
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,079
and exterminate these rats,

174
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,800
we'll have to keep fighting
their successors.

175
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,359
It has been like this
for many generations.

176
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,720
I'll put a new regime in place.

177
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,760
Everyone will have equal rights.

178
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,800
But everyone needs to understand

179
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,880
the responsibility that comes
with increased freedoms.

180
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,040
I think everyone will be satisfied.

181
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,480
We should let my dad know what happened.

182
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,640
Where's Laorchan?

183
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,800
She wants to be alone for a while.

184
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,400
Will you keep her company?

185
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,760
Yes, sir.

186
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,920
Why are you making that face, Laor?

187
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,960
You have done enough for me.

188
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,960
When it comes to you,
nothing could ever be enough.

189
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,040
I'm willing to help you

190
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:48,920
for the rest of my life.

191
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,520
Keep this safe for me.

192
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,960
I'll come back for it.

193
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,120
You promised you'd come back for it, Sun.

194
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,760
Why didn't you keep your promise?

195
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,960
Sun died because of me.

196
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,480
I should never have got him involved.

197
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,280
I shouldn't have asked him to come.

198
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,560
Then he would still be alive.

199
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,840
This is all my fault.

200
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,280
Sun loved you.

201
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,280
If he's really gone,

202
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,800
I believe he would be glad

203
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,080
he got to protect you
until his last breath.

204
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,080
He didn't even know
that the person he was protecting

205
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,480
had lied to him.

206
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,520
At least he got to save
the woman he loved.

207
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,320
He didn't deserve to die like this.

208
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,640
It was too cruel.

209
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,840
This is just too cruel.

210
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,840
Laor.

211
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,960
Maybe things aren't as bad as you think.

212
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,160
Maybe Sun managed to escape.

213
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,840
No.

214
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,680
He led them away from me

215
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:46,200
so I could escape.

216
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,240
He led them further inside.

217
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,360
How could he have made it out?

218
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,880
I left first and I barely
made it out of there.

219
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,600
This is all my fault.

220
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,960
The prince wants you

221
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,640
to meet King Rangsimun and Queen Chanta

222
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,800
at the inner court.

223
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,320
It's all my fault.

224
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,400
Are you all okay?

225
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

226
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,160
You put yourself in a situation
that was bigger than yourself.

227
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,560
I thank you.

228
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,360
Get up and have a seat.

229
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,480
Thank you so much

230
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:15,440
for risking your life for Viengphukhum.

231
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,680
It was my duty.

232
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,840
I have always believed

233
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,320
that your family

234
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,120
meant this country no harm.

235
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,960
And today,

236
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,520
you've proven to me that

237
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,880
I was right.

238
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,280
Thank you, Your Majesty.

239
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,160
Very well.

240
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,160
So,

241
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,960
are you well, Phu?

242
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,760
It has been a year since we last met.

243
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,840
I'm fine, Your Majesty.

244
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,040
I see.

245
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,720
Thank you so much

246
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,240
for putting your life at risk
to help Satarasamee.

247
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,240
It's my pleasure.

248
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,960
Viengphukhum is like my second home.

249
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,160
Well…

250
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
Gosh.

251
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,160
I still can't believe it.

252
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,480
I…

253
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,400
I can't believe that

254
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,200
the leader of the Manolom Party

255
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,240
and the deputy commissioner of police

256
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,440
are members of the Thapana Association.

257
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,760
I can't believe it either.

258
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,960
I always thought

259
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,560
they seemed composed and calm.

260
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,600
They never showed any sign
of antagonism towards us.

261
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,400
Right.

262
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,960
Those who are traitors

263
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,560
might pretend to be loyal and humble

264
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,920
while waiting for a chance to attack.

265
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,560
After we've interrogated them,

266
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,600
how do you plan to proceed?

267
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,160
I'll lead a team to scout the area
in Kammuan tomorrow.

268
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,000
We need to find more evidence.

269
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,240
I've ordered the royal guards

270
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,080
to keep watch over the crime scene.

271
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,680
Is this problem really behind us?

272
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,840
I don't think so, Your Majesty.

273
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,960
We might've captured three leaders

274
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,440
of Thapana Association,

275
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,800
but it doesn't mean that

276
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,200
there aren't more
of those wretched rebels out there.

277
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,720
I still believe that

278
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,920
there's someone else
whom these rebels take orders from.

279
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,520
Someone who's behind all of this

280
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,360
and who is pulling all the strings.

281
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,440
I think so too.

282
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,680
And I must find out who that person is.

283
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,880
Please.

284
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,480
If you three want to live,

285
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,000
start talking right now!

286
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,840
No!

287
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,680
Please.

288
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,080
Who's your boss?

289
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,200
I received an order
to pick up Princess Laorchan

290
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,640
as she crossed the river here

291
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,560
with the sapphire third eye.

292
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,760
So you take orders from someone.

293
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,280
Who were you supposed to take

294
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,200
the sapphire to?

295
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,000
I don't know.

296
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,960
That's all I was told to do.

297
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,920
If you prefer to do this the hard way,

298
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,320
I can do this all day

299
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,120
until you start talking.

300
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,200
No!

301
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,040
That's enough.

302
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,280
Your Highness.

303
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,240
Even if you beat me to death,

304
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,080
I can't tell you
who the association's leader is.

305
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,960
If you're willing to die for them,

306
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,600
they must be important.

307
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Am I right?

308
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,520
I'm not protecting
the association's leader.

309
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,400
I'm doing this to protect my family!

310
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,920
Thapana Association

311
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,600
was founded by people who weren't in favor

312
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,680
of the Phukhumwong dynasty.

313
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,280
After General Segong was captured,

314
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,480
the association's principles changed.

315
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,280
The members just looked out
for their own interests.

316
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,360
There was conflict within the group.

317
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,880
Everyone wanted
the sapphire for themselves.

318
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,200
That's the reason why

319
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,080
the association's leader

320
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,960
can't reveal his identity.

321
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,560
Are you telling me

322
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,160
everyone is willing
to take orders from this leader

323
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,360
without knowing who it is?

324
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,440
Soodsadakon is telling you the truth.

325
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,840
Each mission is carried out in stages.

326
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,880
When we complete our task,
another group will take over

327
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,600
to prevent betrayal.

328
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,520
You said you're protecting your family.

329
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,400
What do you mean by that?

330
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,640
The association plays dirty.

331
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,160
They hold our families captive

332
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,120
so that we work for them.

333
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,280
If we succeed,

334
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,040
they release our families and reward us.

335
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,960
But if we fail,

336
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,360
they send us body parts
of our family members

337
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,440
or they kill them.

338
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,960
This is how they do it.

339
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,360
This is how they have eyes
and ears everywhere.

340
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,640
They know our every move.

341
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,040
If what you said is true,

342
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,120
I want us to work together.

343
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,080
I want to negotiate with the rebels

344
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,520
to put an end to all these atrocities.

345
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,400
I can't condone

346
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,640
the use of violence against the rebels.

347
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,080
I tried to stop him.

348
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,680
I don't approve of his methods either.

349
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,160
I don't want to add fuel to the fire

350
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,160
and incite any more anger or hatred.

351
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,560
I want to try negotiating with them first.

352
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,320
Very well.

353
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,560
What did Prince Anucha say?

354
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,120
At first he disagreed,

355
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,760
but now he's okay with it.

356
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,920
There will be another interrogation.

357
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,200
A judge will be present

358
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,040
to prevent violence.

359
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,680
All right.

360
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,400
You've made the right decision

361
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,560
not to resort to violence.

362
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,280
You can't use violence

363
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,760
to persuade those who hate us to love us.

364
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,840
Well…

365
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,600
What are your thoughts about your uncle?

366
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,680
I have to presume
everyone close to us is a suspect.

367
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,560
That includes him.

368
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,640
But he has proved

369
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,800
that he is on our side.

370
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,680
He saved me from getting shot today.

371
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,080
If he really meant me harm,

372
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,680
he could've just turned a blind eye

373
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,880
and walked away.

374
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,920
He could've shot me himself

375
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,200
and I'd be dead.

376
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,040
It's good to be careful

377
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,160
and not trust anyone too easily,

378
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,680
especially those who are close to you.

379
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,200
But if you're too cautious,

380
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,840
it could make those who love and trust you

381
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,120
to become discouraged

382
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,840
and to lose faith in you.

383
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,600
Therefore,

384
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:49,560
you must learn to manage
the trust that you have for others.

385
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,400
Don't trust anyone too much

386
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,360
or too little.

387
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,600
Find out

388
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,200
who are your true friends

389
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,600
and who are your enemies.

390
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,400
You should stay here.

391
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,920
Keep Laor company.

392
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,640
Yes, Your Highness.

393
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,320
Wait, Your Highness.

394
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,440
Laor.

395
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,800
Are you heading to the crime scene

396
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,440
in Khammouane?

397
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,600
Yes.

398
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,040
Can I come with you?

399
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,000
It could make things worse.

400
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,400
Will you be able to take it
if you see Sun in that state?

401
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,600
No matter what state he's in,

402
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,800
he's still my friend.

403
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,600
He's my closest friend.

404
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,520
But I think it's too dangerous.

405
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,240
I need to see for myself

406
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,880
that Sun's really gone.

407
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,600
Please let me say goodbye
to him one last time.

408
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,120
Let's go.

409
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:41,960
Gosh.

410
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,440
Laor.

411
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,360
Get up slowly.

412
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,440
Sun isn't here.

413
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,880
The bodies

414
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,560
are barely recognizable.

415
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,920
Why do you think Sun is dead?

416
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,320
Try to stay positive.

417
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,280
Sun might be alive.

418
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,080
If he were still alive,

419
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,840
he would've contacted me.

420
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,840
He would do whatever it takes

421
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,760
to get in touch with me.

422
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,160
He might be hurt.

423
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:34,800
Maybe he ran away.

424
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,800
Or maybe he isn't ready
to reach out to you.

425
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,840
I remember where we got separated.

426
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,800
Can I go and look for him?

427
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,000
What's wrong, Laor?

428
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,400
Wait, Laor.

429
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,640
Give me a second.

430
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,440
-This is his shoe.
-What?

431
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,600
It's his shoe.

432
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,240
Sun.

433
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,400
Sun.

434
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,320
Lieutenant.

435
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,120
We found another body.

436
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,280
What?

437
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,280
Sun.

438
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,120
-Sun.
-Laor.

439
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,480
This necklace.

440
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,520
It's his.

441
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,800
It's Sun's necklace.

442
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,320
Sun.

443
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,080
-Sun!
-Come on, Laor.

444
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,200
Get Laorchan out of here.

445
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,520
All right.

446
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,720
-Laor.
-Come on, Laor.

447
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,960
-Sun.
-Let's go.

448
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,720
Sun, I'm so sorry.

449
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,520
-I'm sorry, Sun.
-Let's go, Laor.

450
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:35,880
I didn't mean for this to happen.

451
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,880
-I'm sorry, Sun.
-Laor.

452
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,840
No.

453
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,560
Take care of the body.

454
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,280
Sun.

455
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,960
I'm sorry.

456
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,800
I'm so sorry.

457
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,960
Sun's in a better place now.

458
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,160
You have to be strong, Laor.

459
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,400
Sun wouldn't want you

460
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,720
to be sad like this.

461
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,600
It's my fault.

462
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,280
Is it really him?

463
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
Laor knew him better than anyone.

464
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,280
I'm so sorry, Sun.

465
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,240
This is all my fault.

466
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,720
Laor.

467
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,520
This is all my fault.

468
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,040
May your soul rest in peace, Sun.

469
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,320
If there is a next life,

470
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,000
I hope we get to be friends again.

471
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,360
Please wait for me here.

472
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,920
Once I've taken care of my family matters,

473
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,800
I'll come and take you home.

474
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,800
Thank you.

475
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,720
Hello, Uncle Chai Yai.

476
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,400
I didn't think you'd get here so soon.

477
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,520
After King Rangsimun phoned me yesterday,

478
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,160
I took the first flight here.

479
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,920
I see.

480
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,440
I'm really sorry about your friend.

481
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,840
Thank you, Mr. Chai Yai.

482
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,320
Thank you so much

483
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,200
for agreeing to advise us on this matter.

484
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,280
It's my pleasure.

485
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,480
Shall we begin?

486
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,360
The archive is in another building.

487
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,400
Someone will be here to assist us.

488
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,600
Ms. Salika is here.

489
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,560
Hello.

490
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,240
How are you all doing?

491
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,440
Salika is the director
of the National Museum

492
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,960
and an expert
in Viengphukhum's ancient language.

493
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,920
She will assist us today.

494
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:19,640
I see.

495
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,640
It's nice to meet you all.

496
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,800
I'll do my best to help you.

497
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,200
But please be informed that

498
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,360
the building is only
a temporary depository.

499
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,120
The museum is currently being renovated.

500
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,320
Things are a bit disorganized.

501
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:36,840
We're in the process
of cataloging the artifacts.

502
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,640
So it might be a bit difficult
to find things in there.

503
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,320
Would you mind telling me
what you're looking for?

504
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,760
We're looking
for Prince Siwilai's journal.

505
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,760
It has a blue velvet cover

506
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,800
with his monogram in the middle.

507
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,800
Have you come across it?

508
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,160
As far as I can remember,

509
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,520
I haven't seen

510
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,640
a journal bearing Prince Siwilai's name.

511
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,760
But that doesn't mean it's not there.

512
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,200
We still haven't gone through
half of the artifacts.

513
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,480
I see.

514
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,240
They haven't done a thorough check.

515
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,880
There's a chance
they might have missed it.

516
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,640
Right.

517
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,760
All of us will look for it together.

518
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,480
Please follow me, everyone.

519
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,320
This way, Your Highness.

520
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,040
After you.

521
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,400
There are many artifacts here.

522
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,000
Let's split up and search the place.

523
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,280
What we're looking for

524
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,920
is Prince Siwilai's journal

525
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,600
or any other documents
that might be relevant.

526
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,080
If you find something, bring it to me.

527
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,360
Please help us, Salika.

528
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,000
-All right.
-Let's split up.

529
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,120
Let's go.

530
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,280
Journals are kept in the back.

531
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,520
I'll go and check over there.

532
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,240
Did you find anything?

533
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,240
No.

534
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:14,960
Here you go.

535
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,880
Let me see.

536
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,240
I don't think this is it.

537
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,760
I'll have another look.

538
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,920
Salika, have the kitchen prepare
snacks and coffee for us outside.

539
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:32,520
Yes, Your Highness.

540
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,320
Hey, everyone.

541
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:38,960
Let's take a snack break.

542
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,120
We've looked everywhere
but haven't found it.

543
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,000
Is it possible that

544
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,120
the journal was lost in the fire?

545
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,560
That's not possible.

546
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,920
My dad insisted that

547
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,560
when the fire broke out,

548
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:56,400
the journal was the first thing
my great-grandpa grabbed.

549
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,520
My dad was just a kid then,

550
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,400
but he told me that

551
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,640
my great-grandpa
never let anyone touch that journal.

552
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,920
It was his most prized possession.

553
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,080
Did your dad know

554
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:11,520
where the journal ended up?

555
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,960
That was the last time
my dad saw the journal.

556
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,480
My great-grandpa sent him
to study in France after that,

557
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,280
so he didn't know
where the journal was kept.

558
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,960
But I'm sure that

559
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,040
the journal is here somewhere.

560
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,040
All right.

561
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:29,760
Excuse me.

562
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,760
Poom, what are you doing here?

563
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:33,920
Hi.

564
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:36,320
Hello, Uncle.

565
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:38,320
I'm here

566
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,080
on a secret mission with my commander.

567
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,680
I've already been to see
the King and Queen.

568
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,360
All right.

569
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,640
Let's look over there.

570
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:00,480
Excuse me. The coffee's ready.

571
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,680
Please follow me.

572
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,680
All right. Let's go.

573
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,320
-Let's take a break.
-After you.

574
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,160
-Let's go.
-All right.

575
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,200
Come on.

576
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,480
This way, everyone.

577
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,640
You haven't found it?

578
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,520
There are many of us.

579
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,000
We'll find it soon.

580
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,120
Please help yourself.

581
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,360
Are there other artifact rooms here?

582
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,800
There are many.

583
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,360
Where is Laor?

584
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,080
I didn't see her when I came in
with the kitchen staff.

585
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:58,720
Maybe she went to the bathroom.

586
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,760
Right.

587
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,240
Hello.

588
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,280
Hello.

589
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:50,960
Hello.

590
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:53,520
Hello.

591
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,520
Gosh!

592
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:00,240
Poom.

593
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,360
How long will you be here?

594
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,920
Three days.

595
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,400
But I'm off duty tomorrow

596
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,640
and the day after.

597
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,800
The royals invited my commander

598
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,280
to a private party.

599
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,720
-I see.
-So I'll be free.

600
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,080
Let me know if you need
my help with anything.

601
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,120
Your Highness.

602
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:20,440
Can you help us find
Prince Siwilai's journal today?

603
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,520
I know you can do it.

604
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,760
Come on, Phu.

605
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,400
I'm not a psychic

606
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,640
who can communicate with spirits.

607
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,080
I only see what they want me to see.

608
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,960
If they don't want me to see it,

609
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,360
then I won't see anything.

610
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,520
All right.

611
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,080
Mr. Phu!

612
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,280
Your Highness! Ms. Salika!

613
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,480
Help me!

614
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,920
-Mr. Phu!
-Laor.

615
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,120
Mr. Phu!

616
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,640
Help me.

617
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,400
Laor.

618
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,840
-Laor.
-Mr. Phu, I'm in here!

619
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:03,960
Laor!

620
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,120
Please allow me.

621
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,280
Laorchan.

622
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,040
Laor.

623
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,520
Laor.

624
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,560
She's awake.

625
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:51,600
How are you, Laor?

626
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,160
What…

627
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,840
What happened?

628
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,160
Why are you all here?

629
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,080
We should ask you

630
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,000
what you were doing in that storeroom.

631
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,400
Wait.

632
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,720
That wasn't a dream?

633
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:18,400
I followed someone into that room.

634
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,320
That's impossible.

635
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:27,640
The palace is very strict
about who comes and goes here.

636
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,920
You can't enter this building

637
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,640
without the King's permission.

638
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,960
Even me,

639
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,720
I have to get his permission

640
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,400
every time I come to work here.

641
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,760
Today,

642
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,040
besides the crown prince's crew

643
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,960
and the staff who came
to set up the snack table,

644
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,880
no one else had permission
to enter this building.

645
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,320
I'm positive.

646
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,640
Was it a man or a woman

647
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,320
that led you in there?

648
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,800
It was a woman.

649
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:03,200
She was dressed like a royal.

650
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:10,840
I have no female relatives
who work here at the palace.

651
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:14,200
All the women here are palace staff.

652
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:15,720
They're all under 30 years old.

653
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,440
Who did you see?

654
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,360
More importantly,

655
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,680
how did you and that woman

656
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,680
get into that room?

657
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,480
The keys

658
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,040
to every room in this building

659
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,280
are with me.

660
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,320
When I followed that woman in there,

661
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,840
the door wasn't locked.

662
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,040
That's impossible.

663
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:44,000
No one has been in that room

664
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,600
since we put things in there for storage.

665
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,360
That door has always been locked.

666
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,840
I know because I locked it myself.

667
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,680
She's right, Laor.

668
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,880
We ran to you when we heard you scream.

669
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,440
The door was locked.

670
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,880
So that's why

671
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,840
I couldn't get the door to open.

672
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,040
This is so confusing.

673
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,440
How did you get into that room?

674
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,840
Who did you follow in there?

675
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,640
Did that woman look like you, Laor?

676
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,920
Yes.

677
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,800
But I have no relatives
that look like Laor.

678
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,080
I've worked here for many years

679
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,800
and I've never seen anyone like that.

680
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,160
What's going on,

681
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,560
Poom?

682
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:45,960
How did you know

683
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,720
that she looked like Laor

684
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,240
when you were with us the whole time?

685
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,680
I told you, Jhao.

686
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:57,040
Poom was born with a sixth sense.

687
00:53:57,120 --> 00:53:59,080
He can predict what's going to happen

688
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,320
and he's usually right.

689
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,680
I'm not that good.

690
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,640
I just tell people what I see,

691
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,360
but it depends on

692
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:10,400
how much they want me to see.

693
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,080
Have you seen that woman before?

694
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:15,920
I have.

695
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,640
I saw her in that room.

696
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,440
But she just disappeared.

697
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:22,920
I've seen her once before

698
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
when Laor came to Jutathep Palace.

699
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,840
When we shook hands,

700
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,560
I felt like I was shaking hands
with someone else.

701
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,720
It was someone

702
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,320
who looked similar to Laor.

703
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:36,280
Not just similar.

704
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,080
She's exactly like Laor.

705
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,720
I saw her once at the palace

706
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,520
when we did the photoshoot.

707
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,160
I thought I was imagining things.

708
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,320
I feel like someone's following me.

709
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,000
Sometimes I see her in my dreams.

710
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:56,600
Sometimes

711
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,480
she shows herself to me.

712
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,800
I can never catch up to her,

713
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,040
so I've never found out who she is.

714
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,600
But earlier today,

715
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,120
when we were face-to-face,

716
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:11,320
I saw that she looked a lot like me.

717
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,720
If we can find photos or portraits
from Prince Siwilai's palace,

718
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,560
maybe we can find out who she is.

719
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,480
Right.

720
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:24,160
The palace burned down in the fire.

721
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,400
Most of the portraits
of Prince Siwilai's family

722
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,720
were destroyed.

723
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,480
As far as I know,

724
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,360
there are only a couple of them left.

725
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,160
They should be here.

726
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,360
Could it be that
an ancestor of Prince Siwilai

727
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:42,600
want to tell us something?

728
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,680
Does this mean that

729
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,320
what we're looking for

730
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,520
is inside that room?

731
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:51,920
That would be my guess.

732
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,520
Pardon me, Your Highness.

733
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,960
The King is having a banquet.

734
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,520
He's invited all of you to join him.

735
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,800
Let's take a break.

736
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,840
All right.

737
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,000
Let's go.

738
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:16,320
Come on.

739
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,120
Laor.

740
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,640
Come in.

741
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,760
This is where we keep
all the remaining portraits

742
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,880
from Prince Siwilai's palace.

743
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,920
These portraits
are the property of Viengphukhum.

744
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,800
Please be careful with them.

745
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,000
Here.

746
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:47,680
This is the portrait
of King Samai and Queen Sroimalai.

747
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:56,520
Princess Chaweewan and Prince Kawin.

748
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,440
Princess Sroikhumthong
and Prince Chiangmuan.

749
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,040
-My great-grandpa.
-That's right.

750
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,720
Prince Siwilai.

751
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,040
The lady next to him

752
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,640
is probably his wife, Princess Fuangphet.

753
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,280
According to our history books,

754
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:48,880
no one ever saw Princess Fuangphet's face.

755
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:56,640
Laor.

756
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,400
How is it possible
that you look exactly like her?

757
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,560
We're lucky that this portrait

758
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,400
is in such good condition

759
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,000
and wasn't damaged in the fire.

760
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,760
Son.

761
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:28,240
Do you think this portrait

762
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,080
contains the answer
that we're looking for?

763
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,840
I'm still not sure.

764
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,520
But from everything that's happened,

765
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:41,320
it makes me believe

766
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,720
that it isn't a coincidence

767
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,920
that Laorchan found the portrait

768
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,920
of her great-grandparents.

769
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:50,720
There must be something more to it.

770
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,680
Do we need to keep looking
for Prince Siwilai's journal?

771
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:58,680
Yes.

772
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,080
I don't think our search will be in vain.

773
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,320
Otherwise,

774
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:07,960
my great-grandma
wouldn't have led me to that room.

775
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,000
Chai Yai.

776
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:18,440
What are your thoughts on this?

777
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:24,000
Although this goes
against scientific reason,

778
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:26,920
we should see it through to the end.

779
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:29,040
All right. Very well.

780
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,480
In that case, we'll start tomorrow.

781
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:36,640
The sooner we know where the temple is,

782
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,720
the better it will be for us.

783
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,360
The leader of the Thapana Association is…

784
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,600
I don't know.

785
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,400
You idiot.

786
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,760
How can a military commander like you

787
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,320
work for a man who hides in the shadows?

788
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,720
If he told you to die for him,

789
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:25,640
you would probably do it.

790
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,000
Do you really not get it?

791
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,560
We're all going to die.

792
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,320
Stop, Prince Anucha.

793
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,720
You can't harm the rebels.

794
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,120
The King insists

795
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,920
that we strictly follow this rule.

796
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,440
Can't you see?

797
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:00,080
Can't you all see it?

798
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,640
These rebels are destroying our country.

799
01:02:04,840 --> 01:02:06,520
If we don't use force,

800
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:09,520
do you think
they will tell us what they know?

801
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:18,800
If you think your way will work better,

802
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:21,560
you can interrogate them yourself.

803
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,720
I hope you succeed.

804
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:37,640
There must be
three representatives present,

805
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,880
from the legislature, the executive,

806
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,000
and the judiciary,

807
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:43,120
in order to conduct an interrogation.

808
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,120
The executive's representative isn't here,

809
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,760
so we can't do anything.

810
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,240
I suppose you're right.

811
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,920
I'll talk to Prince Anucha about this.

812
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:04,760
Thank you

813
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,560
for protecting the association.

814
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,800
I'll help get you out.

815
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,520
If you don't want to receive
severe punishment,

816
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,840
you'd better cooperate with us

817
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,040
before we run out of patience.

818
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,200
Do you understand?

819
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,960
Are you by my side, Sun?

820
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,040
Please help guide me
to my great-grandpa's journal.

821
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,520
Be strong, Laor.

822
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,320
I'll be right by your side.

823
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,560
I'll help you as best as I can.

824
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,480
Thank you.

825
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,560
Good night.

826
01:04:22,120 --> 01:04:22,960
All right.

827
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,440
Good night.

828
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,040
The placement of her hand
is a bit strange.

829
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,320
What do you mean?

830
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,920
Normally, members of the royal family

831
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,640
or those of royal blood,

832
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:13,320
would either sit or stand

833
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,560
for their portraits.

834
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:17,200
They clasp their hands together

835
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:19,640
or place both hands on their legs.

836
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,120
But look at this.

837
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,080
The placement of Princess Fuangphet's hand

838
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:25,280
seems a bit strange.

839
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:27,960
I've never seen a portrait like this.

840
01:05:29,080 --> 01:05:30,080
I see.

841
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,440
I agree with Mr. Poom.

842
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:34,960
It's like she's telling us something.

843
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,680
Her finger is pointing to the lion's head.

844
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,520
Maybe something's hidden there.

845
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,200
Allow me, Your Highness.

846
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:54,560
Go ahead.

847
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:56,360
Thank you.

848
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,640
You can twist the lion's head around.

849
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,920
There must be

850
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,840
some kind of mechanism here.

851
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,760
Can I give it a try?

852
01:06:21,840 --> 01:06:22,920
Sure.

853
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,200
May I, Your Highness?

854
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:01,360
The latch is open.

855
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:15,560
I found it.

856
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:18,840
His monogram isn't on it,

857
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,800
but I'm sure this is his journal.

858
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,040
Here, Your Highness.

859
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,720
It's not a journal.

860
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,800
It looks like it's a list of names.

861
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:48,200
It's written in our ancient language.

862
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,720
Can you read it, Chai Yai?

863
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,800
"The names of the founders
of Thapana Association.

864
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,800
The association secretary,

865
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:04,440
General Luecha.

866
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,160
Senior advisor,

867
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:09,680
Prince Siwilai."

868
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:13,560
That's not true.

869
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:14,960
That's impossible.

870
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,520
He wasn't one of the rebels.

871
01:08:17,399 --> 01:08:18,920
He wasn't part of the association.

872
01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:23,120
You might be right.

873
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,120
Look.

874
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,479
He didn't sign his name here.

875
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,399
This means that

876
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,240
my great-grandpa

877
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:38,720
didn't agree to be
part of the Thapana Association.

878
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:42,160
This means he's innocent, right?

879
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:43,439
Right?

880
01:08:45,399 --> 01:08:46,520
It seems so.

881
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:50,399
But…

882
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:55,600
This isn't enough evidence
to have the council

883
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,560
revise the history of that period.

884
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,520
But if we find Prince Siwilai's journal

885
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,359
and it can lead us to the temple
and the hidden treasure,

886
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,240
we'll be able to prove to everyone

887
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,359
that he's innocent

888
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:11,160
without a shadow of a doubt.

889
01:09:13,439 --> 01:09:14,279
Therefore,

890
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,399
we need to find that journal.

891
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:18,560
Yes.

892
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,000
SP

893
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:46,800
It has a blue velvet cover

894
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:50,600
with his monogram and his crest.

895
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:51,600
SP

896
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,359
It's his personal coat of arms.

897
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:55,000
This is it.

898
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,560
This sketch looks similar
to the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

899
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:08,400
Poom. I need your help.

900
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,760
SP

901
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:11,760
What are you discussing?

902
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,200
I don't keep any secrets from you.

903
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,240
Where did the gunshot come from?

904
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,800
The forest Mr. Phu and Laor entered.

905
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:23,880
How dare you disrespect him.

906
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,640
Don't you know who he is?

907
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,440
Freeze! Drop the gun.

908
01:11:08,560 --> 01:11:13,560
