1
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,120
I damn them

2
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,040
and all their descendants

3
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,320
to eternal suffering and ruin!

4
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,760
So what happened
to the sapphire third eye and the temple?

5
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,520
They became lost, just like Pimpa Kingdom.

6
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,200
In the end,

7
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,640
the sapphire was used
to make the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

8
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,240
Laorchan.

9
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,560
Are you a Dhevaprom?

10
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,440
So who is he interested in?

11
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,600
If Phu brings a girl
to meet Great-Grandma Orn,

12
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,200
that girl is the one for him.

13
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,040
I see you're awake.

14
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,040
What happened to my clothes?

15
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,800
You had a lot of wine last night

16
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,520
and some men tried to hurt you.

17
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,720
If I hadn't been there
to save you from those guys,

18
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,480
who knows what would've happened.

19
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,160
I'm thinking of making money the easy way.

20
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,440
How exactly?

21
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,360
I'll become a rich guy's mistress.

22
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,000
I won't have to work hard.

23
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,440
I just have to please them

24
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,160
and they will buy me a house and a car,
and support me financially.

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,080
Laor.

26
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,280
Hello.

27
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,000
Hello.

28
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,800
Did you park your car in the hotel wing?

29
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,320
What are you all doing here?

30
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
Phu.

31
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,120
Where were you last night?
Mom was waiting for you.

32
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,080
Well, I felt a little dizzy last night,

33
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,320
so I stayed the night at the hotel.

34
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,640
I called Mom and told her.

35
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,680
Something happened last night, Kan.

36
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,040
Did you manage to find Laor last night?

37
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,120
-Of course.
-No.

38
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,400
I couldn't find her by the door,

39
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,960
but I found her in the parking lot,

40
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,080
so I drove her home.

41
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,520
But

42
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Laor's house isn't far

43
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,320
from ours.

44
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,320
Why did you have to stay at the hotel?

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,440
Are you hiding a girl here, Phu?

46
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,480
Come on.

47
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,000
You're joking around
despite all the work you have on.

48
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,080
Let's go back to work.

49
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,400
Wachira invited me
to have breakfast with him.

50
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,360
Meet us at Rimrabiang Restaurant.

51
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,920
Let's eat shrimp porridge together.

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,400
-Shrimp porridge?
-Shrimp porridge?

53
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,680
Thank you for the invite,

54
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,920
but I just had shrimp porridge
for breakfast.

55
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,680
I just want a cup of coffee for breakfast.

56
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,280
Bring coffee to my office.

57
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,000
Yes.

58
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,120
I should get to work then.

59
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,760
All right.

60
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,280
No way.

61
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,720
I don't believe
what you are saying about Laor.

62
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,720
Keep it down.

63
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,320
I didn't start the rumor.

64
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,280
I heard it from someone else.

65
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,880
Who told you?

66
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,640
Mr. Phu is our boss.

67
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,920
He has a good reputation.

68
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,920
And Laor just started
working here a few weeks ago.

69
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,240
How could they be an item?

70
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,280
I agree.

71
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,000
Tell me

72
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,680
which department started the rumor.

73
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,600
Do you really believe them?

74
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,240
I wouldn't be telling you about it
if I believed them.

75
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,120
I want you guys to find out

76
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,720
who started the rumor

77
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,200
so we can slap…

78
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,120
I mean, so we can talk to them.

79
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,840
Tell us the rumor again.

80
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,360
What exactly are people saying?

81
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,480
Are they gossiping about the fact
that they've been going out together?

82
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,320
It's normal for a secretary
to follow their boss around.

83
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,760
Why turn it into gossip?

84
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,280
Rumor has it

85
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,480
they went somewhere they shouldn't have.

86
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,400
Where might that be?

87
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,560
Someone saw him take Laor

88
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,160
to JT Oriental last night.

89
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,440
-What?
-What?

90
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,480
Keep it down.

91
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,640
You are too loud.

92
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,400
Did they really go there together?

93
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,720
How's the preparation at JT Hall going?

94
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,520
We are about 70% ready.

95
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,440
Yesterday, new air-conditioners
were installed.

96
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,240
All that's left is the decoration.

97
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,400
Tomorrow, I'm meeting with the organizer

98
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,160
to discuss the display location
of the Ajna Chakra Necklace,

99
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,200
as a security system
needs to be installed.

100
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,440
I see.

101
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,920
Viengphukhum has sent us

102
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,120
the footage we requested
for the documentary.

103
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,400
Our staff is going through the footage

104
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,000
to select the stock shots.

105
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,080
Today, we are going to go through
the tapes about Viengphukhum's crafts.

106
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,360
The PR department is hurrying
to finish the publicity materials

107
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,440
and asking for cooperation
in publicizing the event

108
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,200
from news channels and magazines.

109
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,400
However, we need you
to review the script first.

110
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,280
I will send you

111
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,080
the first draft of the script
within the week.

112
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,640
Laor.

113
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,760
Yes.

114
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,480
Did Nujaree not tell you to wait for me?

115
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,679
I want to drive you home.

116
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,440
She did.

117
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,440
But I have an appointment with Sun.

118
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,880
There's a private matter
I need to discuss with him.

119
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,440
Are you meeting him here
or at your apartment?

120
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,040
Here.

121
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,040
It's time. I have to go.

122
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,640
You took the bus home.

123
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,360
What happened?

124
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,200
Why didn't Sun give you a ride?

125
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:32,760
Could it be
that you didn't actually meet him?

126
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,240
To tell you the truth,

127
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,680
I hadn't arranged to meet Sun.

128
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,000
Then why didn't you let me drive you home?

129
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,480
It's not your job as my boss.

130
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,200
But I'm happy to do it.

131
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,000
Thank you for your kindness,

132
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:53,320
but I don't want
to stress over a small matter.

133
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,880
Did someone say something to you?

134
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,480
Don't listen to their words.

135
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,640
It's just gossip. It's not true.

136
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,400
But it is true.

137
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,720
We can't deny the fact
that we were in the same hotel room

138
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,600
last night.

139
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Who? Who saw us?

140
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,720
Who mentioned this to you?

141
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,880
It doesn't matter who.

142
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,160
I wouldn't care

143
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,520
if it was a completely false rumor.

144
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,760
But it is partly true.

145
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,400
I think we should nip it in the bud.

146
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,640
Nip it in the bud?

147
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:31,560
What do you mean?

148
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,160
Well.

149
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,440
You should stop driving me to places.

150
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,320
Don't make it worse.

151
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,440
Are you sure
someone didn't ask you to do this?

152
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,200
Laor.

153
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,880
Sun.

154
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,000
Hello, Mr. Phu.

155
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,200
Hello.

156
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,120
I bought your favorite crispy pancake.

157
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,560
It's from a famous store.

158
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Anyway,

159
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,760
I should go.

160
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,840
Come on, let's eat the crispy pancake.

161
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,280
Laor.

162
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,320
What happened last night?

163
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,280
I was calling you all day,
but you didn't answer.

164
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,920
Well,

165
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,360
I had back-to-back meetings all day.

166
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,520
I barely sat down at my desk.

167
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,080
Where were you?

168
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,520
I'm glad someone told me you were safe

169
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,480
and that Mr. Phu had taken you home
or I'd have searched for you all night.

170
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,200
When the lights went out last night,

171
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,360
two men dragged me to a car,

172
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,200
but I managed to escape.

173
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,560
After that, I ran into another group of
men and that was when Mr. Phu showed up.

174
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,160
Could they be the rebels
from Viengphukhum?

175
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,760
How many rebel groups are there?

176
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,160
From what I saw last night,
there were two groups.

177
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,080
But they didn't want to harm me.

178
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,160
They just wanted to kidnap me.

179
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,440
I should have let them kidnap me.

180
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,080
I could have found out who they are.

181
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,120
No.

182
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,320
You can't risk your life like that.

183
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,720
Did you forget your main objective?

184
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,120
You wouldn't be able
to complete your objective

185
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,240
if something happened to you first.

186
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,160
I'll find out

187
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,840
who they are for you.

188
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,960
I'm also curious

189
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
about who they are.

190
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,080
Who they are is not important.

191
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,280
I want to know why
they wanted to take Laorchan.

192
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,000
I found those men
after you took Laorchan home.

193
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,560
I questioned them,

194
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,960
but they wouldn't say a word.

195
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:08,640
I believe Thapana Association
hired gunmen to kidnap Laorchan.

196
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,360
I agree.

197
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,200
She only recently returned to Thailand.

198
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,160
It's unlikely that she has enemies.

199
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,560
Does this mean they have been
tracking her movements?

200
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,960
Why would they kidnap her, Your Highness?

201
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,760
It might be a trick to make us believe

202
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,560
there are multiple rebel groups.

203
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,360
They said

204
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,320
they were hired to drop her off
at a warehouse near Si Phraya Road.

205
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,840
Do they know who hired them?

206
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,200
Is it possible they got the wrong person?

207
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,960
It's possible.

208
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,480
HISTORY OF VIENGPHUKHUM CITY

209
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,840
Hey, you are still up.

210
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,000
I was waiting for you.

211
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,920
Don't tell me you were waiting
to eat congee and rice balls.

212
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,720
I didn't stop by the market.

213
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,240
I'm exhausted today.

214
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Is it because you stayed up all night?

215
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,960
You were with Colonel Wachira all night.

216
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,480
I bet you didn't get any sleep.

217
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:49,960
How long have you known him?

218
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,400
Just a few weeks.

219
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,280
How did you meet?

220
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,120
He came to the restaurant
with some friends.

221
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,200
Do you know who he is?

222
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,880
Do you know what he does for a living?

223
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,240
Do you know that he's a soldier
from Viengphukhum?

224
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,360
Yes.

225
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,880
Are you mad that I'm dating him?

226
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,040
Break up with him

227
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,080
or you will regret it.

228
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,360
I don't get it.

229
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,800
How is it any of your business who I date?

230
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,480
It's my business, all right.
You are my friend.

231
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,000
Do you know

232
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,600
that he is already engaged?

233
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,480
He's getting married.

234
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,920
He came to Thailand
to propose to his girlfriend.

235
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,240
How do you know?

236
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,040
How could I not know?

237
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,840
His fiancée

238
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,800
is Kan, Mr. Phu's sister.

239
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,240
Their engagement party
is at the end of the month.

240
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,160
Are you aware of that?

241
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,360
Don't tell me that you knew,

242
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,720
but you are just playing dumb.

243
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,360
Phu.

244
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,920
What's on your mind?

245
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,360
Judging by the look on his face,

246
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,720
he's not stressing about work,

247
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,840
but rather a certain someone at work.

248
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,440
I'm guessing

249
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,160
it's his secretary.

250
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,760
Am I right?

251
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,360
It's okay.

252
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,880
I'll massage your ear.

253
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,680
Don't stress.

254
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,320
Well.

255
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,880
You're right.

256
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,720
The incident last night is bothering me.

257
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,640
I'm worried for Laor's safety.

258
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,160
But I don't want to annoy her

259
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,480
by following her everywhere.

260
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,520
-Poor man.
-Listen.

261
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,080
It's the intention that matters.

262
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,200
Expressing concern and being clingy
are two different things.

263
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,040
I believe Laor can differentiate
between them.

264
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,280
Laorchan doesn't like being fussed over.

265
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,160
Also,

266
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,599
she always spends time
with this male friend of hers.

267
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,200
I see. Here.

268
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,320
Listen.

269
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,000
I think it's normal for a couple

270
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,280
to attract attention

271
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,920
from people around them.

272
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,400
You can't stop people

273
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,320
from gossiping about you.

274
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,920
As for her close friend,

275
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,200
unless they are openly dating

276
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,960
as a couple,

277
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,480
they are nothing but friends.

278
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,600
-Don't worry about it.
-Okay.

279
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,160
If you like her,

280
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,280
you should express how you feel.

281
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,760
To me, Laor seems like

282
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,800
an intelligent, elegant, and strong woman.

283
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,040
I understand why you would fall

284
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,080
for such a woman.

285
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,480
I agree.

286
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,720
-Honey, listen.
-Yes.

287
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,320
The commercials will be over soon.
I'm going upstairs.

288
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,560
Talk to you later.

289
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,240
-Okay.
-See you.

290
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,480
Okay.

291
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,760
Well.

292
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,000
I should follow her before she gets mad.

293
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,320
Okay.

294
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,560
Don't worry about it.

295
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,440
-Good night.
-Good night.

296
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,280
Laor.

297
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,120
About last night,

298
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,640
I…

299
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,160
What do you see in him?

300
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,360
His money?

301
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,160
His charm?

302
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,960
Or didn't you know about the engagement?

303
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,520
I didn't know.

304
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,960
But now you do.

305
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,960
It's not too late.

306
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,720
Leave him and start afresh.

307
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,080
It's best for you and Kan.

308
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,760
Thank you for your concern.

309
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,360
It might be difficult

310
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,920
and painful,

311
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,880
but I know you will be able
to get through it.

312
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,960
You'll get over him in time.

313
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,120
I've been through worse.

314
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:15,560
A boy problem won't bring me down.

315
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,160
I promise

316
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,920
to move on from him.

317
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,760
I'm glad you've come to your senses.

318
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,440
You can do this.

319
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,160
I'm late. I have to go.

320
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,520
Okay.

321
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,280
Laor knows about us.

322
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,360
Mr. Phu.

323
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,800
I told you not to pick me up.

324
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,240
I'm fine getting the bus to work.

325
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,960
Uncle Chai Yai has requested a meeting.

326
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,040
There are matters we must discuss.

327
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,200
He wants to hear your thoughts.

328
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,360
Get in.

329
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,120
Good morning, Uncle.

330
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,120
Good morning.

331
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,280
Take a seat.

332
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,480
Laorchan.

333
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,640
I heard an unexpected incident

334
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,680
happened the other night.

335
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,760
That's right.

336
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,720
You should file a report

337
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,400
so the police track down those kidnappers.

338
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,880
I think
it was a case of mistaken identity.

339
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,920
I don't have any enemies

340
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,120
or problems with anyone.

341
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,600
I actually just came back to Thailand
a few months ago.

342
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,160
Since she doesn't wish to file a report,

343
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,320
you should keep a closer eye
on your secretary.

344
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,240
Why don't you hire bodyguards
to protect her?

345
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,960
Or do you want to do that job yourself?

346
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,480
Mr. Phu is a wonderful boss.

347
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,800
If it wasn't for him the other night,

348
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,080
those kidnappers

349
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,920
would have taken me.

350
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,560
Yes.

351
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,840
You are very lucky.

352
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,160
I hope you weren't harmed, Your Highness.

353
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,600
I wasn't.

354
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,160
Wachira, Khumpheng, and Phathana
were there to protect me.

355
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,560
We headed straight back to the hotel.

356
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,080
Did you go back to the hotel
with the prince, Wachira?

357
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,360
I did. I followed them later.

358
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,880
The prince went in a car
with Khumpheng and Phathana.

359
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,400
All right then.

360
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:21,000
Let's make our way to the library.

361
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,640
-Okay.
-Sure.

362
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,600
We talked about presenting

363
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,200
the mystery of the necklace
to attract viewers.

364
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,760
I'm thinking of adding a little politics
into the documentary.

365
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,760
What do you think?

366
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,800
Since you wanted to add
a serious tone to the documentary,

367
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,000
I found myself a book
to do further research.

368
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,560
Where was it written? Who wrote it?

369
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,680
A French man named Francois Bonnier.

370
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,360
He wrote books on Southeast Asia.

371
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,800
He wrote about

372
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,160
Viengphukhum's Prince Siwilai
and King Atitayawong.

373
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,600
Did he visit Viengphukhum

374
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,960
to write his book?

375
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:10,960
No.

376
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,240
The story is told from
the perspective of General Luecha

377
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,640
who fled to France during that time.

378
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
What does the book say?

379
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,240
May you live long and prosper.

380
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,040
It's as beautiful as the legend says.

381
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,880
Siwilai,

382
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,640
thank you for bringing me

383
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,080
the sapphire third eye.

384
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,120
Since it's the 15th anniversary
of your reign,

385
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,440
the offering must be grand
and honorable, Your Majesty.

386
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,600
This gift

387
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,720
is more than just a necklace.

388
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,720
It represents

389
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,480
your love and honesty,

390
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,760
and our brotherhood.

391
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,320
This symbol of our brotherly love

392
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,320
will be a part of Viengphukhum
for many generations to come.

393
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,560
Long live the king.

394
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,200
-Long live the king.
-Long live the king.

395
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,160
-Long live the king.
-Long live the king.

396
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,200
-Long live the king.
-Long live the king.

397
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,320
I'm touched by your gratitude.

398
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,720
Your loyalty to King Atitayawong

399
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:10,680
will be celebrated
for many generations to come.

400
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,880
Everybody will say

401
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,320
your plan to dethrone him
was just a rumor.

402
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,520
Shut up.

403
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,720
Focus on doing your job.

404
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,320
Are our men ready?

405
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,320
Yes, they are.

406
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,720
We are waiting for your command.

407
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,080
Attack on my signal.

408
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,240
Spare no one.

409
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,800
But don't touch my brother.

410
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,280
He's mine.

411
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,120
That's impossible.

412
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,400
What makes you think that?

413
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,920
This book records the testimony
of people from that time.

414
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,600
I'm sorry,

415
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,760
but I have a reason to object.

416
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,320
The book records the testimony
of General Luecha,

417
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,800
the former leader of
the Thapana Association.

418
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,080
The information is biased.

419
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,680
I didn't say I believe it.

420
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,400
I'm merely saying
it's some of the information we have.

421
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,800
I'm glad somebody objected.

422
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,160
I've read many books
on Southeast Asian history.

423
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:31,320
Many countries sent diplomats
to strengthen ties with Viengphukhum.

424
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,960
Many of them mentioned Prince Siwilai

425
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,920
as he was a diplomat himself.

426
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,120
He was widely admired.

427
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,880
Because of that, you don't believe
he planned to dethrone the king.

428
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,240
According to the stories I heard

429
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,760
from people in the palace,

430
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,080
Prince Siwilai offered
my great-grandpa the necklace

431
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,880
to make the villagers believe

432
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,960
that they were loving brothers

433
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,400
who would never betray each other.

434
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,680
But what happened was

435
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,680
Prince Siwilai and General Luecha

436
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,800
invaded the palace on the day
they gave him the necklace.

437
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,200
That is consistent
with the story in your book.

438
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,920
I read another account

439
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,800
while I was studying in France.

440
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,600
It was written by Anonyme,
an anonymous writer.

441
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,560
You're probably talking about this book.

442
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,280
That's right.

443
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:41,000
This book presents
a different perspective of Prince Siwilai

444
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,520
from the time
after he received the sapphire

445
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,560
from the royal jeweler.

446
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,320
I will take care of the task

447
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,240
as soon as possible.

448
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,960
I will report back to you
once I hear anything.

449
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,760
I should go then.

450
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,720
Long live the king.

451
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,240
Spare his life.

452
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
I'll deal with him.

453
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,800
I'm afraid I can't.

454
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,600
One must dig up the roots
in order to fully remove a tree.

455
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,920
You want me dead too.

456
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,400
You are indeed a smart man.

457
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,160
That's not all I am.

458
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,880
I'm smarter than you think.

459
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,280
-Hands up.
-On your knees.

460
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,800
Siwilai…

461
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,080
Lock them up in a dark cell.

462
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,400
Tomorrow,

463
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,040
I will punish them myself. Take them.

464
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,280
-Come.
-Come.

465
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,880
The writer of this book tells a story

466
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,920
where Prince Siwilai
was loyal to the king.

467
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,640
Why haven't I heard this version before?

468
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,400
All the tales state

469
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,480
Prince Siwilai was one of the founders

470
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,040
of Thapana Association.

471
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,000
Maybe it's not true, Your Highness.

472
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,480
What's not true?

473
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,320
Are you saying

474
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,040
there weren't any rebels
or Prince Siwilai wasn't a rebel?

475
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,840
There's evidence that proves
the existence of Thapana Association.

476
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,800
Prince Siwilai

477
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,280
admitted to his crime,

478
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,120
but the king

479
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,560
showed his brother mercy

480
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,880
and banished him to the north.

481
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,840
After that, no one heard

482
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,880
from him or his family again.

483
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,680
I see.

484
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,320
But this book

485
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,880
has a different ending
to the story you just told.

486
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,920
The two different endings

487
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,280
make the story more interesting.

488
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,760
How does the story end in this book?

489
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,080
Are you sure

490
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,960
you want to do this?

491
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,160
Please reconsider.

492
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,560
I'm sure.

493
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,560
I was unsatisfied with how slowly
Viengphukhum was developing,

494
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,240
since I studied abroad for a long time.

495
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,600
I kept pondering ways
to advance Viengphukhum

496
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:06,240
so it could become as developed as
Western countries.

497
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,960
I was consumed

498
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,000
by doubts

499
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,120
about the country's regime.

500
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
I despaired.

501
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,600
As time passed, it became clear to me

502
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,960
that my efforts to help our people

503
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,240
were in vain.

504
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,800
Your good intentions

505
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,720
were not in vain.

506
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,800
You wanted to give our people
liberty and rights.

507
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,360
But to do that, you must make sure

508
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,400
they thoroughly understand
the meaning of those words.

509
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,920
If they don't, then you must
teach them the definition,

510
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,880
and only then will they see
the value in your efforts.

511
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,840
I must educate them.

512
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,560
Yes.

513
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,800
Now that you know what to do,

514
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:08,040
there's no need to
banish yourself to Pailin City.

515
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,840
Think about your family,

516
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,240
Princess Fuangphet and Prince Peerapong.

517
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,400
Life will be hard for them there.

518
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,960
I've talked to Princess Fuangphet.

519
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,240
My family

520
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
has agreed to go wherever I go.

521
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,560
All I need

522
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,720
is a carriage to carry us.

523
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Will we ever see each other again,

524
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,760
Prince Siwilai?

525
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,480
I will send you letters from time to time.

526
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,840
If anything happens to me,

527
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,320
please know that

528
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,880
I love and respect you.

529
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,840
Farewell.

530
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,880
I want you to know

531
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,960
how happy I am

532
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,280
to have been born as your brother.

533
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,360
It's a completely different ending.

534
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,800
I bet the writer

535
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,120
had a personal connection
to Prince Siwilai.

536
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,760
Perhaps Prince Siwilai wrote it himself.

537
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,480
This book was published in 1959,

538
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,280
which is 2502 in the Thai calendar.

539
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,800
Prince Siwilai passed away
decades before that.

540
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,080
He couldn't have written it.

541
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,480
But I agree with you.

542
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,920
I think someone close to him
wrote this book.

543
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,800
Could the writer be his son?

544
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,240
His son disappeared without a trace.

545
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,520
The last time they heard from him

546
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,160
was when he sent a letter

547
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,080
to announce Prince Siwilai's death.

548
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,800
That was the last and only letter
the palace kept from him.

549
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,160
One book accuses him
of being a rebel leader.

550
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,720
Meanwhile, another book claims
he was a hero behind the scenes.

551
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,520
Which book do we believe?

552
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,560
We don't need to believe either one.

553
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,760
We just need to present
both sides of the story.

554
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,280
Do you think this is enough
to write the script, Laorchan?

555
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,280
Yes.

556
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:23,680
I will write an unbiased script

557
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,280
that doesn't favor

558
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,120
either side.

559
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,880
I will remain neutral

560
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,120
and nonjudgmental.

561
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,240
I'll leave it open to interpretation.

562
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,320
That way, viewers can come
to their own conclusions.

563
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,920
I think we have enough information.

564
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,320
We need to take additional photos

565
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,320
of the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

566
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,680
Should we take pack shots

567
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:57,000
of the necklace
and use them on the posters?

568
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,560
What if we found a model
to wear the necklace instead?

569
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,840
Yes.

570
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,840
But who?

571
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,680
Do you want me to be the model?

572
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,040
Yes.

573
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,640
As the sister of Viengphukhum's king,

574
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,320
you are the perfect candidate
to wear the necklace.

575
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,600
You have all your royal clothes
and accessories

576
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,320
with you here.

577
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:34,960
But…

578
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,640
He already talked to Uncle and Aunt.

579
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,120
They have chosen you to be the model.

580
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,160
Since that's the royal order,

581
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,280
I'll gladly do it.

582
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,680
Are you sure
the Ajna Chakra Necklace is in Thailand?

583
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,760
We screwed up last time

584
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,320
and failed to retrieve it.

585
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,160
My search team is giving up.

586
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,120
The harder we try, the harder it gets.

587
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,600
The fact that the prince
is looking for a model

588
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,720
makes me believe that
the necklace is already in Thailand.

589
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,920
You might be wrong.

590
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,640
If it were here, we would surely
have caught wind of it by now.

591
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:32,280
I sent a spy to infiltrate the hotel,

592
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,920
but it was useless.

593
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,200
Maybe it's not at the hotel.

594
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,920
I'm sure Mr. Phu knows where it is.

595
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,560
How do we make Mr. Phu talk?

596
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,120
I've got an idea.

597
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,240
We need to move forward.
We can't stand still.

598
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,040
I will have that necklace

599
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,720
before the opening of the exhibition.

600
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,240
Mr. Phu, here's the script
for the documentary.

601
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,120
Please check it over.

602
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,200
I'll do it now.

603
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,000
Mr. Phu.

604
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,720
Has the prince decided to take
additional photos of the necklace?

605
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,160
If you are interested,

606
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,840
I will call the technical team
to prepare for the shoot.

607
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,400
Yes, please give them a call.

608
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,440
And you have to get ready yourself.

609
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,200
I will. Once you approve the script,

610
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,360
I will interview Mr. Chai Yai
and record an audio tape.

611
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,320
Not just that.

612
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,960
The prince told me to ask you

613
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,520
to model the necklace with my mom.

614
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,400
What?

615
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,040
If you agree,

616
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,960
the shoot will take place in two days.
What do you say?

617
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,240
Also,

618
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,600
have you finished
all your work for the day?

619
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,520
I want you to help me
with some personal business.

620
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:37,680
Laorchan.

621
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,040
Yes.

622
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,880
I…

623
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,840
Can I have some time to think?

624
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,480
The Ajna Chakra Necklace is a royal item.

625
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,960
I'm an ordinary citizen.

626
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:55,360
Take some time to think about it.

627
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,800
Give me an answer tomorrow.

628
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,360
But what I need to know right now is,

629
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,440
when you will finish your work today.

630
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,880
Queen Chanta and I

631
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:24,120
wish Wachira and Kan happiness

632
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:28,400
in their upcoming engagement.

633
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:34,080
My son and I are deeply grateful

634
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,640
for your blessing.

635
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,720
Take a seat, Jumphol.

636
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,360
Thank you, Your Majesty.

637
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,360
Please pass our regards
to Rachanon and Sroifha.

638
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,080
We wish them good health.

639
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,400
His Majesty and I think of them often.

640
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:03,480
It's very important
to take care of your health.

641
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,240
I have a chronic illness.

642
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:09,280
Luckily, Prince Anucha is here
to assist me with work.

643
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:12,640
Otherwise, I would be in big trouble.

644
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,280
It is my pleasure and honor to serve you.

645
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,440
I will never forget

646
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,040
my debt of gratitude

647
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:25,320
to the Phukhumwong dynasty.

648
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,840
Jumphol, when are you flying to Thailand?

649
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,480
Most likely this weekend, Your Majesty.

650
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,560
I see. In that case,

651
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,840
I wish you and your crew
a safe trip to Thailand.

652
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,320
All right then.

653
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,320
Stay and talk to Prince Anucha.

654
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:48,640
Her Majesty and I

655
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,880
have a doctor's appointment
at the hospital.

656
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,000
It's my appointment.

657
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,120
I will send soldiers
to accompany you for protection.

658
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,840
For your safety,

659
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,960
you should request a royal doctor
to treat you at the palace.

660
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,040
That won't be necessary.

661
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:12,960
Also, a whole troop of soldiers

662
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,120
can't stop death.

663
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,440
No one can escape death

664
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,640
once their time is up.

665
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,600
Let us commute

666
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,400
like commoners

667
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,880
so we know what our people
have to go through.

668
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,320
Don't worry about us.

669
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,160
Satarasamee sent Sub-Lieut. Khumpheng
and Sgt. Maj Phathana

670
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:42,760
to be our personal bodyguards

671
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:44,440
temporarily.

672
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,160
All right, Your Majesty.

673
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,720
Let's go.

674
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,560
Make yourselves at home.

675
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,080
What's the meaning of this?

676
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:24,320
Everyone, don't we have
a department meeting?

677
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,600
Get moving already or you will be late.

678
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,000
You are his secretary.

679
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,680
It's not his job to drive you home.

680
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:51,400
How do you know
that road leads to my house?

681
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,360
Don't tell me

682
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,400
you have a relative
who lives in my neighborhood.

683
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,800
Well, since it's not on the way
to Phu's house,

684
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,720
it has to be on the way to yours.

685
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,880
Could it be

686
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,240
the way to a motel?

687
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,920
Well…

688
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,080
I don't think anyone would look
this stressed heading to a motel.

689
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,000
Don't tell me

690
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,280
this is what you look like

691
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:24,200
when you go to a motel.

692
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,040
Is that how you know?

693
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,360
What are you talking about?

694
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,480
Mr. Phu didn't drive me home.

695
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,120
He was there to assign me a task.

696
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,360
You have nothing to worry about.

697
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,920
I'm glad you know your place.

698
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,640
You are just an ordinary employee.

699
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,200
You should know where you belong.

700
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,520
You are aware that my family and his

701
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,000
have been destined to marry
for generations, right?

702
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,160
Yes, I'm well aware.

703
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,280
I'm rooting for you

704
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,080
to become

705
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,320
the first member of the Dhevaprom family

706
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,400
to win the heart of someone
from the Jutathep family.

707
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,160
-You--
-Ying.

708
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,040
Yes, Phu.

709
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:13,080
When did you get here?

710
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,840
You are here today.

711
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,720
I have something for you.

712
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,760
Let's go.

713
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,080
Come on.

714
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,600
-Come on, let's get you a drink.
-Okay.

715
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,920
Have a safe trip.

716
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,520
Send my regards to Lady Prapasee.

717
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,760
Thank you, Your Highness.

718
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,120
I will return once I'm done
with my business in Bangkok.

719
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,160
Don't worry about me.

720
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,640
Enjoy your time there.

721
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,240
It's your only son's engagement.

722
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,320
Thank you, Your Highness,

723
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:06,160
for standing by His Majesty
for over a decade.

724
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:11,240
I will continue to stand by him
for the rest of my life.

725
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:12,600
Don't worry.

726
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,440
I won't allow anyone

727
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,840
to harm him.

728
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,320
They'll have to go through me first.

729
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,960
I'm honored

730
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,000
to fight by your side.

731
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,520
My whole family feels honored.

732
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,760
Together, we fight for Viengphukhum.

733
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,040
Farewell.

734
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,680
Your shooting has improved.

735
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,480
I still missed
and my shots weren't precise.

736
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,120
They were more precise
than when you first started.

737
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,200
You are ill.

738
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,720
If the prince finds out I brought you both

739
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,480
to a shooting range,

740
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,720
he will be very upset with me.

741
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:20,720
I don't want to be a burden.

742
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,480
Most importantly,
I want to get back to work.

743
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:26,440
I want to visit my people.

744
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,360
Therefore, I must recover
as quickly as possible.

745
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,440
But if the rebels find out

746
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:34,920
that you travel without any soldiers…

747
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,400
It's dangerous for me anywhere I am,

748
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,240
even in this palace.

749
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:46,960
But we feel safe with both of you nearby.

750
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,160
Thank you very much.

751
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:27,160
Gross. It tastes disgusting.
Who made this coffee?

752
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:32,640
I did.

753
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,640
What did you put in it?

754
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,600
Well…

755
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,720
There's 30 cc of brewed Arabica coffee,

756
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,520
30 cc of fresh milk,

757
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,200
and no sugar.

758
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,120
That's a bad recipe.

759
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,040
No wonder it tastes unpleasant.

760
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,720
You've got no taste.

761
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:54,120
Does my recipe taste that bad?

762
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,440
I thought you would enjoy

763
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:05,160
Mr. Phu's special recipe.

764
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:07,600
I apologize.

765
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,760
You said I've got no taste.

766
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,360
I'll ask her to make you a new one.

767
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:14,560
-Laor.
-No.

768
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,800
I don't feel so well, Phu.

769
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,560
My throat hurts.

770
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,520
And I have a cough.

771
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,400
My taste buds must be off.

772
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,960
Excuse me, sir.

773
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,960
There's a problem with the stock.

774
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,240
An agent called saying

775
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,920
the quality of this batch
is lower than usual.

776
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,560
I've arranged a meeting on the 18th floor.

777
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,000
I have a meeting to attend, Ying.

778
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:55,880
Have you prepared the documents?

779
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:58,640
Yes, sir. They're on the table.

780
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,360
Let's go, Laor.

781
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,480
What?

782
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:10,440
I got it.

783
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,800
Let's go.

784
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:15,960
Wait.

785
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,920
Are you attending the meeting too?

786
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,040
Of course, I'm going to wait
for him in there.

787
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,880
The air-conditioners
in the meeting room are broken.

788
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,920
They haven't been fixed yet.

789
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,640
I'm afraid the heat will ruin

790
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,520
your beautiful makeup.

791
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,880
But if you insist on waiting

792
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,560
in the meeting room, be my guest.

793
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,600
I'm just looking out for you.

794
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,920
In that case,
tell Phu I'll be in his office.

795
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:51,120
"In that case,
tell Phu I'll be in his office."

796
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,240
I'm so smart.

797
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,920
Mr. Phu.

798
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:04,120
Was a signature all they needed from you?

799
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:07,080
Yes. As I said,

800
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:10,000
every department has a manager.

801
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,600
They will look into the problem
and report back to me later.

802
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,840
By the way, where are you taking me?

803
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,800
I already told you earlier.

804
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,840
To be honest,

805
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,160
I think you should take
Ying with you instead.

806
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,480
I'm not good at selecting jewelry

807
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,480
since I don't usually wear it.

808
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,680
I want you

809
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,880
because I like your style.

810
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,360
It's a personal preference.

811
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,120
I can't help it.

812
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,760
Let's go.

813
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,880
Wait, Mr. Phu.

814
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,680
Freeze, give me your money.

815
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,120
That's not funny, Phu.

816
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,960
You scared me.

817
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,560
You know I get scared easily.

818
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:10,840
Hello.

819
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,960
Hello.

820
00:53:14,520 --> 00:53:16,240
Who did you bring?

821
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,440
This is Laor, my secretary.

822
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,200
This is Chavit,

823
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,680
the owner of the biggest
gold shop in Thailand.

824
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,280
I wish I could be humbler, but he's right.

825
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:35,160
So,

826
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,240
how may I help you?

827
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,160
Don't tell me you need gold
for your engagement.

828
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:46,000
You are right.

829
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,760
No, you can't do this to me.

830
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,480
You have to give me a chance

831
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:54,600
to know this beautiful lady first.

832
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,000
You can't introduce me to her

833
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:58,920
for the first time
and then tell me you are engaged.

834
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,680
Mr. Chavit, you misunderstood.

835
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:06,480
I'm just helping him out.
The gold is not for me.

836
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:11,160
Mr. Phu is looking to buy gold for Ms. Kan
as an engagement gift.

837
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:14,120
That's a relief.
I've still got a shot with you then.

838
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,920
Gosh, stop being so silly.

839
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:19,680
Pick something for me.

840
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,440
I want earrings and a necklace.

841
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,000
I'm going to catch up with him.

842
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,560
Sure.

843
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:31,720
Come here.

844
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:33,160
What?

845
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,440
Come sit here.

846
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,320
Sit down.

847
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,920
Don't get in her way.

848
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Let her look around in peace.

849
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,200
You are upset. Are you jealous?

850
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,640
I just don't want to bother her.

851
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,600
After all, she's doing me a favor.

852
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,760
I can't have a playboy
following her around

853
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,120
and hitting on her.

854
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,720
You are a real Casanova.

855
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,320
Is she your secretary or girlfriend?

856
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,560
Girlfriend.

857
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,000
Seriously?

858
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,320
She's my secretary.

859
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:05,720
She's mine.

860
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:08,600
No, stay here. Leave her alone.

861
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,680
Don't distract her.

862
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:12,600
You're protective of her.

863
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,840
No, I'm not.

864
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,400
Laor has been working with us
for less than a month.

865
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,640
What if she quits

866
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,440
because you harassed her?

867
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:25,360
It's hard to find
a good secretary these days.

868
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,480
You are an overprotective liar.
You obviously like her.

869
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,840
Stay here.

870
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,720
I'll see how this ends.

871
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,120
How did it go, Laor?
Did you find something that you like?

872
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,160
I found two sets
of earrings and necklaces.

873
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:45,600
Take your pick, Mr. Phu.

874
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,480
Which one do you like?

875
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,280
I like this one.

876
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,960
It's simple but classy.

877
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,120
It's easy to match
and suitable for daily wear.

878
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,880
I'll buy the set that you like.

879
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,440
The bill, please.

880
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:12,080
I'll put it in a fancy box for you.

881
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,520
Thank you.

882
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,160
What is it, Jaree?

883
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,640
How is everything going?

884
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,480
It's going well.

885
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,760
It's me you're talking to.

886
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,200
I'm calling to tell you

887
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:34,480
that Laor is free

888
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,880
for the rest of the day.

889
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,520
Your path is clear,
it's a perfect opportunity

890
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,480
for my handsome boss

891
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:46,040
to take his beautiful
and hardworking secretary out

892
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,760
for a fancy dinner.

893
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,560
What is Ying doing?

894
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,320
She waited for a long time,

895
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,400
but she lost patience

896
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,200
and angrily stormed off.

897
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:00,320
Okay, thank you.

898
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:04,680
You are welcome, sir.
Have an amazing weekend.

899
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,520
Thank you. Talk to you later.

900
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,200
You seemed to enjoy
buying your sister a gift.

901
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,240
Here you go.

902
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,080
I'll send you the bill later.

903
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,600
Please congratulate her for me.

904
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:24,520
Okay. Tell Ked and Chinnakorn I say hello.

905
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,800
Are you going home?

906
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,440
Not yet.

907
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:31,400
I was going to take Laorchan for a meal
to thank her for helping me.

908
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,680
Can I come? I'm hungry.

909
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:40,160
Fine, I'm not hungry anymore.

910
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,000
But I'm hungry.

911
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,160
Where are we going?

912
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,600
I just got hungry again.
I'll come with you.

913
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:56,080
-That's good.
-Let's go eat.

914
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,880
Okay?

915
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,200
How about this table? It looks cozy.

916
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:13,880
Where are you going?

917
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,560
Come sit next to me.

918
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,040
Sit down.

919
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:19,800
Good.

920
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,040
I wasn't going to come,

921
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,960
but then I changed my mind
after seeing you.

922
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,760
I haven't seen you for years.

923
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,800
This meal is on me.

924
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:35,680
Chavit and Ying are close relatives.

925
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:39,120
Chavit's grandpa, M.R. Dhevapan Dhevaprom,

926
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:42,320
is the brother of M.R. Anupan Dhevaprom,

927
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,360
Ying's grandpa.

928
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,680
I see. I didn't know you were
from the Dhevaprom family.

929
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,880
Yes, we haven't had a family gathering

930
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,560
since I came back to Thailand.

931
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,200
But at least

932
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,680
I get to see your face
in the newspaper from time to time

933
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:02,240
since you party with your friends
almost every night.

934
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:07,080
I'm certain I go out less often
than you, Jak, and Phu,

935
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,960
who venture out every night
surrounded by girls.

936
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:15,360
You are ruining my chances here.

937
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,240
I was going to talk myself up to Laor.

938
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,480
I thought you had a meeting, Phu.

939
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:30,160
How did you end up shopping for gold
with your secretary?

940
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,160
Well…

941
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,400
I'm sorry.

942
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:49,800
My friend is waiting for me.
Enjoy your meal.

943
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:51,840
Okay.

944
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:01,880
Where are you going?

945
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,600
Where do you think you are going?

946
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,160
It has been a long time.

947
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,400
Let me buy you a meal.

948
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,200
Stay with me.

949
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,720
Here you go again, Chavit.

950
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,800
Can we have the menu?

951
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,560
Who's picking you up?

952
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:35,440
I don't see anyone.

953
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,760
I'll drive you home then.

954
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:41,040
Mr. Phu.

955
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:50,840
Mr. Phu, why don't you stay

956
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,120
and have dinner with those two?

957
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,120
I want to have dinner with you

958
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,520
and talk to you
without anyone else around.

959
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,280
Do you have a secret to tell me?

960
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:09,240
As of now, I want it to be a secret
between the two of us.

961
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:12,920
But it's up to you if you want
to keep it a secret or not.

962
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,480
-It's up to me?
-Yes.

963
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,080
What's the secret?

964
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,000
Do you believe in destiny?

965
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,480
Do you remember where we first met?

966
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:26,120
Well, we met at Jutathep Palace.

967
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:30,240
I was working there on an event.

968
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,200
You're wrong.

969
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,000
That was our second encounter.

970
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,160
We first met in Paris.

971
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:39,320
I picked up your postcard for you.

972
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,520
Do you remember?

973
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:45,160
What? You're the man who picked up

974
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,880
the postcard for me?

975
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,800
Was that really you?

976
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,240
You didn't recognize me,

977
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:55,960
but I recognized you the second
I saw you at the palace.

978
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,600
Do you know why?

979
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:03,040
Because your image
was imprinted on my heart.

980
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,840
Do know why that is?

981
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,000
I'm going to tell you anyway.

982
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,480
Because

983
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,120
I fell…

984
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:18,520
Hey, Phu.

985
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,480
-Hello, Wuthichai.
-Hello.

986
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,920
Laor, this is M.R. Wuthichai,

987
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,760
the president of Global 88,

988
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,840
our business partner
for the shopping mall project.

989
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:37,520
Sir, this is Laorchan, my secretary.

990
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,160
-Hello.
-Hello.

991
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,920
Phu, why don't you join us?

992
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,960
I'm meeting with
our foreign project partner.

993
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,480
We can discuss the project while we eat.

994
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,400
Who knows, we might be able
to close a deal today.

995
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,600
You should join us too.

996
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,080
Sure, we would be happy to.

997
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,160
This way.

998
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:10,800
Mr. Phu, you were saying you fell.

999
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,520
Where did you fall?

1000
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,800
We'll continue our conversation later.

1001
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:20,880
After you.

1002
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:36,200
Mr. Phu, thank you so much for taking me.

1003
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,040
I learned many things today,

1004
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:41,320
including how much easier
and smoother it is

1005
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,520
to discuss a business deal over a meal.

1006
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,680
You did a great job today.

1007
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:49,720
Wuthichai wouldn't stop talking about you.

1008
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:54,960
I was doing my best as your secretary.

1009
01:03:58,720 --> 01:03:59,760
Take a seat, Laor.

1010
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:03,080
Let's finish our conversation
from earlier.

1011
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,840
What is it?

1012
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:21,520
I want you to take on extra duty

1013
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,560
besides being my secretary.

1014
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,080
What do you say?

1015
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,800
What do you want me to do?

1016
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,840
Well…

1017
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:37,400
This job will bring us closer.

1018
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:40,880
I can't do it alone without you.

1019
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,320
But I can't force you,

1020
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,560
so I need you to agree to it first.

1021
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,360
However, before we get there…

1022
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,640
Will you be my girlfriend, Laor?

1023
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:30,360
Laor.

1024
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,880
Laor.

1025
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,040
Laor.

1026
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,520
Laor.

1027
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:43,280
Will you be my girlfriend?

1028
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,520
-Hey.
-Run.

1029
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:57,920
Laor!

1030
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:01,960
Excuse me.

1031
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:10,560
I'm so sorry I'm late.

1032
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:12,840
The bus I was on

1033
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,880
got hit by another bus.

1034
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,440
I saw the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

1035
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,040
So it's really here?

1036
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,440
The necklace is at Jutathep Palace.

1037
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,520
So you know where the safe is.

1038
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,560
If one day, something happens
that causes us to break up,

1039
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,520
we can end things quietly.

1040
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:30,600
Do you still have doubts
about our relationship?

1041
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:32,680
Are you here with your boyfriend?

1042
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,360
What a coincidence.

1043
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,680
You should introduce us.

1044
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,360
-Sister, look at this.
-What?

1045
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,720
My gosh! What is this?

1046
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,960
Let me see it.

1047
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:24,960
