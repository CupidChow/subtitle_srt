1
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,360
I'll lead them away from you.

2
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,120
I'm going back for him.

3
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,280
I'll go with you.

4
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,200
It's going to blow!

5
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,640
Sun!

6
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,600
Even if you beat me to death,

7
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,240
I can't tell you
who the association's leader is.

8
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,720
-My great-grandpa.
-That's right.

9
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,920
Prince Siwilai.

10
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,920
The lady next to him

11
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,240
is probably his wife, Princess Fuangphet.

12
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,040
Her finger is pointing to the lion's head.

13
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Maybe something's hidden there.

14
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,680
It has a blue velvet cover

15
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,640
with his monogram and his crest.
It's his personal coat of arms.

16
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,240
This is the work of an artist.

17
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
He must have loved Fuangphet very much.

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Does it only contain
sketches of the princess?

19
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,800
Does it contain a map to the temple?

20
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,160
We haven't found one.

21
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,360
Wait.

22
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:14,120
This sketch looks similar
to the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

23
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,280
It's not just similar.

24
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,560
This is a sketch
of the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

25
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,760
He's right.

26
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,560
It's the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

27
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,640
Hang on.

28
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,800
This is a sketch

29
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,840
of the complete necklace.

30
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,360
It's some kind of a symbol.
There's a dashed line

31
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,880
with dots.

32
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,280
There's no map.

33
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,280
It doesn't tell us
how to get to the temple.

34
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,840
Can I try something?

35
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,040
Poom. I need your help.

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,120
What's wrong, Poom?

37
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,320
The diary is burning hot.

38
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,120
It's not hot.

39
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,760
A candle. Give me a candle.

40
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,080
Sure.

41
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,920
What's the matter, Poom?

42
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,400
How romantic.

43
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,680
You danced in a cave.

44
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,280
What nonsense are you talking about?

45
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,040
Ignore him. He's speaking nonsense.

46
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,960
Which page should we start on?

47
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,080
Let me see.

48
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,720
This page, Your Highness.

49
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,480
I've only seen

50
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,160
text appearing
in the presence of heat in movies.

51
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,200
Does it really work?

52
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,880
I've encountered several references
to invisible text

53
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,920
throughout my research.

54
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,560
This technique was used
to hide secret messages

55
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,960
from enemies.

56
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,760
But I've never seen it myself.

57
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,480
Your Highness, can we try again?

58
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,320
Hold it closer to the flame this time.

59
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,240
But it might catch fire.

60
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,600
We have to risk it.

61
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,640
There it is!

62
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,960
What does it say?

63
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,160
It's an ancient language.

64
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,880
However, there are words

65
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,480
I'm not familiar with.

66
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,600
Mr. Chai Yai, can you read what it says?

67
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,680
It looks like a poem.

68
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,160
"Shine light

69
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
Through

70
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,520
Aligned celestial luminaries

71
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,480
A solar eclipse

72
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,680
Will engulf

73
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,440
The Earth

74
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,560
In the absence of a crescent moon

75
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,960
The light

76
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,800
Will blaze brightly

77
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,560
Only then

78
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,840
Will Anodard Pond

79
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,200
Be revealed"

80
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,480
It's difficult enough to read.

81
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,840
Do we need to solve a riddle too?

82
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,320
This is too hard.

83
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,960
Mr. Chai Yai.

84
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,400
Did my great-grandpa write anything else?

85
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,800
Isn't Anodard Pond

86
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,000
in the mystical forest of Himavanta?

87
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,760
Yes, according to the myth.

88
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,760
But I don't know whether it really exists.

89
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,000
Personally, I think it's an analogy,
describing a location.

90
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,200
Could it be referring

91
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,040
to the temple?

92
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,040
Listen.

93
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,480
If you are right,

94
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,800
we are both lucky and unlucky.

95
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,280
Prince Siwilai hid the diary

96
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,080
in a safe place.

97
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,680
Why didn't he just draw a clear map
for his descendants to find?

98
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,560
Why make us solve riddles?

99
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
He didn't want anyone to know.

100
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,760
Especially the rebels
from Thapana Association.

101
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,600
It would have been a big problem
if they had found the map.

102
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,840
What does it mean by celestial luminaries?

103
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,240
It's not a common term.

104
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,960
It refers to stars.

105
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,680
"Shine light through
Aligned celestial luminaries"

106
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,160
Do we have to shine light on the stars,

107
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,920
Chai Yai?

108
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,000
Stars that align…

109
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,640
I can only think of Orion's Belt.

110
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,800
I don't think that's it.

111
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,440
I think the stars in this case

112
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,480
refer to the moon and the sun

113
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,080
on the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

114
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,520
I don't think it refers
to actual stars in the sky.

115
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,280
It's a metaphor.

116
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,600
Do you think

117
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,000
it refers to the sun and the moon pendants
which are adjacent on the necklace?

118
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,960
Astronomy fascinated Prince Siwilai.

119
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,640
Maybe he had it made
according to his own design.

120
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,800
I agree with Laor. May I?

121
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,520
Does this mean

122
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,720
we have to disassemble the necklace

123
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,760
and align the pendants under the sun?

124
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,240
Will that make the necklace glow?

125
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,360
Since sapphire doesn't glow,
we can shine light on it instead.

126
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,400
Do you mean to use something

127
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,080
like a film viewer or slide projector?

128
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,440
That's right, Phu.

129
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,560
Yes.

130
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,600
That's a good idea.

131
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:27,680
"A solar eclipse will engulf the Earth"

132
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,320
If this pendant represents the sun
and this one represents the moon,

133
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,480
what about the Earth?

134
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,520
Could it be this part?

135
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,800
We have to make the necklace glow first,

136
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,200
then we will be able to figure out

137
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,520
its connection
to the first line of the riddle.

138
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,680
All right then.

139
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,560
We will follow
Phu and Poom's suggestion tomorrow.

140
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,680
If they are right, we will be able to move
on to the next part of the riddle.

141
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,400
Yes, Your Majesty.

142
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,160
A solar eclipse will engulf

143
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,280
the Earth.

144
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,160
I believe this is the correct arrangement

145
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,640
of the eclipse as mentioned in the riddle.

146
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,400
Wachira, turn on the projector.

147
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,240
-Yes.
-Veena, turn off the light.

148
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,440
Sure.

149
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,160
I don't see anything, Phu.

150
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,200
Prince Siwilai wouldn't come up
with a simple riddle.

151
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,520
Veena, turn the light back on.

152
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,960
Yes.

153
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,200
But this is the correct alignment
for a solar eclipse.

154
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,120
Could we be missing a component?

155
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,600
What else could we be missing?

156
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,480
These are the sole components
of the necklace.

157
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,360
I expected the component
representing Earth to be round.

158
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,640
But none of the necklace components

159
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,880
are round.

160
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,760
Could the sapphire

161
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,280
represent the Earth?

162
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,600
We have to remove the sapphire.

163
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:01,160
But that could damage the necklace.

164
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,720
I doubt it.

165
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,720
We have to try every method.
One of them might work.

166
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,720
We've come this far.

167
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,880
We have to keep trying.

168
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,560
Let's prove

169
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,760
whether we were right about the riddle.

170
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,640
Wachira, fetch some tools.

171
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,640
Yes, Your Highness.

172
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,320
General, they are over there.

173
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,040
Here.

174
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,200
Get ready.

175
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,040
Attack!

176
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,840
Who is the leader
of the Thapana Association?

177
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,480
Who is it?

178
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,240
Please, Prince Anucha.

179
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,560
We don't know who he is.

180
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,480
Kill them!

181
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,120
Take aim.

182
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,920
-Fire!
-Stop.

183
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,720
My brother.

184
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,480
The sapphire can really be removed.

185
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,200
If Laor's theory is right,

186
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,080
the sapphire should be here.

187
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,880
In the absence of a crescent moon

188
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,120
The light will blaze brightly

189
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,320
In the absence of a crescent moon.

190
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,440
Could it refer to a full moon?

191
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,000
How can we turn

192
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,080
a crescent moon into a full moon?

193
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,880
Colonel, turn on the projector.

194
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:25,920
Okay.

195
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,400
-Captain, turn off the light.
-Right.

196
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,360
Only then

197
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,360
Will Anodard Pond

198
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,200
Be revealed

199
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,560
What is it, Mr. Chai Yai?

200
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,560
It looks familiar.

201
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,320
I don't know where I've seen it before.

202
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,840
These are animals.

203
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,600
The top figure looks like an elephant.

204
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,240
This one looks like a horse.

205
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,280
The one opposite to it looks like a lion.

206
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,920
And I think that's a cow. I see horns.

207
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,560
An elephant, a horse, a cow, and a lion

208
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,560
positioned in each direction.

209
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,360
What does it mean?

210
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,800
Could this be a map
to Anodard Pond in Himavanta?

211
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,680
-Himavanta?
-Himavanta?

212
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,440
Does it really exist?

213
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,160
Isn't Himavanta a mythical forest?

214
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,120
I think it's a metaphorical map.

215
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,560
It reminds me…

216
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,360
It reminds me of
the Neak Poan sanctuary in Cambodia.

217
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,720
The sanctuary was also inspired

218
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,240
by Anodard Pond.

219
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,960
Four carved animals
are located in each direction.

220
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,480
Prince Siwilai must be trying to tell us

221
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,280
that the temple is located somewhere
similar to Anodard Pond.

222
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,200
There are three pagodas

223
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,240
in the center.

224
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,000
Wat Chedi Sam Yot.

225
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,680
I believe it will lead us to the temple.

226
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,520
We need to find

227
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,840
the starting point.

228
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,160
When rebels surrounded us

229
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,800
during the battle of Khok Phaya,

230
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,120
I retreated to Wat Chedi Sam Yot.

231
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,240
There were three large pagodas inside.

232
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,800
Well, that was easy.

233
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,320
It's not that easy, Poom.

234
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,800
Viengphukhum has three-pagoda temples

235
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,400
in every region.

236
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,120
How do we know which one it is?

237
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,400
Do you see now, Poom?

238
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,480
Prince Siwilai wouldn't reveal
the temple's location that easily.

239
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,880
I know

240
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,960
that your loyalty lies with me
and Viengphukhum.

241
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,880
But you must think clearly

242
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,600
and not be too hasty.

243
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,360
I was accused

244
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,560
of being a rebel.

245
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,200
If it weren't for you,

246
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,880
I would have died in prison

247
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,960
or been executed already.

248
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,480
My brother.

249
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,280
You gave me a second chance at life.

250
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,240
Of course I would do anything for you.

251
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,600
I understand

252
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,840
that you are burdened
by pain and a desire for revenge.

253
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,800
Taking the lives of those individuals

254
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,960
may satisfy your need for vengeance,

255
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,440
but the satisfaction would be temporary.

256
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,760
Eventually,

257
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,800
you will wonder

258
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,600
how you can completely eradicate them.

259
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,880
But it's impossible
to get rid of them all.

260
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,760
Taking out your anger on them

261
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,120
is like pouring oil on a fire,

262
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,120
encouraging them to fight back.

263
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,440
What do you want me to do?

264
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,480
You must love

265
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,040
in order to be loved.

266
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,040
You must trust

267
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,520
in order to be trusted.

268
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,600
Just like

269
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,880
how I trust you, Anucha.

270
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,200
Here.

271
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,120
In the north,

272
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,920
there's a temple in Pailin.

273
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,840
PAILIN CITY

274
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,720
In the south, there's a temple in Khamsai.

275
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,840
In the east, there's one in Thung Luang.

276
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,800
Lastly,

277
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,640
there's a temple in Khok Phaya.

278
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,320
There's one in each region.

279
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,800
Fortunately, you don't have
northeast and northwest regions.

280
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,280
Otherwise, it would be…

281
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,200
There's also one in the capital.

282
00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:00,240
It's within walking distance
from the palace.

283
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,000
What is the distance
between these temples?

284
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,840
They are about 300 to 400 km
from the city center.

285
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,960
It doesn't sound far,

286
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,840
but they are not easy to reach.

287
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:20,000
It will take us a lot of time.

288
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,680
This means, if we get the wrong temple,

289
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,080
it will be a hassle to get to another one.

290
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,160
Most importantly,

291
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,360
we don't have much time.

292
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,840
If the curse of Lord Naga Trinetr is real,

293
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,880
the 18-year cycle will recur
in just a few months.

294
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,160
We don't have time
to explore many temples.

295
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,160
We must pick the right one.

296
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,280
What are you discussing?

297
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,360
It seems like an important matter.

298
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,520
I should go then.

299
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,520
I don't keep any secrets from you.

300
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,360
I actually need your advice
about something.

301
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,720
You've traveled around the country
training soldiers.

302
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,440
Can you give us advice on where to start?

303
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,640
Khamsai

304
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,320
experiences a few big storms every year.

305
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,640
Each storm causes
severe damage to the area.

306
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,560
It has been like this since ancient times.

307
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,560
Therefore, it's impossible
that the temple is there.

308
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,080
Thung Luang

309
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,360
is home to a Vietnamese community.

310
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,280
They have been living there
for many centuries.

311
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,760
So it couldn't be this area.

312
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,840
I agree.

313
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,360
The Vietnamese are Christians.

314
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,440
The King wouldn't have built
a temple in that location.

315
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,240
This leaves us with Pailin City

316
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,080
and Khok Phaya.

317
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,920
Khok Phaya is in a better location.

318
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,000
Getting there is easier

319
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,000
since most of the land is flat.

320
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:31,040
I think it would be a suitable location
to build a temple.

321
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,720
But the legend says

322
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,720
the temple is buried
under a tall mountain.

323
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,680
This means

324
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,920
it must be in a mountainous area.

325
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,600
Khok Phaya doesn't fit the description.

326
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,920
Most importantly,

327
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,920
Prince Siwilai moved to Pailin

328
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,240
which is the northernmost district
of the country.

329
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,320
It's likely

330
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,840
that the temple we are looking for

331
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,200
is the three-pagoda temple in Pailin.

332
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,360
He must have known about the temple.

333
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,640
That's why he decided
to build a palace nearby.

334
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,160
We are on the right track.

335
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,080
Do the four animals
have some significance?

336
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,800
We'll solve the next part of the puzzle
once we get to the temple.

337
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,800
Let's do what Prince Siwilai would do.

338
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,400
Solve the puzzle one piece at a time.

339
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,280
Wachira.

340
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,200
Prepare for our departure.

341
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,000
We will leave tomorrow.

342
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,160
Yes, Your Highness.

343
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:02,280
PAILIN

344
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,640
Hey.

345
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,800
Are you still grieving over Sun's death?

346
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,320
Is it possible that you were
in love with him without realizing?

347
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,440
I loved him

348
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,920
like a family member.

349
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,120
He stood by me when I had no one.

350
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,720
I felt closer to him than my own family.

351
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,080
No matter how much time passes,

352
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:18,280
I will never get over his death.

353
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,160
I have to complete the mission

354
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,240
for my great-grandpa

355
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,120
and Sun.

356
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,880
Your connection with Sun
is like mine with Wachira.

357
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,600
I love him so much
that I could die for him.

358
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
It's not like that with anyone else.

359
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,200
Do you have a sweetheart?

360
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,640
I wish.

361
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,240
My job is dangerous
and it requires me to be on standby.

362
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,480
How could I have a boyfriend?

363
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,080
What about Mr. Phu?

364
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,600
Don't tell me you only got close to him

365
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,320
to find out about the necklace

366
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,120
and that you never actually
had feelings for him.

367
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,680
It's a shame you and Uncle Chai Yai
can't come with us.

368
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,720
Phu.

369
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,200
I really want to go.

370
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,520
I love challenging adventures.

371
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,280
But I'm worried

372
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,520
I'll get fired.

373
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,800
Do you think it will be challenging?

374
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,920
You have no idea.

375
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,560
It will be unimaginably challenging.

376
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,840
Did you have a vision?

377
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,840
No, but I can tell.

378
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,360
It's undeniably
one of the toughest missions.

379
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,280
The prince isn't the only person
looking for the temple.

380
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,680
The rebels are also searching for it.

381
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,200
But it's the only way for the prince

382
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,160
to do something for his country.

383
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,320
And Laor will get to prove

384
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,920
her family's innocence.

385
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,240
As for you,

386
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,000
you will get to prove your love for Laor.

387
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,680
Bang. You'll kill three birds
with one stone.

388
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,200
I just want to help Laor
clear her family's name.

389
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,760
Phu.

390
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,080
Stop lying.

391
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,400
Are you doing all this
just to be her friend?

392
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,880
Phu.

393
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,680
I can see it in your eyes,
how you feel about her.

394
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,920
I've got you.

395
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,280
Have you forgiven her?

396
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,920
Is that why you're helping her?

397
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,960
I'll get it.

398
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,840
Can I talk to Mr. Phu?

399
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,120
Sure.

400
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,520
Mr. Phu.

401
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,440
I want to talk to you about what happened

402
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,480
between us.

403
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,760
I'm truly sorry

404
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,440
for what I did.

405
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,560
It was extremely selfish.

406
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,040
I was really mad at you.

407
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,800
But if I had known
about the situation you were in,

408
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:11,080
I would have acted differently

409
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:14,239
as I can't bear
the thought of you getting hurt.

410
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,159
Why did you agree to help me?

411
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,679
I admit

412
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,120
I was so upset with you

413
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,320
that I didn't want to see you again.

414
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,320
But I couldn't stop thinking of you

415
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,400
every day we were apart.

416
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,320
It was like I'd had my heart broken,

417
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,080
but I couldn't get past it.

418
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,240
When I heard you had been kidnapped,

419
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,240
my heart was on fire.

420
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,800
I was worried sick.

421
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,600
That was when it became clear to me

422
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,360
that I couldn't live without you.

423
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,880
I should be thanking you

424
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,200
for making me realize

425
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,520
what my heart wants.

426
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,280
Can we get back together?

427
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,840
Come back to me,

428
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,440
Laorchan.

429
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,200
Mr. Phu.

430
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,480
I don't deserve your forgiveness.

431
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,000
Right now, I don't know

432
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,120
how I feel.

433
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,440
I don't want to hurt you any more
than I already have.

434
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,800
Also,

435
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,080
I have to focus on the mission.

436
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,240
I'll help you.

437
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,200
I'll stand by you

438
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,880
until

439
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,840
you accept my love.

440
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,240
Who knows,

441
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,000
I might be the answer you are looking for.

442
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,360
Okay, Mr. Phu.

443
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,760
Thank you.

444
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,320
You're welcome.

445
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,320
I barely see any houses now.
Where are we, Colonel?

446
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,800
We are about 150 km from the city.

447
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,400
Have we only traveled
150 km in half a day?

448
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,240
The road is rather winding.

449
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,600
We are actually ahead of schedule.

450
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,800
Colonel, how many days
will it take to reach Pailin

451
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,080
if we drive 150 km a day?

452
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,120
Probably about three days.

453
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,840
The road will get worse as we go

454
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,880
as there have been storms this past month.

455
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,520
Are we entering Sa Pa?

456
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,120
Yes, Your Highness.

457
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,440
Once we pass this next mountain,
we will cross into it.

458
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,960
This area has had
many earthquakes and major floods.

459
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,040
The roads have been badly damaged.

460
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,880
Luckily, you and Wachira
are familiar with the road.

461
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,360
Despite their familiarity,

462
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,120
northern forests are known to be cursed.

463
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,480
We can't let our guard down.

464
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,440
We are about to enter Sa Pa.

465
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,440
Children!

466
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:51,960
Oh, no.

467
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,280
Kids.

468
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,360
Laor.

469
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,560
What's going on? Let's check it out.

470
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,280
Kids, are you all right?

471
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,560
Are you hurt?

472
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,800
What happened? Is anyone hurt?

473
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,520
I stopped the car in time.

474
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,320
-City people.
-City people.

475
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,640
Kids, wait.

476
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,800
We have medicine. Hey, wait for me.

477
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,160
-Laor.
-Laor.

478
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:30,720
Laor.

479
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,720
Why were they terrified of us?

480
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,400
-City people!
-City people!

481
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,520
-City people!
-They are going to sell us!

482
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,920
-City people!
-City people!

483
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,640
They are going to sell us!

484
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,720
-City people.
-Laor.

485
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,200
Laor.

486
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,920
Where did the gunshot come from?

487
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,840
The forest Mr. Phu and Laor entered.

488
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,400
Do you think they are rebels or hunters?

489
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,720
It's a residential area.

490
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,240
It doesn't matter who fired the shots.
We need to rescue them.

491
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,560
Khumpheng, go and find
Mr. Phu and Ms. Laor.

492
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,440
Watch out for the two children. Go.

493
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,520
Yes.

494
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,280
They are bandits. We are being robbed.

495
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,440
Protect our supplies. Do not shoot anyone.

496
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,560
Wachira, follow those two.

497
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,840
Yes, Your Highness.

498
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,320
Protect the prince.

499
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,960
Put it down.

500
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,160
Now.

501
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,560
Where did the gunshots come from?

502
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:02,120
I don't think they are hunters.

503
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,200
Could they be rebels?

504
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
We should leave.

505
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,800
It's me.

506
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,400
I almost punched you.

507
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,600
What's happening?

508
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,560
We are being robbed.

509
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,120
The soldiers are after them.

510
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,600
We should head back to the car.

511
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,560
Help!

512
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,640
Help!

513
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,880
Look, they are taking the children.

514
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,440
Help!

515
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,960
Laor.

516
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,920
-Help!
-Help!

517
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,640
-Help!
-Help!

518
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,600
Shut up.

519
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,360
-Help!
-Help!

520
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,120
Help!

521
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,560
Don't come any closer

522
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,200
or I will kill everyone.

523
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:20,280
Great job. You did well.

524
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,160
-Go.
-What's going on?

525
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,360
You tricked us.

526
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,120
Freeze! Drop the gun.

527
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,440
Sun!

528
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:45,680
Sun?

529
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,600
Laor…

530
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,120
Be careful, Ms. Laor.

531
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,760
Sun.

532
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,800
-Sun.
-Laor.

533
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,680
I was able to escape
before the place blew up.

534
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:39,160
But I was unconscious for three days.

535
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:40,920
When I woke up,

536
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,720
I discovered myself here
in Prai Dum village.

537
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,440
I couldn't even remember my own name.

538
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,040
I would be dead
if it weren't for Elder Khumtai.

539
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:01,040
It's like you were reborn.

540
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:05,560
I'm so happy to see you again.

541
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,240
Thank you very much for saving his life.

542
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,080
Thank you.

543
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,440
What a miracle.

544
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:21,040
You have been reunited
in an unexpected place.

545
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,760
Has your memory completely returned?

546
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,480
Yes, Elder Khumtai's herbal medicine
sped up my recovery.

547
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,120
Khammouane is very far from here.

548
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,120
What were you doing there?

549
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,920
Yesterday,

550
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,400
my siblings and I went to a funeral.

551
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,520
After that, we went to collect honeycombs
in the forest.

552
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,440
We found him
barely breathing near the river,

553
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,600
so we brought him home.

554
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,520
You sound like a merciful man.

555
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,520
Why do you rob people then?

556
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,080
We have to survive.

557
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,880
We only do it to get by.

558
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:08,400
We never tried to kill anyone.

559
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:12,320
We recently had a plague outbreak.

560
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,920
We had no food or water,

561
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,800
let alone medicine to treat the sick.

562
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,240
Then we were robbed by a group of bandits.

563
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:25,720
We got those guns from the thieves.

564
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,160
Has the government not offered help?

565
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,960
The government
is no different than the thieves.

566
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,960
The money never reaches the people.

567
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,240
You wouldn't understand.

568
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,640
Still, you shouldn't use
those children as bait.

569
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,200
It's dangerous.

570
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,000
And it teaches the children bad morals.

571
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,600
Even the children need to survive.

572
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,720
They need to support themselves
and their family.

573
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,400
Deep down, they are good children.

574
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,360
I swear on my life.

575
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,640
Come here, Prom and Joi.

576
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,360
Apologize to them.

577
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,720
-We are sorry.
-We are sorry.

578
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,120
Look at you. You're covered in wounds.

579
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,280
Come with me. I'll clean your wounds.

580
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,720
We didn't get hit by the car.

581
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,680
It was an act.
We were just rolling on the ground.

582
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,640
If that's the case, then why are your arms

583
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,720
covered in blood?

584
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,920
It's from wildflowers.

585
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,400
I see.

586
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,920
You are great actors.

587
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,040
How long have you been doing this act?

588
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:40,560
Let me see.

589
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,640
These kids.

590
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,560
I can't believe them.

591
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,760
You should sleep here tonight,

592
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,840
then continue on your journey
tomorrow morning.

593
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:59,080
Is this all of you?

594
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,640
Who's the leader?

595
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,720
It's you, isn't it?

596
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,440
What's your name?

597
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,800
My name is Jhao.

598
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,600
Jhao?

599
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,480
Yes.

600
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,640
You are all invited

601
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,240
to join us for dinner.

602
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,560
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

603
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,880
You look so happy.

604
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,000
Of course.

605
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,840
I'm so relieved to see Sun's face again.

606
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,760
It's as if I was reborn alongside him.

607
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,680
Are you going to tell him
about the mission?

608
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,960
I will if he asks.

609
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:59,640
But I won't let him
risk his life for me again.

610
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,240
I got you.

611
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,320
Go away. I'm cold now.

612
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,400
You knew about Laor's plan all along.

613
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,120
And what happened back in Khammouane
was part of your plan.

614
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,080
I had to know the leader's identity.

615
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,480
I wanted to talk to him.

616
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,520
However, the explosion

617
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,200
which resulted in casualties

618
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,600
was not part of my plan.

619
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,560
You must be strong and tough

620
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,000
to have made it out alive.

621
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,560
Laor saved me.

622
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,840
I couldn't die.

623
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,000
I wanted to see Laor one more time.

624
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,040
Why didn't you contact Laor

625
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,280
after your memory returned?

626
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,560
I wanted to contact her and see her

627
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,720
more than anything in the world.

628
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:26,080
But Elder Khumtai needed men

629
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,720
and food to support the people,

630
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,040
so I decided to stay.

631
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:36,920
Laor was devastated,

632
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:40,960
as you were her best friend.

633
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,800
I also felt terrible

634
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:48,320
that I wasn't the person who rescued Laor.

635
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:51,760
There was nothing I could do.

636
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,120
But from now on,

637
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,920
I'll never abandon her again.

638
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,480
Laor is so lucky

639
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,320
to have you as a friend.

640
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,320
We are glad to see you again, Sun.

641
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:20,720
Likewise.

642
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:34,040
-Hey, are you done?
-Yes.

643
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:38,320
Let's head back to the camp. Come on.

644
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:43,000
I'd like to speak to Sun in private.

645
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:53,600
Come on. I'm hungry.

646
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,240
-Wachira.
-Yes.

647
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,880
Please take this for me.

648
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,320
-Sure.
-Thank you.

649
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,360
You finally came back for it.

650
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,840
I thought you had forgotten your promise.

651
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,520
Keep it.

652
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,080
The sun and the moon…

653
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:37,240
belong together.

654
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,240
I don't deserve the necklace.

655
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,000
I lied to you.

656
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,520
I took advantage of your trust

657
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,200
and it almost got you killed.

658
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,800
I don't even deserve to be your friend.

659
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,240
I know you had no choice.

660
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,600
In life,

661
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,760
there are some things we just can't avoid.

662
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,680
Don't be sad.

663
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,680
It will only make me feel worse.

664
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,320
I want to see you smile, not cry.

665
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,040
Thank you so much.

666
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:54,080
Thank you for coming back.

667
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,840
I'm sorry

668
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:00,800
for putting you in harm's way.

669
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,840
I should be thanking you,

670
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,360
for staying alive
so I could see you again.

671
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,640
Mr. Phu saved my life.

672
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,440
I would be dead

673
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,400
if it weren't for him.

674
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,320
He must really love you
to have followed you here.

675
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,320
So, what about the necklace?

676
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,080
Sun.

677
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,880
You don't need to worry about it anymore.

678
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,000
I'll take care of everything myself.

679
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:44,880
Soon,

680
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,640
everything will be over.

681
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:50,760
Wait for me in Bangkok.

682
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,400
We've just been reunited
and you're sending me away already.

683
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,960
I'm not sending you away,

684
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,480
but you shouldn't risk your life
over this matter anymore.

685
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,760
If you still consider me a friend,

686
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,440
please listen to me.

687
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:18,200
I don't want to be your friend.

688
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,600
You know that.

689
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,960
You've been a good friend to me.

690
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:38,240
You are like my family.

691
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:44,000
And I refuse to let anything
happen to my family.

692
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,720
You can't stop me

693
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,040
from caring about you.

694
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:02,720
I still care about you

695
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,240
as much as I did

696
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,400
the day we first met.

697
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,120
I've been here for you
all this time, haven't I?

698
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:17,200
I'm not going anywhere.

699
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,320
I think we should head back to the camp.

700
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,000
Everyone's waiting for us.

701
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,000
You keep it.

702
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,240
Let's go.

703
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:24,880
Mr. Phu.

704
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,120
It's dinner time.

705
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,280
Everyone is waiting
at Elder Khumtai's residence.

706
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,680
What did you talk about?
You were gone for a while.

707
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,560
I apologized to him

708
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,880
and we talked about
the herbal medicine he took.

709
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,240
Are you sure that's all?

710
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,960
What else could we have talked about?

711
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:56,760
Laor, you know what I mean.

712
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:02,880
Let's go eat.

713
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,240
I don't care who comes first.

714
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,800
I'm giving you an order as your boss.

715
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,360
Don't forget

716
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:18,040
that I quit my job.

717
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,080
But I haven't signed
the resignation letter.

718
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,960
And I will never sign it.

719
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,360
You are still my secretary.

720
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,560
-And you will also be--
-Mr. Phu.

721
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,160
We've talked about this.

722
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,400
My word still stands.

723
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:33,480
I won't think about other things

724
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,960
until the mission is complete.

725
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,000
Therefore, let's go eat.

726
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,240
Sure. I'll wait.

727
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,520
Thank you for the food

728
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,960
you've shared with us.

729
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:02,880
The supplies you gave us will last months.

730
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:07,560
This year, we've experienced
heavy rain, floods, and strong winds.

731
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,640
Luckily, there are still fish to catch.

732
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,880
Before we depart tomorrow,

733
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,040
we will give you more food.

734
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,880
In exchange, will you promise me

735
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,640
that you won't rob people anymore?

736
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,560
It's my job

737
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,280
to feed my starving villagers.

738
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:33,560
But it's wrong to rob people.

739
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,280
What are we supposed to do?

740
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,520
We can't beg the government for food.

741
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:43,440
They won't help us.

742
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,760
They use the knowledge they have
to take advantage of us.

743
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:48,520
Elder Khumtai.

744
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,680
There are government officials

745
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,880
who are honest and dependable.

746
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,920
Not in our district.

747
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,360
They become wealthy by exploiting us.

748
00:59:58,440 --> 00:59:59,920
They are rich like you.

749
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:05,440
I understand how you must feel.

750
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,840
No, you don't.

751
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,960
How would well-off people
understand what we have to endure?

752
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,440
It's easy for you to say

753
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,720
because you've never suffered!

754
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,560
Try going without food and water.

755
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,040
Then you'll understand what it's like.

756
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:24,440
I dare you!

757
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,320
How dare you disrespect him like that.

758
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:29,320
Don't you know who he is?

759
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:32,920
That's the sort of question
rich people ask.

760
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,600
Do you have any idea who I am?

761
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:38,640
-Shut up!
-Sit down,

762
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,560
Wachira, Khumpheng, Phathana!

763
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,360
Elder Khumtai.

764
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,000
I apologize to you on their behalf.

765
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:02,160
I promise to help you guys.

766
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,480
I will talk to my dad.

767
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,720
He knows the governor of Sa Pa.

768
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,880
The famine in your village

769
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,280
requires immediate attention.

770
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,400
I have no reason to believe you,

771
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,840
but I'll take your word for it.

772
01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:30,120
Let's eat. We are hungry.

773
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,520
-Yes.
-Yes.

774
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,120
Dig in then.

775
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,240
Let's eat.

776
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,040
It seems they hate government officials

777
01:01:58,120 --> 01:02:00,120
because they take advantage of them.

778
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,360
Yes.

779
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:05,520
It makes the problem even worse.

780
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:10,600
There are good and bad people everywhere,

781
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,400
whether in France,

782
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,120
Thailand, or Viengphukhum.

783
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:17,440
What your country needs

784
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,840
are fair laws.

785
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,360
I'm going to fix this problem.

786
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,560
You could fix this problem
without hiding your identity.

787
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,640
The villagers wouldn't open up and discuss

788
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:34,440
their problems with me
if they knew my identity.

789
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,640
It's best that they think
I'm just another villager.

790
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:43,360
Please talk to me and treat me
like an ordinary person.

791
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,680
I told Sun to do the same.

792
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:50,280
But they might do
something disrespectful to you.

793
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:54,400
I agree with the prince.

794
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,440
The villagers
are sharing their experiences

795
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,560
and expressing their opinions.

796
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:03,160
It might seem somewhat impolite,

797
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:05,280
but they're not being unreasonable.

798
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,360
It's better than risking his safety
by revealing his identity,

799
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,120
as word might reach the rebels.

800
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,360
Khumpheng.

801
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:18,160
Give Elder Khumtai more of our food
before we leave tomorrow.

802
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,040
Yes, Your Highness.

803
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,960
I mean, sure.

804
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:35,800
May I speak with Laor?

805
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:43,600
Let's go.

806
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:51,960
Are you leaving tomorrow?

807
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:53,680
Where are you going?

808
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,560
I need to find the temple

809
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,720
so I can return Lord Naga Trinetr
his third eye.

810
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:05,280
I'm talking about the sapphire third eye
on the Ajna Chakra Necklace.

811
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:07,240
Does it really exist, Laor?

812
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,960
We found my great-grandpa's diary.

813
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:13,960
He created an intricate puzzle
to conceal the location of the temple.

814
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,120
We've solved half the puzzle already.

815
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:18,560
I'll come with you.

816
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,240
No.

817
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:25,440
I won't let you risk your life again.

818
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:27,720
Come on.

819
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:31,000
I told you I'm happy to help.

820
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,760
But I don't want your help, Sun.

821
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:40,040
I can't let anything happen to you again.

822
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,120
Do you have any idea

823
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:52,040
how devastated I was
when I thought you were dead?

824
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:02,280
I will be just as devastated

825
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,960
if you don't let me come with you.

826
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,480
Your vehicles won't reach Pailin.

827
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:25,880
What's the problem, Elder Khumtai?

828
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:27,520
Stop!

829
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,920
I need Sun on my team.

830
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,680
What are you hunting?

831
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,160
-A ghoul.
-What?

832
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:42,640
With you and Satarasamee dead,

833
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,240
we will be able to defy the royal law.

834
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,160
Queen Chanta!

835
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:33,240
