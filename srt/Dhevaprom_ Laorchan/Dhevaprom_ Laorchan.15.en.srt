1
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,280
There’s a chance…

2
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,200
that he could be Laorchan’s great-grandpa.

3
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,440
She vanished decades ago.

4
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,280
Why are you reopening old wounds?

5
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,440
Get out!

6
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,240
What caused him to go into shock?

7
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,120
A strange woman suddenly showed up

8
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,400
and claimed to be a Dhevaprom.

9
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,600
From now on,

10
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,640
you won't be alone anymore.

11
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,320
Whether or not you are a Dhevaprom,

12
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,000
or whether or not
they welcome you into the family,

13
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,960
I will always be here for you.

14
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,880
Okay.

15
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,000
All right.

16
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,120
Let's go.

17
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,400
Excuse me. How's the patient doing?

18
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,720
His blood pressure is normal,

19
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,400
but he still has a slight fever.

20
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,440
Please call a nurse
if you need anything else.

21
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,920
Thank you so much.

22
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,440
-Please excuse us.
-Thank you.

23
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,520
Are you sure you can
take care of him on your own?

24
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,960
I'm sure.

25
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,080
Thank you so much

26
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,760
for bringing my clothes.

27
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,440
You should go home and rest.

28
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,080
All right.

29
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,880
Okay.

30
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,080
I'll come and check on you
tomorrow morning.

31
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,360
My darling.

32
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
Goodnight.

33
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,200
Goodnight.

34
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,680
You're burning up.

35
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,960
Water.

36
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,080
Can you get me some water?

37
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,560
Here you go, sir.

38
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Drink slowly.

39
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,040
So…

40
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,480
Where is the rest of my family?

41
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,200
Ms. Ked is sick.

42
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,280
Other than Ms. Sineenuch

43
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,920
and Ms. Woranuch,

44
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,760
no one knows you are here.

45
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,760
So

46
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,160
I told Ms. Ked

47
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,200
that I would stay with you.

48
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,960
That's enough.

49
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,720
You can go.

50
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,360
I want to be alone.

51
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,720
All right.

52
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,720
Wait.

53
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,840
Yes?

54
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,880
I…

55
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,520
I'm cold.

56
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,240
Turn up the temperature.

57
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,320
I'm still cold.

58
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,280
Turn it up more.

59
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,040
Yes, sir.

60
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,160
Yes?

61
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,480
It's hot.

62
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,720
I'm hot. Turn down the temperature.

63
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,120
Yes, sir.

64
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,280
Turn it down more.

65
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,000
How can I sleep if I'm sweating?

66
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,480
Okay.

67
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,760
Is this okay?

68
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,960
Yes.

69
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,520
This is good.

70
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,320
The temperature is 24 degrees Celsius.

71
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,640
It's what it was in the first place.

72
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,960
So this isn't too cold for you?

73
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,799
I'm good now.

74
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,880
You can go.

75
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,600
Okay.

76
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,720
Wait.

77
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
Well…

78
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,400
Can you pull the blanket

79
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,000
over my chest?

80
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,160
Right.

81
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,920
Higher.

82
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,440
Sure.

83
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,080
A little higher.

84
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,440
There you go.

85
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,600
Please excuse me.

86
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,040
Wait.

87
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,320
Don't go yet.

88
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,280
So

89
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,920
is the room too hot or too cold?

90
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,480
Do you want a blanket or not?

91
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,120
I need to use

92
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,760
the bathroom.

93
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,880
Can you take me?

94
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,600
Sure.

95
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,520
Come on.

96
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,560
-Get up slowly.
-All right.

97
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,240
I can't lift my leg.

98
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,840
Okay.

99
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,560
Excuse me.

100
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,640
Be careful.

101
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,320
What's your name?

102
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,600
Laor.

103
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Laorchan.

104
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,240
Let's go.

105
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,640
Okay.

106
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,200
Watch your step.

107
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,520
Right.

108
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,640
Okay.

109
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,960
Good morning, sir.

110
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,880
You look well.

111
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:41,720
Let's start this beautiful morning
with some little activities.

112
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,320
First of all,

113
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,960
you have to wash your face
and brush your teeth.

114
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,680
I've prepared everything
that you might need.

115
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,000
After that,

116
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,720
you need to have breakfast

117
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,200
and take your medicine.

118
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,680
You have to finish doing
everything by 8:15 a.m.,

119
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,120
before the doctor comes

120
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,280
to examine you at 8:30 a.m.

121
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,720
Hold on.

122
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,880
I don't like

123
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,600
being told what to do.

124
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,720
Right.

125
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,880
Mr. Dhevapan.

126
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,680
You want to be able
to go home soon, don't you?

127
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,280
Therefore,

128
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,960
you have to show the doctor

129
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,560
that you're healthy

130
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,600
and that you can carry out
your daily routine by yourself.

131
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,160
Come on. Let me help.

132
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,520
I'll take you to the bathroom.

133
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,880
Let me help.

134
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,520
Please get up, sir.

135
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
If you want to go home soon,

136
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,240
you have to recover fast.

137
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,160
Give me a smile.

138
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,680
This is such a beautiful morning.

139
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,680
Come on. Let's go.

140
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,040
Walk slowly.

141
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,080
Now that I think of it,

142
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,520
we should've volunteered
to stay with your grandpa

143
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,960
instead of letting
Ked takes all the credit.

144
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,000
Old people just sit around all day.

145
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,040
How hard could it be to take care of him?

146
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,360
You're right, Mom.

147
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,640
Look, Mom. That's Aunt Ked over there.

148
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,680
Hello, Aunt Ked.

149
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,320
-Hello.
-Good morning.

150
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,320
How is Grandpa doing?

151
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,040
If I hadn't had to work yesterday,

152
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,760
I would've volunteered to stay with him

153
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,600
so you could rest,

154
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,920
instead of having to stay up all night.

155
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,280
Is he doing better now?

156
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,920
Yes.

157
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,880
You must be exhausted.

158
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,360
I'm not actually.

159
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,640
After you two left yesterday,

160
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,520
I had a dizzy spell and fainted.

161
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,320
I had to be admitted last night.

162
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,840
I stayed in the room next to Dad's.

163
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,120
So the person who had to stay
and watch him all night was Laorchan.

164
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,360
What?

165
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,800
-Laorchan?
-Laorchan?

166
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,400
Here's your breakfast, sir.

167
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,560
I'm not hungry.

168
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,480
Please have some, sir.

169
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,480
Come on. Let me help you.

170
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,880
Here.

171
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,600
I told you.

172
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,800
I'm not hungry.

173
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,880
Sir.

174
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,280
You were born into a noble
and well-educated family.

175
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,480
I think you're aware that

176
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,400
farmers work very hard

177
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,440
in order to harvest

178
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,440
each grain of rice.

179
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,040
Have you ever seen farmers grow rice?

180
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,880
Or do you spend
all your time in the palace,

181
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:18,960
so you don't know the hardship
that others have to endure?

182
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,400
Please forgive me.

183
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,040
I'm not sure

184
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,120
if others have ever been frank
with you about your behavior.

185
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,000
I think the problem isn't about

186
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,320
emotional maturity.

187
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,680
This is about

188
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,360
a display of good manners

189
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,600
towards those around you.

190
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,160
Are you criticizing me?

191
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,920
I'm not criticizing you.

192
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,400
I'm just pointing things out to you.

193
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,080
If you act unreasonably

194
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,640
and refuse to listen to others,

195
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,560
what will your family think of you?

196
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,720
Where did Aunt Jaithip find that musician

197
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,960
that she ran away with?

198
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,640
What sort of family was he from?

199
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,560
Didn't they teach their grandchildren

200
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,320
not to be insolent with adults like this?

201
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,320
Hello, Grandpa.

202
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,640
Hi, Uncle.

203
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,320
You look so full of energy today.

204
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,240
-Right, Mom?
-Yes.

205
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,160
Laorchan, thank you so much

206
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,160
for looking after Dad for me

207
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,560
all night.

208
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,480
You're welcome.

209
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,920
She's not even family.

210
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,720
What a nerve, offering to look after him.

211
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,880
I was the one

212
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,320
who asked Laorchan to stay with him.

213
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,240
Well, then.

214
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,120
Your help is appreciated.

215
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,480
Your job is done.

216
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,920
You can leave now.

217
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,320
Go on.

218
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,800
This is family only.

219
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:05,440
Leave us be.

220
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:07,560
That's right.

221
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,280
Well, I'll get going then.

222
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,720
Sir.

223
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,880
Enjoy your breakfast.

224
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,160
She didn't do a very good job.

225
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,560
-Look at this. This is a mess.
-It's fine, dear.

226
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,760
I'll clean it up.

227
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,520
Can you get me a tissue?

228
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
All right.

229
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,720
-Let me help.
-Thank you so much.

230
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,840
How dare you show your face here again?

231
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,320
You really want people to believe

232
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,600
that you are related
to Jaithip, don't you?

233
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,320
Even if you are,
what difference does it make?

234
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,720
The Dhevaproms haven't heard
from her for decades.

235
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,840
The family searched
for her in all 71 provinces

236
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,080
but never found her.

237
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:15,960
Honey.

238
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,800
There are 72 provinces.

239
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,880
That's what I meant.

240
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,480
It's been decades.

241
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,920
What do you expect from us?

242
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,560
What she did was mortifying.

243
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,120
It was unacceptable.

244
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,640
If you really are her granddaughter,

245
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,360
let me tell you right now

246
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,440
that the Dhevaproms

247
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,840
were humiliated
after she ran away with that man.

248
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,920
I apologize.

249
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,200
But I have no idea

250
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,800
where Great-Grandma Jaithip is
or what she's doing.

251
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,480
I'm not here as her grandchild.

252
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,240
I'm here as Fuangphet's
great-granddaughter.

253
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,960
Who is that?

254
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,800
Mr. Dhevapan, may I take up
some of your time to discuss

255
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,440
an important matter with you?

256
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,320
Please.

257
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,120
Ignore her, Grandpa.

258
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,160
Let's go back to the palace.

259
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,120
Let's go.

260
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,560
-Come on.
-Let's go, Aunt Ked.

261
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,400
-Come on.
-In that case,

262
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,040
can I follow you
to the palace to talk about this?

263
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,280
Don't keep me waiting.

264
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,080
We'll be right there.

265
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,360
Let's go.

266
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,440
Unbelievable.

267
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,960
Princess Fuangphet?

268
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,640
Who is she?

269
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,080
Not in my generation,

270
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,960
my dad's,

271
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,160
my grandpa's,

272
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,640
or my great-grandpa's,

273
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,960
is there anyone that I know of

274
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,000
named Fuangphet.

275
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,600
My great-grandma

276
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,680
was the daughter of Phra Boribanphuthorn,

277
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,400
who was a government officer in Nong Khai.

278
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,200
Nong Khai?

279
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,080
That's several hundred kilometers
away from Bangkok.

280
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,720
How could your great-grandma

281
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
be related to the Dhevaproms?

282
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,840
Your great-grandpa

283
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:40,040
traveled to Nong Khai
and met my great-grandma there.

284
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,640
What do you mean?

285
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,960
Great-Grandpa Chakkarin

286
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,680
accompanied His Royal Highness

287
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,600
Prince Prajaksilpakom

288
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,120
to Nong Khai

289
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,520
in 1909.

290
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:57,760
Isn't that right?

291
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,760
You were probably
around 11 years old back then.

292
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,560
You should have some memory of it.

293
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,640
How do you know

294
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,520
so much about this, Phu?

295
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,120
Where did you hear about it?

296
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,640
In this letter.

297
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,920
Great-Grandma Fuangphet

298
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,160
wrote this letter herself.

299
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,160
MY DEAR SON PEERAPONG

300
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,120
I FIRST MET YOUR DAD…

301
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,120
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT OUR LOVE
WOULD CAUSE SUCH TROUBLE

302
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,080
Well…

303
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:56,960
Gosh.

304
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,960
Is this all you have?

305
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,640
Is this what makes you think
you can claim to be a Dhevaprom?

306
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,880
No one would just accept

307
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,360
that you're their flesh and blood

308
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,640
based on a few words

309
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,360
from a letter

310
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,560
that you don't even know

311
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,760
is genuine or not.

312
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,960
The contents of this letter

313
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,760
could be all lies.

314
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,760
But you don't deny

315
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,120
that Prince Chakkarin

316
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,720
went to look for his sister in Nong Khai.

317
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,600
My dad might've gone there,

318
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,840
but how dare you invent a relationship
between my dad

319
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,160
and your great-grandma.

320
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,680
Is it because you know

321
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,320
that my dad was of royal descent?

322
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,400
Is that why you made up this lie?

323
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,600
You know full well

324
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,320
that I'm not lying.

325
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,880
Why don't you finish the letter?

326
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,600
This isn't the only letter.

327
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,000
There are three more letters

328
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,960
that my great-grandma

329
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,960
wrote to Prince Chakkarin
and sent to this palace.

330
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,080
Why don't you finish the letter?

331
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,200
I won't.

332
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,280
My dad and my mom

333
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,360
loved each other

334
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,360
more than any couple I've ever known.

335
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,840
Who are you

336
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,960
to come here

337
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,400
and claim that you're related to us
in the palace?

338
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,320
Have you no shame?

339
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,720
Don't you think that,

340
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,160
by digging into this,

341
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,560
you're disgracing your great-grandma?

342
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,880
You're telling everyone

343
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,800
that she was my dad's mistress,

344
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,240
which is not true at all.

345
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,320
Dad, I don't think
that is Laorchan's intention.

346
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,360
Why don't you finish this letter?

347
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,240
I won't read it.

348
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,120
Don't ever bring this up again.

349
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,440
I don't want to hear it.

350
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,960
Don't you dare

351
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,480
step foot in this palace again.

352
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,080
You're not welcome here.

353
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,880
The thing about M.R. Dhevapan is,

354
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,320
he has a short temper.

355
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,160
Besides, he just got out of hospital.

356
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,240
Maybe he hasn't recovered fully yet,

357
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,600
so he might get easily frustrated.

358
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:44,240
Please don't take it personally, Laor.

359
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,480
I'm not mad at him.

360
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,800
I just feel like I failed
before I could even try.

361
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,600
He's already rejected

362
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,800
and shunned me.

363
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,800
Maybe

364
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,920
he was scared of the truth,

365
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,120
so he avoided it

366
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,040
by not reading the letter.

367
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,120
You mean he didn't want to accept that

368
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,680
his dad had an affair with another woman?

369
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,520
I'm sorry, Laor.

370
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,760
I'm just saying what he might think.

371
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,080
I don't think he was in denial.

372
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,480
He was probably in shock

373
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,120
and didn't know how to react.

374
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,560
Perhaps he wasn't aware

375
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,960
that his dad was involved
with any women besides his mom.

376
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,320
If we want Mr. Dhevapan
to accept the truth,

377
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,040
we have to find out
whether the other three letters

378
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,320
that your great-grandma wrote

379
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,040
really exist or not.

380
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,560
Come on, Dad.

381
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,640
He didn't even finish the letter
that Laor showed him.

382
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,760
Even if we manage
to find the other three letters,

383
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,920
he might refuse to read them

384
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,640
if he doesn't want to accept the truth.

385
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,120
I won't give up.

386
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,480
I will prove to the Dhevaprom family

387
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,680
and make them all see

388
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,040
that Princess Fuangphet
had honor and dignity.

389
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,200
I won't let the Dhevaproms

390
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,400
say otherwise about her.

391
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,880
That woman

392
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,840
has written three letters to Chakkarin.

393
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,520
I don't want to worry you,

394
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,080
but she won't stop writing to him.

395
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,920
I feel terrible, Mom.

396
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,560
I can hardly bear it.

397
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,960
So I brought the letters for you to read.

398
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,120
When Chakkarin returns from Korat,
I'll have a word with him.

399
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,800
Lady Jaithip

400
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,320
already caused a scandal
when she eloped with a man.

401
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,400
We can't afford another scandal

402
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,920
about Chakkarin's affair
with another woman.

403
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,600
I will not allow

404
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,520
this abomination to happen.

405
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,520
You should focus on taking care
of Dhevapan and Anupan.

406
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,680
Act like nothing happened.

407
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,720
Don't let your kids see you cry.

408
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,320
Don't let them find out

409
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,840
there's something bad going on.

410
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,680
I will take care of this for you.

411
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,240
Dad, you should eat something.

412
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,000
I made you porridge.

413
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
Here.

414
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,240
Dad.

415
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,240
Please eat some food
so you can take your medicine.

416
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Gosh.

417
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,800
No.

418
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,520
I don't want it.

419
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,040
I'm full.

420
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,200
Where are you going?

421
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,840
I'm going to bed.

422
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,960
Okay.

423
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,320
My goodness. That smells so nice.
Everything looks delicious.

424
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,920
I'm so hungry I could eat a horse.

425
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,040
We can't eat yet.

426
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
We should wait for Saruj.

427
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,960
He's probably getting dressed.

428
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,880
I'm here.

429
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,400
I was waiting

430
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,560
for this pretty lady
to finish getting ready.

431
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,480
Hello, Great-Grandma.

432
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,360
Hi, everyone.

433
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,040
Well, Laor?

434
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,960
Did you go to Dhevaprom Palace?

435
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,760
CHAKKARIN

436
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,400
DEAR MY BELOVED CHAK

437
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,160
Dear my beloved Chak.

438
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,600
It's been over a month
since I last saw you.

439
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,640
Where are you right now?

440
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,320
How is life treating you?

441
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,960
Have you found Ms. Jaithip yet?

442
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,560
Have you taken her back to Bangkok?

443
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,240
I hope that

444
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,760
you won't forget the promise
you made to me

445
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,280
that you would come back to me

446
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,800
and that tell my dad about us.

447
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,920
I'm still waiting for that day to come.

448
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,720
The ring you gave me

449
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,920
has not left my finger.

450
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,960
I love you with all my heart.

451
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,720
Fuangphet.

452
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,080
I have something important to tell you.

453
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,920
My dad wants me to marry Prince Siwilai.

454
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:51,320
He's the brother
of the King of Viengphukhum.

455
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,720
I feel so troubled.

456
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,960
I want you to come to Nong Khai

457
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,760
and tell my dad about our relationship.

458
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,640
I believe that he will show us kindness.

459
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,280
I love you with every breath I take.

460
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,520
Fuangphet.

461
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,760
Where are you, Chak?

462
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,400
I'm counting the days
until I can see you again.

463
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,840
My wedding with Prince Siwilai

464
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,200
is fast approaching.

465
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,200
I'm dying to see you

466
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,560
as I have good news to tell you.

467
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,360
I'm three months pregnant.

468
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,680
I cannot keep our relationship
from my dad anymore.

469
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,400
I will come to Bangkok

470
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,960
so we can talk and figure out
what to do together.

471
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,000
I look forward to seeing you
with every breath I take.

472
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,240
Fuangphet.

473
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,240
If we can't get

474
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,880
Mr. Dhevapan to read the letter,

475
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,280
we'll have to find another way.

476
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,440
The only other thing we have to show him

477
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,040
is the ring

478
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,400
that Chakkarin gave to Princess Fuangphet.

479
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,639
I see.

480
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,880
Laor.

481
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,239
Do you have the ring with you?

482
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,440
Yes. I always carry it with me.

483
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,719
Let me have a look.

484
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,639
This ring.

485
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,360
It looks like the one Eied had.

486
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,639
She had it made
together with Lady Janchai,

487
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,600
Chakkarin's mom.

488
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,800
The rings were made by the same jeweler.

489
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,760
Both ladies intended

490
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,680
to give the rings

491
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,640
to the eldest son
of their respective families.

492
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,240
The ring belonging to the Jutatheps

493
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:11,240
had the initials WC.

494
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,920
engraved on it.

495
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,800
It stands for M.J. Wichakorn.

496
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,560
If this ring belonged to Lady Janchai,

497
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,760
it should have the initials
CK engraved on it,

498
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,360
which stands for Chakkarin.

499
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,560
May I have a look?

500
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,720
CK

501
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,440
It has the initials CK on it.

502
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,040
Can I see it?

503
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,720
You're right.

504
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,800
This is it.

505
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,920
Let me see.

506
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,080
I know now

507
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,520
why I thought

508
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,720
you looked so familiar
the first time we met.

509
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,040
It's because I've seen
someone who looked just like you.

510
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,560
Gosh. Why are you back here, Laorchan?

511
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,080
Grandpa already said
you're not welcome here,

512
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,000
yet you still have the cheek to come back.

513
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,000
You're utterly shameless.

514
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,440
She's right, Phu.

515
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,080
What's the deal here?

516
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,320
What makes you so sure that this woman

517
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,880
is related to the Dhevaproms?

518
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,880
This ring.

519
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,680
Have you seen this ring before, sir?

520
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,400
It belonged to Prince Chakkarin.

521
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,400
Dad.

522
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,520
This ring is a family heirloom.

523
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,600
I had it made specially for you.

524
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,040
Wear it on your travels.

525
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,320
It will keep you safe.

526
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,800
Good luck, dear.

527
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,960
Find your sister and bring her home.

528
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,240
Yes, Mom.

529
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,080
I wish you luck, sweetheart.

530
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,640
I'll look after our kids.

531
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,200
Don't worry about them.

532
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,160
I'll take very good care of them.

533
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,520
I promise that I'll be good at school.

534
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,320
Come here, son.

535
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,440
Behave yourself while I'm away.

536
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,080
-Okay.
-Be good.

537
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,840
All right.

538
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,720
Is it nice?

539
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,240
It is.

540
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,640
Someday in the future,

541
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,080
this ring will be yours.

542
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,080
No.

543
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,800
I've never seen it.

544
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,680
My dad never wore this ring.

545
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,760
You really are

546
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,800
one hell of a schemer.

547
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,680
You made up all these stories.

548
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,360
Not only the letter,

549
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,440
but also the ring.

550
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,680
Did Princess Fuangphet even exist?

551
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,200
No one ever saw her.

552
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,240
I did.

553
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,200
I can confirm

554
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,200
that Princess Fuangphet

555
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,440
really existed.

556
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,440
Auntie.

557
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,480
It has been a while.

558
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,160
Are you doing well?

559
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,440
Yes.

560
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,480
I'm well enough

561
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,880
to come here today
and tell everyone the truth.

562
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,320
The truth?

563
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,480
What truth?

564
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,400
The truth that

565
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,480
Princess Fuangphet,

566
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,320
Laorchan's great-grandma,

567
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,760
came here before.

568
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,120
Gosh.

569
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:04,960
So it's you.

570
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,280
Are you Fuangphet?

571
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,040
You're a beautiful woman.

572
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,760
That's me.

573
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,720
Well…

574
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,920
I'm here to see Chak.

575
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,840
I know from his address

576
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,600
that he lives here.

577
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,080
This is Dhevaprom Palace.

578
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,960
Right.

579
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,120
Do you know if Chak is home?

580
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,680
He's not home.

581
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,160
Do you know

582
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,680
what time he will be back?

583
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,080
It's just that

584
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,240
I have an urgent matter
to discuss with him.

585
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,560
Is it all right

586
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,080
if I wait for him here?

587
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,240
How dare you come here
and ask to wait for him?

588
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,200
You have no right whatsoever over him.

589
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,600
What do you mean?

590
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,720
Gosh.

591
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,200
How funny.

592
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,040
You're just a naive girl

593
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,640
with a pretty face.

594
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,640
Yet you look worthless.

595
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,120
You threw yourself
at a man without even asking him

596
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,200
whether he had a wife and kids.

597
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,680
What did you say?

598
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,280
I'm Lady Ploy.

599
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,960
Prince Chakkarin Dhevaprom and I

600
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,160
are legally married as husband and wife.

601
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,760
Prince Chakkarin?

602
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,640
That's impossible.

603
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,720
Chak never said anything.

604
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,920
He never once mentioned

605
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,760
that he's married.

606
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,560
He and I love each other.

607
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,080
And now,

608
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,720
I'm carrying his child.

609
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,960
You're just a whore

610
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,800
who wants to steal my husband from me.

611
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,840
So you chose to turn a blind eye
and ignore the truth.

612
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,160
Let me tell you something.

613
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,040
There's no way that I will let Chak

614
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,200
be with someone like you.

615
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,360
Chak's mom also knows about you.

616
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,840
She's very displeased
with the three letters

617
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,240
that you shamelessly wrote to her son.

618
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,720
His mom

619
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,960
would never allow

620
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,520
her son

621
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,000
to have an affair
with some bumpkin like you.

622
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:24,960
That's not true.

623
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,320
I don't believe you.

624
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,760
I need to hear this from Chak himself.

625
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,880
You foolish girl.

626
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,200
You dare talk back to me
when you're just a mistress?

627
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,000
If Chak really loved you,

628
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,280
why didn't he go back to you?

629
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,160
How come he didn't write to you

630
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,120
after you sent him those three letters?

631
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,720
Let me tell you something.

632
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,640
You should go home and take a long bath

633
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,600
to clean yourself up.

634
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,520
It might help wash off
the foul smell of trash.

635
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,040
Then you can go fool a new man

636
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,640
with your innocent act.

637
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,840
One more thing.

638
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,240
Don't forget to ask him this time

639
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,000
whether he's married or not.

640
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,840
Dhevapan.

641
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,960
Come here, dear.

642
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:23,640
Yes, Mom.

643
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,440
This is my eldest son.

644
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,360
M.R. Dhevapan Dhevaprom.

645
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,640
This woman wants to know

646
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,360
what your dad's name is.

647
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,600
It's Prince Chakkarin Dhevaprom.

648
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,680
Are you here

649
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,720
to see someone?

650
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,600
She's looking for her man.

651
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,280
But he isn't here.

652
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,240
Go and play, dear.

653
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,280
Yes, Mom.

654
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:07,920
Salee.

655
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,560
Don't forget to disinfect the driveway
once you see our guest off.

656
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,120
Not long after that,

657
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,320
I learned that

658
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,480
Prince Chakkarin was involved
in a car accident

659
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,080
as he was traveling to Nong Khai.

660
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,800
He was severely injured.

661
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,520
The Dhevaprom family was busy nursing him.

662
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,440
Then when he passed away,

663
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,600
we were all busy with the funeral.

664
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:42,120
In the end,

665
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:45,080
everyone forgot about that woman.

666
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,880
I had also forgotten about her.

667
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,360
When Laorchan came
to see me the first time,

668
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,280
it jogged my memory

669
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,520
because she looked

670
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,560
exactly like Princess Fuangphet.

671
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,760
That's not true, is it?

672
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,880
Maybe it's because Great-Grandma Orn
is getting old,

673
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,640
so her memory is foggy.

674
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,600
It can't be true, right?

675
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,680
Though I love another woman,

676
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,120
it doesn't mean I love you

677
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,480
or your mom any less, Dhevapan.

678
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,400
When you grow up,

679
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,240
you'll understand
the difference between love

680
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,800
and propriety.

681
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,880
I married your mom

682
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,800
out of propriety,

683
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,640
not love.

684
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,920
Do you love that woman?

685
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,440
I'll tell you as a dad to son,

686
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,720
I love her.

687
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:50,920
What about Mom?

688
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,440
Your mom is the pride of our family.

689
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:00,560
She's a good mom to you

690
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,080
and a good wife to me.

691
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,560
She's my responsibility.

692
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,360
But…

693
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:11,200
I must also take responsibility
for that woman.

694
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,280
You may not understand it now.

695
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,280
When you grow up,

696
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,600
you'll know what I mean.

697
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:22,880
I'll be home soon.

698
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,240
Chakkarin.

699
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,360
Chakkarin.

700
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,200
You can't leave me and our kids like this.

701
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:51,800
Chakkarin.

702
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,760
She's already married
to a prince in Viengphukhum.

703
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,680
Why do you still care about her?

704
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,080
Chakkarin.

705
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,000
Chakkarin.

706
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,040
Grandpa.

707
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,440
This is all a lie, right?

708
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,000
You don't know
any of her relatives, do you?

709
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:17,440
Ying, stop pressing your grandpa.

710
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:19,280
He just got out of the hospital.

711
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,040
Then tell us, Grandpa.

712
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,840
Tell us that Great-Grandma Orn

713
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:24,880
just misunderstood things.

714
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,880
She's old.

715
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,240
Maybe she's going senile.

716
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,400
Don't disrespect Great-Grandma Orn, Ying.

717
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:34,240
Everything she said,

718
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,760
it's all true.

719
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,760
No!

720
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,160
I don't believe you!

721
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,760
You made this up, didn't you?

722
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:49,560
You found out that

723
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,760
Grandpa owns a plot of land
worth hundreds of millions of baht,

724
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,800
so you claimed to be a Dhevaprom

725
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,080
to get a share.

726
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:57,920
Hold on, Ying.

727
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,760
What land? What are you talking about?

728
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,360
The land in Hua Hin

729
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:04,600
that Uncle Dhevapan keeps a secret.

730
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:06,760
This girl found out about it

731
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,600
and wanted a share of the money.

732
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,320
Excuse me.

733
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,960
I know nothing about any land.

734
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:17,280
I just want M.R. Dhevapan
to accept my great-grandma

735
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,520
and accept that I'm a Dhevaprom.

736
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,000
That's all I want.

737
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:28,200
Enough of this bullshit.

738
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,480
I've known you for months now.

739
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,720
If you really are

740
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,440
related to the Dhevaproms,

741
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,560
why didn't you say so from the beginning?

742
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:38,240
Shut your mouth, Ying!

743
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:39,960
That's enough.

744
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,240
The truth is the truth.

745
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,760
Laorchan

746
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,280
is part of the Dhevaprom family.

747
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,800
My goodness. Dad.

748
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,120
Sineenuch.

749
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,680
You and Ying should leave.

750
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,640
Don't cause a scene right now.

751
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,680
Are you blaming me?

752
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,160
The person who caused all this trouble

753
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,720
and should be kicked out is that woman.

754
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,880
Can't you see my dad isn't feeling well?

755
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,560
Please leave.

756
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,640
Come on, Ying. Let's go home.

757
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,600
Dad.

758
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:34,640
Mr. Dhevapan.

759
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,520
Are you okay?

760
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:40,880
Ms. Ked.

761
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,840
Let's take him to see a doctor.

762
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,080
Dad, let me take you to the hospital.

763
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,000
There's no need.

764
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,720
I think

765
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:53,200
I feel better now.

766
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,440
I'm fine.

767
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,120
Dad.

768
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,440
Grandma Orn.

769
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,560
Chai Lek.

770
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,600
I must apologize for earlier.

771
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,760
It's all right, dear.

772
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,440
We're sorry as well

773
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,400
for making you and Mr. Dhevapan uneasy.

774
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,080
I'm okay.

775
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,480
Watch your step.

776
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,640
Okay.

777
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,880
All right.

778
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,920
Okay. All right.

779
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,960
Aren't you tired after spending
half the day out of the house?

780
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,120
Not at all.

781
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:49,000
I haven't seen you smile like this
in a long time.

782
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,200
Well, I'm truly happy.

783
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:54,800
The promise between the Dhevaproms

784
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,280
and the Jutatheps

785
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:00,480
seems likely to be fulfilled pretty soon.

786
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,160
I'm really happy that
this is happening while I'm still alive.

787
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,640
Your dad's generation couldn't do it,

788
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:11,440
but your generation
will finally make it happen.

789
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,400
I'm so happy
and relieved at the same time.

790
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,560
This is the happiest day of my life.

791
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:20,280
You have a good eye, Phu.

792
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,240
I'm very lucky

793
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,400
that I got to know Laor.

794
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,640
She's the one I would choose
to spend my life with,

795
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,280
regardless of her background.

796
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,800
Very well.

797
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:35,120
So it turns out that

798
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,680
Laorchan is a Dhevaprom.

799
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,160
I think you could call it…

800
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,160
What's the word in English?

801
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,080
A bonus, right?

802
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,000
Hey, Phu.

803
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:53,880
Have you asked her if she wants

804
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,360
to spend her life with you?

805
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,680
Goodness. There's no need for that.

806
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:03,720
Laorchan, let me welcome you

807
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,760
to the Jutathep family.

808
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,360
It's not just Great-Grandma.

809
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,080
Chai Lek and I are also happy
to have you as part of our family.

810
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:21,320
Right.

811
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,640
Phu.

812
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,080
Stop rubbing your ear.

813
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,880
Gosh.

814
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,040
Mom's teasing me.

815
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,960
She's a pretty girl.

816
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:43,640
She really is.

817
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,440
I'm so happy.

818
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,600
I'm really sorry, sir.

819
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,280
I'm sorry I dug up old memories

820
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,000
and caused you distress.

821
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,720
But I still maintain that

822
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,280
the reason I came to see you

823
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,040
was to find out the truth.

824
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,520
I wanted to clear the name

825
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,080
of Great-Grandma Fuangphet.

826
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,040
I don't want any money from you.

827
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,640
Gosh.

828
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,720
Though you're not asking for anything,

829
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,080
that piece of land in Hua Hin

830
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,480
should be yours anyway.

831
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:53,120
But that land

832
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,600
is our family's inheritance.

833
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,320
It should be split fairly

834
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,160
among everyone in the family.

835
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,920
That's right, Uncle.

836
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,800
We've paid a fortune
in maintenance fees for that land.

837
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,640
You can't just give the land to this girl.

838
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,520
Of course I can.

839
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,640
My dad left a will

840
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:18,840
which bequeathed that piece of land

841
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,960
to his heir

842
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,320
who was born to Princess Fuangphet

843
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,440
and that heir was Prince Peerapong.

844
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,840
The land now belongs to

845
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,040
the only remaining heir
of Prince Peerapong.

846
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,480
That's Laorchan.

847
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:38,600
Does this mean

848
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,840
Laor will become a multimillionaire?

849
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,520
But I insist, sir.

850
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,840
I do not wish to take that land

851
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:51,440
as my own personal property.

852
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,160
What?

853
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,720
Why not, dear?

854
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:58,840
That piece of land

855
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,320
belongs to everyone
in the Dhevaprom family.

856
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,680
They all have a right to it.

857
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,760
I think the fairest way
to handle this is to split the land

858
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,760
among the Dhevaprom grandchildren.

859
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,680
Good. Let's split it then.

860
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,560
The Dhevaprom grandchildren

861
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:17,640
are myself,

862
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,240
Chavit,

863
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,600
Chalisa,

864
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:21,960
and Cheeva.

865
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,560
That's five including you.

866
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,640
If we divide 30 rai by 5,

867
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,280
we'll get 6 rai each.

868
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,040
Come on, Ying.

869
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,520
That's not right.

870
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,320
You have to include the children
of Aunt Maratee and Aunt Vilairumpa.

871
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:39,920
We still don't know

872
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,280
how many children those two have.

873
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:43,920
And let's not forget

874
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,240
Grandma Jaitip.

875
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,640
We don't know

876
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,440
how many grandchildren she has.

877
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,120
Come on, Aunt Ked.

878
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,120
They have been gone for almost 30 years.

879
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,600
No one has heard from them.

880
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:02,040
I think we can assume they are missing.

881
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,720
So why waste time
waiting for them to come back?

882
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,720
We have to wait,
even if they stay missing.

883
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:12,240
We have no solid proof

884
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:14,960
whether either of them is still alive

885
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,600
or whether they're missing.

886
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:18,760
Am I right?

887
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,760
But someone has already
contacted me to buy that land.

888
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,640
We might lose money

889
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,120
if we keep stalling and they call off
the project to build a condo

890
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,440
and a waterpark there.

891
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,960
Does anyone in the family
need money urgently?

892
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,480
If not,

893
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:41,200
I'll decide what we'll do with the land

894
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,120
since I'm the only heir
of Grandpa Peerapong.

895
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,080
Let's split the land fairly as we agreed.

896
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,400
If there's nothing else,

897
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:52,880
please excuse me.

898
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,840
Mr. Dhevapan.

899
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,520
Wait. Hang on a second.

900
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,320
There's one more thing.

901
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,040
Come a bit closer.

902
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,560
You're a Dhevaprom.

903
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,480
We are family now.

904
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,360
You shouldn't call me

905
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:28,320
Mr. Dhevapan anymore.

906
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,960
Call me Grandpa.

907
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,920
And call me Aunt Ked.

908
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,120
Thank you so much.

909
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,040
Grandpa.

910
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:04,920
Aunt Ked.

911
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,240
Thank you for accepting me.

912
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,120
You were right, Phu.

913
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,840
The first person to complete the mission

914
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,240
was you.

915
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,040
Gosh.

916
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,600
Let's give him a round of applause.

917
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,280
So when's the wedding?

918
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:42,160
We're all ready to join you
in the groom's procession.

919
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,040
You should hurry
before Laor changes her mind.

920
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:48,840
I personally want to marry Laor
as soon as possible,

921
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,280
but I need to ask her
when she will be ready.

922
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,600
Goodness.

923
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:57,400
Time and tide wait for no man, Phu.

924
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:00,480
Just propose to her and get married.

925
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:06,840
I can't wait to see the Dhevaproms
and the Jutatheps become one family.

926
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:10,360
Be patient, Great-Grandma.

927
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,840
How did you get up here anyway?

928
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,160
I have no idea.

929
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:18,240
Jaew didn't help me.

930
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,200
How did I get up here?

931
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,440
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

932
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:24,400
Thank you.

933
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,600
Thank you, dear. All right.

934
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:34,080
Do you want a grandchild
born to a Dhevaprom that badly?

935
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,840
That's right.

936
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:38,720
All your dads

937
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,080
got my hopes up
and let me down so many times.

938
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,880
Goodness.

939
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:47,520
I'm really happy
that this day has finally come.

940
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,280
Thank you so much, Phu.

941
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:54,080
You've made an old lady very happy.

942
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,160
Goodness.

943
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,400
I'm glad that you're happy.

944
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,880
-All right.
-I love you.

945
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,400
I love you too.

946
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,360
Don't hog all the attention, Phu.

947
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,200
-What?
-I love you too.

948
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:10,280
-All right.
-I love you too, Great-Grandma.

949
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,640
I love you too.

950
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,080
We all love you.

951
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,920
I love all of you too.

952
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:17,840
I love you all equally,
so there's no need to fight.

953
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,280
I made you some snacks.

954
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,720
I'll have this one.

955
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,560
Do you want this one? Okay.

956
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,960
Doctor, she can't eat sweets.

957
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,120
I forgot.

958
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,840
Can't I have just one?

959
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,160
-You call yourself a doctor?
-Let me have one.

960
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,000
I'll have one tiny piece.

961
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,520
No, Great-Grandma.

962
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,760
-Way to go, doctor.
-Come on.

963
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,720
You teased me, Chat.

964
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,080
You made me want it,
then you took it away.

965
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,440
How are you feeling?

966
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,720
Do you feel better?

967
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,160
Yes.

968
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,800
I got to fulfill my duty to my family.

969
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,520
It didn't go as I expected,

970
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,960
but everything happened for a reason.

971
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,080
I'll make the most
of the time that I have.

972
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,960
And you'll always have me

973
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,160
every second of your life

974
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,600
until the very last moment.

975
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:49,120
You're as crazy in love as ever.

976
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,240
Well…

977
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,080
I'm not crazy.

978
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,240
I'm consistently in love with you.

979
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,080
Great-Grandma asked me

980
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,720
when we're getting married.

981
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,520
You have to propose first

982
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:08,920
in order to answer her question.

983
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,200
Wait.

984
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,080
Are you serious, Laor?

985
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,600
Well…

986
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,640
Mr. Phu.

987
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,880
You have proven to me

988
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,720
that I'm the luckiest girl

989
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,040
for having you by my side.

990
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,440
Your words and your actions

991
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,800
show me that I can trust you.

992
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,760
Thank you so much

993
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:43,000
for making me feel like
the luckiest girl in the world.

994
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,440
Well, then.

995
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:00,040
Will you be my first love

996
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,040
and my only love,

997
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,000
Laorchan?

998
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,400
Yes.

999
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,360
This means I'll get to say goodnight
to you every night.

1000
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:21,400
Yes.

1001
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,520
Phu.

1002
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,040
What is it, Chat?

1003
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:42,400
Can we go yet? I'm bored.

1004
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:44,760
It will be dark before we get to Bangkok.

1005
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:47,240
Are you in a hurry to go looking for love?

1006
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:48,680
Just take it easy.

1007
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,360
I'm focusing on work right now.

1008
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,440
The right person will come along
at the right time.

1009
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:57,880
Isn't that right, Laor?

1010
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:00,440
Right.

1011
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,840
Take us for example.

1012
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:05,240
We managed to find each other.

1013
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,080
If you're in that much of a hurry,

1014
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,040
you can drive.

1015
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,280
No.

1016
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:20,720
I want to take a nap.

1017
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,320
Gosh.

1018
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,120
A guy like Chat

1019
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,000
needs a strong and tough woman

1020
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,160
to keep him in check.

1021
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:31,680
You're right.

1022
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,640
I can't wait to see who he'll end up with.

1023
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,840
Were you talking about me?

1024
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,480
No, I didn't say anything.

1025
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,560
Gosh.

1026
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,160
Goodness.

1027
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,920
Mr. Phu.

1028
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,200
Get in the car, baby.

1029
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,520
Wait for me.

1030
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:08,920
THE END

1031
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Just go already.

1032
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:12,080
Be patient, Chat.

1033
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:21,600
LAORCHAN

1034
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:27,720
