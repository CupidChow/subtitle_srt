1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll never let go after we part

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You are me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You are me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You are me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You are me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You are me

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Episode 12

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Stand By me

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
事情非常不 kneeling

10
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Ju Deng Deng

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I am taking out manpower from our sandwich

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Do you know that?

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You will see

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,640
Go.

15
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,000
Who allowed you to be here?

16
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,840
I heard you have a toothache.

17
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,920
So I brought you some medicine.

18
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:48,140
The

19
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,640
Yu Deng Deng, please wake up.

20
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,680
She just tried to kill you.

21
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,240
Don't be unfaithful to you

22
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,040
for a little favor.

23
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,080
That's your biggest flaw.

24
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,700
It's no big deal.

25
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,480
You need to sleep.

26
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,920
But sometimes,

27
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,080
I can't get it back.

28
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,160
You are a mystery that can't be solved with your life.

29
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:19,320
I can't find the answer.

30
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,480
It's in my heart.

31
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,320
I don't know if every word is about you.

32
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,400
It's been ten thousand years.

33
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Say I love you.

34
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,400
Uncle Wu, how is it?

35
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,040
How is it?

36
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,760
Did you forget that man?

37
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,880
He's not a fish.

38
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,680
How could he forget someone so quickly?

39
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:55,080
But don't worry.

40
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,560
I've made friends with him.

41
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,600
I've had a fight with him.

42
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,800
I should be in a good mood.

43
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,440
I didn't expect you to be so reliable.

44
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,320
I was so worried about you.

45
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,400
I didn't expect you to find the right person.

46
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,480
No, no, no.

47
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,560
Don't get excited.

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,520
I mean I always think you are very reliable.

49
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,520
I'm going to ask you for a favor.

50
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,160
Well, stay here a little longer.

51
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,240
Let master forget that man completely.

52
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,640
What are you talking about?

53
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,840
What time is it now?

54
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,360
Besides, it's late at night.

55
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,440
What if a man

56
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,960
is watching the boat

57
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,560
in a girl's room?

58
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,240
I'm fine.

59
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,120
It's okay.

60
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,200
It's just a man.

61
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,160
What about him?

62
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,480
He's a girl.

63
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,600
He's not good at being famous.

64
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,240
Why are you looking at me?

65
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,760
I didn't expect that.

66
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,000
Master Wu, you are really

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,480
a man of honor and honor.

68
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,640
Well, I'll cut the crap.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,560
I, Peng Da Hai, will

70
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,760
support you from now on.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,560
Well,

72
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,040
I'll call you

73
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,080
whenever my master needs me.

74
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,800
Let me know if he needs anything.

75
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,320
Okay.

76
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,120
Let's go.

77
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,720
Let's go.

78
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,120
I didn't expect that.

79
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,720
It's really good.

80
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,640
I heard that you have a toothache.

81
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,000
So,

82
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,760
I brought you some medicine.

83
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,840
Master.

84
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,520
Master.

85
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,240
Master told you to come here.

86
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,200
What's the matter?

87
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,000
What's the matter?

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,680
I don't know.

89
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,880
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,360
Here.

91
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,080
What's this?

92
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,200
Keep it. Don't waste it.

93
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
Give it to your brothers.

94
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,160
What's this?

95
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,840
Is it edible?

96
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,240
Master.

97
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,680
Master.

98
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,400
Why are you smoking again?

99
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,680
Your father is missing.

100
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,280
What?

101
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,520
He sent a message two days ago.

102
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,080
He said he would come back for your wedding.

103
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,280
He didn't come back.

104
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,600
I asked someone to go to India

105
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,960
to find out about his frequent gambling house.

106
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,160
He said he hadn't seen him for half a month.

107
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,360
It's unusual.

108
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,520
It's really unusual.

109
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,800
My father has been keeping watch for three days.

110
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,680
Did he meet some danger?

111
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,280
Wait.

112
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,000
Put your heart in your stomach.

113
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,680
Your father is very capable.

114
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,480
He will be fine.

115
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm still a little worried.

116
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,000
How about I go there?

117
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,280
From Qingquan Town to India,

118
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,840
it will take at most seven or eight days.

119
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,800
If I go faster,

120
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,720
it will take five or six days.

121
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,400
Master.

122
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,640
I'll go with you.

123
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
No need, my second father.

124
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,240
I'll go by myself.

125
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:35,960
Take the sea with you.

126
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,320
You can stay in the village to help me keep watch.

127
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,440
You don't know, Deng Deng.

128
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,760
There will be a ghost town on the way to India.

129
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,960
It is said that

130
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,400
between Qianhe Town and India,

131
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,400
there is only one space for the spirits to enter.

132
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,880
Many spirits do business and live in it.

133
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,600
Although humans can't enter and exit this place,

134
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,040
once the spirits come out,

135
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,480
it will be dangerous.

136
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,360
Second father.

137
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,240
If I really meet

138
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,760
the spirits,

139
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,920
it's useless to bring you along.

140
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,200
Even if I bring all the brothers in the village,

141
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,200
it's useless.

142
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,200
Second Master.

143
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,360
Listen to me.

144
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,280
If you go,

145
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,280
the village will be in chaos.

146
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,680
Who will take care of the slaughter?

147
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,520
With my strong man,

148
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,480
you can't be at ease.

149
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,240
Yes.

150
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,320
My blood is the blood of normal people.

151
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,360
My blood can deal with those evil things.

152
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,280
I...

153
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,200
Okay, second father.

154
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,600
Don't worry.

155
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,000
I can't...

156
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,880
Okay, second master.

157
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,640
I'll follow you.

158
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,160
Sir.

159
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,040
A'Qin.

160
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,920
A'Cheng.

161
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,280
Sir.

162
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,280
You're back.

163
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,000
Pack up your luggage.

164
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,520
Yu Deng Deng and the others are going to India.

165
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,440
We'll follow them secretly.

166
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,520
India?

167
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,400
Why are they going there?

168
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,800
If we follow them,

169
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,040
won't we find Qian Nian Zhen?

170
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,360
There is a ghost town on the way to India.

171
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,440
All the spirits are gathered there.

172
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,080
Yes.

173
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,800
I didn't expect to go to the ghost town to ask for information.

174
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,360
I remember there is a auction house in the ghost town.

175
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,240
They sell some treasures.

176
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,200
There must be a clue.

177
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,200
Yu Deng Deng goes to India.

178
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,360
We can follow the way

179
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,520
and protect him secretly.

180
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,360
They won't be at peace on this journey.

181
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,120
There are some things we need to do in advance.

182
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,680
Whether it's people or spirits,

183
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,200
we have to clear it before Yu Deng Deng encounters them.

184
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
Do you understand?

185
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,960
Yes.

186
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,040
Go.

187
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,840
Sound known?

188
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:44,960
Master,

189
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,600
do you have Yuz他說?

190
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,240
Master.

191
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,760
Men don't always come with good feelings.

192
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Peng Da Hai from Qingquan Village has a message for you.

193
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,960
Da Hai.

194
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,560
Be careful.

195
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,240
Don't worry.

196
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,640
I'll leave Chief to you.

197
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,400
How can I feel...

198
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,040
if you're not by my side?

199
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,080
Second Brother.

200
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,120
You can rely on your friends at home.

201
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,360
You can't rely on your friends at home.

202
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,680
Second Brother.

203
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,200
I've remembered what you said.

204
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,160
Don't worry.

205
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,600
It's good that you remembered.

206
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,000
I have another question.

207
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,840
Did you steal my cigarette?

208
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,880
Second Brother.

209
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,320
I'm here to help you quit smoking.

210
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,400
Listen.

211
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,000
Don't smoke again.

212
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,000
That's all I have.

213
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,720
Actually,

214
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,080
I feel at ease with him.

215
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,840
It's like you're by my side.

216
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,360
What's this?

217
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,360
This is my second brother's bodyguard uniform.

218
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,960
Is it some kind of gold and silver jewelry?

219
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,360
It's a family heirloom.

220
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,200
Don't open it.

221
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,760
It might save your life.

222
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,160
I've remembered it.

223
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,760
It's all in your heart.

224
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,240
We're leaving.

225
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,280
Take care.

226
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,640
We're leaving.

227
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,160
Don't worry.

228
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,320
Okay.

229
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,640
Boss.

230
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,880
I heard Yu Deng Deng left Mount Qingquan.

231
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,040
She'll be here in two hours.

232
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,160
Yu Deng Deng, you bitch.

233
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,120
How dare you steal my cigarette?

234
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,840
Fine.

235
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,200
I'll see how you get through me today.

236
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,080
Who's there?

237
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Who's there?

238
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
I'll beat you to a pulp if you don't talk.

239
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,880
Sorry.

240
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,520
Hai,

241
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,320
do we have any problem?

242
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
No.

243
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,400
I just want to talk to you.

244
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:26,840
Master.

245
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,840
No.

246
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,960
My feet hurt.

247
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,840
I've walked more than 20 miles.

248
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,480
Let's take a break.

249
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,600
Look at you.

250
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,000
You're all sweaty.

251
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,240
I've asked you to work out more.

252
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,440
But you're always lazy.

253
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,040
Here.

254
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,720
How about this?

255
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,800
I'll get the bag for you.

256
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,280
No.

257
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,000
No, master.

258
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,160
I'm a man and a disciple.

259
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,200
How can I let you take my bag?

260
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,880
It's okay.

261
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,680
Take care of each other.

262
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,240
Isn't it the same?

263
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,920
Besides, you're my disciple.

264
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,120
I'm your master.

265
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,000
Okay.

266
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,040
Thank you, master.

267
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,280
We have to go.

268
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,840
We'll arrive at the Luowu Village half an hour ago.

269
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,400
Although it's a little bit lonely,

270
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,480
there's always a place to live.

271
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:04,840
No.

272
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,680
Master.

273
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,040
No.

274
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,720
We can go.

275
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
But we have to

276
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,960
fill our stomachs before we go.

277
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,440
Right?

278
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,160
Okay?

279
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,240
Here.

280
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,360
Aunt Li sent me some pancakes,

281
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,680
Uncle Wang's spicy meat

282
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,240
and Erhei's sauce.

283
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,920
When we get there,

284
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,160
wait for the fire to burn out.

285
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:20,760
Think about it.

286
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,360
It's beautiful.

287
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
Master, we have money now.

288
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,840
You're taking so much stuff from us.

289
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,840
How heavy is this on the road?

290
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,360
You don't understand.

291
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,240
These are all

292
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,840
the people's kindness.

293
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,160
They will be unhappy

294
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,480
if I don't take them.

295
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,080
You have to be patient for a few days.

296
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,360
When we arrive in the capital,

297
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,320
I'll buy you a porcelain bar.

298
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
Wait. Wait. Wait.

299
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,440
Why did you stop again?

300
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,040
Because you...

301
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:44,480
I...

302
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,040
Yes.

303
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
You borrowed the porcelain bar, right?

304
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,520
I've thought it over.

305
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,240
In life,

306
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,440
why do you borrow your favorite porcelain bar

307
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,440
for some irrelevant things?

308
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,440
Porcelain bar.

309
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,680
So luxurious.

310
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,640
Bring me one.

311
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,920
Gu Bei Xi.

312
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,920
Why are you here?

313
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,200
I'm going to Ying Du.

314
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,520
You're going to Ying Du, too?

315
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,320
You're not going to Ying Du, are you?

316
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,360
That's great.

317
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,680
It's a good idea.

318
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,080
My dad told me

319
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,080
that he booked a baby marriage in Ying Du.

320
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Baby marriage?

321
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,280
You mean

322
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,280
you have a fiancee in Ying Du?

323
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,120
If you don't want me to have one,

324
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,320
I'll cancel it right away.

325
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,200
I've already paid you two li of the south wind debt.

326
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,720
It's time to pay back.

327
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,600
Don't be so polite.

328
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm generous when I should be.

329
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,280
I don't know what she looks like.

330
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,760
I've never seen her before.

331
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,120
I have to go see her in advance.

332
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,520
If it's not appropriate,

333
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,720
I'll run away as soon as possible.

334
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,320
Since we're so fated,

335
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
let's go together.

336
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Go together?

337
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,520
What good things can happen to you?

338
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,520
Go your separate ways.

339
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,520
Then I'll be in trouble.

340
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,080
After you took over the fire station,

341
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,200
I've been feeling regretful.

342
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,000
I plan to block you in the village ahead.

343
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,320
You're not afraid of it.

344
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,600
You're brave and powerful.

345
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,880
I'm not alone.

346
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,280
When I was helping you

347
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,640
to capture the monsters in Qingquan,

348
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,320
we knew each other.

349
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,400
He can't block you.

350
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,680
He must be bullying me.

351
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,160
Master.

352
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,560
I think

353
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,440
the

354
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:10,240
Inquisitor Gu is pitiful.

355
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,240
He came out alone

356
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,360
and didn't even bring a man.

357
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,440
If something really happened,

358
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,240
people would say

359
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,720
we're dead in Qingquan.

360
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,520
It's not nice.

361
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,560
Don't say that, Da Hai.

362
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,480
My life in the north and west

363
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,240
has nothing to do with your Qingquan.

364
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,360
Master,

365
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,160
besides,

366
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,280
he's alone.

367
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,560
We need a helper.

368
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,160
If we're in the fire station,

369
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,280
we can't afford to be bullied.

370
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:29,960
Right?

371
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,840
Forget it.

372
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,120
Let him follow us.

373
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,520
Let me help you.

374
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,160
Come on.

375
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,120
Master, I'm about to be hungry.

376
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,560
It seems that the people of the Fire Station

377
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,320
have already come.

378
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,960
There should be less than ten people.

379
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,040
Let's go.

380
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,120
Master Yu.

381
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,520
Let's go. Hurry up.

382
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,000
Coming.

383
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,720
Hurry up.

384
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,160
Hurry up.

385
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,120
Master Yu.

386
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,640
Hurry up.

387
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,160
Hurry up.

388
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,960
Coming.

389
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,440
Coming.

390
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,160
Master Yu has been waiting for a long time.

391
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,520
His sedan chair has been stolen.

392
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,800
Hurry up.

393
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,920
Well,

394
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:31,800
let me send some salt

395
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
to the market.

396
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,720
I'll go and get some.

397
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,320
Okay.

398
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,080
Hurry up.

399
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,840
Hurry up.

400
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,520
Hurry up.

401
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,120
Hurry up.

402
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,800
Let's go.

403
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,760
Send me to the market?

404
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,200
To the market?

405
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,560
What's this?

406
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,600
What's the new method of fraud?

407
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,440
This is...

408
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,880
This is our

409
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,200
admiration for Master Yu.

410
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,120
Amazement.

411
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:49,720
Right.

412
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,800
Right.

413
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,400
Master.

414
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,800
Let's go around the road.

415
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,640
Look at these people.

416
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:55,520
Be careful not to get caught in the fire.

417
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,040
Let's go.

418
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,440
What are you doing?

419
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,400
What are you doing?

420
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,960
You can't go.

421
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,360
If you go,

422
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,000
we'll be finished.

423
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,720
Grandma Yu.

424
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,400
Mama Yu.

425
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
It's a dangerous time.

426
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,360
We must hurry up.

427
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,800
Let's go.

428
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,400
I'll send someone to prepare for the next town.

429
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:19,960
Master.

430
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,000
This little town

431
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,120
is too rough

432
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,320
to be taught.

433
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,400
It's okay if you don't do it.

434
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,040
We can prepare better for him later.

435
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,640
No need.

436
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,480
With his personality,

437
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,560
he can only say

438
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,560
that he will settle down when he comes.

439
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,840
Get up.

440
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,200
How can we

441
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,120
refuse such kindness?

442
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,680
I think

443
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,600
we should settle down when he comes.

444
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,840
Get on the sedan.

445
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,920
I'm leaving.

446
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,840
Come on.

447
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,640
I'll see what kind of man he is.

448
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
I'll see when he makes a fuss.

449
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,120
Let's go.

450
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,120
Let's go.

451
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,640
Mr. Yu, are you hot?

452
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,600
Stop.

453
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,640
We're all tired.

454
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,440
Let's take a break.

455
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,160
Guys,

456
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,560
come down and take a break.

457
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,960
Second Master, Master Su,

458
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,640
I'm coming.

459
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,320
Master, are you okay?

460
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,480
Is there anything wrong?

461
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,760
Not yet.

462
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,000
Mr. Yu, are you thirsty?

463
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,080
I have ice-cold plum soup.

464
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,800
No, I'm fine.

465
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,400
I have

466
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,160
candied chestnuts.

467
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,080
And

468
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,680
the grapes from the Western Regions.

469
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,560
They're very sweet.

470
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,200
Have a taste.

471
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,720
I have more.

472
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,960
Okay, okay.

473
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,920
It's okay.

474
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,320
I made the horse seat

475
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,600
so painful.

476
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,320
Go and have a look.

477
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,120
If you have any,

478
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:06,760
change it for me.

479
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,480
Okay, okay.

480
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,000
Thank you.

481
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,680
I'll change it right away.

482
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,120
Second Master.

483
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:11,920
Brother.

484
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:12,720
Come here.

485
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,360
Change the horse seat.

486
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,160
Okay, okay.

487
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:15,720
That one.

488
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,560
Hurry up.

489
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,360
No problem.

490
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,960
If we want to do it,

491
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,160
they would have done it earlier.

492
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,120
Do they

493
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,920
really want to help us?

494
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:39,220
Nothing is beyond our reach.

495
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,160
Come here.

496
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:43,920
Don't answer.

497
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,960
What greenlings?

498
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,600
You're...

499
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,960
You wanted to

500
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,680
tactical attack

501
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:56,280
last January when to

502
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,760
this day?

503
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,680
Your fight insisted

504
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,440
on death.

505
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,360
Second Master

506
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,880
I trust you.

507
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,960
Seriously?

508
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,360
Something happened while I was sleeping.

509
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,760
Do you hear that

510
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,320
there was a misunderstanding between you and Yu Zhai Zhu?

511
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,920
Then you stillinos in most cases,

512
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,760
right?

513
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,120
Has a young lass been cheated

514
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,000
into officers' Bond?

515
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,320
E, we're also the pursuer,

516
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,320
Actually?

517
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,080
Who?

518
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,800
You must not tell the head of the house,

519
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,440
understand?

520
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,120
Yes, yes.

521
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:38,680
Last one.

522
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,880
Let's go.

523
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:42,640
Let's go.

524
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,440
Get on the horse.

525
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,160
Come on.

526
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,560
Come on.

527
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,080
Come on.

528
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,720
Get on the horse.

529
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,440
Excuse me.

530
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,720
Come on.

531
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,560
Get on the horse.

532
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,360
Come on.

533
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
Get on the horse.

534
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,280
Come on.

535
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
Get on the horse.

536
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,280
Come on.

537
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Get on the horse.

538
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
Come on.

539
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,280
Get on the horse.

540
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,280
Come on.

541
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,280
Get on the horse.

542
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,280
Come on.

543
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,040
Alright, alright.

544
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,760
Mr. Yu.

545
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,680
Qianhe Mountain is here.

546
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,920
Then we'll take our leave.

547
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,640
Thank you for your hard work.

548
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,120
This is the money for your foot massage.

549
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,800
And

550
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,280
the two horses.

551
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,880
It's not appropriate.

552
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,040
Don't push it.

553
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,040
I know

554
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,680
you're being forced.

555
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,560
But I won't make it hard for you.

556
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,200
Tell that man

557
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,440
to tell him

558
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,640
from now on,

559
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,280
he'll go through his block,

560
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,440
I'll go through my way.

561
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,920
Don't do these boring things.

562
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,200
I won't take his money.

563
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,520
And

564
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,680
I was wrong before.

565
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,240
I only have this much money now.

566
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,720
When I'm done,

567
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,960
I'll go to the mountain again.

568
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,000
Mr. Yu.

569
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,120
You're so useless.

570
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,640
Actually, Chief Gu

571
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,600
Chief Gu has given us money.

572
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,080
Qian.

573
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:04,840
Qian.

574
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,360
What do you mean?

575
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,960
You're so easy with me.

576
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,720
I've learned a lesson recently.

577
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,640
It's better to be easy with men.

578
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,800
I'm sure of it.

579
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:18,960
Da Hai.

580
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,480
Master.

581
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,320
Let's go.

582
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,680
Yu...

583
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,000
Yu, take care.

584
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,880
He's so brave.

585
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,600
So handsome.

586
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,520
Right?

587
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,880
So handsome.

588
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,400
Take it.

589
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,200
These are for you.

590
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,080
Thank you, Chief Gu.

591
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,160
Let's go.

592
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,040
Go.

593
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,520
Take care.

594
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,000
Take care.

595
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,120
Handsome.

596
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,480
Handsome.

597
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,280
Go, go .

598
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,360
What's the matter?

599
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,560
Mi is ready?

600
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,280
We sent him there.

601
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,200
But it seems Mr. Yu

602
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,960
has noticed you.

603
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,200
What did he say after that?

604
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,400
Well...

605
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,840
He said he doesn't need to know much.

606
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,520
He asked me in full.

607
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,560
And

608
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,520
he said he waited and waited for you

609
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,960
to do all these fresh things.

610
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,680
Such a...

611
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,080
A cyber Messy business.

612
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,800
Right, and..

613
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,400
The one who is around him,

614
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,360
the one who is fighting with him,

615
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,400
also means that.

616
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,200
Look, this person...

617
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:32,920
Alright, alright, alright.

618
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,760
Get out of here.

619
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:34,920
Get out.

620
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,760
Get out.

621
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,640
Sorry.

622
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,160
Sorry.

623
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,760
Sorry.

624
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,880
Get out.

625
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,480
Sir,

626
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,840
don't take it too seriously.

627
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,720
Women are more aggressive.

628
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,520
They are very manly.

629
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,360
Chang,

630
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,720
the imperial edict

631
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,040
is to inform all the tribes

632
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,640
in Qianhe Town

633
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,960
to obey my order.

634
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,480
Yes, sir.

635
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,040
A Xin has sent a letter

636
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,480
saying that the arrangement is done.

637
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,760
Bao Bao,

638
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
we need to eat well

639
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,040
to grow up quickly.

640
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,560
Alright.

641
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,640
Keep the money.

642
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,160
Okay.

643
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,640
We need to grow up pretty.

644
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,760
Bao Bao,

645
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,840
what kind of buns do you want?

646
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,800
Vegetables or meat?

647
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,440
How about we eat a bun?

648
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:23,600
What's wrong?

649
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,240
Bao Bao,

650
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,640
give me a meat bun.

651
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,120
Here you are.

652
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,920
Thank you, boss.

653
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,560
Here, take it.

654
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,440
Help me pay.

655
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,280
I forgot to bring the money.

656
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,240
It's okay.

657
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,120
Let's pay next time.

658
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,520
Thank you, boss.

659
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,400
Thank you, uncle.

660
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
Thank you, uncle.

661
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,200
Sir,

662
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,000
the people are so generous.

663
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,280
I want to eat a meat bun too.

664
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,040
I'm starving.

665
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,680
Where is Gu Bei Xi?

666
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,840
Why didn't he come up?

667
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,400
He's not here.

668
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,640
Let's leave him alone.

669
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,120
Let's go.

670
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,080
Let's go eat something delicious.

671
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:49,520
Let's go.

672
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,040
Let's go.

673
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,640
Hurry.

674
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,000
Let's go.

675
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,400
Go.

676
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,160
Go.

677
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,000
Go.

678
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:58,600
What's that?

679
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,160
Why did you eat it

680
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,800
before I did?

681
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
Who told you to çıktı?

682
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,560
You liked gonna eat

683
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,480
everything I bought for you?

684
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,040
Let's put them away for now.

685
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:17,720
I can't eat them.

686
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,520
Listen.

687
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,800
There are jams here.

688
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:20,920
All kinds of food were sold out.

689
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,120
And it tastes swear by the restaurant.

690
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,800
But the thing is,

691
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:23,600
they are really cheap.

692
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,000
It's the same as the yard in your Qingquan Village.

693
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,440
It tastes good.

694
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,080
Right?

695
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,240
Boss,

696
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,800
your cooking is good

697
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,400
in this environment.

698
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,280
But it's not as good as before.

699
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,960
If you don't eat, what are you going to do?

700
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,840
I'm going to find a place to sleep.

701
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,560
Why are you laughing?

702
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:54,800
I'm coming.

703
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,000
What's the matter, Master?

704
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,840
You lack money.

705
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,720
Before I left,

706
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,360
I left more money for the villagers.

707
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,800
Today, the money was not enough.

708
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,240
I also gave most of the money to Gu Beixi.

709
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,600
Although I don't spend much money with meals,

710
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,000
But now I'm a little nervous.

711
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,280
Master, I don't think you're upset

712
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,480
because of money.

713
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,840
It's because of the salt.

714
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,000
The second master said

715
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,800
it's not good for the beauty.

716
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:36,560
Get out.

717
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,960
I'm thinking where we're going to live.

718
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,320
I forgot to tell Gu Bei Xi

719
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,320
to find some cheap hotel.

720
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,200
No, let's ask Gu to get the money back.

721
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,920
Then we'll pay him back.

722
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
Come on.

723
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,520
He's been very fond of our village.

724
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
He's been very kind.

725
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,320
If we ask him to get the money back,

726
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,560
we'll be in trouble.

727
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,280
We'll lose the whole village.

728
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,160
I don't think Gu is that kind of person.

729
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,640
Master, you must think too much.

730
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,320
It's better to beg for help than to beg for help.

731
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,480
Let's find a cheaper hotel today.

732
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,120
At least we have to find an old one.

733
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,600
Otherwise, we'll sleep on the street.

734
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,920
Don't worry.

735
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:10,960
We can find someone to live with.

736
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,080
Okay, let's see.

737
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,040
Let's go.

738
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,320
Look at that.

739
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,040
That one.

740
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,160
Boss.

741
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:22,760
Boss.

742
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,360
Boss.

743
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:23,920
Boss.

744
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,560
Look at it clearly.

745
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,360
Go ask about this person.

746
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,440
Report to me whenever you hear anything.

747
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,120
Boss, is there anything else?

748
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,720
Go to the best hotel in the village.

749
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,600
Open three rooms.

750
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,920
Two of them must be locked.

751
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,120
Make it look nice.

752
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
The other one.

753
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:42,920
The farther the better.

754
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:43,920
Yes.

755
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,440
Yes.

756
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,080
Let's go.

757
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,680
Yes.

758
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,280
Yes.

759
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:46,880
Yes.

760
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,520
Yes.

761
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,240
Yes.

762
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:48,840
Yes.

763
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,360
Yes.

764
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,080
Yes.

765
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,600
Yes.

766
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,200
Yes.

767
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,840
Let's go.

768
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,480
Let's go.

769
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,240
Qianhe Town is quite cheap.

770
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,600
But why is it so expensive?

771
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,480
Now Qianhe Town is so rich.

772
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,560
If I have a chance,

773
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,040
I'll find out how they make money.

774
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,960
Master.

775
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,920
Let's solve the food problem first.

776
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,520
Then we'll talk about making money, okay?

777
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,680
How about we stay overnight tonight?

778
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,200
The world is not peaceful now.

779
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,160
We won't let strangers complain easily.

780
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,080
I'm a good person.

781
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,880
Why don't you drink some wine

782
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,320
and see if you can change women?

783
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,440
Our sisters' complaints

784
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,160
are more likely to be accepted.

785
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,400
I changed again.

786
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,480
Do you have a better way?

787
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,120
Congratulations.

788
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:43,680
Take it.

789
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,000
Congratulations.

790
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,320
You're the winners.

791
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,120
You know what?

792
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,360
Today you passed

793
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,400
the top ten thousand lucky customers

794
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,200
of Lü Dian.

795
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,640
For the lucky customers,

796
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,920
we'll offer you the best service

797
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,600
at a very low price.

798
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,600
I can't afford it.

799
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,160
We're cheap.

800
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,280
No, no.

801
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:03,680
It's a big deal.

802
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,480
One silver dollar.

803
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:07,960
Two people.

804
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,200
One silver dollar.

805
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,680
Two rooms.

806
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,960
No other expenses?

807
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,840
Absolutely not.

808
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,480
Why are you two here?

809
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,480
We just found a Lü Dian.

810
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,080
I've arranged it.

811
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,320
It's cheaper.

812
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,240
That's better.

813
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
It's cheaper.

814
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,200
That's cheaper.

815
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,480
It's free.

816
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,720
And I'll give the highest price

817
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,840
to this lady.

818
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,040
The dinner is free.

819
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,160
I'll give you three meals.

820
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:40,820
And we'll give you a horse-horses'

821
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,820
horse-horses' meal.

822
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,380
Come on, guys.

823
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:48,900
This way, please.

824
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,820
Be careful of the steps.

825
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:51,500
Sir,

826
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,340
this room No. 1 is yours.

827
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:53,900
Thank you.

828
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:54,740
You're welcome.

829
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,580
What about his room No. 2?

830
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,740
Is it next to here?

831
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:58,900
No.

832
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,060
Where is it?

833
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,900
Go out from here.

834
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,180
Turn left and go up the stairs.

835
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,380
Then turn right.

836
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,900
The third room is his room No. 2.

837
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,820
Shouldn't the rooms No. 1 and No. 2

838
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,860
be in the same room?

839
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,420
Sir, look at what you said.

840
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,220
Who said room No. 1

841
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,500
must be in the same room with No. 2?

842
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:15,860
What about his room No. 4?

843
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,100
They're closer.

844
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,700
Look.

845
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:20,060
I'll switch with him.

846
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,420
I want to live in room No. 4.

847
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,300
You have so many things to do

848
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,180
in a free room.

849
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,260
What?

850
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,380
You live alone and leave us alone.

851
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,140
Are you afraid?

852
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,500
Don't be afraid.

853
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,060
I'll clean up with Dahai.

854
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,060
I'll let him come and accompany you.

855
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:32,980
Let's go.

856
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,180
This way, please.

857
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:34,980
Come on, sir.

858
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,380
So stupid.

859
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,100
You didn't see the room and chose the room number.

860
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,100
Next time, live in room No. 1.

861
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:40,900
Okay.

862
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,500
I'll go.

863
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,500
Miss, don't worry.

864
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:43,100
Today,

865
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,020
I'll make you three

866
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,020
feel like you're back to normal.

867
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:55,980
Miss,

868
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,100
we're here.

869
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,420
Miss,

870
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:01,820
this is your room No. 2.

871
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:05,060
Come on.

872
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,020
There's a porcelain bowl?

873
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,460
Rong,

874
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,260
Miss,

875
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,340
this porcelain bowl

876
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,180
is a specialty of our store.

877
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,980
Every room has it.

878
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:14,740
Try it.

879
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,740
You're so thoughtful, Miss.

880
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,700
You're right.

881
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,180
Come on.

882
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,860
Keep the key.

883
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,340
Well,

884
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,580
you can take a rest.

885
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,540
Call me if you need anything.

886
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:22,940
By the way,

887
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:24,980
someone has already

888
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,260
lived in the next room.

889
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:26,980
Miss,

890
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,660
although someone has already lived in the next room,

891
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,380
the sound insulation effect is very good here.

892
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:30,900
Don't worry.

893
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,660
We won't disturb you.

894
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,060
Okay.

895
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:34,820
Thank you.

896
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,300
Okay.

897
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,540
Call me if you need anything.

898
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:37,420
Okay.

899
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,460
Okay. Goodbye.

900
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,060
Come on.

901
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:56,860
How is it?

902
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,620
Is it sweet?

903
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,940
This is the best red peach

904
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,420
I've ever stolen from the second master's kitchen.

905
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,500
Do you like it?

906
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:04,700
It's okay.

907
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:05,860
It's okay.

908
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,340
Porcelain bowl?

909
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,980
Where did you buy

910
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,460
this dirty porcelain bowl?

911
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,660
Master!

912
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:30,660
What's up?

913
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:31,780
I'm going shopping.

914
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,260
You have no money.

915
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,060
What shopping?

916
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,180
I've asked around.

917
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,260
Qian He Town is holding an event these days.

918
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,140
It's getting more and more lively.

919
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,100
Although we have no money,

920
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,340
we can still have fun.

921
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,700
Anyway, the dinner is still early.

922
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,820
It's just a free time, right?

923
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,420
Okay.

924
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,820
Call Gu Bei Xi.

925
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,060
I did.

926
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,620
No one is here.

927
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,900
The owner said she saw him go out.

928
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:51,660
It's okay.

929
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,180
It doesn't matter.

930
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,060
A busy man can't be lost.

931
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,580
He'll be back when he's hungry.

932
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:54,900
Let's go.

933
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,580
Let's go out and have a look.

934
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,020
Let's go.

935
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,460
It's so lively.

936
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,460
What festival is this?

937
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,620
Why is everyone holding a baby?

938
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,620
I don't know.

939
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,460
Anyway, it's a festival.

940
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:10,260
Look.

941
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,420
It's quite lively.

942
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,940
Miss, one for you.

943
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,740
No, thanks.

944
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:19,460
Let's go.

945
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:19,940
Okay.

946
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:24,660
It's a trap.

947
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,940
Let's go and have a look.

948
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:26,700
Let me try.

949
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,540
Come and have a look.

950
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,180
These are all good things brought back from the provincial city.

951
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,060
One yuan for ten traps.

952
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,260
It's worth it.

953
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,100
Okay, master.

954
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:35,700
Try it.

955
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:36,460
What if you get it?

956
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,420
It's worth it to have one trap.

957
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,380
Come and have a look.

958
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,300
Let me try.

959
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,140
Give it to him.

960
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:44,700
Try it.

961
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,460
Try it.

962
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,220
What if you get it?

963
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,580
Hold it.

964
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,540
Come on.

965
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,300
Come on.

966
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:03,780
Relax.

967
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,100
Relax.

968
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:05,940
Drink.

969
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,460
Good one.

970
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:09,820
Good.

971
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,860
Nicely done.

972
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,580
Good.

973
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,380
Ch 함께.

974
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,220
Wow, really good.

975
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,340
Not one.

976
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,580
Whoa, great.

977
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:23,900
If loving is changed,

978
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,500
Yeah, that's right.

979
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:33,780
Then, the old love will be

980
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,860
Good, good.

981
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,620
That's great.

982
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,500
Master, it's a pity that we don't have any extra goods.

983
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,420
You took them away.

984
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,780
I can't do anything about it.

985
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,860
How about this?

986
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,540
I can get some money

987
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,980
and buy it from you.

988
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,020
It's better.

989
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,940
It's a lot of money.

990
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:51,940
No need.

991
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,540
It's too much.

992
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,220
Yes.

993
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,300
It's a lot of money.

994
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,100
It's a lot.

995
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,260
Come here.

996
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,900
Master, we just need money.

997
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,940
We can make money.

998
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,820
It's a good life.

999
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,580
Sir,

1000
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,060
did we give too much money?

1001
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,220
How else would you give it?

1002
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,660
This is called

1003
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,620
the natural duty of a man who has a good reputation.

1004
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,740
You don't need to know who I am.

1005
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,660
I'm a man of my word.

1006
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,740
I'll give you whatever you want.

1007
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,820
Master, relax.

1008
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,820
Master, I happen to see

1009
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,940
another stall that makes money.

1010
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,620
Come on.

1011
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,460
Okay.

1012
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,180
Come on.

1013
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,340
Boss.

1014
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,700
It's really him.

1015
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,820
He's really a soul-stirring man.

1016
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,220
Master, look at this guy.

1017
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,260
Oh my god.

1018
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,500
We'll sell these things later.

1019
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,260
It won't be a problem when we get to India.

1020
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:55,260
Master, I think we should stay longer.

1021
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,060
Maybe we can make money.

1022
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,580
Pan De Wu Yan will be in trouble.

1023
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,140
I think we should go back to India.

1024
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,140
I think we should go back to India.

1025
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,900
Pan De Wu Yan will be in trouble.

1026
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,700
We'll take it when we see him.

1027
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,620
Okay.

1028
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,140
Let's go.

1029
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,820
Let's go.

1030
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,980
How much is this?

1031
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,060
Miss, do you want to come and have a look?

1032
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,300
No, thanks.

1033
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:11,820
Come on.

1034
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,460
Miss.

1035
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:14,660
Let's go.

1036
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,620
Let's go.

1037
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,340
Xiao Tou, chase him.

1038
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,500
Boss, look.

1039
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,740
It's the thief.

1040
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,180
What are you doing?

1041
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,260
Be careful.

1042
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,060
Help me.

1043
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,780
Idiot, you're going to get me.

1044
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,580
The thief.

1045
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,740
The thief.

1046
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:33,820
Stop.

1047
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,220
Xiao Tou, stop.

1048
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:37,900
Stop.

1049
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,660
Don't run.

1050
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,220
He runs fast.

1051
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,420
It's done.

1052
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,700
Da Hai, there are two ways.

1053
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,620
You go to the small road to block him.

1054
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,020
Okay.

1055
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,980
Be careful.

1056
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,300
Sir, what should we do?

1057
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,540
Let's go back to Lü Hall.

1058
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,580
A Xin, find a carriage for them.

1059
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,380
Okay.

1060
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,220
Our church has a branch here.

1061
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,380
Now we can eat and sleep.

1062
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,220
We'll pay for it.

1063
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:14,900
You run.

1064
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,380
You want to run?

1065
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,940
Let's see where you go.

1066
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:22,900
Let's see where you go.

1067
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,300
You want to find me?

1068
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,020
Have a dream.

1069
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,460
Who is this?

1070
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,420
You want to run?

1071
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,540
You want to run after stealing my money?

1072
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,260
Da Hai,

1073
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,660
take him to a hidden place.

1074
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:36,220
Okay.

1075
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:36,820
Let's go.

1076
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,980
I'm not here to catch you.

1077
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:39,620
Come here.

1078
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,700
He met Xiao Tou at the first time he left the Garden.

1079
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,980
Now he's in a dangerous situation.

1080
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,580
Tell me.

1081
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,660
Where did you hide the money?

1082
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,620
Why did you steal the money?

1083
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,500
Don't play with me.

1084
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,660
I didn't touch you.

1085
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,020
Sir,

1086
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,260
I don't know how to make money.

1087
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,220
I don't know how to make money.

1088
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,300
I don't know how to make money.

1089
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,140
I don't know how to make money.

1090
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,460
Sir,

1091
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,780
I didn't do that.

1092
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,340
I didn't do that.

1093
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:08,740
Are you okay?

1094
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:11,700
What's wrong with you?

1095
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,180
What's wrong with you?

1096
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,820
What's this?

1097
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,780
A monster!

1098
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,860
Listen,

1099
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,660
don't do anything stupid.

1100
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,740
I...

1101
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,300
I'm a hunter.

1102
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,460
My blood can remove the monsters of the forest.

1103
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:23,980
Right.

1104
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,700
You'll be destroyed if you get it.

1105
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,180
Dong Wang,

1106
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,060
I'll get you.

1107
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:27,740
I'll get you.

1108
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,700
No, no, no.

1109
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,500
Don't.

1110
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,180
Stop.

1111
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,820
Don't do that.

1112
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,260
I'm not here to steal money.

1113
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,180
I...

1114
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:35,620
I'm here to give you money.

1115
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:36,860
Look,

1116
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,500
the money in the bag

1117
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,380
is not even a penny less.

1118
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,500
Give money?

1119
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,500
Are you that kind?

1120
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,100
Why do you know we lack money?

1121
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,100
You...

1122
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,100
Oh my god.

1123
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,780
It's true.

1124
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:48,820
It seems that it's not less,

1125
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,660
but a few more.

1126
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,420
Lu Yan sent you here?

1127
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,860
Lu Yan?

1128
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,100
I don't know his name.

1129
00:38:58,820 --> 00:38:59,580
I only know

1130
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,620
he's General Yan.

1131
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,020
He's got too many paintings.

1132
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,380
Who would write this name for himself?

1133
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,540
Who else but you?

1134
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,260
The small and small tribes in this area

1135
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,660
all follow his orders.

1136
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:12,900
They've been following you all the way.

1137
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:14,340
Master,

1138
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,100
that's enough.

1139
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,100
We have three dishes here.

1140
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,820
And we also have

1141
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,220
a lot of mappies.

1142
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:18,940
No need.

1143
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,580
That's too much.

1144
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,260
It's okay.

1145
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,580
It's a marriage.

1146
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,060
That's great.

1147
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,980
Three in front of the hospital.

1148
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,940
I promise we'll be together.

1149
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:25,940
I promise we'll be together.

1150
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:26,860
Three in front of the hospital?

1151
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,260
Yes.

1152
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:27,980
That's cheap.

1153
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,380
Four in front of the hospital?

1154
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,060
Let's try.

1155
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,500
In the town,

1156
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,340
those who play tricks

1157
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,380
and send money to us

1158
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,300
are also your people?

1159
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,420
I'll tell you when we get back, General Yan.

1160
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,820
This kind of trick is not fun at all.

1161
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,460
Tell him to leave.

1162
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,780
Or I'll be rude.

1163
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,420
Yes.

1164
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,220
Listen.

1165
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,220
Who is my master?

1166
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,220
He's a famous strategist in the distant world.

1167
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,140
You'll be scared to death.

1168
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,300
Madam,

1169
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,900
please forgive me.

1170
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,340
I'll obey General Yan's order.

1171
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,540
Even if we leave now,

1172
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,100
if General Yan

1173
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,700
takes responsibility,

1174
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,340
he'll kill us.

1175
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,820
I have my old and young.

1176
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,860
We're a big family.

1177
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,180
What if I die?

1178
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,940
What will they do?

1179
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,020
Master,

1180
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,180
who is Lu Yan?

1181
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,860
And what kind of monster is he?

1182
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,060
Is he more terrifying than a trainer?

1183
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,460
You two

1184
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,100
don't know his legend yet, right?

1185
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:58,060
The most beautiful scenery in life

1186
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:04,180
is all about you

1187
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,740
When the stars are so close

1188
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:12,260
When the whole world is occupied by you

1189
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:17,020
I will call your name with all my heart

1190
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:30,060
Till the memory of you

1191
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,700
This何ise-t ile

1192
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,820
forGradually

1193
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,180
I see nothing but love

1194
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:46,140
I'm justoku

1195
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:50,140
I made a decision for you

1196
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,140
When two hearts are so close

1197
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,140
When the whole world is occupied by you

1198
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:23,140
I will try my best to exchange your name

1199
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:28,140
Until your memories

1200
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:34,140
You are the only one for me

1201
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:41,140
The scenery of the past

1202
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,140
The most sincere

1203
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,140
Because of myself

1204
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,140
I can't separate from love

1205
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,140
I hide my heart

1206
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,140
I made a decision for you

1207
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:16,140
I made a decision for you
