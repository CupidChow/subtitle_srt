00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will never let you go

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's not you

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But you are me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are me

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000

Episode 15

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Director Bai, that day I stopped the rich man from going to the market.

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I told him that I would go to the market.

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
He said that he would go to the market.

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I told him that I would go to the market.

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I told him that I would go to the market.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I stopped the car from your mansion that day

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
because I knew that the forest tribe would attack your Bai family.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Fortunately, my apprentice and I arrived in time and conquered the forest tribe.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Otherwise, your family would not only disappear.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm afraid that now it's already a white bone.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yu Deng Deng, you are talking about the score.

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You are talking about the score.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Go on.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll see what else you can say.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Director Bai, as long as you let him go,

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I will help you deal with the forest tribe

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
and solve the missing case in the city.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
If it's done, the credit is yours.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
If it fails, I will take all the responsibility.

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Such a good deal, you should think about it carefully.

29
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You, you are drinking milk.

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Why do you have to catch the forest tribe?

31
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Don't move, don't move.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It seems that it's time to show you.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm leaving.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Lu Yan, please.

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Go.

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Director, director, director.

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Director Bai, I want to get out of here easily.

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I just came here to help you.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Help you solve these missing cases

40
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
and solve this disaster.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
This disaster, you should be grateful.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We are here to help you solve the case.

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I want to be a parent.

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Director, the scene is often like this.

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
He is so annoying.

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's just try it.

50
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If it's true, we can solve this case,

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
and we can be a good person

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
to introduce him to the scene.

53
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Put down the gun.

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,440
Hero is here to help us, right?

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,120
Miss Yu Deng Deng.

56
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,920
I'm really sorry.

57
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,040
You are a man of the nation.

58
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,760
I'm just a hypocrite.

59
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,320
Miss Yu, how about this?

60
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,280
You help me solve the case.

61
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,480
I'll let your disciple go.

62
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,000
Not now?

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,240
Not that I can't.

64
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,040
But you see, I have a high position.

65
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,480
I'm a man of the nation.

66
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,800
Right?

67
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,520
How about

68
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,160
setting a deadline?

69
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:16,840
Seven days.

70
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,720
How about seven days?

71
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:21,960
It's a deal.

72
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,560
Seven days.

73
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,160
But

74
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
you have to treat him well

75
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,800
for these seven days.

76
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,840
Treat my disciple well.

77
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,600
Don't make it difficult.

78
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:37,080
Don't let him eat and drink well.

79
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,560
If you dare to touch his finger,

80
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,200
I'll teach you a lesson.

81
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,600
Okay, no problem.

82
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,840
Who?

83
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,680
Who dares to use private torture like this?

84
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,760
Hurry up.

85
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,120
I'll call for a fire.

86
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,760
Do you hear me?

87
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,480
Yes.

88
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,040
Well,

89
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,760
Miss Yu, look.

90
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
You just arrived.

91
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,240
I'm a man of the nation.

92
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,640
How about staying in my house for a few days?

93
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,040
You want to keep me?

94
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,200
Okay.

95
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,160
Anyway, we're in the same business.

96
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,360
We'll go everywhere.

97
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,280
Okay.

98
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,520
It's a deal.

99
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,080
Come on.

100
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,160
Take Miss Yu back to the mansion.

101
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,160
Yes.

102
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,760
Wait.

103
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,000
I have a few words

104
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,880
to explain to my disciple.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,080
No problem.

106
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,160
Whatever you want.

107
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,240
That's a good idea.

108
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,200
So uneducated.

109
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,760
Director,

110
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,400
I have something to report to you

111
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,320
about Miss Bai.

112
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,840
They're really inhuman.

113
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,480
How dare they beat you up like this?

114
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,520
Da Hai.

115
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,680
Are you okay?

116
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,280
I'm fine.

117
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,880
It must hurt.

118
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,480
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,960
I'm late.

120
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,680
Wait.

121
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,520
Guess what I brought you.

122
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,560
Your favorite.

123
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,480
Eat slowly.

124
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,400
Don't rush.

125
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,200
Eat slowly.

126
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,400
No one will steal it from you.

127
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,200
Slowly.

128
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,400
Do you trust me?

129
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,080
I do.

130
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,680
I do.

131
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,080
You have to endure it for a few days.

132
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,480
I'll get you out of here.

133
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,480
I do.

134
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
I do.

135
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,480
I do.

136
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,480
I do.

137
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,480
I do.

138
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
I do.

139
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
I do.

140
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
Master.

141
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
It's okay.

142
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,480
It's okay.

143
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
It's okay.

144
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,480
Master is here.

145
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Miss Yu.

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,480
Master asked me to take you home.

147
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
That old fox.

148
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
He's afraid I'll run away.

149
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,480
He wants to watch me.

150
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Thank you, Master.

151
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Miss Yu, please get on the train.

152
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Okay.

153
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
Let's go.

154
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,480
Go.

155
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
Go.

156
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,480
Go.

157
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Go.

158
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Go.

159
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,480
Go.

160
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,480
Go.

161
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,480
It seems that

162
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Chief Bai was tricked.

163
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,480
But why did he

164
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
get on the white horse carriage?

165
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
Lu Yan.

166
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
Are you still here?

167
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
What's up?

168
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,480
I...

169
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Who told you to

170
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
come out and scare me?

171
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,480
How about

172
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
I go back?

173
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Wait.

174
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
You were in the interrogation room just now.

175
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,480
When did you come?

176
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,480
How did you help me?

177
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
You asked me so many questions.

178
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Which one should I answer first?

179
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,480
Is it hard to help me?

180
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,480
Actually, it's not hard.

181
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
You can learn it by yourself.

182
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,480
Me?

183
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,480
What are you joking about?

184
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,480
How is that possible?

185
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,480
You are the reincarnation of Yunxi.

186
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
I've been nourished

187
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
with the yuan pellet for many years.

188
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
So your body

189
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,480
contains yuan energy.

190
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,480
As long as you find the right way,

191
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
you can also

192
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,480
use some small arts.

193
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Come on.

194
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
Give me your hand.

195
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,480
This is the yuan energy

196
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,480
that you have

197
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
in your body.

198
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,480
I just helped you

199
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
to draw it out.

200
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
This is amazing.

201
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,480
Teach me.

202
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,480
You said that

203
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,480
one share of help is ten times the amount of return.

204
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
This is the rule you set for me.

205
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,480
So when will you

206
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,480
pay off your revenge today?

207
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,480
I'll think about

208
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,480
whether I should teach you

209
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
something else.

210
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Goodbye.

211
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Hey!

212
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
Lu Yan,

213
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
you are so stubborn.

214
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,480
You even sent General Yan.

215
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
You'll die if you are careless.

216
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Miss Yu,

217
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
we are here.

218
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,480
Please.

219
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,480
Please.

220
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,480
How much money

221
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,480
did Bai's family get?

222
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
No wonder my father

223
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,480
broke up with his family.

224
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,480
Old fox.

225
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
Miss Yu, this way, please.

226
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
Miss Yu, this way.

227
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,480
Please.

228
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Miss Yu,

229
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
this is your residence.

230
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
Thank you.

231
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,480
These two...

232
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,480
Master said

233
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,480
these servants are here to protect you.

234
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
When you leave the mansion,

235
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
they will also follow you.

236
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
I understand.

237
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,480
Okay.

238
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
Miss Yu, have a good rest.

239
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,480
Miss Yu,

240
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
please.

241
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
Miss Yu,

242
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,480
please.

243
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Miss Yu,

244
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,480
please.

245
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,480
Miss Yu,

246
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,480
please.

247
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Miss Yu,

248
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
please.

249
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,480
Miss Yu,

250
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,480
please.

251
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,480
Miss Yu,

252
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,480
please.

253
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Miss Yu,

254
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
please.

255
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Miss Yu,

256
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
please.

257
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
Miss Yu,

258
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
please.

259
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Miss Yu,

260
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,480
please.

261
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
Miss Yu,

262
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,480
please.

263
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,480
Miss Yu,

264
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,480
please.

265
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
Miss Yu,

266
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,480
please.

267
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,480
Why is she going away?

268
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,280
Somehow I time

269
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,280
came up with

270
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,480
a selection.

271
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,480
To eat,

272
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,480
but even accept

273
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,480
these two...

274
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,480
Customers are bad.

275
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,480
This old fox

276
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,480
is considering me too highly.

277
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,480
This kind of punishment.

278
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,240
Oh, my!

279
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Lu Yan, Lu Yan.

280
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,720
What's up?

281
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,400
You're still up?

282
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:29,960
No.

283
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,440
Thank you for today.

284
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,320
I won't be angry

285
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,560
if you send someone to follow me.

286
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,480
I'm a good talker.

287
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,360
I'll help you ten times.

288
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,040
Tell me. What do you want?

289
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,520
I want to see you.

290
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:45,320
It's not at any time.

291
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,680
I'm telling you,

292
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,800
there's only one chance.

293
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,960
You have to grasp it.

294
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,920
Tell me.

295
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,520
I'll agree to anything.

296
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,880
I want to see you ten times.

297
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Stop it. Stop it.

298
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,160
Why are you more serious than me?

299
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,120
You're not clear-headed today.

300
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,920
Let's talk another day.

301
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,880
Have a rest.

302
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,280
Is he still the one I knew?

303
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,560
Why is he so active?

304
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,480
It seems that

305
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,280
no one can escape

306
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:31,540
my

307
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,240
What's that?

308
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,320
I was feeding

309
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,960
the three-headed cat of my auntie.

310
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
Suddenly,

311
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,960
the baby was thrown down the wall.

312
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:41,960
Look.

313
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,920
Did you see the person who threw the baby away?

314
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,200
No.

315
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,840
But I guess

316
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,280
it must be a man.

317
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,880
How did you know?

318
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,840
It's written in the play.

319
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,000
The head of the wall is on the horse,

320
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,160
and the horse is on the ground.

321
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
It's a mutual protection.

322
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,560
I guess

323
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,760
it was originally for our auntie.

324
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,320
Don't talk nonsense.

325
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,920
If others hear it,

326
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,000
it will cause trouble again.

327
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,440
Shut up.

328
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,880
I confiscated this thing.

329
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,000
No one can talk about it.

330
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,840
Do you hear me?

331
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,600
I know.

332
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,880
By the way, Miss.

333
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,320
In the theater of Master Jin Tian,

334
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,120
a little girl lived in it.

335
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
She even sent someone

336
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,640
to surround the theater.

337
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,600
It seemed that she was afraid that she would run away.

338
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,760
Auntie just disappeared.

339
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,520
My brother is going to take the concubine again.

340
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,920
Not the concubine.

341
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,000
She is one of the three wanted criminals.

342
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,480
Is my father back?

343
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,840
Yes.

344
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,800
I'll go find him.

345
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,480
Go.

346
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,120
I told you not to bother me.

347
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:10,960
Get out.

348
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,080
The doctor has said so many times

349
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,880
that smoking is not good for your health.

350
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,200
Why can't you remember it?

351
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,760
No, I'm your father.

352
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,120
I'm not your son.

353
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,720
Is it appropriate for you to teach me like this?

354
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,600
Is it appropriate?

355
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,160
You, you, you.

356
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:28,880
Lidong soup.

357
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,640
Lidong soup.

358
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,480
You...

359
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:42,880
Dad.

360
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,880
I heard that you brought a female wanted criminal

361
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,800
home.

362
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,760
She is called Yu Deng.

363
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,400
She is a little capable.

364
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,120
She said that our recent affairs

365
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,840
were all done by the Spirit Clan.

366
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,240
So I gave her a chance

367
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,600
to save her friends.

368
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,280
I also checked if she was a ghost or a ghost.

369
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,520
Did she get caught?

370
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,840
One of them was caught.

371
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,720
And another one.

372
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,440
Why do you ask about these?

373
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,200
You are being rude.

374
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,880
Right?

375
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,040
Just right.

376
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,320
Shiqi.

377
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,720
I heard that

378
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,440
you met a male classmate recently.

379
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,160
Did I talk too much to you again?

380
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,720
Don't care who said it.

381
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,120
Anyway, I asked you to go to a female school.

382
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,560
All the teachers

383
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:34,960
are female.

384
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,320
Where did you go to meet a male classmate?

385
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,120
Where did you come from?

386
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,960
He is my classmate's brother, dad.

387
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,000
When we were in Shenzhen,

388
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,040
we went out together

389
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,720
and played together.

390
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,240
Now that he is in India,

391
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,440
I have to say hello to him.

392
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,400
Right?

393
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,480
Really?

394
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,280
Yes.

395
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,560
Okay, I believe you.

396
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,480
I believe you won't lie to me, right?

397
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,240
But remember,

398
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,200
we have a engagement with Gu family in Nanteng Village.

399
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,680
Although they are really useless,

400
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,440
they still don't reply to me.

401
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,960
But we can't say we don't trust them.

402
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,240
I am engaged to the old man of Gu family.

403
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,400
We are engaged to the right person.

404
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,200
Don't let me be embarrassed.

405
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:21,920
Understand?

406
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,840
I know, dad.

407
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,760
You can just accept this engagement.

408
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,080
My daughter,

409
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,840
nobody is going to help me

410
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,520
without your aunt.

411
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,960
I can't sleep well.

412
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,040
If you can't,

413
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,560
you have to get married soon.

414
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,240
I will find the boy of Gu family

415
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,080
and get married soon, okay?

416
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,600
Dad,

417
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,040
if...

418
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,680
If Gu Benxi

419
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,400
has arrived in Yindu,

420
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,840
how are you going to treat him?

421
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,000
How?

422
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,040
Beat him.

423
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,840
Beat him up.

424
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,800
My beautiful daughter

425
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,600
is so beautiful and handsome.

426
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,200
Many people want her.

427
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,680
But she doesn't reply to my marriage letter.

428
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,840
What does that mean?

429
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,800
When she hears this, I will tell her

430
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,480
I can give you anything.

431
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,400
Just one.

432
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,680
You have to be nice to my daughter, right?

433
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,960
If she doesn't like my daughter,

434
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,400
I will skin her.

435
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,440
Dad,

436
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,160
you are so nice to me.

437
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:33,680
Miss,

438
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,400
just buy a mouthpiece.

439
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,280
You don't need to dress so well.

440
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,840
You don't understand.

441
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,240
Girls

442
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,960
need to dress up.

443
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,160
Because you don't know

444
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,160
there will be a surprise in the sky

445
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,000
when you meet the one you want to see.

446
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,640
Take it.

447
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,280
Go away.

448
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,840
Keep your eyes on me.

449
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,680
Who is it?

450
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,880
Who are you? What are you doing?

451
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,680
Do you know who I am?

452
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,480
I know you too well.

453
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,280
The daughter of the head of the Bai family.

454
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,880
Don't think about it.

455
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,680
Do you know this?

456
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,080
You are the criminals who are running away.

457
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,680
Let go of me!

458
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,280
The head of the Bai family is very generous.

459
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,080
You are forcing our brothers to be too cruel.

460
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,280
The day I got married, you went to the Bai family to arrest me.

461
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,880
I lost my new wife for nothing.

462
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,080
This amount of money, you Bai family's eldest daughter,

463
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,080
you can take it.

464
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,680
Help!

465
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,880
Take her away!

466
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,680
I...

467
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,280
Go!

468
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,080
Go!

469
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,280
Go! Go! Go!

470
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,680
You are making trouble here.

471
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,480
The thieves here are too cruel.

472
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,880
This world is because you people have too many fish and shrimps.

473
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,880
That's why you have a pot of soup.

474
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,680
Brother,

475
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,680
if you have nothing to do, don't interfere with other people's affairs.

476
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,080
Mind your own life.

477
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,680
You guys are going to go on your own?

478
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,680
You better wait for me to open a hole in your head before you come here.

479
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,680
Are you okay?

480
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,480
I'm fine.

481
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,480
There was a gunshot just now. Go and take a look.

482
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,680
I'll go with you.

483
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,280
Don't make trouble. The police won't arrest you.

484
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,880
If you want to follow me, then follow me.

485
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,680
Let's go over there and take a look.

486
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,080
Here. Hurry.

487
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,080
It's safe.

488
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,880
Are you okay?

489
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,880
I'm fine.

490
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,480
Thank you for today.

491
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,680
If it weren't for you, I might have...

492
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,880
Don't say that.

493
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,280
If I didn't ask you out, you wouldn't be in danger.

494
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,280
Those kidnappers had an old grudge against my father.

495
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,680
Even if they didn't kidnap me today,

496
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,880
they would have kidnapped me some other time.

497
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
You're quite bold.

498
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,280
Recently, there's been a missing case in the city.

499
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,680
I thought you wouldn't come out alone.

500
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,280
I... I'm not scared.

501
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,080
You're not a bad person.

502
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,480
Miss Bai Shi Qi is quite funny.

503
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,680
You believed me when you first met me.

504
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,080
What brought you here today?

505
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,080
The girl who saved you in the mountain

506
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,680
has moved into Bai's house, right?

507
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,680
She's my friend.

508
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,480
I know. She claims to be a hunter.

509
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,880
She wants to help my father solve the case

510
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,680
so that you can be together.

511
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,280
But my father only gave her seven days.

512
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,880
I'm worried that she's in danger in Bai's house.

513
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,080
Can you help me take care of her?

514
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,680
You care about Miss Yu so much?

515
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,480
You're just friends?

516
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,080
Let's put it this way.

517
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,080
She's the person I like.

518
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,280
Even though we're just friends now,

519
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,680
she'll be mine sooner or later.

520
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,080
Don't you have a fiancee?

521
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,680
How do you know?

522
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,280
I... I think you're getting old.

523
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,880
I do have a fiancee.

524
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,280
But I'm not planning to get married.

525
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
I'm here to break off the engagement.

526
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,680
No, break off the engagement?

527
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,480
Because of Miss Yu?

528
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,680
It has nothing to do with her.

529
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,080
Even if I don't have her, I still want to break off the engagement.

530
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,480
You must marry someone you like.

531
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,680
But you...

532
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,880
Do you know what it is?

533
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:25,680
I... I don't know if I know.

534
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,080
You're still young. You'll know later.

535
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,680
If you marry someone you don't like,

536
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,880
what's the difference between you and a living horse?

537
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,080
Life is short. It's a lifetime.

538
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,480
I don't want to live like that.

539
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,480
But after you get to know your fiancee,

540
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,280
you might like her, right?

541
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,680
That's impossible.

542
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,280
I've had someone I like for a long time.

543
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,480
Miss Shi Qi, if you're willing to help me,

544
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,480
I'll take it as a token of my gratitude.

545
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,280
If you have any questions, I can understand.

546
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,280
I just hope you won't tell anyone about this.

547
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,080
Can you keep it a secret for me?

548
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,880
Okay. I'll take your debt of gratitude.

549
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,280
But if you and Miss Yu

550
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,880
have any intentions of harming the Bai family,

551
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,480
I won't let you off.

552
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,080
Don't worry.

553
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,080
We have the same goal as the Bai family.

554
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,080
We're all here to investigate the disappearance of this city.

555
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,680
I'm leaving. I'll send you back.

556
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,680
This way?

557
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,280
This way?

558
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,380
Old Mom, I'm so sorry.

559
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,980
Before that ghost died,

560
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:53,060
I found a memory from his spirit world.

561
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:00,860
Commander, everything is arranged.

562
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:11,140
Zhurong?

563
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,460
How is that possible?

564
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,900
Didn't you kill him

565
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,460
three thousand years ago?

566
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,980
Lu Yan's yuan energy is strong.

567
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,780
We can't resist it.

568
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,380
Luckily, the heavens don't know about it.

569
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,100
Yu Deng Deng is the god of flowers,

570
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,020
the Saintess Yunxi.

571
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,300
As long as we find a chance to do it,

572
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,780
we can take back the yuan pellet.

573
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,940
It will be difficult.

574
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,020
Deng Deng is in danger.

575
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,380
The Ghost World

576
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,340
It's you.

577
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,820
You scared me.

578
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,780
Yu Deng Deng tried his best

579
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,340
to get Peng Da Hai out.

580
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,260
If you keep trying,

581
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,700
you're just causing him trouble.

582
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,500
The situation in the city

583
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,060
is much more complicated than you think.

584
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,180
I hope you can leave the city as soon as possible.

585
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,540
Leave the rest to me.

586
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,580
I should be the one to say that.

587
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,300
When will

588
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:10,940
the monster

589
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,500
like you,

590
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,460
who is so scheming,

591
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,260
get involved in our business?

592
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,900
The missing case in the city

593
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,260
is related to the Ghost Tribe.

594
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,780
The one who wants Yu Deng Deng's life

595
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,820
is also a Ghost Tribe.

596
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,340
Can you handle it?

597
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,220
Who wants to kill him?

598
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,740
You don't have to care who wants to kill him.

599
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,420
As long as you leave the city,

600
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,940
I can promise you

601
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,220
that whether it's the missing case

602
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,540
that has been planted on you

603
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,100
or the search for the old Yu's owner,

604
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,980
I will help you deal with it.

605
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,860
You're not a good man.

606
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,940
You have your evil ways.

607
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,420
I have my own ways.

608
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,580
Let's wait and see

609
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,020
who can stand

610
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,940
beside Yu Deng Deng in the end.

611
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,180
All right.

612
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,700
I can do more for Yu Deng Deng

613
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,900
than you can.

614
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,420
The first missing case

615
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,900
was Cao Da Fa from Baozi Hall.

616
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,140
On the day of the accident,

617
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,180
he was as early as usual

618
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:15,980
to steam buns.

619
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,580
But when it was time,

620
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:18,980
the buns didn't come out.

621
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,820
His wife felt something was wrong

622
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:21,580
and went in to have a look.

623
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,420
The stove was still hot

624
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,700
and the water had dried up.

625
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,180
There was only one set of clothes and shoes left on the ground.

626
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,860
He just disappeared

627
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,700
without a reason.

628
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,220
The windows are sealed

629
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,260
and fully idiots.

630
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,740
The door to the kitchen

631
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,740
was facing a courtyard

632
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,140
so it was unlikely

633
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:04,880
to disappear

634
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,700
and be taken away Ji Wu's room as well.

635
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,600
It's very idea

636
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,100
that he had been under the Far East

637
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:13,940
I'm sorry.

638
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,140
Cao Da Fa.

639
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:35,820
Come on.

640
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,740
Take that goose back.

641
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,660
Miss Yu.

642
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,660
We're here to investigate the case.

643
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,740
We need to catch the killer.

644
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,100
We can't just stand here.

645
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:46,900
Who said I'm going to hurt them?

646
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,580
Protect my victim.

647
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,420
Take them back.

648
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,620
Put them in my yard.

649
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,460
This is a victim?

650
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,460
What are you doing, Miss Yu?

651
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,460
Don't mind so much.

652
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,580
By the way,

653
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,860
take the fat pig with black ears

654
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,220
in the north three-way street.

655
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,140
Take them back.

656
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,020
Go.

657
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,900
Next place.

658
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:04,460
What are you waiting for?

659
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,260
Take them back.

660
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:06,060
Yes.

661
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,220
Let's go.

662
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,140
I can do anything

663
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,580
to get my fish.

664
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,740
My master

665
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,900
is really good at solving cases.

666
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,060
Why are you throwing two cupboards?

667
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,060
Miss Yu.

668
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,020
Your husband is here.

669
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:35,980
He's in the front hall

670
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,260
talking to our master.

671
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,740
Our lady asked him

672
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,660
to bring you a new bed.

673
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:43,940
No.

674
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:44,500
Wait.

675
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,300
What husband?

676
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,100
Which husband?

677
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,460
Is it the chicken?

678
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,740
I don't know

679
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,100
your husband's name.

680
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,300
I don't know

681
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,420
how many husbands you have.

682
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,500
You misunderstood.

683
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,620
I don't have any husband.

684
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,460
You must have made a mistake.

685
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,100
Come on.

686
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,780
Miss Yu.

687
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:00,260
Thank you.

688
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,060
Thank you.

689
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:02,300
Don't bother this lady.

690
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,300
I can do it myself.

691
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,740
Lu Yan.

692
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,540
Why are you here?

693
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,620
I won't bother

694
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,980
you two to get married.

695
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,420
If you need anything, just tell me.

696
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,460
I'll close the door for you.

697
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,420
Thank you.

698
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,260
Lu Yan.

699
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,340
You're really here.

700
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,540
The man who attacked you that day

701
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:30,540
is the one who ordered

702
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,180
the ghost to harm you in the ghost city.

703
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,820
He already knows your identity.

704
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,220
Since you don't want me

705
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,940
to send someone to protect you,

706
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,260
I'll have to

707
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,220
protect you from the sky.

708
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,380
I don't agree.

709
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,940
It's no use if you don't agree.

710
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,020
I've already told Director Bai

711
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,820
that I hope he can fulfill my love.

712
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,420
General Yan.

713
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,140
I know

714
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,220
you're worried about me.

715
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,220
But I'm the

716
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,980
head of the Qingquan Village.

717
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,540
I have martial arts and weapons.

718
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,260
I have your hairpin

719
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,500
if I don't give it to you.

720
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,580
So you really don't need

721
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,260
to stick to me every day.

722
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,620
Before I caught him,

723
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,140
you have to listen to me.

724
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,180
Don't say anything else.

725
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,940
Why don't you make sense?

726
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,940
Besides, you said we were

727
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,700
a couple.

728
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,700
What couple?

729
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,060
Are we a couple?

730
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,380
You're just a second wife.

731
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,180
Have you considered my reputation?

732
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,780
When the chief took me back to the Qingquan Village,

733
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,060
he didn't consider my reputation.

734
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,420
I won't talk about it with you.

735
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,500
Are you leaving or not?

736
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,180
No.

737
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,700
Fine.

738
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,660
I'll move to another place.

739
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,060
Then next time you want to break the law,

740
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,580
you won't be so cold.

741
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,580
You're threatening me.

742
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,580
I have no choice.

743
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:05,740
Get off.

744
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,780
Don't touch me.

745
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,180
I don't like being touched by others.

746
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:09,900
Get off.

747
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,580
We're here.

748
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,300
Don't waste time.

749
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,460
Respect each other's feelings.

750
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,220
What's wrong with you?

751
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,300
What are you doing?

752
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,020
How is it?

753
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,700
Do you feel that

754
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,780
we're closer?

755
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,220
What?

756
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,660
Do you want to be closer?

757
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,620
Stop it.

758
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,580
If you don't want to,

759
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,940
I won't force you.

760
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,740
You insist on this, right?

761
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,700
Come on.

762
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,420
What are you doing?

763
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,300
You...

764
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,700
What are you doing?

765
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:33,580
You...

766
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,860
If you drive me away again,

767
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,660
I'll do more.

768
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,380
Do you know that?

769
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:38,780
You...

770
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,380
Don't do anything.

771
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:42,940
Stay.

772
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:43,820
Stay.

773
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,820
Say whatever you want.

774
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,620
Stay for as long as you want.

775
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,940
It'll be fine if you stay like this.

776
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,420
Go to bed.

777
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,740
You sleep on the bed tonight.

778
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:55,980
I'll guard the bed.

779
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,500
Are you sure?

780
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,700
A gentleman should not take advantage of others.

781
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:06,620
I'll leave you alone.

782
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,420
I'll leave you alone.

783
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,900
Yu Deng Deng, you're so bad.

784
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,340
Why are you so bad?

785
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,940
It wasn't like this before.

786
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,140
Is the art of the salt and salt

787
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,420
getting better?

788
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,100
What a shame.

789
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,380
I've already told you

790
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,660
that I've checked the missing people's whereabouts

791
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,860
and found some suspicious people.

792
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:40,500
You brought back some

793
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,980
people of the spirit clan who are

794
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,500
of the same species.

795
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,340
Their original abilities are extremely low.

796
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,620
So

797
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:51,820
Xiao Yi Tai may be a member of the spirit clan.

798
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:52,940
Do you think

799
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,780
Director Bai knows about this?

800
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,060
The spirit clan and the human clan have lived together for a long time.

801
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,460
I heard from Xin that the spirit clan and the human clan

802
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,420
are a couple.

803
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,260
But the spirit clan is a group of people

804
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,260
who live in the Nine Regions.

805
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,900
It's still a minority who can confess their identity.

806
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,900
It sounds like

807
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,700
the spirit clan is really poor.

808
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,300
But why did they

809
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,740
become like this today?

810
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,380
There are traces of the original abilities

811
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:27,580
where Xiao Yi Tai has been.

812
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,940
It's not like he was attacked by an outsider.

813
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,580
It's more like there's been a change inside.

814
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,580
If Xiao Yi Tai is a spirit clan,

815
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,620
he must have some kind of property.

816
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,660
Let's go to his room.

817
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,540
I didn't expect Xiao Yi Tai

818
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,180
to be a girl with a heart of gold.

819
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,740
I'm sure he's a girl with a heart of gold.

820
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,620
I'm sure he's a girl with a heart of gold.

821
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,100
General Yan,

822
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,820
since you have to follow me,

823
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,220
you have to help me.

824
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,220
What do you want?

825
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,540
See if there are any places

826
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,860
that the spirit clan can't touch,

827
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,780
eat, use, and play.

828
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,820
See if there are any places that are not right.

829
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,660
If you want to know these things,

830
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,340
just ask the people around him.

831
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:24,700
I know.

832
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,940
I know.

833
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:31,940
I know.

834
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:32,940

I know.

I know.

842
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,940
I know.

843
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,940
I know.

844
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,940
I know.

845
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,940
I know.

846
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,940
I know.

847
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:45,940
I know.

848
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,940
I know.

849
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,940
I know.

I know.

851
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,940
I know.

852

I know.

853
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,940
I know.

858
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,940

859
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,940

867
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,940

903
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,940

904
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,940

907
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,940

908
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:46,940

I know.

918
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,940
I know.

919
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,940
When two hearts are so close

920
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,940
When the whole world is occupied by you

921
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:09,940
I will use my soul to find you

922
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:14,940
Until I find your memory

923
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:20,940
You are my only

924
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:27,940
My only

925
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:31,940
This city is so far away

926
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,940
I can't find love

927
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:39,940
I hide my heart

928
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:43,940
And make a decision for you

929
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:56,940
I will use my soul to find you

930
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,940
Until I find your memory
