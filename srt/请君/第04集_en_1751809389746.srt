1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let go even if you walk away from me

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You ask me, it's not me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You ask me, it's not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's not me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's not me

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Farewell

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Episode 6

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What secret is hidden in Yu Family's temple?

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Why it is so secretive?

11
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
There is no secret

12
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I have been there so many times

13
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Nothing is special

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Could you show me?

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
No

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yu Family's temple

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,040
only on important days

18
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,520
when we worship ancestors.

19
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,680
And only the Yu family can do it.

20
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,720
By the way,

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,400
after we get married tomorrow,

22
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,640
you'll be a member of the Yu family.

23
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,760
The next morning,

24
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,480
I can take you to worship ancestors.

25
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,040
For you.

26
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,280
For me?

27
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,080
Take the thing that will make you a brother.

28
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,920
I know.

29
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:03,720
It's a good chance.

30
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,720
I'll eat and sleep with it every day.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,760
Don't worry.

32
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,120
After today's

33
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,040
life-saving friendship,

34
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,160
after we get married,

35
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,360
I won't bully you anymore.

36
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,360
I'll be nice to you.

37
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,680
No matter why the ancestors came,

38
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,440
I have to protect her from the full moon.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,280
Chief is out now,

40
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,200
let's go punish that thief.

41
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:32,920
Erase him.

42
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,880
Come on, without further ado.

43
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,840
I got to the toilet.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The lady went to the men's toilet

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The lady went to the men's toilet

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Second master

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Second master

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
This time it's not a joke

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The big master really wants to get a second house back

50
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's definitely not a joke

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's about Dingding

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's not good

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The big master is apparently fascinated by that man

54
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
When the wind blows

55
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
We have to blow our Qingquan village apart

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I don't agree with an outsider being our master

57
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I think this Lu Yiniang is nothing bad

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
At least he can control our big master

59
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Anyway

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Lu Yiniang is also a man

61
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Since ancient times, the male master loves the female master

62
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
This is the right person

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes, Young Master

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
When will our Qingquan Village

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's the turn of a lady to be the master

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Have you put our boss in your eyes

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No, no

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Although it's the big master

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Isn't she a little girl in the early years?

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The position of the owner

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
The business of the other two

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Who does it, who does it

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What are you doing?

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yes, yes

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't fight, don't fight

77
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm still here

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I really didn't expect

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The big master was actually fascinated by a male fox

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Logically speaking

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He should also marry

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Gu Beixi, who has been in love with him since childhood

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The big master doesn't mean that to Gu Beixi

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Come and see for yourself

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This is the wedding sticker for Gu Beixi

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Look

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Who am I going to write?

88
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Who am I going to write?

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What are you doing, boss

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Why are you here by yourself

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The wedding invitation of the Qingquan Village

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I just met the day before yesterday

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Will be married tomorrow

94
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I said we shouldn't go

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We shouldn't go

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But get married

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
How big is it

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Obviously let us bleed

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Can we get on this road?

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
No

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yes

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I have to go to a big deal

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You go to the warehouse to find two good things

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
By the way, find out my ancestor's dagger

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What are you doing?

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That little white face

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Isn't it a woman who is seduced by face?

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The little master just scratched his face

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
See how he seduces a woman

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Over there

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Over there

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Hurry up

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Everyone, move away

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Come on, everyone, move away

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Be careful

116
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Be careful

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is mine

118
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Come on, everyone, move away

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Boss Gu

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This way, this way

121
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Please

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Move away

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Look at it

124
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I said can you pay attention

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Your boss's wedding dress

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But the top of the first class is good

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
This whole place

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Why are you so careless

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You two hurry up and take it

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Sorry, Boss Bu

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hurry up, hurry up

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Give the master's wedding dress to the master

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
OK

134
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Boss Bu

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You said the wedding dress is a small thing

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You still run a trip in person

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
How inappropriate it is

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You're welcome

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You're welcome

140
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This is for your boss's wedding gift

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Good, this is good

142
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And this is for your boss's gift

143
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
This smell

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Thank you, thank you

145
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The second master is combing his hair for the master

146
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I'll give this to the second master in person

147
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
OK

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I can't say it without drinking a cup

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Of course

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
No drunk, no ghost

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
OK

152
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Come and send Boss Bu over

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Boss Bu

154
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Please, please

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
See you later

156
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
See you later

157
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm a good dog

158
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The creditors of the eighteen hills today

159
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
All here

160
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Much richer than their Qingquan debt

161
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Let's stay today

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Meet this big blessing

163
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If it's done

164
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The business of next year will be there

165
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Small one

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Small, small

167
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Say that again

168
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Small

169
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
зай

170
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What co stayed

171
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Boss Bu

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Strong

173
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I think so

174
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Then I left

175
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Picking

176
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Grandad

177
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Follow you

178
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Never notice

179
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You come too

180
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Come

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Qin todas

182
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
wild

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Start

184
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You lost

185
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,240
Two

186
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,800
Look, I'm right.

187
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,000
You look good in everything.

188
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,680
I'll wear this later.

189
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,200
Okay.

190
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,640
You like everything.

191
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
You're a grown-up.

192
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,000
You're finally married.

193
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,320
I didn't let you down.

194
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,920
Listen to me.

195
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,960
You two should live a good life.

196
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,720
If Lu Yan dares to bully Deng Deng,

197
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,280
I'll go after him.

198
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,320
If you're here, who dares to bully me?

199
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,920
That's right.

200
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,160
Second Father,

201
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,640
it's good that you're here.

202
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,080
Otherwise,

203
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,400
my mother would have died.

204
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,000
My father is not at home.

205
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,480
I don't know what will happen to him.

206
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,480
He's doing fine.

207
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,840
Your father is here.

208
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,000
And your eldest father.

209
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,000
Let's not talk about it.

210
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Today is a big day.

211
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,040
Let's not talk about it.

212
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,920
Okay?

213
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,200
Okay.

214
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,520
Your father is really something.

215
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,600
He's been...

216
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,640
He's been doing good for you.

217
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,240
It's reasonable.

218
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,440
I don't want to keep good things.

219
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,240
I just want him to be with me.

220
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,600
But...

221
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,800
What time is it?

222
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,560
Why isn't he back yet?

223
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,480
Did he not send the letter?

224
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,480
It's already been sent.

225
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,720
Someone went to pick him up at the station.

226
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,680
He should be back.

227
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,280
Boss!

228
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,160
Boss, the wedding dress is here.

229
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,520
Okay, put it here.

230
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,240
Okay.

231
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,840
Thank you.

232
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,440
I'll go change.

233
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,440
I'm busy.

234
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,240
I'm leaving.

235
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:37,080
Sir, I didn't expect that this wedding dress

236
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
would look good on you.

237
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,040
Are you serious?

238
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,360
I didn't expect the beauty of this village

239
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,560
to be like this.

240
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,640
I don't like it anyway.

241
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,280
Hurry up!

242
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,560
Lift the sedan chair up!

243
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,520
Slowly.

244
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,160
Back!

245
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,280
Hurry up!

246
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,640
Come on, guys, lift it up!

247
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,520
Slowly.

248
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,320
Lift it up.

249
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,280
Okay.

250
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,240
Okay.

251
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,280
Okay.

252
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,480
Okay.

253
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,440
Okay.

254
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,880
Okay.

255
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,080
What are you doing?

256
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,320
Lu Yun Niang,

257
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,800
the boss asked me to lift the sedan chair

258
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,080
that you're about to sit on.

259
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,880
What a joke!

260
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:12,440
Since ancient times,

261
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,200
men don't sit on the sedan chair.

262
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,640
Since ancient times,

263
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,120
men haven't married,

264
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,760
right?

265
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,360
Right.

266
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,040
You're a single family.

267
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,400
The boss said,

268
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,600
Lu Yun Niang,

269
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,960
please make up for it.

270
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,440
Get dressed up and put the sedan chair on.

271
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,800
Everyone, lift it up

272
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,600
in the village.

273
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,640
Then go to the wedding hall.

274
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,680
Right.

275
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,480
Right.

276
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,840
Please be busy.

277
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,760
Don't waste time.

278
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,160
Guys,

279
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,960
back!

280
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,840
Please come in.

281
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,760
What a big box!

282
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,640
Congratulations!

283
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,360
Good luck!

284
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,320
Good luck!

285
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,360
Drink more.

286
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:56,840
Boss.

287
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:57,880
You go to the boss.

288
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,520
I'll keep an eye on it.

289
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,880
I'll keep an eye on it.

290
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,920
Okay.

291
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,640
Great.

292
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,280
Boss Bu gave you a gift.

293
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,280
Take it.

294
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,080
I'll go over there.

295
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,320
I'm thirsty.

296
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,480
You're drunk.

297
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,000
Are you drunk?

298
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,280
Right.

299
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:15,880
I can't drink.

300
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,520
Good luck!

301
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,240
Go!

302
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:17,960
I'll go over there.

303
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,080
Go!

304
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,040
Boss, take a breath.

305
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,840
Take a breath.

306
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,560
Harder.

307
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,440
Harder.

308
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,880
Right.

309
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,080
Oh, no.

310
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,280
What should we do?

311
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,600
Don't worry.

312
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,320
Don't panic.

313
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,240
Boss Bu is still in our village.

314
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,680
Go call him over and give him a massage.

315
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,320
Go.

316
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,360
Go to see Boss Bu.

317
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,440
It's too tight.

318
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,400
Master.

319
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,160
It's...

320
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,040
What's wrong, master?

321
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,000
Are you holding yourself up

322
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,120
because you're wearing a wedding dress?

323
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,640
Da Hai.

324
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,640
Why don't you

325
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,400
look like a woman?

326
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,920
Why are you...

327
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,200
Master.

328
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,040
Why are you

329
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,720
so cruel?

330
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,760
Look.

331
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,520
When other people get married,

332
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,360
they all have a pretty

333
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,640
and lovely bride.

334
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,480
When I get married,

335
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:20,920
I'm surrounded by

336
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,280
a bunch of men.

337
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,720
I always feel like

338
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm not interesting.

339
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,840
I also hope that

340
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,360
I have a bride

341
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,640
who's lively and cheerful

342
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,920
and helps me to look pretty.

343
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:31,720
That would be great.

344
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:32,680
Master.

345
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,280
We don't need a bride.

346
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,040
Is there such a thing?

347
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,200
I don't

348
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,960
pay much attention to it.

349
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,800
I just want to

350
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,600
pay attention to it once.

351
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,200
Fine.

352
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:57,960
Master.

353
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,080
What's wrong?

354
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,760
I have a secret.

355
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,080
I can tell you.

356
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,160
But you must not

357
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,680
be anxious, master.

358
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,160
I'm not anxious.

359
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:09,880
Tell me.

360
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,480
I'm afraid you'll be anxious.

361
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,640
Wait for me.

362
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,600
What are you looking for?

363
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,480
What are you doing?

364
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,560
Why are you holding the wine?

365
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,520
Master.

366
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,160
Don't blink.

367
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,440
I...

368
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,680
You haven't been married yet.

369
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,080
Why are you...

370
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,080
Why are you so anxious?

371
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,200
Look at you.

372
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,880
Why are you so happy?

373
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,600
What's wrong?

374
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,360
Da Hai.

375
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:39,880
Look at you.

376
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,920
Don't drink.

377
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,320
You...

378
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,320
Should I find a doctor

379
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,960
to check on you?

380
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,600
What's wrong?

381
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,640
Da Hai.

382
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,920
Are you okay?

383
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,360
Master.

384
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,880
Don't be so excited.

385
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,720
You...

386
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:01,880
You...

387
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,560
Da Hai.

388
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,320
I...

389
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,520
I became a woman

390
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,040
after drinking.

391
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,160
This...

392
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,600
My god.

393
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,480
How could this happen?

394
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,600
How could this happen?

395
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,480
Master, this is a big mistake.

396
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,120
You became a woman

397
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,400
after drinking.

398
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,000
A man is a man,

399
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,360
while a woman is a woman.

400
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,920
Did you become like this

401
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,800
because you were hurt?

402
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:36,840
Yes.

403
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,760
I didn't even think about it.

404
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,400
I'm sure.

405
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,480
I've been like this since yesterday.

406
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,600
I changed after drinking.

407
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,560
I changed after drinking.

408
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,920
I'll be fine after I get over it.

409
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,280
Master.

410
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,560
I wasn't like this

411
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,240
before I got hurt.

412
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,440
I knew it.

413
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,240
They said

414
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,320
you didn't go back to sleep last night.

415
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,080
I thought you went to drink.

416
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,280
I didn't.

417
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,040
I'm not a man.

418
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,480
How could I go back?

419
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
I'll be hurt if I go back.

420
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,080
Stop laughing.

421
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,400
I know.

422
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,360
This is the post-traumatic stress disorder

423
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,440
that the doctor said.

424
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,680
It's too serious.

425
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,600
What should I do?

426
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,360
Can I go back?

427
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:29,720
I'm done.

428
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,320
I know.

429
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,840
This is the science

430
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,680
that Gu Bei Xi mentioned.

431
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,960
He said that science

432
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,200
can cure many problems.

433
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,320
After we get married,

434
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,040
I'll ask Gu Bei Xi

435
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,160
to find the science

436
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:41,960
to cure you.

437
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,320
Okay.

438
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,040
I'll try.

439
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,360
Master.

440
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,800
There's no other way.

441
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,440
There's no other choice.

442
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,560
You.

443
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:50,920
Come here.

444
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,360
Come here.

445
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,080
Come here.

446
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,680
Practice first.

447
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,320
They'll pour me wine

448
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,440
when we get married.

449
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,960
If you're not by my side,

450
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,640
they'll pour me more.

451
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,360
How can I

452
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,880
make up my mind after I drink too much?

453
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:04,920
If I let Lu Yan

454
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,720
look down on me

455
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,760
on the night of our wedding,

456
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,640
I'll be

457
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,920
on his head

458
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,800
for the rest of my life.

459
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,400
Okay, master.

460
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,680
Don't worry.

461
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,280
I've made up your mind.

462
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,560
You and that Lu Yi Niang

463
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,760
will make up your mind.

464
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,280
Ouch.

465
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,960
Good brother.

466
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,760
It's all on you.

467
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,560
Go get a woman's dress.

468
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,200
Okay.

469
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,760
I'm coming in.

470
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,280
Is she your new maid?

471
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,960
Boss Bu, hurry up.

472
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,240
Help me check my clothes.

473
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,960
It's open.

474
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,680
It's open.

475
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,640
Why are you so careless?

476
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,000
Luckily, you still have time.

477
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,560
I said my clothes weren't suitable.

478
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,920
They're too tight.

479
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,560
Come on.

480
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:56,840
Let me sew it for you.

481
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,880
Which one is not

482
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,240
made of blood, sweat and money?

483
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,680
The boss used to marry

484
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,080
with a thick cloth.

485
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,800
Why did he spend this money

486
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,080
to suffer this?

487
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,360
It's worth it.

488
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,720
The new maid?

489
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,160
You don't understand.

490
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,160
This is the romance

491
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,360
that's said overseas.

492
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,840
Romantic.

493
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,120
What did you say?

494
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,960
I thought that the fish owner

495
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,240
was a playboy

496
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,600
who was having fun.

497
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,280
I didn't expect that

498
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,000
I was the one who was in the mud.

499
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,680
What do you mean?

500
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,320
You mean Lu Yan was acting in a play.

501
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,680
I'm the only one who's willing to do it.

502
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,040
Isn't it obvious?

503
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,480
Nonsense.

504
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,000
Make it clear.

505
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,000
I'm a man.

506
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,080
I know women.

507
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,000
I know men better.

508
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,480
If a man likes you,

509
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,280
his eyes will keep staring at you.

510
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,040
His ears will run with you.

511
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,120
They'll touch you.

512
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,640
They'll care about you.

513
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,120
They'll tell you everything.

514
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,760
If you're hurt or in pain,

515
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,280
he'll be happy to leave you alone.

516
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,160
You'll be happy.

517
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,600
He'll be happier than you.

518
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:30,600
Think about it.

519
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,320
Is your aunt Lu like this?

520
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,520
How much do you know about her?

521
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,640
Do you believe that I'll have roasted chicken tonight?

522
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,840
How dare you?

523
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,680
What era is this?

524
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,040
And someone's surname is Li Yingzuo.

525
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,160
Wait for me.

526
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,280
I'm in pain.

527
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,640
Carry me.

528
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,720
Go by yourself.

529
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,800
It's not the old days.

530
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,640
Free love is about two-sided love.

531
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,000
Did you talk too much?

532
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,640
We fought a lot.

533
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,680
How do you know

534
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,680
she doesn't love someone else?

535
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,920
Women are like water in the water.

536
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,200
They're afraid of water.

537
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,720
They'll be in the water all night.

538
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,040
I like her.

539
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,320
As long as she's with me,

540
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,240
it doesn't matter if she's sincere or not.

541
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,160
As long as you're happy.

542
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,440
Master,

543
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,040
the other lords are here.

544
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,480
Master, please go to welcome them.

545
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,440
Got it.

546
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,560
Master, bye.

547
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,080
I'm so sad.

548
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:00,920
Look.

549
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,520
The lords are here.

550
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,080
Where did you find this pretty girl?

551
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,280
I've never seen her.

552
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,480
What are you looking at?

553
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,240
I'm here to pay you a lot.

554
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,520
Look at me.

555
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,440
Be more polite.

556
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,000
The lords of Tang Ying Village

557
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,600
have a box of gold.

558
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,960
One piece of cloth.

559
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,400
Two pieces of silver.

560
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,320
The lords of Beizhou Village

561
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:25,960
have two wild chickens.

562
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,680
Look, four pieces.

563
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,640
Four pieces.

564
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,480
Master,

565
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,040
we're so lucky.

566
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,880
I didn't expect these old men

567
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,160
to return to the palace one by one.

568
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,200
Master, what are you thinking?

569
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,200
Later,

570
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,280
we'll take these rice noodles and beef back.

571
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,080
We'll take some of them

572
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,840
back to the villagers.

573
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,360
Then we'll ask around

574
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,480
and see which one

575
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,360
has a patient

576
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,320
and has a child.

577
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,680
Then we'll burn more silver.

578
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,480
Okay.

579
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,120
Let's go.

580
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,320
Let's go.

581
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:57,560
Master of Beigou Village.

582
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:58,760
Master Yu.

583
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,200
You're so lucky.

584
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,760
Master Yu is young and promising.

585
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,360
At a young age,

586
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,360
he married a family of two.

587
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:07,960
He's so good.

588
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,720
Why didn't I see you in the main room?

589
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,680
I'm sorry.

590
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,120
It's just a small scene.

591
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,280
Compared to the Madam Yi

592
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,400
who married you in the eighth and ninth rooms,

593
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,920
it's definitely incomparable.

594
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,960
What a coincidence!

595
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,120
The master of Nanfeng Village is here.

596
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,480
Master,

597
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,160
the people of Nanfeng Village are here.

598
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,160
The 18 mountains

599
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,360
are the most glorious

600
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,400
in the marriage of the old uncle.

601
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,840
The seven eyes are the most arrogant.

602
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,560
They're all good things.

603
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,360
Look at them.

604
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I haven't been here for a long time.

605
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,840
How did your village break down like this?

606
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,200
Even half of the wedding

607
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,240
is so bitter.

608
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,720
You're so lucky.

609
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,160
Compared to the Nanfeng Village,

610
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,360
it's definitely incomparable.

611
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,880
The Master of Nanfeng Village is so generous.

612
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,640
So many goods.

613
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,600
It's big enough.

614
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:05,880
This is so good.

615
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,280
Master, Master, Master.

616
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,240
Master?

617
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,320
Why does he call you Master?

618
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,840
Where's Da Hai?

619
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,760
You got married and he's been slacking off, right?

620
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,280
He can call me whatever he wants.

621
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,320
It's none of your business.

622
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,640
What do you mean by giving these away?

623
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:22,840
You got married

624
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,440
just to collect the gifts, right?

625
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,200
Yu Deng Deng,

626
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,160
if you're poor,

627
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,360
you should have told me earlier.

628
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,720
We grew up together.

629
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,160
I can't just watch you starve to death.

630
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,240
What do you mean by looking for a white face?

631
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,280
You're disgusted with me, right?

632
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,120
I think

633
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,120
we should unite as soon as possible.

634
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,800
How much do you want?

635
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,840
Come on.

636
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,080
What's your idea?

637
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,440
You think I don't know?

638
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,040
What do you mean?

639
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,600
All these years,

640
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,280
you've done so many things.

641
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,160
You've done so many things.

642
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,200
Don't think I don't know.

643
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,280
You just want

644
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,040
your business team to smuggle the opium

645
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,480
and get to my place.

646
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,080
I'm telling you,

647
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,600
as long as I'm alive,

648
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,880
don't even think about it.

649
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,000
You're thinking too much.

650
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,640
I know.

651
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,400
I've been in a mess

652
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,520
with that scumbag business team.

653
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,640
They're forbidden to smuggle opium

654
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,840
in Jiuzhou.

655
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,440
I support them.

656
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,520
It's just a gift for you.

657
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,720
It's not that complicated.

658
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,080
Are you out of your mind?

659
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,800
It's not your style to be a gentleman.

660
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,720
You know me well.

661
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,400
One day,

662
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,000
you'll be mine

663
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,280
no matter what.

664
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,160
Get out of here.

665
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,920
You want to take over our stock.

666
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,040
Go to your dream.

667
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,120
Let's go.

668
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,000
Hurry up.

669
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,800
Put it away.

670
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,760
Put it away.

671
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,800
Master,

672
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,880
I think Gu Bei Xi is good.

673
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,560
He's rich and has a way.

674
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,680
He's even better than you.

675
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,360
If you take him as your nanny,

676
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,960
we won't have to worry about money anymore.

677
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,320
He's good.

678
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,720
But he can't fool you.

679
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,360
Put away the gifts.

680
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,560
After the wedding,

681
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,160
let the Second Master see

682
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,880
what kind of dirty goods he got.

683
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,200
What?

684
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,600
We've always been in a bad relationship with Nansong.

685
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,360
How could Gu Bei Xi

686
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,360
be so generous to us?

687
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,360
He didn't steal them from us

688
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,560
and made us dirty.

689
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,520
Nansong is really good.

690
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,560
Of course.

691
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,000
We're no match for him.

692
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,240
It's weird.

693
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,160
He even gave us a gift.

694
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,080
I think

695
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,680
your master

696
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,840
doesn't look down on Gu Bei Xi.

697
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,440
I know.

698
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,520
He must like

699
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,000
a clean and innocent girl like Lu Yi Niang.

700
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,760
Look at Gu Bei Xi.

701
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,000
He's so long and slender.

702
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,360
He can't do that.

703
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,960
If he cut his hair,

704
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,040
I think he can be in your master's eyes.

705
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,960
Did you hear that?

706
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,920
I did.

707
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,040
What's going on?

708
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,080
He's not good at it.

709
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,440
And he even gave us a gift.

710
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,520
What are you listening to?

711
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,280
What did he say?

712
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,160
Deng Deng said he likes short hair.

713
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,000
I knew it.

714
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,760
Deng Deng has never been

715
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,520
nice to me in all these years.

716
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,720
It's all because of his hair.

717
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,040
I don't know what you're listening to.

718
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,240
What's wrong with you?

719
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,240
clarify

720
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,000
Hso,

721
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,220
Pinky

722
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,000
Boss,

723
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,640
this hairpin isinta

724
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,680
it doesn't fit you.

725
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,040
Take it off.

726
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,760
I can take out a woman's hairpin

727
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
at will.

728
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,960
Does she really have another lover?

729
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,680
What if her mother left her hairpin?

730
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,600
It's not impossible.

731
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,680
If I hurt He Qi because of this,

732
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,800
I won't try.

733
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,320
Forget it.

734
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
There's nothing more suitable.

735
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,480
Let's do this.

736
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,720
Boss.

737
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,600
Boss.

738
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,320
Let's send a car to pick up the old owner.

739
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,720
All the cars are here.

740
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,240
I didn't pick it up.

741
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,880
The ride is almost here.

742
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,360
The Palace Museum is ready.

743
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,520
How about...

744
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,320
Forget it.

745
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
Let's prepare the ceremony.

746
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,720
Okay.

747
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,440
Why am I here?

748
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,040
How do I know why you're here?

749
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,560
Hurry up.

750
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,080
It's too late.

751
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,560
Prepare the ceremony.

752
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,080
What?

753
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:51,720
You guys play first.

754
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,400
I'll be back in a minute.

755
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,080
How is it?

756
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,320
Is it good?

757
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,600
You're really good at business.

758
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,440
Boss Bu, you're really good at business.

759
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,400
Boss Bu.

760
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,440
The owner of the North Gorge.

761
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,520
It's really hard.

762
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,080
Look at what you said.

763
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,200
A small gift for you.

764
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,160
You just give me one?

765
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,840
Of course.

766
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,200
Uncle.

767
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,600
What's wrong with you?

768
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,600
I heard you were a little dizzy just now.

769
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,640
I'm old.

770
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,560
I didn't eat anything this morning.

771
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,040
I'm a little dizzy.

772
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,000
I've been lying down for a while.

773
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,680
I feel much better.

774
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,400
Then you should take more.

775
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,720
After you're done,

776
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,840
drink more and eat more.

777
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,880
Okay.

778
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,000
Let me know if you need anything.

779
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,800
Okay.

780
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,400
You're busy.

781
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,120
Okay.

782
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,040
Take that.

783
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,560
Come on.

784
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,240
You're good.

785
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,480
You know how to cut hair.

786
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,080
You just cut your hair.

787
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,280
It feels like you're bald.

788
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,800
It's like you're not wearing clothes.

789
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,880
I just cut my hair.

790
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,160
I'm used to it after a long time.

791
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,520
Did he understand what I said to Yu Deng Deng?

792
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,160
He didn't understand it now.

793
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,680
He'll understand it sooner or later.

794
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,360
Besides,

795
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,200
you cut your hair

796
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,400
because he likes it.

797
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,040
Yes.

798
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,200
I mean

799
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,480
you and him are a couple.

800
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,440
Nanfeng and Qingquan are strong and united.

801
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,200
They're a good couple.

802
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,920
They're a good couple.

803
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,440
The guns, money and medicine we sent out

804
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,280
are still ours.

805
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,320
Even his people are ours.

806
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,000
What's the use of you understanding it?

807
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,840
I asked him if Yu Deng Deng understood it.

808
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,320
I feel like I've said it for a long time.

809
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,760
He's still indifferent.

810
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,240
Boss.

811
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,200
Yu Deng Deng can take men.

812
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,000
He's strong and cruel.

813
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
He's not a normal person.

814
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,800
You want to get him completely.

815
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,160
You need time.

816
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,480
You can't be impatient.

817
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,280
The problem is

818
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,400
we have to get rid of that blind man first.

819
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,000
Let's go.

820
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,600
Okay.

821
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,560
Sir.

822
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,360
It's been a long time.

823
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,680
Why are you still writing?

824
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,720
To cultivate the mind and the mind.

825
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,040
I know.

826
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,240
Is it because of Yu Deng Deng

827
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,120
that you're afraid that he's upset with you?

828
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,840
He won't be quiet tonight.

829
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,320
Or else,

830
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,920
when you enter the bridal chamber,

831
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,520
I'll make him dizzy and then...

832
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,560
Get married?

833
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,840
You're here.

834
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,040
Why are you hiding?

835
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,600
What're you doing here?

836
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,480
It's a little bit earnings.

837
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,760
They came attack us that day.

838
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
It was you who shot later, right?

839
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,240
So what?

840
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,240
Even if it's the Heavenly Palace,

841
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,040
I'll still be able to get you.

842
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,400
No one can do anything to me.

843
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,280
But you're quite pitiful.

844
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,680
I heard that you were the one who fell into the Qingquan Village.

845
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,280
I'm sure you're not willing to.

846
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,640
With this money,

847
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,600
there's a dog hole on the right side of the door.

848
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,040
You can go out from there.

849
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,360
In the future, you can split up with Yu Deng Deng

850
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,840
and draw a clear line.

851
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,560
That's a good idea.

852
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,360
Yu Deng Deng is mine.

853
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,240
Even if he's not now,

854
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,280
he'll be sooner or later.

855
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,240
You're here...

856
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,720
to love me.

857
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,720
We must be clear about Bubble.

858
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,120
noodles.

859
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,280
He can free your mind

860
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,580
with a open body

861
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:13,580
and make the

862
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,680
light of the coalition into the明日adder,

863
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:24,420
which the colonel is

864
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,060
Here.

865
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,140
It's time.

866
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,300
The village head is coming.

867
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,500
The village head is good.

868
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,380
She's so beautiful.

869
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,580
The groom is so lucky.

870
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,500
No matter how beautiful she is,

871
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,620
you're willing to be her second wife.

872
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,380
I'm not.

873
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:55,540
She's so beautiful.

874
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,980
The bride is so beautiful.

875
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,100
She must be very beautiful.

876
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,340
The village head is not

877
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,060
someone who can be so beautiful.

878
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,860
The village head is so beautiful.

879
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,180
The groom is coming.

880
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,260
The sound of the drum is so loud.

881
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:28,740
The bridegroom is coming.

882
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,180
The fire is burning.

883
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,780
The trouble is over.

884
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,620
The bride is so beautiful.

885
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,420
The bride is so beautiful.

886
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,060
The love between husband and wife

887
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,540
is like a couple.

888
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,260
The auspicious time has come.

889
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,340
If a man likes you,

890
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,460
his eyes will keep staring at you.

891
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,860
Bow to heaven and earth.

892
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,740
Good.

893
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,580
Bow to the elders.

894
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:20,740
Look.

895
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,740
Good.

896
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:25,740
Good.

897
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:29,060
Bow to each other.

898
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,260
Don't go too far.

899
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:37,260
It's enough.

900
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,260
The bride is so beautiful.

901
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,260
The bride is so beautiful.

902
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,260
The bride is so beautiful.

903
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,260
It's enough.

904
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,260
Am I a wolf or a tiger?

905
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,260
I tell you.

906
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,060
I've signed this hand.

907
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,660
Even if it's a play,

908
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:55,660
you have to make this play safe for me.

909
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,260
When you get married today and bow to heaven,

910
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,260
you'll be my wife.

911
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,260
You can only be good at it.

912
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,260
Be a second wife to me.

913
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,660
You're so mean.

914
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,860
I've said it.

915
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,260
It's enough.

916
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,260
Sorry to bother you.

917
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,460
Madam Lu.

918
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:17,260
According to the rules,

919
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,260
you have to give Dahong a cup of tea.

920
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,860
Please.

921
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,260
It's so funny.

922
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,260
I told you.

923
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,260
As a man,

924
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:32,260
how can you be so mean?

925
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,260
So mean.

926
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,260
I'm sorry.

927
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,260
I'm sorry.

928
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,260
I'm sorry.

929
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,260
I'm sorry.

930
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,260
I'm sorry.

931
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,260
I'm sorry.

932
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,260
I'm sorry.

933
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,260
I'm sorry.

934
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,260
I'm sorry.

935
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,260
I'm sorry.

936
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,260
I'm sorry.

937
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,260
I'm sorry.

938
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,260
I'm sorry.

939
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:10,260
I'm sorry.

940
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,260
I'm sorry.

941
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,260
I'm sorry.

942
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,260
I'm sorry.

943
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,260
I'm sorry.

944
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:20,260
I'm sorry.

945
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,260
I'm sorry.

946
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,260
I'm sorry.

947
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,260
I'm sorry.

948
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,260
I'm sorry.

949
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,260
I'm sorry.

950
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,260
I'm sorry.

951
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,260
I'm sorry.

952
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,260
I'm sorry.

953
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,260
I'm sorry.

954
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,260
I'm sorry.

955
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:45,260
I hide my heart.

956
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:49,260
I make a decision for you.

957
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:14,260
When two hearts are so close.

958
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:18,260
When the whole world is occupied by you.

959
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:22,260
I will call your name with all my heart.

960
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:27,260
Until your memory.

961
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:33,260
You are the scenery I have for you.

962
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:40,260
The scenery I have for you.

963
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:42,260
The city is you.

964
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,260
You and me.

965
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:47,260
We are separated by love.

966
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:52,260
I hide my heart.

967
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,260
I make a decision for you.

968
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,260
I'm sorry.

969
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,260
I'm sorry.

970
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,260
I'm sorry.

971
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,260
I'm sorry.

972
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,260
I'm sorry.

973
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,260
I'm sorry.

974
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,260
I'm sorry.

975
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,260
I'm sorry.

976
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,260
I'm sorry.

977
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,260
I'm sorry.

978
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,260
I'm sorry.

979
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,260
I'm sorry.

980
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,260
I'm sorry.

981
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,260
I'm sorry.
