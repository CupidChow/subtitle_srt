1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,040
I still miss you

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,240
The rainbow falls

3
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,040
The past is hard to forget

4
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,200
Tears fall

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,680
And turn into a bitter sea

6
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,200
Fate falls

7
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,360
Love is buried

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,360
Love and hate are inextricable

9
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,200
Follow me

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,080
Let go

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:00,800
Go away

12
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,640
I won't let go

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,320
It's not me

14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,240
Because you're not me

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,240
Because you're not me

16
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,240
Because you're not me

17
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,240
Because you're not me

18
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,920
Old man

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,480
You know your own girl's temper

20
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,920
Can I stop her?

21
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,960
And one more thing

22
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,320
I dare not say

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,320
Just that Chuan Chuan

24
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,160
I almost killed your girl

25
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,800
What did you say

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,160
How do you talk, Gu Bei Xin

27
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,040
Annoy her

28
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,600
You talk too much

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,720
My dad, dad, dad

30
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,600
She's talking nonsense

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,480
There's no such thing

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,200
Don't talk about me first

33
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:15,840
Talk about you

34
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,880
What's wrong with you

35
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,640
I asked Lu Yan to investigate that missing case

36
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,680
How did you get into it

37
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,280
What missing case

38
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,000
It's Ling Chong's crime

39
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,800
You know Ling Chong

40
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,200
I know it

41
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,800
Ling Chong is still bothering me

42
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,600
Master Yu

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,760
Peng Dahai is now identified by Director Bai

44
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,440
The murderer of the missing case

45
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,040
Now locked in the police station

46
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,400
I hope you can

47
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,840
Tell me everything you know

48
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,680
Give Peng Dahai a clear picture

49
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,880
I'll tell my daughter

50
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,280
Go out

51
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,040
Dad

52
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,240
Go out

53
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,440
We have to save Dahai

54
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:55,840
You

55
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,200
Wait

56
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,640
Nothing

57
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,200
Then I'll go out first

58
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,080
No, Lu Yan

59
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,520
Don't be angry

60
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,280
No, Old Yu, he's like this

61
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,320
I'll find you later

62
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:08,800
Come on, come on, come on

63
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,680
Don't put it in your heart

64
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,400
Not old Yu

65
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,600
You said you were a grown man

66
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,320
Still so willful

67
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,960
Sit down

68
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,480
Let me tell you

69
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,320
Three months ago

70
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,400
The spirit tribe came to me for help

71
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,400
Said someone was lost

72
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,320
At first I didn't care

73
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,360
Then I found out

74
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,560
Ghost city

75
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,720
And the disappearance of Yingdu

76
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,920
More and more

77
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,280
How many people

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,280
Less than a hundred people

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,600
One day I found out

80
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,480
By Ling Chong

81
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,120
Spirit tribe that was swallowed up

82
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,800
At that time his body

83
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,800
Very fragile

84
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,480
Almost transparent body

85
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,880
I tried my best to learn

86
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,680
I couldn't stop him from being out of energy

87
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
There is something in your body

88
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,680
In the West is your energy

89
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,600
I can't help you

90
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,280
Sorry

91
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,400
Ghost

92
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,320
Ghost city

93
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,760
Chang...Changle restaurant

94
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,200
Chang...Changle

95
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,720
I found out

96
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,920
These missing cases

97
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,440
Not kidnapping

98
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,960
But by Ling Chong

99
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,880
The spirit tribe that was swallowed up

100
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,280
So you went to the restaurant to find out

101
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,320
I found out after I went

102
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,280
My spirits

103
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,000
It was sold by the boss of Changle Restaurant

104
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,680
But with his ability

105
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,800
Absolutely not equipped

106
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,320
The ability to feed this bug

107
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,560
So after the purchase method of Mo Qing

108
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,440
I just like to eat mung beans

109
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,760
Go

110
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,720
Husband, have some tea

111
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,680
Is there wine?

112
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Sir, you must be joking.

113
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,680
There is no wine in this tavern.

114
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,680
How can it be called a tavern?

115
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
High-quality wine, millet wine,

116
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
from the farm to the farm,

117
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,680
you can order whatever you want.

118
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,680
I want the wine from the grass,

119
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,680
not the grass, not the wine.

120
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
Go, go, go.

121
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
Sir,

122
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,680
people will get drunk with this wine.

123
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,680
It's only sold to the spiritual clan,

124
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,680
not to people.

125
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,680
This is the rule.

126
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
Mr. Tian,

127
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,680
it's getting late,

128
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,680
it's time to close.

129
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,680
You can go.

130
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,680
How much do you want?

131
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,680
50.

132
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
Five.

133
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
Okay.

134
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
Okay, sir.

135
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,680
You can walk around,

136
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
wait for me to get the goods.

137
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,680
I'll come back in an hour.

138
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,680
I know he doesn't have

139
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,680
so much spiritual graces.

140
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,680
He must go to the Shang family

141
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
to get the goods.

142
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,680
So after I came out,

143
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,680
I was staring at him.

144
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
The time is up.

145
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Be careful of the fire.

146
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,680
It's been a long time.

147
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
The time is up.

148
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,680
Please keep it in mind.

149
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,680
I'll come back.

150
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,680
Bye.

151
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,680
Come again.

152
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
I'll go.

153
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,680
Okay.

154
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,680
The light is still on even when the door is closed.

155
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
It must be their street code.

156
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
It's possible.

157
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,680
It's autumn.

158
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,680
There are so many mosquitoes.

159
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,680
It's itchy.

160
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
What's wrong?

161
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,680
On the left,

162
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,680
it's itchy all over.

163
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
It has nothing to do with mosquitoes.

164
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
It's time to take a bath.

165
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
My scalp.

166
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,680
My scalp.

167
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
Are you feeling better?

168
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,680
Are you feeling better?

169
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
What happened after that?

170
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
What happened after that?

171
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Who is that man?

172
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
Not a lady.

173
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
Pearl Effect.

174
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
Anything's possible.

175
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,680
Come.

176
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,680
I've agreed.

177
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,680
Anyone?

178
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
Ilsipo.

179
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
Someone?

180
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Who?

181
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,680
Kimao!

182
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
Don't run!

183
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,680
Don't run!

184
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,680
One of them ran away.

185
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,680
I'll go and find him.

186
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,680
I'll go and find him.

187
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,680
I'll go and find him.

188
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,680
Another one.

189
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
Do you think I'm jealous?

190
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,680
I think you're right.

191
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,680
That's the way it is.

192
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,680
It's the man in the windbreaker.

193
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,680
It's very likely that

194
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,680
the windbreaker he wears

195
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
is the same as the one Lu Yan wore.

196
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,680
He said I was the murderer.

197
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,680
I said he was the murderer.

198
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,680
Dad, don't talk nonsense.

199
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,680
Lu Yan wouldn't do that.

200
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,680
I believe him.

201
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,680
You take a shower first.

202
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,680
I'll go and ask him.

203
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,680
Don't fall for that trickster.

204
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
Women are really not allowed to stay.

205
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,680
It's itchy again.

206
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
Left, left, left.

207
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Right, right, right.

208
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
You should wash it.

209
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,680
Wash it.

210
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,680
Lu Yan.

211
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
Lu Yan.

212
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,680
Lu Yan.

213
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
Are you okay?

214
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,680
Don't be angry.

215
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,680
My dad is a very bad person.

216
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,680
He's actually a good person.

217
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Don't take it to heart.

218
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Let me tell you.

219
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,680
It's okay.

220
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,680
I heard what you said.

221
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,680
Come on, look at this first.

222
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
Account book.

223
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,680
I think there are more than one seller.

224
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,680
The old owner said

225
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,680
according to his investigation over the past three months,

226
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,680
there are less than a hundred missing people.

227
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:51,680
But there are only a dozen of trading information in this account book.

228
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,680
So I think there are other shops in the ghost city

229
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,680
selling spirits.

230
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,680
But there are so many shops in the ghost city.

231
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,680
It's also a big deal to find it like this.

232
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
Lighting.

233
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
That's right.

234
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,680
If the light is their street sign,

235
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,680
then tonight...

236
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,680
Then tonight we'll go to the ghost city to find a high place.

237
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
When you look at the shop at the time of the purple stone,

238
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,680
turn off the light and hang up the lantern.

239
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,680
We can find the upper shelf and clear the sea.

240
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
Then we'll set off tonight.

241
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
Old fish, you haven't recovered yet.

242
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
You can't eat so oily.

243
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Don't eat it.

244
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
Come on, have a bowl of porridge.

245
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
You're obedient.

246
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,680
What's going on?

247
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
If two more pieces of beef and a basket of buns,

248
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,680
you'll recover faster.

249
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,680
Do you need another pot of old Indian food?

250
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,680
That's great.

251
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,680
Chang Yan said there's no wine without meat.

252
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680
No meat for dogs.

253
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,680
You're serious.

254
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,680
Beixi said you had something to do with me.

255
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,680
Just this?

256
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,680
Let's talk about it later.

257
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,680
I have to go to the case.

258
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:05,680
I'll bring you some wine.

259
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,680
Wait.

260
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,680
Let me ask you.

261
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,680
How did you know that guy named Lu?

262
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,680
I...

263
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
I married him.

264
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,680
I've already married Tang.

265
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,680
He's the legitimate son-in-law of our Qingquan Village.

266
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
You're married.

267
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,680
Why are you so beautiful?

268
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,680
Do you know that you're married to a murderer?

269
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
What murderer? Who killed him?

270
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
Did he want to kill you?

271
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,680
Old fish, don't worry.

272
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,680
Look at me.

273
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,680
I'm fine in front of you.

274
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,680
I'm fine.

275
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
I told you.

276
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,680
He said I had a yuan-pellet in my body.

277
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
He wanted to kill me to get the money.

278
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,680
Then he said I was a saintess.

279
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
He protected me all day.

280
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,680
What saintess?

281
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,680
You're my daughter.

282
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,680
What nonsense are you talking about?

283
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
You're so...

284
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,680
Now that it's come to this,

285
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
don't hide it from me.

286
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,680
I have something to ask you.

287
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
Go ahead.

288
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,680
Am I your daughter?

289
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
Of course.

290
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,680
Your mother was pregnant in October.

291
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,680
Your father worked so hard to raise you.

292
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
Why isn't he?

293
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,680
Don't listen to him.

294
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,680
What is this?

295
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,640
It's a

296
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
treasure.

297
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,680
You're a hunter.

298
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,680
You must know the yuan-pellet of the forest tribe.

299
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,680
Daughter,

300
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
this is the kid named Lu who gave it to you.

301
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,680
What you said is true.

302
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,680
I'm from the forest tribe.

303
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
Wait.

304
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
Now that you've grown up,

305
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,680
I'll tell you everything that happened.

306
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,680
That year...

307
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,680
You and I met

308
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,680
on the edge of the mountain.

309
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,680
We saw you alone on the edge of the mountain.

310
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,680
We took you home

311
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
and took care of your mother and I.

312
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,680
So we decided to adopt you.

313
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
Since then,

314
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
you've been in my arms

315
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,680
and cried when I was gone.

316
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,680
You were happy when I hugged you

317
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,680
and you smiled when I hugged you.

318
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
You ate a lot.

319
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,680
I've been hiding it from you

320
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,680
for so many years.

321
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,680
I just wanted...

322
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,680
I just wanted you to be safe.

323
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,680
You can grow up

324
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,680
and be a good family.

325
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,680
I was just saying.

326
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,680
Why am I stronger than others

327
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,680
and more capable than others?

328
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,680
You always say that I'm a hungry, stupid, and wronged child.

329
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,680
Now,

330
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,680
you're strong.

331
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,680
You don't recognize your father anymore.

332
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Who says I don't recognize my father?

333
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,680
Old Yu, don't worry.

334
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,680
No matter what kind of spiritual blessing he is,

335
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,680
or what kind of saint you are,

336
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,680
I'll always be your daughter.

337
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,680
I'll eat you up.

338
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,680
I'll be your wife.

339
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,680
I'll be your brother.

340
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
I'll be your sister.

341
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
I'll be your mother.

342
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,680
I'll be your father.

343
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,680
I'll be your mother.

344
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
Okay, I've made myself clear.

345
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,680
I should go.

346
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,680
I have to go investigate the case.

347
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,680
Daughter,

348
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,680
why don't you let Xing Lu go?

349
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
Why are you going?

350
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,680
No way.

351
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,680
He's the second son I married.

352
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,680
He's so handsome.

353
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,680
What if someone kidnaps him?

354
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,680
I have to take him back to Qingquan Village.

355
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,680
Besides,

356
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,680
Peng Dahai is my apprentice.

357
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,680
I have to go save him myself.

358
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,680
Don't worry, Old Yu.

359
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
I promised them

360
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,680
that I would save Xiao Yitai.

361
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,680
Didn't you teach me before?

362
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,680
It's hard to pass the test.

363
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,680
It's hard to pass the test.

364
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,680
It's hard to pass the test.

365
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,680
It's hard to pass the test.

366
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,680
I'm leaving.

367
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,680
Go ahead.

368
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,680
Come back soon.

369
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,680
Okay.

370
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,680
Don't be as willful as last time

371
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,680
when you go to the ghost market.

372
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,680
Don't worry.

373
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,680
I'll listen to you this time.

374
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,680
Daqian?

375
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Am I right?

376
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,680
Why is it Daqian?

377
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,680
Daqian.

378
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,680
Let's get ready.

379
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
Tell me more about

380
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
the weapons and equipment

381
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
you found about Bai's Mansion.

382
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,380
40 for the

383
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:11,680
40 for the

384
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,680
80 for the

385
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,680
100 for the

386
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,680
100 for the

387
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
300 for the

388
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,680
300 for the

389
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,680
300 for the

390
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
300 for the

391
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,680
300 for the

392
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,980
100 for the

393
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,180
300 for the

394
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,680
300 for the

395
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,680
300 for the

396
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,680
exponent şöyle

397
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,680
yours is

398
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,180
100 is

399
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,180
100.

400
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:35,280
Hold on.

401
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,680
Hold on.

402
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,680
Hold on.

403
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,680
He's not a bad guy.

404
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,040
Maybe he can get it wrong.

405
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,640
Right.

406
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,320
Stop it.

407
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,000
Stop it.

408
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,440
Learn from him.

409
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:46,880
Remember.

410
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,600
Don't always think of

411
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,680
using your brain.

412
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,080
Use your brain.

413
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,000
Understand?

414
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,800
Put on the suit I sewed myself.

415
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,280
Okay.

416
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:55,920
Okay.

417
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,520
Be more precise.

418
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,080
Okay.

419
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,480
Look.

420
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,040
This is good.

421
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,920
This is called brain.

422
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,520
What's this?

423
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,040
I made it myself.

424
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,280
You should be more careful.

425
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,520
You're too careless.

426
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,320
Right.

427
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,320
Sometimes I even want to

428
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,160
cut my own hair.

429
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,000
I'm so talented.

430
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:17,640
So talented.

431
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,200
Are you ready?

432
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,720
Yes.

433
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,440
Let's go.

434
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:19,960
Go.

435
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
Go.

436
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,160
Brother.

437
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:23,720
Wait.

438
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,400
Chief.

439
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,760
Chief.

440
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,560
Why didn't you go in and save you?

441
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,720
Why did you come out?

442
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,600
Right.

443
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,880
Why are you all here?

444
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,520
We're here to save you.

445
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,400
Right.

446
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,960
You didn't send a message to India.

447
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,920
I heard that you were wanted.

448
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,440
Right.

449
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,720
You were wanted in Baifu.

450
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,880
We're here to save you.

451
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,640
I'm fine.

452
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,560
And I'm looking for my father.

453
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,560
Chief.

454
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,480
Where is he?

455
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,840
He's in Baifu now.

456
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,080
But I can't make it clear.

457
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,640
Well.

458
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,240
Father.

459
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,400
Go to Baifu first.

460
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,600
Find someone to report to Gu Beixi.

461
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,720
He's great now.

462
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,280
He's the future son-in-law of Baifu.

463
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,160
He's very handsome.

464
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,880
Really?

465
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,200
The rest of you go back to the village first.

466
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,120
Wait for me to get the money.

467
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:04,560
Okay.

468
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,000
Don't let me go back.

469
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,680
I'll let you do what you want.

470
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,200
Don't talk so much.

471
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:09,720
Okay.

472
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
You're so disobedient.

473
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,600
Okay.

474
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,640
We should go now.

475
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:14,840
Okay.

476
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,560
I have something important to do.

477
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,520
I'll go first.

478
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,800
Be careful, girl.

479
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,480
Be careful.

480
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,000
Don't worry.

481
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,760
Chief.

482
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,520
Be careful.

483
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,240
Be careful.

484
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,080
Be careful.

485
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,600
Chief.

486
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,120
Take care.

487
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,080
Be careful.

488
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,680
Be careful.

489
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,440
Be careful.

490
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:29,920
Chief.

491
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,760
Be careful.

492
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,440
Don't shout.

493
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,400
Don't shout.

494
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,200
What are you shouting?

495
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,640
Don't shout.

496
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,680
Don't stand here.

497
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,720
You'll cry.

498
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,840
Go.

499
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,160
Go.

500
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,120
Why are you here?

501
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,680
Go back.

502
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,560
Go.

503
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,800
Hurry.

504
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,280
This way.

505
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,240
This way.

506
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,760
This way.

507
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,240
Go.

508
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,000
Xin.

509
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,720
Has the lantern lit up?

510
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:13,880
Not yet.

511
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:14,880
I'm watching.

512
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,040
Our guess

513
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,320
shouldn't be wrong.

514
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Let's wait a little longer.

515
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,920
Xin.

516
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,200
Come back and sit down.

517
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,800
Okay.

518
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,880
Sir.

519
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,880
Master.

520
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:41,600
Yes?

521
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,880
You two are a perfect match.

522
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,080
You two are a perfect match.

523
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,280
You two are a perfect match.

524
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,600
I like that.

525
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,720
Tell me more.

526
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,480
Look.

527
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,800
Master is

528
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,720
a gentleman.

529
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,600
Master is

530
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,640
a gentle man.

531
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Don't look at his personality.

532
00:21:59,040 --> 00:21:59,880
What are you doing?

533
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,960
Let him say.

534
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:01,960
Xin.

535
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,600
Three guests.

536
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,320
Three guests.

537
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:06,760
Sorry.

538
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,520
Sorry.

539
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,320
Sorry.

540
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,880
Sorry.

541
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,160
We're really going to close.

542
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,080
Didn't you say

543
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,640
money can make ghosts go away?

544
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,640
It's the same everywhere.

545
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,840
Let's have another good glass of white wine.

546
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,720
Sir.

547
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,840
We can't.

548
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,720
We've cleaned up here.

549
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
We're really leaving.

550
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:25,720
We'll...

551
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,800
Wait.

552
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,600
Let's go.

553
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,520
I'm leaving.

554
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,280
Take care.

555
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,240
Don't be careless.

556
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,560
Maybe it's Yirong.

557
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,040
This bug.

558
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,040
It's not a bug.

559
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,040
It's a bug.

560
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,960
This bug is too cunning.

561
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,160
He used a kid

562
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
to do this kind of bad business.

563
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,000
The silver is more valuable than the world.

564
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,480
The deal of this bug

565
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
has caused half of the city

566
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,000
to be in a panic.

567
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,520
The only thing that can't be sure

568
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,880
is to light the lamp.

569
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,360
This drug store

570
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,280
is still the place

571
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,080
with the most people.

572
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,080
It even involves the kid.

573
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
I feel

574
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,880
this is not a way

575
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,680
he can come up with alone.

576
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,920
After we catch him,

577
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,040
we'll ask him again.

578
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,640
Yes.

579
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,320
I want to see

580
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,720
what they're up to.

581
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
In the wild,

582
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,120
we go to the jungle.

583
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,120
The fairy goes to the sky.

584
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,120
If you want to be a fairy,

585
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,720
you can go.

586
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,720
Let the beauty go.

587
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,720
Let's go.

588
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,720
They're still here.

589
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
Get ready.

590
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:33,720
Go.

591
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
Go.

592
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,120
Where are you going?

593
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,520
How dare you trick me?

594
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,320
Sir.

595
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
Where's Lu Yan?

596
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,320
I'm here.

597
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
I'm here.

598
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,320
I'm here.

599
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
I'm here.

600
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
I'm here.

601
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
I'm here.

602
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,320
I'm here.

603
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,320
I'm here.

604
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
I'm here.

605
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,320
I'm here.

606
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,320
I'm here.

607
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
I'm here.

608
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
I'm here.

609
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,320
I'm here.

610
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
I'm here.

611
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,320
I'm here.

612
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,320
I'm here.

613
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,320
I'm here.

614
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
I'm here.

615
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
I'm here.

616
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,320
I'm here.

617
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
I'm here.

618
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
I'm here.

619
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,320
I'm here.

620
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,320
I'm here.

621
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
I'm here.

622
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,320
I'm here.

623
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
I'm here.

624
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
I'm here.

625
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
It hurts.

626
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
Can you fall down?

627
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Yes.

628
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:42,800
Yes.

629
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,800
Was I on organizations?

630
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,240
Your clinic has been dry for a long time.

631
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,200
What did you sell earlier?

632
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,940
Pharm L Vikram medicine.

633
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,100
It's natural.

634
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,980
I can spare your life if you tell me the truth

635
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,700
I... I don't know what you're talking about

636
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,620
You... you are oppressing the people

637
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,140
Is there any law?

638
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,180
You're selling the poison of the dead

639
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,580
You ran away because you're afraid of the ghost

640
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,060
How about this?

641
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,220
We'll tie him up and interrogate him

642
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,780
Sir, Mistress

643
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,060
How about we go back and have a look?

644
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,660
Maybe Lin Chong is still in the pharmacy

645
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,620
It makes sense

646
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,340
Let's go

647
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,820
Come back here

648
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,940
Help!

649
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,420
Help!

650
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,420
Help!

651
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,660
Help!

652
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,460
Help!

653
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,060
Sir, let's save him

654
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,620
No need

655
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,540
Take him back to the White House

656
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,860
Help!

657
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,020
Help!

658
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,660
Help!

659
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,060
Help!

660
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,740
Help!

661
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,100
Help!

662
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,100
Help!

663
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,220
Help!

664
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,740
Shiqing, it's your birthday today

665
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,180
And your father's case is almost solved

666
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,660
Today is a good day

667
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,580
How about we set up your marriage with Gu Beixi?

668
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,500
No, Dad

669
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,540
It's not urgent

670
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,500
Not urgent

671
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,420
What?

672
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,420
Not urgent?

673
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,020
I heard that Gu Beixi

674
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:16,020
was always with the people in Xi Yuan

675
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,940
I don't know what he's thinking

676
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:19,980
Did he leave you alone?

677
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,820
You're unhappy

678
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,380
So you don't want to marry him

679
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:24,460
I'll call him here

680
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,020
and beat him up

681
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:28,780
Dad

682
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,620
I'll tell you the truth

683
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,020
Gu Beixi

684
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,340
He has someone in his heart

685
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,180
Gu Beixi

686
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,540
You're so blind and ignorant

687
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,100
Gu Beixi

688
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,060
You first

689
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:57,460
I'll go first

690
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,060
Shiqing

691
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,420
We've been engaged since we were kids

692
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,420
But Dengdeng and I grew up together

693
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:14,220
He's been in my heart for too long

694
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,260
I can't pretend to be someone else

695
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,220
I'm sorry

696
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,980
I've told your father about the marriage

697
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,460
Thank you for helping me

698
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,100
You don't have to thank me

699
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,260
And you have nothing to do with me

700
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,900
You're just like me

701
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,900
You're just struggling in an endless relationship

702
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,580
And I think

703
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,740
it's good to have someone in your heart

704
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,460
I'll leave Bai's Mansion tomorrow

705
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,780
Forget me

706
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,140
and start a new life

707
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,460
What if I can't forget you?

708
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,500
How can you?

709
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,580
You're a rich lady

710
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,940
and I'm a rough man

711
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,580
Time goes by and you'll forget me

712
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,860
Take care

713
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,660
Thank you

714
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,340
Please

715
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,580
Today please

716
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,620
Congratulations

717
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,820
Brother Liu.

718
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,020
Thank you.

719
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,580
Welcome.

720
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,580
Congratulations.

721
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,180
Thank you.

722
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:07,780
Congratulations.

723
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,820
Thank you for coming.

724
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,700
Don't move.

725
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,780
Stay still.

726
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,420
Take him down.

727
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,020
Please come in.

728
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,540
Okay.

729
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,820
Thank you, Director Bai.

730
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,220
Don't move.

731
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:22,700
Thank you.

732
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,620
Go in first.

733
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:24,980
Congratulations.

734
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,540
Behave yourself.

735
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,020
No.

736
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:28,700
Director Bai.

737
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:29,860
You're a hero.

738
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,700
I'm here

739
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,860
for your birthday party.

740
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,260
All the guests are here.

741
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,660
What do you mean?

742
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,700
What's wrong with you?

743
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,420
A Xin.

744
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,020
What...

745
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:45,980
What species is it?

746
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,780
It's a chrysanthemum.

747
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,580
We found that

748
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,140
it's related to the business of insects.

749
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:51,700
It must be related to

750
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,220
the disappearance of the population.

751
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,980
Interesting.

752
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,700
A rabbit is not a rabbit.

753
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,860
A donkey is not a donkey.

754
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
It's a good mouth.

755
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,020
Don't move.

756
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,100
I admire you.

757
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,300
You've done a great job this time.

758
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,700
Isn't it, Director Bai?

759
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,660
Today is Miss Bai's birthday party.

760
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,060
And you solved the case.

761
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,300
This is

762
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,740
a good thing for you

763
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,180
to put a peony on the phoenix's head.

764
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,700
Well,

765
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,380
my apprentice, Peng Dahai,

766
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,700
is he...

767
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,580
Let him go.

768
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,780
Don't be so anxious.

769
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,460
Look at this.

770
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,020
Evidence.

771
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,460
Where's the testimony?

772
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,900
You've caught him.

773
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,460
Are you afraid of losing the testimony?

774
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,740
Well,

775
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,180
you caught him.

776
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,620
He pulled you on the street.

777
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,260
I don't believe you.

778
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,300
I'm the one who's empty-handed.

779
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,620
The director is also in there.

780
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,540
I reported to him and he asked.

781
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,820
I was right.

782
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,300
Is it a joke?

783
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,260
Of course it's not.

784
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,620
Since this Chahe is a criminal,

785
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,020
if we want him to speak,

786
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,300
we must interrogate him.

787
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,460
The reason we brought him to Bai's Mansion

788
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,700
is to ask him

789
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,700
to provide us with a place to interrogate.

790
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:01,940
So we can

791
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,460
know the whole case.

792
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,380
That's right.

793
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,060
Director Bai,

794
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,060
you've been worrying for days.

795
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,700
Finally, you found a witness.

796
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,660
You must ask him.

797
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,100
We caught him.

798
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,540
It's easier to ask.

799
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,540
Don't worry.

800
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,780
We'll try to

801
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,500
send you the witness

802
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
and evidence before the birthday party.

803
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,660
You'll be able to

804
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,500
face the guests

805
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,460
in person.

806
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,900
I see.

807
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,540
We're just looking for a place

808
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,660
to interrogate the criminal.

809
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,780
Bai's Mansion is a big place.

810
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,500
You can pick and interrogate him.

811
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,060
And your apprentice, Dahai,

812
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,300
I'll bring him out of the prison

813
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:36,980
right now

814
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,580
to treat him well.

815
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,500
Don't worry.

816
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,700
As long as you get the evidence,

817
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,820
the director will be over the old man.

818
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:43,940
And you can put the criminal

819
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,820
on the cart safely.

820
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,700
I'll give you

821
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,460
your apprentice.

822
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,060
Director Bai,

823
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,180
you're

824
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,060
on the right track.

825
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:54,580
Director Bai.

826
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,580
I'm always on the right track.

827
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:56,940
Director Bai.

828
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,420
We're just looking for...

829
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,060
Director Bai,

830
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,580
the guests are almost here.

831
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,700
The director is sitting down, too.

832
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,700
He's waiting for you to host the party.

833
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,140
Hero.

834
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,700
I'll go over there.

835
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,700
I'll listen to your hero later.

836
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:09,340
He can do whatever he wants.

837
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:09,660
Okay?

838
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,460
Okay, director.

839
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:11,460
See you.

840
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,940
Old Yang.

841
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,340
Is responds correctly.

842
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,780
Zero!

843
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,660
For the last 2 days,

844
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,980
the treasures never came in handy.

845
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,940
That's a shame.

846
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,380
But now I'm Но- people like you

847
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,980
just scoff at you.

848
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,460
Speak out!

849
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,560
Who really

850
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,620
gave the slaughter лет theécофilx the blame?

851
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:54,860
Erm…

852
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,740
What fish and wideners?

853
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,340
You're still being stubborn, aren't you?

854
00:33:59,220 --> 00:33:59,860
Fine.

855
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,140
I'd like to see

856
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,340
if you're being stubborn

857
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,980
or I'm a whip with chili water.

858
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,340
Say it or not?

859
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:12,940
Say it!

860
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,420
Say it!

861
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,740
Say it or not?

862
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:17,980
I'm just

863
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,060
running a pharmacy.

864
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,140
What is it?

865
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:22,700
I...

866
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,660
I've never heard of it.

867
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,900
You're still not going to say it, aren't you?

868
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,180
Fine.

869
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,580
You're forcing me to be a killer.

870
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:31,300
Gu Bei Xi!

871
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,340
Coming!

872
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,180
Your ears are so long.

873
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,580
Why did you ask me to be a cop?

874
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:39,580
You even want this?

875
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,860
Looks like you have a good show to watch.

876
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,300
Here.

877
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,940
What are you doing?

878
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:47,740
Don't... Don't come here.

879
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,220
Aren't you a good ear?

880
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,860
I told you to be a good ear.

881
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,060
Say it!

882
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,620
Say it!

883
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,660
You're still not going to say it, aren't you?

884
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,580
Gu Bei Xi!

885
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,060
Coming!

886
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,820
Say it or not?

887
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,580
Say it or not?

888
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,300
Say it or not?

889
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,500
Say it or not?

890
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:14,820
Say it or not?

891
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,500
Say it or not?

892
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,300
Say it or not?

893
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,300
Say it!

894
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,780
Say it!

895
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,540
Say it!

896
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,020
Say it!

897
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,100
I won't say it!

898
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,500
Say it!

899
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,220
I won't say it!

900
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:27,980
Stop!

901
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,020
Say it!

902
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:33,660
I...

903
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,700
I heard about the ghost market.

904
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,140
Someone is doing a spiritual business.

905
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,620
But it has nothing to do with me.

906
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,340
I'm selling drugs seriously.

907
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,460
You...

908
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,820
Did you catch the wrong person?

909
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:46,620
Sir.

910
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,900
The pharmacy was burned to the ground by the fire.

911
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,500
We don't have any proper evidence.

912
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,460
Could it be that we really caught the wrong person?

913
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,100
The person must not have been caught wrong.

914
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,460
Besides,

915
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,660
we don't have any evidence.

916
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,020
Ling Chong.

917
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,540
The usual pharmacy is full of herbs.

918
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,020
It's important to keep the scale.

919
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,780
The most clear videos of the Yangtze River

920
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,300
such as Danggui, Baishao and Chuan Xiong

921
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:25,740
are made in the upper level of the scale.

922
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,420
The most important videos

923
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,020
such as Longgu, Muli, Zhenzhu and Mu

924
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,460
are made in the lower level of the scale.

925
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,900
Finally, the videos with a large amount of material

926
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,140
are made in the lowest level.

927
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,980
Such as Tongcao, Sangye and others.

928
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,060
Such a setting is convenient to adjust the time.

929
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,380
In addition to the shelf for the medicine,

930
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,980
it's not easy to find a space

931
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,980
to store a large number of insects.

932
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,460
Just now, in the pharmacy,

933
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,180
I found that the videos of Qingzhi

934
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,340
were made in the lowest level.

935
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
So I inferred that someone made the shelf

936
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,460
to be replaced.

937
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,420
He must have transferred something

938
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,740
that was invisible to the upper level.

939
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,860
It made Ling Chong hard to be discovered.

940
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,580
He is indeed the person I like.

941
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,260
He is really amazing.

942
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,220
The evidence is here.

943
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,540
Do you want to play tricks?

944
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,900
I'm just borrowing some kids

945
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,260
to do some business with Ling Chong.

946
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,380
I can't sell

947
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,580
what others buy.

948
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,620
Who is the person behind you?

949
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:29,820
I...

950
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,140
I'm rich.

951
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,260
I don't need anyone to instruct me.

952
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,900
The pharmacy fire

953
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,700
has already confirmed my guess.

954
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,220
Ling Chong's deal is not done by you alone.

955
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,660
Even if you don't say it,

956
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,500
the person behind you

957
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,740
may not protect you.

958
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,580
Why bother to suffer?

959
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,940
Besides,

960
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:57,580
it's not good to have Ling Chong's feelings in your body, right?

961
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,420
If you say it,

962
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,900
I can save you.

963
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,980
You... You can't save me.

964
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,180
The... The King of Worms...

965
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,300
It's... It's King of Worms.

966
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,980
King of Worms? What King of Worms?

967
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,740
Continue.

968
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:33,140
He is our superior.

969
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,460
I only know that

970
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,380
as long as the distance is close enough,

971
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,820
he can manipulate all the Ling Chong

972
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,700
and disturb the host to go east.

973
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,900
The host can't go west.

974
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,780
He is like the master of these worms.

975
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,860
So... So we call him King of Worms.

976
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,620
We are not welcome

977
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,420
to be infected.

978
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,740
Where can we find him?

979
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,380
I don't know.

980
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,980
A few days ago, a subordinate died.

981
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,260
I heard that

982
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,660
it was a crime.

983
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,060
The rules of selling the forest and not selling people

984
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,780
are too high.

985
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,140
We are selling worms.

986
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,220
We are just

987
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,940
a little bit of a burden.

988
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,940
We can't avoid

989
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,220
those people who are so ugly.

990
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,780
We are just a little bit of a burden.

991
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,020
Where did the Ling Chong come from?

992
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,220
Did it come from the sky?

993
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:24,900
You have a good relationship with the King of Worms.

994
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,420
How can you not have seen him?

995
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,660
Have I seen him or not?

996
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,380
Think about it.

997
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,260
Sir...

998
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,820
Sir... Sir, please forgive me.

999
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,460
I have seen him.

1000
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,300
But you shouldn't eat

1001
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,860
what you eat.

1002
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,660
He only appears when he is delivering goods.

1003
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,900
When he comes, he wears a wind coat.

1004
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,060
He doesn't look at me.

1005
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,780
He only knows

1006
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,980
that he makes a strange sound when he walks.

1007
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,020
He is weird.

1008
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:01,260
I really don't know anything else.

1009
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,380
I think he has said enough.

1010
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,900
Why don't we give him to Director Bai

1011
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:18,620
and ask the police to deal with him?

1012
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,340
Sir, how do you know

1013
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,340
that there are Ling Chong in the Chang'er's clan?

1014
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,860
When I first caught him,

1015
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,340
I found his neck is wrinkled.

1016
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,220
It's the same as the symptoms of the animal's

1017
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,460
excretion here.

1018
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,260
This King of Worms is too powerful.

1019
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:35,580
He can not only absorb the power of the spirit,

1020
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,780
but also control the people who are heavily injured.

1021
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,180
Let's save the sea first

1022
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,300
and meet him again.

1023
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,700
We can't let him hurt others anymore.

1024
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:43,860
Okay.

1025
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,860
This matter...

1026
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:45,860
Father.

1027
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,540
No problem.

1028
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,180
Father.

1029
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,100
Wait.

1030
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,420
Let me see.

1031
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,460
Take it.

1032
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,740
You are too exaggerated.

1033
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,140
You lost weight in a day.

1034
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,020
That's not true.

1035
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,660
Take it.

1036
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,140
I'll tell you a good news.

1037
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:00,020
What good news?

1038
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,700
We caught a Ling Chong in the Chang'er's clan.

1039
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,980
When we hand him over to Director Bai,

1040
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,260
when the sea comes out,

1041
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,980
we'll take him to have a good meal

1042
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,740
and go to meet him.

1043
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,980
Then we'll go back to Qingquan Village.

1044
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,260
My father hasn't been back to the village for a long time.

1045
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,500
It's time to go back and have a rest.

1046
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,620
Our family finally reunited.

1047
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,180
It's quite good.

1048
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:17,980
Deng Deng.

1049
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,300
You go back to Qingquan Village first.

1050
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,580
I'll stay here for a few more days.

1051
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,900
When I find out about Ling Chong,

1052
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,300
I'll go back to Qingquan Village to find you.

1053
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,580
What are you looking for?

1054
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,020
Qingquan Village?

1055
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,580
You want to go there?

1056
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:29,700
Why do you make him think about you?

1057
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:30,220
Shut up.

1058
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,580
What did you say?

1059
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:34,340
You and Deng Deng

1060
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,820
are like a fight from the beginning.

1061
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,860
You can't even fight back.

1062
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,940
If you dare to bully Deng Deng again

1063
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,020
and touch him,

1064
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,660
I'll kill you.

1065
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,260
Father.

1066
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,460
I've told you.

1067
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,380
It's a misunderstanding.

1068
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,420
What misunderstanding?

1069
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:49,340
He wants to kill you with money.

1070
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,980
Living with such a person for a lifetime.

1071
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,180
That's dangerous.

1072
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,340
He's here today.

1073
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:53,820
Come on.

1074
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,500
Write the divorce letter to me.

1075
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:20,460
The most beautiful scenery

1076
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:26,460
is all about you

1077
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,460
When two hearts are so close

1078
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:33,460
When the whole world is occupied by you

1079
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:38,460
I will call you with all my heart

1080
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,460
Until your memory

1081
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:48,460
You are the only one

1082
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:55,460
who walks into the scenery

1083
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:59,460
This city is full of rain and the clouds are scattered

1084
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,460
The clouds are about to stop

1085
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:07,460
I have decided to do it for you

1086
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,460
with all my heart

1087
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:18,460
I will call you with all my heart

1088
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:23,460
Until your memory

1089
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:28,460
You are the only one

1090
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:33,460
who walks into the scenery

1091
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:38,460
This city is full of rain and the clouds are scattered

1092
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,460
I will call you with all my heart

1093
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:48,460
Until your memory

1094
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:55,460
You are the only one

1095
00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:01,460
who walks into the scenery

1096
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,460
This city is full of rain and the clouds are scattered

1097
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,460
The clouds are about to stop

1098
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:14,460
I have decided to do it for you

1099
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:19,460
with all my heart
