1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,580
The End

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will never let go after you leave

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You are not me

5
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You are not me

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You are not me

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You are not me

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm so tired

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Rest in peace

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Master, firefly

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Master

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm in a dark place

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Firefly, firefly took me out

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is the firefly that the fool said

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The place he said it was dark

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It should be this underground palace

17
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Maybe he was scared because he saw these bones

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The fool said it was a firefly that took him out

19
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let's try

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Firefly brother

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Brother, please take us out

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It's useless

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Maybe it was a firefly drawn by his friend

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
My father said before

25
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
After people die, the spirit energy may turn into fireflies

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
These fireflies should be drawn by these dead people

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They were trapped here together

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Then we have no chance

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We are not familiar with the fireflies here

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
None of them are familiar

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Master, you are overdoing them

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I have less yuan

33
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Master, you can't consume your yuan energy anymore

34
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Master Wei Le is the first member of the Qingquan Village

35
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Master, don't say these official words in front of me

36
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Be careful

37
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Da Hai

38
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Master

39
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Master

40
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Master

41
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Master, are you ok?

42
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Master

43
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Father

44
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Ok, wait

45
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Are you hurt?

46
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I knew you were here

47
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What's wrong with you?

48
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm so worried

49
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You didn't change your habit

50
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
My second father is really with you

51
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't talk about this

52
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Wait, I'll take you out of the underground palace

53
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Go

54
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Do you know how to get out?

55
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Where is my second father?

56
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He went out first

57
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I've been here for a few days

58
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Just grind the way

59
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Da Hai and Lu Yan are here too

60
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Let's go find them first

61
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Ok

62
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Go

63
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
How long

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Almost

65
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
But it's hard to get out

66
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Hard to get out

67
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes, let's go

68
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Come on

69
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
When can we get there

70
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Almost

71
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Just over there

72
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm your father.

73
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You can't even remember

74
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
what my father used to say

75
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
when you see your own mark.

76
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You don't know my father at all.

77
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Tell me.

78
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Who are you?

79
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yunxi.

80
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You are...

81
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Zhu Rong?

82
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's not easy for us to meet alone.

83
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's not good to use a knife and a gun.

84
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Don't waste your energy.

85
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You're not my opponent at all.

86
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You killed me with a knife.

87
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What's the point of being a hero?

88
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Stop talking nonsense.

89
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Come with me.

90
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm not a hero anymore.

91
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I want to see

92
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
what tricks you play.

93
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You put a spirit worm on me

94
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
and deliberately

95
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
lead us to this place.

96
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
What is it for?

97
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Is it for

98
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
the energy of my body?

99
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
How can your energy

100
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
compare with

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Lu Yan's energy?

102
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You've been around for a long time.

103
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You want to take me

104
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
to change the yuan-pellet to Lu Yan.

105
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You should have told me earlier.

106
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
It's easy to discuss.

107
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't use a knife and a gun when you come up.

108
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Let me send a letter

109
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and I'll let him come over.

110
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Okay.

111
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's discuss.

112
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Go and cut Lu Yan's chest open.

113
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Dig out the yuan-pellet and give it to me.

114
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Don't turn your eyes.

115
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You think I'll believe

116
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
your tricks?

117
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I don't believe.

118
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't believe in you.

119
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm just curious.

120
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You're like this.

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
You stole other people's things.

122
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Why are you still

123
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
a face of a man

124
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
who is a man of his word?

125
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The yuan-pellet is my spiritual thing.

126
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's the source of all the spiritual energy.

127
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You betrayed the people

128
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and gave the yuan-pellet to a human.

129
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
As the leader of the spiritual clan,

130
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
why can't I take it back?

131
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Leader of the spiritual clan?

132
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You took the yuan-pellet

133
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
and caused the chaos of the spirit insects.

134
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You killed so many spiritual clans

135
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
and made so many spiritual clans

136
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
in the capital homeless.

137
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
How dare you

138
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
call yourself the leader of the spiritual clan?

139
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I killed the spiritual clan.

140
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I made the spiritual clan homeless.

141
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Thousands of years ago,

142
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
the ancient soil was in a state of natural disaster.

143
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
In order to survive,

144
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
the spiritual clan had to eat the same kind of food.

145
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It was me

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
who led them to the land of the nine states.

147
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But you?

148
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
As the sacred daughter of the spiritual clan,

149
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
you gave the yuan-pellet to a human.

150
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You caused the spiritual clan to be helpless.

151
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Have you forgotten

152
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
how many people Lu Yan killed?

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The war of the human-spirit lasted for decades.

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
How many people died

155
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
under Lu Yan's knife?

156
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Was it me

157
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
who caused all this?

158
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What?

159
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't know what happened in the past three thousand years.

160
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I only know that Lu Yan

161
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
only wanted to protect the human and the spiritual clan.

162
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Now,

163
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
the human and the spiritual clan are in peace.

164
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Why are you making trouble again?

165
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The human and the spiritual clan are in peace?

166
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Or the spiritual clan

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
doesn't dare to face the world

168
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
and live a life of

169
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
slander and theft?

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Three thousand years ago,

171
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
you were the sacred daughter of the spiritual clan,

172
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
but you betrayed our clan.

173
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Three thousand years later,

174
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I, Zhu Rong,

175
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
led the spiritual clan

176
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
to the land of the nine states.

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
No.

178
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You want to break the formation with blood?

179
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Now you can't even bleed.

180
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
How do you want to break the formation?

181
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Jia...

182
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Almost there.

183
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm alive.

184
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Lu Yan,

185
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
you have to come quickly.

186
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Aren't you afraid of the underground palace being collapsed

187
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
because of your reckless behavior?

188
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Even if it collapses,

189
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'll let you die with me.

190
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Who is going to kill my brother?

191
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Master.

192
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Wait.

193
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Master.

194
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Wait.

195
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Master.

196
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
How is it?

197
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Master.

198
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Master.

199
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Master.

200
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Master.

201
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Da Hai.

202
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Second Brother.

203
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Why did you take him with you?

204
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It was like a maze.

205
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I turned a few rounds

206
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and I met the Second Master.

207
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Then we started looking for you.

208
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
We found the little flower mark you left.

209
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
We followed you.

210
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Why is this devil here?

211
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's a long story.

212
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Let's go.

213
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The 36th level.

214
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The grass is overgrown.

215
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Old Yu,

216
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
go quickly.

217
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm going.

218
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm going.

219
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm going.

220
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm going.

221
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm going.

222
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm going.

223
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm going.

224
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Go.

225
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
You go first.

226
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Go.

227
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Go.

228
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
It's not that easy to go.

229
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Master.

230
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Master.

231
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Master.

232
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Hurry.

233
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Wait.

234
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Master.

235
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Hurry.

236
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Master.

237
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Master.

238
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Hurry.

239
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Wait.

240
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Master.

241
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Master.

242
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Old Yu.

243
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Shi Ya.

244
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Father.

245
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm the one you're going to fight.

246
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Come at me if you can.

247
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Luo Yan.

248
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
It's not very easy to catch them.

249
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Luo Yan.

250
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Hurry.

251
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Look at Deng Deng.

252
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll give Deng Deng some yuan energy.

253
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Let's go now.

254
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Deng Deng.

255
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Deng Deng.

256
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Master.

257
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Master.

258
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Deng Deng.

259
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Deng Deng.

260
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Master.

261
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Master.

262
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Deng Deng.

263
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Master.

264
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Deng Deng.

265
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Deng Deng.

266
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Deng Deng.

267
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Deng Deng.

268
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Deng Deng.

269
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Master.

270
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,520
Master.

271
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,120
You finally got back together with your husband.

272
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,560
Let's go.

273
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,720
Hurry.

274
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,800
Hurry.

275
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,040
Hold my heart.

276
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
What's going on?

277
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,600
Master, there's a tiger and a tiger again.

278
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,520
A dragon just left and a Wei Du came.

279
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Your husband is so loyal to you.

280
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,320
General.

281
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,560
Let me ask you again.

282
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,200
Are you choosing this woman from the Spirit Clan

283
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,240
or these brothers who have been born and raised with you?

284
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,560
Master Tan Jianmei is starting to attack now.

285
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
General.

286
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,400
Are you sure you want to choose her?

287
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,520
So what if I choose her?

288
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,640
I'm not forcing her to be my wife.

289
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,520
This woman can only die from a liver transplant.

290
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,640
Can you protect her?

291
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,880
You can only watch her die again.

292
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,880
That's not necessarily true.

293
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,880
Master, the mission is complete.

294
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,880
The Beads?

295
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,480
Aren't you outside the palace?

296
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,080
Master knew you wouldn't hand over the Beads.

297
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,760
So he pretended to let me stay outside the palace

298
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,520
to relax your guard.

299
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,320
Actually, I followed you secretly.

300
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,920
In terms of intelligence, you're no match for my master.

301
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,040
Not bad.

302
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,120
You even blackmailed your own subordinates.

303
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,480
That's called

304
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,480
a black heart who has no respect for me.

305
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
Since the Beads are here,

306
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,800
Wei Du, I won't ask about what you did before.

307
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,000
From now on, you can stay in the valley.

308
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,760
Don't think about what happens next.

309
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,760
Let's go.

310
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,120
You took the Beads.

311
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,920
The whole city will die.

312
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,360
You...

313
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,960
What do you mean?

314
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,320
General.

315
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,720
I lied to you.

316
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,720
We survived because we were the testers of the Spirit Clan.

317
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,920
We even built the capital of the ancient mouse.

318
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,560
But in a few years,

319
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,120
the medicine was gradually disappearing.

320
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,680
Our brothers started to grow old and die.

321
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
At that time,

322
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,720
Zhu Rong appeared

323
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,520
and gave me the Beads.

324
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
The Beads.

325
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,400
After I put them in the underground palace,

326
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,400
the people in the city stopped growing old.

327
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,800
They're not old anymore.

328
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
They won't die.

329
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,400
So Zhu Rong used the Beads

330
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:26,520
to seduce you to take us to the underground palace?

331
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,440
If he took the Beads,

332
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,040
the people in the city would die.

333
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,320
He took the lives of the people in the city.

334
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,920
I had to obey him.

335
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,920
But now it's different.

336
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,840
You're back.

337
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,040
We can work together

338
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,320
to kill Zhu Rong.

339
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
Just that Beads.

340
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,040
Is it that powerful?

341
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,840
It can make people live for 3,000 years.

342
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,120
It's impossible.

343
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,840
There are ghosts in the underground palace.

344
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,040
It's impossible for ordinary people to come in.

345
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,640
Wei Du, you must have something to hide.

346
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,440
Where did the energy from the Beads come from?

347
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,520
Okay.

348
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,440
If you don't tell me, I'll tell you.

349
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,120
In the underground palace,

350
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,920
there are the bones of the human being from different ages.

351
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,560
And the human bones that were missing

352
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,120
in the next village.

353
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,800
You made this place a trap for people's lives.

354
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,880
You used the human life to maintain the energy of the Beads.

355
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,280
And you're still alive.

356
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,320
It's reasonable.

357
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,640
Is that so, Wei Du?

358
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:47,800
General.

359
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,120
Have you ever asked me if I'm not good at living?

360
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,600
Of course I'm good at living.

361
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,480
But how can it be so easy to live?

362
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,280
What can we do

363
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,320
if we don't do that?

364
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,920
Are we going to watch

365
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,120
our people

366
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,560
and our brothers

367
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,840
die miserably?

368
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:18,880
Wei Du.

369
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,760
You've changed.

370
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,520
You're not the Wei Du you used to be.

371
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,600
What's the difference between

372
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,800
what you did and those evil spirits?

373
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
The spirits are making us go to this hell.

374
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,520
General.

375
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,240
Wei Du.

376
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,400
Wei Du is a man who can't die.

377
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,760
But what about these brothers?

378
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,960
What about the old young men in the city?

379
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,440
They've all followed you.

380
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,520
They've trusted you.

381
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,000
General.

382
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Brothers don't have to die miserably.

383
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,640
You can stay and be our king.

384
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,640
This is Shu State.

385
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,520
The people here,

386
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,280
the capital here,

387
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,080
are no different from the land 3000 years ago.

388
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,040
General.

389
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,560
You choose.

390
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,520
Wei Du.

391
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,720
Don't make one more mistake.

392
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,120
General.

393
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,160
You're really not giving us

394
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,520
even a single chance?

395
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:48,960
Good.

396
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,560
Good.

397
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,120
Since I'm dead,

398
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,600
let's bury all of us here!

399
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,080
Good.

400
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,520
Are you trying to trap us?

401
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,920
Master, let's go.

402
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,680
Yes.

403
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,480
Wei Du.

404
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,800
What's the point of doing this?

405
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,200
Don't you regret it?

406
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,080
General.

407
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,720
I know that with your ability,

408
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,600
this gate can't stop you.

409
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,080
If that's the case,

410
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,040
if you want to take this woman

411
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,000
and Bichen Zhu away,

412
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,000
I and my brothers

413
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,640
have no more concerns.

414
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,920
Then let's stay here

415
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,600
and return to our homeland.

416
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,680
General.

417
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,240
Enough, General Wei.

418
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,200
Stop acting.

419
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,400
You're so arrogant.

420
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
You're so arrogant.

421
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
I won't eat it.

422
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,320
What did you say?

423
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,080
With Lu Yan's brain,

424
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,560
I'd rather be the one to be blamed,

425
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,280
than the one to be blamed.

426
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,760
But you let him choose between

427
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,160
the one he likes and his brothers.

428
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,680
Isn't that forcing him to die?

429
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,440
What kind of stupid choice is that?

430
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,480
Don't you hate me?

431
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:29,840
Fine.

432
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,840
I'll give you a chance to make a choice.

433
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,840
Either I smash this pearl,

434
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,120
and once the pearl is destroyed,

435
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
everyone will be in the same situation.

436
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,800
It'll also make it hard for you.

437
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,160
Master, are you crazy?

438
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,600
If they don't leave, we'll leave on our own.

439
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,560
Da Hai.

440
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,000
Lu Yan can't bear to leave his brothers.

441
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Neither can your master.

442
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,280
Or,

443
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,600
you and I go out together.

444
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,000
Lu Yan can stay and be your king.

445
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,520
I'll be your king.

446
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,280
If you stay and be your king,

447
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,160
I'll stay and be your queen.

448
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,840
Once the pearl has taken the worms out of me,

449
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:15,660
I'll pass on the

450
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,960
But you're a spirit.

451
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,160
What spirit?

452
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,920
I don't care about anything except him.

453
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,640
Wei Du.

454
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,680
Your choice is my choice.

455
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,480
Go out with us.

456
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,200
Now,

457
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,600
you should believe my sincerity.

458
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,560
Two birds with one stone.

459
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,080
What are you thinking about?

460
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,960
Leave.

461
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,800
Get out of the underground palace.

462
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
They're all gone.

463
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,200
Let's go.

464
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,280
Let's go.

465
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,240
Are you okay?

466
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,680
I'm fine.

467
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,160
He's bleeding.

468
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,520
Let's go.

469
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,040
General.

470
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,440
I know I've wronged you.

471
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,680
Please punish me.

472
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,520
Wei Du.

473
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,920
More than ten years ago,

474
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,440
Yu Deng Deng's mother

475
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,080
was killed by someone with Long Wen Wen Hui.

476
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,960
Is this about your army?

477
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,000
She kept asking me

478
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,520
if I could get out of the city.

479
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,880
General.

480
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,880
I'm not lying.

481
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,680
The people in the city have never been out.

482
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,120
We can only move within the energy range of the Beecheng Pearl.

483
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
We can't get out at all.

484
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,920
But it's different now.

485
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,440
You're back.

486
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,840
You're the hope we've re-entered.

487
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,560
Get up first.

488
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,520
Thank you, General.

489
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,760
Thank you.

490
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,240
Where's the Beecheng Pearl?

491
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,560
I've discussed with the people in charge of the ceremony in the capital.

492
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,680
When you take over the capital,

493
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,640
you can give the Beecheng Pearl to the ceremony.

494
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,560
It's your wedding gift.

495
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,720
What do you think?

496
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,000
I didn't have time to tell you in the underground palace.

497
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,200
In the underground palace,

498
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,840
I found the firefly that the fool mentioned.

499
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,720
When he entered the capital,

500
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,080
he must have been there.

501
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,000
He was scared by the scene there.

502
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,440
Why did you lie to Wei Du

503
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,320
and stay here in the underground palace?

504
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,760
Why did you make the same decision as me?

505
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,480
Wei.

506
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,080
Why hasn't the brother who went to the探路 come back?

507
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,520
Is something wrong?

508
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,880
Don't worry.

509
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,920
We'll wait for him.

510
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,200
Boss.

511
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,800
What's this?

512
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,400
It's said that the people in the Bear Cliff Village

513
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,280
ordered it.

514
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,560
It should be from the Bai family.

515
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,520
Please recognize it.

516
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,160
The human was near the cemetery.

517
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,160
It must have been Qi's.

518
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,760
He was killed in one of the other two coat roles.

519
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,160
That works.

520
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,240
He was killed also in the carriage.

521
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,960
Leading Cut section,

522
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,160
Don't forget it.

523
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,400
I have to return the favor.

524
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,960
A never-ending mystery

525
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,080
I can't find it

526
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,280
It's in my heart

527
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,960
Every word of the unknown is about you

528
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,160
It's been ten thousand years

529
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,440
I love you

530
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,960
I love you

531
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,960
The wind blows

532
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,600
The rain falls

533
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,760
The birds sing

534
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,600
Why are you in India?

535
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,280
It's none of your business

536
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,840
Can you tell me your name?

537
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,280
Gu Meixi

538
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:10,560
And

539
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,040
You can't tell your family about my name

540
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,680
Got it?

541
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,320
Yes

542
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,960
A never-ending mystery

543
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,720
I can't find it

544
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,080
You're so bold

545
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,840
I thought you wouldn't dare to be alone

546
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,680
I'm not afraid

547
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,360
You're not a bad person

548
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,760
You can fight for it

549
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,040
I can do it too

550
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,840
It's a lifetime

551
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,800
I want to live with the one I love

552
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
I love you

553
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,520
You forgot me

554
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,120
It's time to start a new life

555
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,120
What if I can't forget you?

556
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,960
A never-ending mystery

557
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,000
I can't find it

558
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,320
It's in my heart

559
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,040
Every word of the unknown is about you

560
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,080
It's been ten thousand years

561
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:17,120
I can't say I love you

562
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,920
I can't say I love you

563
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,800
It's been ten thousand years

564
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,160
You're not afraid of anything, right?

565
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,120
It's all down

566
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,720
Is this how the people in the church are?

567
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,520
Follow up

568
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,520
It looks the same as us

569
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,280
What is this place?

570
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,800
I don't want to go in

571
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,000
Mom, I'm scared

572
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,960
Don't be afraid, son

573
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,480
Let Xiao Mei, that girl, go ahead

574
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,280
Follow up

575
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,440
Lord

576
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,160
Where are you taking us?

577
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,080
Just go inside

578
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,120
Don't be afraid

579
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,560
It's useless to be afraid

580
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,120
Anyway, you don't have to be afraid if you're dead

581
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,800
Follow up

582
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:14,640
Get them

583
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:16,240
Don't let them get into the ghost church

584
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:16,880
Don't move

585
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,080
Don't run

586
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,360
Come back

587
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,560
Go back

588
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:40,720
Mom

589
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,160
General

590
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,400
Here are the golden days

591
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,580
to the day of the

592
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,340
imperial ceremony.

593
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:14,560
Leave it here.

594
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,760
This is the rule

595
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,560
I set according to the rules of the ancient book.

596
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,480
We are not familiar with the etiquette of the royal family.

597
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,600
There may be a mistake.

598
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,800
Please have a look, General.

599
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,560
See if you need to adjust it.

600
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,640
The times are different now.

601
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,880
These old royal interests don't have to be taken into account.

602
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,680
Do as you have decided.

603
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,600
General.

604
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,000
How can you say that so easily?

605
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,520
You are our general

606
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,880
and the prince of the Shu State.

607
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,160
Since the throne of the Shu State

608
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,080
is in good hands,

609
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,680
the ceremony

610
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,600
must be done according to the rules of the ancient book.

611
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,200
According to the rules of the ancient book,

612
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,000
my brother should be the one who inherits the throne.

613
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,160
The general died in the past.

614
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,280
The prince inherits the throne.

615
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,040
But the Shu State has been defeated day by day

616
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,600
and finally destroyed.

617
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,200
We brothers

618
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,440
are always grateful.

619
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,360
If the general were to ascend the throne,

620
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,560
the Shu State would be in great danger.

621
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,560
Now,

622
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,520
we finally have the opportunity

623
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,720
to send you to the throne

624
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,440
to make up for the regret of three thousand years ago.

625
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,080
There must be no mistakes

626
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,760
in this grand ceremony.

627
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,720
Do as you have decided.

628
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:37,840
General.

629
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,720
After the grand ceremony,

630
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:42,200
we will start building a new palace.

631
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:43,880
These are the papers.

632
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,640
Wei Du,

633
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,400
don't do these useless things

634
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,560
that the old people have done.

635
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,800
But this palace

636
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,440
is the dignity of the royal family.

637
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,560
What's the use of having this dignity?

638
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,240
Even if I ascend the throne,

639
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,800
I am just a puppet of the capital.

640
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,360
Wei Du is incompetent.

641
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,680
But the big thing is certain.

642
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,520
Wei Du will help the general

643
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,080
to show the map of the Shu State

644
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,680
and return the general to the real world.

645
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,760
Do you think what I want

646
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,280
is to restore the Shu State?

647
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,120
General,

648
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,680
you can abandon the Shu State,

649
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,920
but the people in the Shu State

650
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,560
can't have a king like you.

651
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,320
For three thousand years,

652
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,000
except for our military affairs,

653
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,600
the people have been here for generations.

654
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,440
The people of the country

655
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,120
are living like a spirit.

656
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,360
To be honest,

657
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,400
we don't know

658
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,000
what the outside world looks like.

659
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,960
Only you

660
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,960
are our hope.

661
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,240
Wei Du,

662
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,600
you have been here for thousands of years.

663
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,480
You are the leader of the people.

664
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,400
You could have lived better.

665
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,160
Why do you have to suffer?

666
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,640
I am a citizen.

667
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,600
I have no choice.

668
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,040
I made a mistake.

669
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,880
I was wrong to be killed

670
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,320
by Zhu Rong and Bi Chen Zhu.

671
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,680
But I

672
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,200
only care about the Shu State and the general.

673
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,120
The world is visible.

674
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,280
If you have any doubts,

675
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,360
when you become the emperor,

676
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,960
I will be willing to pay the price

677
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,920
to make up for my mistakes.

678
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,160
Then please

679
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
keep your promise

680
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
to keep your promise

681
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
and don't leave us again.

682
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,640
If we lose the general for the time being,

683
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,680
there will be no place to go back.

684
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,560
You get up first.

685
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,000
General,

686
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,600
if you get the throne,

687
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,120
we will no longer be controlled by the spirit clan.

688
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,720
We will definitely be loyal to the general and the new queen.

689
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,480
You attracted the people outside

690
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,480
to enter the underground palace

691
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,120
to sacrifice for Bi Chen Zhu.

692
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,880
This is too cruel.

693
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,120
Don't do it again.

694
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:49,920
Yes.

695
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:51,840
Since Zhu Rong can use Yuan

696
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,280
to control Bi Chen Zhu

697
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,840
to protect everyone's lives,

698
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,920
maybe

699
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,760
I can try it too.

700
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,400
Thank you, general.

701
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,520
With the general's Yuan,

702
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,400
Bi Chen Zhu will no longer be used to sacrifice for the people.

703
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,600
The people and soldiers of the ancient city

704
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,920
will no longer have the worry of life.

705
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,240
The Shu State will be victorious.

706
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,040
General,

707
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,680
the underground palace is the safest place in the city.

708
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,120
So it's safer to keep Bi Chen Zhu

709
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,840
in the underground palace.

710
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,760
Now I can only ask the general to go there in person.

711
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,000
It's okay.

712
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,600
This shop looks good.

713
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,840
General, do you want to take a walk and rest?

714
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,640
Stop!

715
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,040
Don't run!

716
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,080
Sir,

717
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,840
isn't this the Xiaomei Palace in the Bai Le Village?

718
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,640
Stop!

719
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,440
Stop!

720
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,320
Don't kill me.

721
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,560
General Jiang.

722
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,600
Xiaomei,

723
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,720
don't kill me.

724
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,600
General Jiang.

725
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,600
Xiaomei,

726
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,880
why did you come in?

727
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,240
I...

728
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,000
Save me!

729
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:03,520
Save me!

730
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,320
I'm innocent!

731
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,120
Save me!

732
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,040
Ruidu,

733
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,200
what's going on?

734
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,240
The most beautiful scenery

735
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,240
is all about you

736
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,640
When two stars are so close

737
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,120
When the whole world is occupied by you

738
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,840
I will call for you with all my heart

739
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:54,040
Until your memory

740
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:59,720
You are the only thing

741
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:06,360
in the view

742
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,300
It's just a composing of a night

743
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,400
All is lost in the cloud

744
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,240
I feel the hurt

745
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,360
for you

746
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:28,040
I'll make a decision for you
