These pathetic human beings

28

29
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,720
Let go of me!

30

For these 3,000 years,

31
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,670
I've been waiting for this moment

32
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,860
to witness your despair and death.

33
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,820
Sir!

34
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,060
Unfortunately,

35
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,329
after I swallowed you,

36
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,570
you will no longer have feelings.

37
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,870
You can only watch

39
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,810

You can only say all lives are equal.

And then?

45
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,950
You can only

46
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,520
rely on the energy core inside Lu Yan's body.

47
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,680
He even sacrificed his life for you.

48
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,690
You can't even save the person you love.

49
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,829
You don't deserve to love him.

50

You're back.

59
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,570
I can't believe that man would save you by taking the energy core out.

60
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,120
Stop hurting others.

61
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,550
Three thousand years ago,

62
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,900
we did whatever we wanted

63
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,450
and destroyed one home after another.

64
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,060
If we wanted to rob a place,

65
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,460
we would regard the people there as enemies.

66
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,250
We thought it was natural to rob them of their things,

67
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,750
and regarded unscrupulous tactics as faith.

68
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
It was humans

69
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,720
who taught me how to love others and be grateful.

70
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,700
We used to believe of

71
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,570
the survival of the fittest in natural selection, and thought the weak didn't deserve to survive.

72
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,480
It was Lu Yan who told me that

73
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,940
the weak

74
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,420
are not obstacles of survival at all,

75
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,840
but arrogance is.

76
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,000
I sealed you 3,000 years ago.

77
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,500

78

I will completely abandon you.

79
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,409
The spirit clan doesn't need you anymore,

80
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,690
because only love and respect

81
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,890
are the law of survival.

88
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,120
You're not worthy of saying that!

89
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,860
Because you don't know

90
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,550
what love is at all!

91
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,770

Yes, Chief.

171
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,390
-Slow down. -Push harder.

172
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,460
You didn't use your strength. I'm the one pushing it.

173
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,490
Chief.

174
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,420
You're back.

175
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,490
The harvest is good.

176
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,880
His Lordship's seeds are good,

177
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,580
and our land is fertile enough.

178
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,320
That's right.

179
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:58,960
By the way,

180
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,010
are there enough clerks in the clinic?

181
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,430
Don't worry.

182
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,540
Someone is watching over there.

183
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,940
Okay. Get back to work.

184
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:06,840
Okay.

185
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,550
Let's go.

186
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,570
Come on. Let's go.

187
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,310
Be careful.

188
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:10,060
Okay.

189
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,760
Come on. Keep up.

190
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,410
Chief, are you going out?

191
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,500
Alright.

192
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,940
Let's go.

193
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,190
Come on.

194
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,750
Senior Master, time to eat.

195
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,840
Has the second-in-command replied to the telegram?

196
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,510
Yes.

197
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,590
But he said the whereabouts of his master were unpredictable.

198
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,110
It's hard to find him.

199
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,010
But once we find him,

200
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,950
we will find out where His Lordship is.

201
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,260
What master?

202
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,170
His master is a swindler.

203
00:14:59,190 --> 00:14:59,990
That's not possible.

204
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,950
He capitalizes on his seniority.

205
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,920
After we finish the meal later,

206
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,140
send another telegram to the second-in-command.

207
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,110
Tell him to come back soon.

208
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,980
If he still refuses to come back, ask him not to come back anymore.

209
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,550
Okay.

210
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,550
Come on! Time to eat!

211
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,080
Da Qian, time to eat.

212
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,350
Coming.

213
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:18,460
Come on.

214
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,430
Old chieftain.

215
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:22,910
Our stronghold has a great harvest this year.

216
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,040
Lu Yan's seeds...

217
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:26,400
We agreed not to mention His Lordship.

218
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:26,990
How stupid.

219
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,480
I met our chief at the gate just now.

220
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,530
When I mentioned Lu Yan in front of her,

221
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:31,550
she wasn't sad.

222
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,340
Has she gone up the mountain again?

223
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,320
She's gone to the lakeside.

224
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,750
If that's the case,

225
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,410
has my master got over the sadness?

226
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,540
[Liquor]

227
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,350
Dahai.

228
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,840
What else can you do besides eating?

229
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:48,150
[Liquor]

230
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,180
No, Senior Master.

231
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,270
Why are you still unhappy if my master is fine now?

232
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,300
She always goes out.

233
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,490
She's been walking around the mountains.

234
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:56,580
[Liquor]

235
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,350
Why did she go up the mountains?

236
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,140
No reason.

237
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:06,320
[Liquor]

238
00:15:58,170 --> 00:15:59,250
I went there with my master once,

239
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:00,310
but I didn't discover anything...

240
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,100
Is she looking for His Lordship?

241
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:12,050
Dengdeng is just like that.

242
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,180
She keeps everything to herself

243
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,780
without telling us.

244
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,830
[Liquor]

245
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,490
If this goes on,

246
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,720
what if something wrong

247
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,080
happens to her?

248
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,690
What do you mean?

249
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,450
You're here. Come on.

250
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:24,980
Why are you here?

251
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:25,730
Let's eat together.

252
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,580
To deliver the gifts here.

253
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,580
The patients who had been rescued by Dengdeng

254
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,960
brought us gifts.

255
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,570
Where's Dengdeng?

256
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,110
Well...

257
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,310
Lu Yan, you know what?

258
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,450
Our stronghold

259
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,630
has a great harvest this year.

260
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,750
For the grains in the farmland,

261
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,390
and the fruits and vegetables in the fields,

262
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,319
the harvest of them is very good.

263
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:13,290
From now on, we don't need to worry about the famine.

264
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,920
Children from and outside the stronghold

265
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:20,099
have also started to go to school.

266
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,000
They all became literate,

267
00:17:23,369 --> 00:17:24,690
and can even recite poems.

268
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,400
They are more excellent than me.

269
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:32,300
Our stronghold has also got its own clinic.

270
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,200
The doctor you hired

271
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,420
is highly skilled at medicine indeed.

272
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:39,990
He has cured many intractable diseases.

273
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,700
All the people

274
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,300
are quite healthy now.

275
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,530
They have no disease or worries.

276
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,530
My father and uncle are still the same,

277
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,040
fighting and arguing with each other.

278
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,910
However,

279
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,890
my uncle has quit smoking.

280
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,360
My father

281
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,350
doesn't like drinking as much as he used to do.

282
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,870
Dahai

283
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,040
still likes eating very much.

284
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,640
He's always noisy and making jokes.

285
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,140
Beixi and Shiqi

286
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,820
get along well with each other.

287
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:24,010
I think

288
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,490
I'll attend their wedding soon.

289
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:33,390
Don't worry.

290
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,510
We are all fine.

291
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,540
Why did I tell you so much?

292
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:53,110
You know

293
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,350
all these things.

294
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,160
Right?

295
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,230
Then let me

296
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,960
take a good look at you again.

297
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,750
Your eyebrows look good.

298
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,410
Your eyes look good.

299
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,910
Your nose looks good, too.

300
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,080
Your mouth looks even prettier.

301
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,090
You're indeed the one I love.

302
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:16,070
Every part of you looks good.

303
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,770
You've been with me all the time,

304
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,670
and have never left.

305
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,780
My master is back! Come out now!

306
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:52,680
Master.

307
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,490
Dahai.

308
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,310
Why are you sitting at the entrance of the stronghold?

309
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:56,490
I'm waiting for you to eat.

310
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,730
Chief, you are back.

311
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,880
Shiqi. Beixi.

312
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,490
It's been a while since I saw you last time.

313
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,650
What brings you here today?

314
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,150
We came to see you.

315
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,370
Yes.

316
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:08,070
I'm here to see how you made Yu angry.

317
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:11,800
I made him angry? In what way?

318
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:13,980
Liquor.

319
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,370
Liquor.

320
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,940
It's Liquor.

321
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,020
Dengdeng.

322
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,780
You've really let me down.

323
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,200
Is there a new tavern in town?

324
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:27,090
People who bought its liquor formed a long line extending to the Qianhe Town. Right?

325
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,980
Then why didn't you buy some

326
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,610
to let me taste it?

327
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,290
Is that it?

328
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,140
I thought it was a big deal.

329
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,460
Isn't it a big deal?

330
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,640
Okay. I'll buy it for you now.

331
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:39,430
Wait for me.

332
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,510
Two jars.

333
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,320
Okay.

334
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,110
Three jars.

335
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:43,970
No problem.

336
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,740
Beixi, what's your purpose?

337
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,820
A coward needs wine to make himself get braver.

338
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,630
A sad man uses wine to drown his sorrow.

339
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:52,910
When a person gets drunk,

340
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,930
he would talk about the pain in his heart.

341
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,380
She'll be fine gradually after saying her pain out.

342
00:21:58,610 --> 00:21:59,450
Today,

343
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,250
let's give Dengdeng a dose of strong medicine.

344
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,760
-The five best scholars' hands. -Six, six, six.

345
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,120
Drink it.

346
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:09,150
Again.

347
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,140
Master, drink more.

348
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,110
Good brothers.

349
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:14,630
[Liquor]

350
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,590
Come on.

351
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,200
Again.

352
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,060
-Good brothers. -Six, six, six.

353
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:25,830
Really good brothers.

354
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:26,790
Dengdeng.

355
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:33,870
[Liquor]

356
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,390
Have a seat.

357
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:32,230
Father.

358
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:33,620
Here you are.

359
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,800
Dengdeng.

360
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,320
When your mother was alive,

361
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,500
if I had a fight with her,

362
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,150
she wouldn't say a word.

363
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,960
Now you've grown up.

364
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,510
How come you're the same as your mother?

365
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:54,610
You also keep everything to yourself without telling others.

366
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,930
As your father,

367
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,800
how could I be such a failure?

368
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,540
Didn't we agree to let my master drink to drown her sorrow?

369
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,410
Why are you drunk?

370
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,030
I'm not drunk.

371
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,320
Dengdeng.

372
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,610
Lu Yan has left,

373
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:09,380
but I'm still here.

374
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,980
All the brothers and sisters are still here.

375
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:15,460
Can't you just tell us?

376
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:17,490
That's right.

377
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,320
Master,

378
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,230
if you really think His Lordship is still alive,

379
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,460
just look for him.

380
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,310
We all agree. Right?

381
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,580
The rainy season is coming soon.

382
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:32,180
We need to set up some rain-proof sheds

383
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:34,010
inside our stronghold.

384
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,080
I think there are still many things to be arranged.

385
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,270
Alright, Dengdeng.

386
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,600
Without you, can't the Qingquan Stronghold

387
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,670
operate well?

388
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,700
Listen to me.

389
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,700
Can't you live for yourself for once?

390
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,190
I'm begging you. Okay?

391
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,780
Yu, look at you.

392
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,240
You can really drink a lot.

393
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,450
We don't even have enough liquor here.

394
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:58,100
I'll go get a few more bottles of liquor.

395
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,410
Wait for me.

396
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,500
I'll be back soon.

397
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,710
You went out to get the liquor,

398
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,150
but you're drinking it yourself.

399
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,910
Why did you come out?

400
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,360
Don't worry.

401
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,180
I'm not here to persuade you.

402
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:36,730
I'm here to laugh at you.

403
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,910
You still like rambling as you did before.

404
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,890
Do you also think

405
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,890
Lu Yan is still alive?

406
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,120
I, Gu Beixi,

407
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,740
have never been convinced by anyone in my life.

408
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,440
But I respect Lu Yan as he's a real man.

409
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,040
So I believe that

410
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,470
he can protect you forever.

411
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
Besides, after sealing up the Black Saintess,

412
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,760
we couldn't find his body.

413
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,260
Little Tot went missing, too.

414
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,210
It can't be a coincidence.

415
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,420
So,

416
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,870
why don't you look for him?

417
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,510
Don't use the Qingquan Stronghold as an excuse.

418
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,090
I know it's just an excuse.

419
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
Dengdeng.

420
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,220
Actually, this time I came to

421
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,500
say goodbye to you.

422
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,800
Say goodbye?

423
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,950
Over the past one year,

424
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,660
Shiqi and I have been helping at the rescue station.

425
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,690
There's a war in the north.

426
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,210
She wants to go there.

427
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,130
I promised Mr. Bai to take good care of her.

428
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,420
I'm worried about her,

429
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,050
so I want to go with her.

430
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,540
That's good.

431
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,560
I support Shiqi.

432
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,160
Seize the moment to do whatever you want as soon as possible.

433
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:42,800
If you need

434
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,660
help from our Qingquan Stronghold,

435
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,790
just let us know.

436
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,670
Dengdeng.

437
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,860
For me, Shiqi is someone

438
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,990
whom I had lost and then found again,

439
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,110
so I can better understand

440
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,220
how you feel.

441
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,420
You don't dare to have hope,

442
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,660
because you're afraid that the hope might be destroyed again.

443
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,260
But the more you dare not face it or look for him,

444
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,120
the more you will regret in the future.

445
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,720
When I heard you talk about what had happened 3,000 years ago,

446
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,710
I thought that was nonsense.

447
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,090
But after going through so much with you together,

448
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,390
I saw it all with my own eyes.

449
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:49,030
Dengdeng.

450
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,960
Lu Yan could wait for you for 3,000 years.

451
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,930
Why do you give up looking for him?

452
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,890
Chief.

453
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,200
-Chief. -Chief.

454
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,130
Chief, be careful on the way.

455
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,250
I'll be fine. Don't worry.

456
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:16,830
I'll be back soon.

457
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:18,220
She'll be fine. Don't worry.

458
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,390
-Okay. -Okay.

459
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,730
Be careful.

460
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,490
Okay.

461
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,900
Dengdeng.

462
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,460
Set off early and come back early.

463
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,530
When you arrive,

464
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,980
ask someone to send a message to me.

465
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,390
Don't worry, Father.

466
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,680
I'm giving the entire Qingquan Stronghold back to you.

467
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,050
Pay attention to your own health,

468
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,300
and take good care of yourself.

469
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:36,970
Got it.

470
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:41,350
Even if I have to search all over the world,

471
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,900
I must bring Lu Yan back.

472
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,980
You stubborn girl.

473
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,440
Beixi.

474
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,350
I'll entrust Miss Bai to you.

475
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,940
You must treat her well.

476
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,300
Just mind your own business.

477
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,270
Be careful not to become a haggard old woman

478
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,070
when you find Lu Yan.

479
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,940
Then he may abandon you.

480
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,310
Watch your mouth.

481
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,370
Brat!

482
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,210
Do you want to be beaten again?

483
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:17,790
You...

484
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,240
Don't worry.

485
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,110
You'll definitely find him.

486
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,220
Dengdeng, take good care of yourself on the way.

487
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,790
We'll wait for both of you.

488
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,860
Okay.

489
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,080
Alright.

490
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:39,750
Let's go.

491
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,020
We have to go, Senior Master.

492
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:41,810
Just go.

493
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:42,470
Dengdeng!

494
00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:44,460
Dengdeng!

495
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,850
Uncle.

496
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,800
I finally made it.

497
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,400
I bought these things

498
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,090
for you.

499
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,260
They are all your favorite foods.

500
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,600
I haven't seen you for half a month.

501
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,390
You didn't care about the stronghold or Dengdeng.

502
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,060
Before she leaves, you give her some delicious food.

503
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,280
Who are you trying to gag?

504
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,310
Who says my uncle doesn't care about me?

505
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,060
As I smell it, I know it's the first batch of Glutinous Rice Cake with Brown Sugar.

506
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,260
You stood in the line to buy it before dawn. Right?

507
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,100
Dahai, take it.

508
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:11,950
Give it to me.

509
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,720
I still have something good for you.

510
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,240
What is it?

511
