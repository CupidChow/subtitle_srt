Father.

29
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:46,240
My girl, I finally found

30
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,360
the way to eliminate the spirit worms.

31
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,039
What is it?

32
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,340
It took me a long time.

33
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,690
I finally found something

34
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,920
from the spirit-hunter that can defeat the the King of Gu,

35
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,670
which is called

36
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,300
the Dust-proof Bead.

37
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:00,510
The Dust-proof Bead?

38
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,650
Three thousand years ago,

39
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,210
the royal family of the ancient Shu had one.

40
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,259
But as the dynasty changed,

41
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,830
I'm not sure if this bead

42
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,350
is still in the old capital of ancient Shu.

43
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,080
But we can give it a try.

44
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,720
The ruins of ancient Shu are in Lingdong.

45
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,960
It's not far from us.

46

Dengdeng, is your health condition good enough to set out?

47
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,200
Yes, of course.

48
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,210
I'm fine.

49
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,140
I can do whatever I want now.

50
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,070
Besides, with Lu Yan by my side,

51
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,100
there's nothing to worry about.

52
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,720
Okay, let's set out now.

53

So every time you use your energy,

269
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,090
I can sense it.

270
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,140
No matter where you use your energy,

271
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,520

If I fall in love with someone else,

278
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,230
you'll lock me up in the dark room

279
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,280
and keep me at your disposal.

280

was supposed to deal with enemies.

285
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,770

286
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,280
the loss of energy in your body.

287

he escaped to a place

295

Don't be afraid. I'm not from Xiongya Stronghold.

I'm here to save you.

Okay.

They... They...

550
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,820
killed my father in front of me.

I have no family, Gu Beixi.

I beg you.

566
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,440
I beg you.

567
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,540

Who is it?

00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,670
What are you waiting for?

572
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:19,860
Find him!

573

Okay. Let's go.

574
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,360
Gu Beixi from Nanfeng Stronghold must not have gone far.

We must find the guy from the Nanfeng Stronghold.

584
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,060
I'll shoot him today!

585
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,770
You didn't know this, did you?

586
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,350
Although I also use guns,

587
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,710
actually, this knife is the one I've been practicing when I was a kid.

588
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,950
You go there! Over there!

589
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,970
What should we do?

590
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,250
We seem to be surrounded.

591
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,790
I'll lure them away.

592
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,520
There's a Taiping village not far from here.

593
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,270
There's a shabby City God Temple there.

594
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,590
-Wait for me there. -No.

595
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,760
You came here to save me.

596
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:23,390
I'll be the bait.

597
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,700
You escape first.

598
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,790
You can save me

599
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,110
when you get back to Nanfeng Stronghold.

600
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,780
There's no time.

601
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,140
Listen to me.

603
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,560
Promise me

604
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,500
that you'll meet me there.

605
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:42,100
And you won't leave me there alone.

606
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,700
Rest assured.

607
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,180
I've nothing special

608
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,590
except for being lucky enough.

609
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,070
Take this for self-defense.

610
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,070
It's a deal then.

611
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,090
I'll wait for you in that shabby temple.

612
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:04,670
I won't leave if you don't come.

613
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,640
Get him!

614
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,670
Brat,

615
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,850
I'll let you die here today.

616
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,900
Shoot him!

617
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:11,650
Shoot him! Shoot him!

618
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,170
Shoot him! Shoot him!

619
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,730
Chase them!

620
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,160
Go!

621
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,240
Hurry up.

people here don't even smile.

This is so scary.

I'm sorry. He didn't mean it.

630
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:08,900
It's okay.

631
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,710
Where have you been? I've been looking for you.

632
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:11,780
Eat something.

633
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,830
What's wrong? Are you okay?

Fireflies.

639

What firefly?

00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,020
What firefly are your talking about?

642
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,560
Something is wrong on with his brain.

643
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,130
He often talks nonsense.

644

We didn't get any useful information.

657
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,600
What should we do?

658
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,050
Let's go somewhere else.

when I was young,

836

a group of villains broke into Yu Village

We agreed that

843
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,110
although we couldn't be born on the same day,

844
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:12,490
we would like to die on the same day.

I think this pattern

Then I looked for you everywhere.

The villagers told me

858
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,020
they gave you to a beggar,

859
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,410
and he took you out of the village.

860
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,060
Could it be...

861
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,070
the fool knows something?

862
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,180
He knows

863
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,310
how my mother died?

864
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,580
He...

865
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,530
He should know that...

866
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,220
dragon...

867
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:01,700
Father!

868
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,110
Father, it's fine.

869
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:09,180
Let's go to that fool tomorrow morning

870
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,070
and ask him.

871
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:22,150
I found the dragon pattern

872
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,400
left by your mother before she died.

873
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,130
I think this pattern

874
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:31,020
must have something to do with

875
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,740
the ones who killed her.

876
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:35,130
Sir.

877
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,230
Sir, what's wrong?

878
00:42:41,370 --> 00:42:42,390
Nothing.

879
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,910
Is it because

880
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:48,110
what ladyship's father said?

881
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:56,090
Actually, the dragon pattern they mentioned just now,

882
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:58,270
I have one on my body.

883
