1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will never say let go

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Because you're not me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Because you're not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Because you're not me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Because you're not me

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Because you're not me

8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You are so beautiful.

9
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Speaking of the dress of the bride,

10
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
you are better than anyone.

11
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You should wear this wedding dress.

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I should be the most beautiful bride

13
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
in the whole Qingquan Town

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
in this wedding dress.

15
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
My bride is the most beautiful.

16
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You are the best husband in the world.

17
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Master, you are right.

18
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Wait for me.

19
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
After I change my clothes,

20
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
we will take photos.

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay.

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Sir, this is your photo.

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Thank you.

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
See you, sir.

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What?

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Open it.

27
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Shi Qi,

28
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
you were unlucky before.

29
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You must have left nothing behind.

30
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I am sorry.

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I must have left nothing behind.

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I was cleaning my father's warehouse

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and found this photo.

34
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I thought I should wash it

35
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and leave you a memory.

36
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You must miss your father very much.

37
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He loved you so much before.

38
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
After a few days,

39
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I will take you to his grave

40
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and offer incense to him.

41
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Don't worry.

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I have settled down.

43
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Thank you, Gu Weixi.

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Thank you.

45
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Let's go.

46
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Boss,

47
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
where are Yu and Gu Nuan?

48
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
They have left.

49
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
They said they would take photos.

50
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's go to them.

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let's not go.

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
They are married.

53
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Why should we bother?

54
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
They are here.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Let's have a look.

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What about this?

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's a big one.

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's vulgar.

59
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Vulgar?

60
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I will go to the bathroom.

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Thank you.

62
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Thank you.

63
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Gu Weixi,

64
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
what do you want?

65
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Nothing.

66
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I just want to make a dress for you.

67
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You must have lost it

68
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
to save your life.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So I want to make a new one for you.

70
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Why did you make me a dress?

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Do you really think you are my father?

72
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Are you thinking of compensating me again?

73
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Shiqi,

74
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
can you stop saying that?

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I just want to make a dress for you.

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
And Deng Deng is right.

77
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I am really happy

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
after you come back.

79
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
And Deng Deng...

80
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Gu Weixi,

81
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I am also happy

82
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
that you made this for me today.

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But if you still have Deng Deng in your heart,

84
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
you really don't have to do this.

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I can afford to let go of it.

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And I said before,

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I have you in my heart.

88
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It has nothing to do with you.

89
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You don't believe me, do you?

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Gu Weixi,

91
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
where are you going?

92
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Gu Weixi,

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
what are you doing?

94
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Heaven above,

95
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
the land is the sword.

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Heaven and earth are the witnesses.

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Mountains and rivers are the allies.

98
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I, Gu Weixi,

99
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
will make a vow in front of Uncle Bai today.

100
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
In the future,

101
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I and Bai Shiqi

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
will share the same fortune

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and share the same difficulties.

104
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
We will eat meat together

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
and drink together.

106
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't want to live the same year and the same month

107
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
but I want to die the same year and the same month.

108
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Uncle Bai,

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I am not a child.

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I am a child.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Uncle Bai,

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
don't worry.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
In the future,

114
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I will take good care of Bai Shiqi.

115
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Why are you crazy?

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Why are you crazy?

117
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Then do you believe me?

118
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes.

119
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Are you ready?

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Come on.

121
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
OK.

122
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Come on.

123
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Ready.

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Three, two, one.

125
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
General Yan,

126
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
3000 years ago,

127
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
did your father force you

128
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
to marry a half-Queen?

129
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
No.

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I was busy with the war at that time.

131
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I couldn't care about these things.

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
So,

133
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
General Yan is very affectionate to me.

134
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He is no different from a normal boy.

135
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But why do you always pretend to be

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
a man of old and deep in front of me?

137
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I am older than you.

138
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
And I know what you are thinking every day.

139
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I know it.

140
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What am I thinking now?

141
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Whatever you are thinking,

142
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I can help you realize it today.

143
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Really?

144
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Then,

145
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I want to dance with you.

146
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Our wedding is a Chinese wedding.

147
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
But I heard that

148
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
all the girls in the town

149
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
have to dance with the one they like.

150
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Because of that,

151
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
two people can hear each other's heartbeats.

152
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You forgot that

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I can hear your heartbeats all the time.

154
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Whether you are happy or sad,

155
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
or nervous or angry,

156
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I can know it.

157
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Come on.

158
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I am here.

159
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I am here.

160
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I am here.

161
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I am here.

162
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I am here.

163
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I am here.

164
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I am here.

165
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I am here.

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I am here.

167
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I am here.

168
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I am here.

169
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I am here.

170
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I am here.

171
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I am here.

172
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I am here.

173
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I am here.

174
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I am here.

175
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I am here.

176
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I am here.

177
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I am here.

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I am here.

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I am here.

180
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I am here.

181
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I am here.

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I am here.

183
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I am here.

184
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I am here.

185
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I am here.

186
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What do you think I am feeling now?

187
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You are beating faster now

188
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
because of the reason you dance with me?

189
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Are you ready?

190
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I am here.

191
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I am here.

192
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I am here.

193
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I am here.

194
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I am here.

195
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I am here.

196
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I am here.

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I am here.

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I am here.

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I am here.

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I am here.

201
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I am here.

202
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I am here.

203
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I am here.

204
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I am here.

205
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I am here.

206
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I am here.

207
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I am here.

208
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I am here.

209
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I am here.

210
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I am here.

211
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I am here.

212
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I am here.

213
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I am here.

214
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I am here.

215
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I am here.

216
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I am here.

217
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I am here.

218
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I am here.

219
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
When two stars are so close

220
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
When the whole world is occupied by you

221
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You go first.

222
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I will deal with them.

223
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I will hold your heart

224
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Until your memory

225
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You are me for you

226
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The past

227
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
This is something that protects you from death.

228
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I have brought you something new.

229
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Only to be myself

230
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I have never been alone

231
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
If I get a bad omen

232
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Can you stay for three years

233
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
To help me settle down in the capital

234
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Don't think about it.

235
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I won't let anything happen to you.

236
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Don't be afraid.

237
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I am here.

238
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I will always be with you.

239
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You are me for you

240
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The past

241
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
This is something that protects you from death.

242
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Promise me.

243
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
In the future, you

244
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You must live well.

245
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So this is the love of men and women.

246
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The living can really be killed.

247
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Thank you for appearing in my life.

248
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Let me no longer be alone.

249
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Someone shares happiness.

250
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Someone is in trouble.

251
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Whether it was before

252
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Now

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Or in the future

254
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's so good to have you.

255
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Are you doing something bad?

256
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Go to your

257
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What nonsense

258
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Back back back

259
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Dangdang

260
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
My daughter is here.

261
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Dad, second dad

262
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Why are you here?

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Is it Lei Xingda

264
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I woke you up.

265
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You can't stay up for tomorrow's wedding.

266
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Otherwise, it won't be beautiful.

267
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
That's right.

268
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Dad

269
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Didn't you always blame me for not letting you drink?

270
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Tomorrow I have a big wedding.

271
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Let you drink a happy tonight.

272
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The sea girl is good to me.

273
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Second dad, you are not good at drinking.

274
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Drink less

275
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Come

276
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
The girl will drink with you.

277
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Girl

278
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Did you encounter something?

279
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes, what's wrong with you?

280
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Nothing

281
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Come

282
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Fill it up for you.

283
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It's okay.

284
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You said this is

285
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Is it the thing that dad and second dad bought.

286
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
You don't take advantage of it.

287
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Come

288
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Drink one more

289
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Look at you

290
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
No

291
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Okay, okay, okay

292
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What's going on?

293
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Tell me

294
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You say

295
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Nothing

296
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Just can't bear to leave you.

297
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm going to get married tomorrow.

298
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Second dad

299
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
My dad will depend on you to take care of him.

300
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
He has a bad temper.

301
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Love to drink and make trouble

302
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
You take care of him.

303
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And

304
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
You have to pay more attention to your health.

305
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Is not obedient

306
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Lu Yan gave us so many gifts.

307
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
In the future

308
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It took us several years to buy our Qingquan Village.

309
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
New year's gift

310
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Second dad also put a few more clothes on himself.

311
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Did you hear it?

312
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
My daughter

313
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What are you talking about?

314
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm not going to come back.

315
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Isn't Lu Yan a check point?

316
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
And

317
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The clothes he bought me are too ugly.

318
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You can pick it for me in person.

319
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Bullshit

320
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Since the day I had a house

321
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Which clothes are not I bought for you?

322
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Don't you wear a good one?

323
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What do you look like?

324
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You look ugly.

325
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You're a little weird.

326
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Okay, okay, okay.

327
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Why are you crying?

328
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I know you think a lot about getting married.

329
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Don't think too much

330
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You will never leave this house.

331
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I can't open this house.

332
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
The old and the young in the house are counting on you.

333
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You are still our big boss.

334
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Yes, that's right.

335
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I know

336
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Second dad

337
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Dad

338
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I am Yu Deng Deng.

339
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
As long as someone can rely on it

340
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
There is no main core bone.

341
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I will rely on you two in the future.

342
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Many years

343
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Daughter

344
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
A daughter is like a father.

345
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Do you want to tell me something?

346
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Don't you want to get married?

347
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Tell dad

348
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Dad will tell Lu Yan right away.

349
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Dismiss

350
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I regret it.

351
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Second dad, go with him.

352
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'll go.

353
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'll go.

354
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'll go.

355
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Enough

356
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Don't fight.

357
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
What are you talking about?

358
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Your daughter's eyes are not wrong.

359
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
The heart will not change at will.

360
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
To be honest

361
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
At first I took Lu Yan to the mountain

362
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's true because I like his appearance.

363
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
But then I went down the mountain and experienced so many things.

364
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Lu Yan is step by step

365
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Walked into my heart

366
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
He is always bored and not talking.

367
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
He is a tiger.

368
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
In fact, he has the bloodiest heart.

369
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The bottom of the heart is also the most soft.

370
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Three thousand years ago

371
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
He is the general of their ancient Shu State.

372
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
In his heart

373
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's all about the whole country.

374
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
High position

375
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Of course, the burden is heavy.

376
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
People call him General Yan.

377
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
later

378
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He sacrificed his life for the whole Shu State.

379
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
and so

380
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
He is a

381
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
He is a person with the will of the country.

382
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Later Yun Xi died for him.

383
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
He went down the mountain

384
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Take off the makeup

385
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I've been with him for three thousand years.

386
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm with him on the road.

387
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
He is also silently guarding me.

388
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Three times to save me.

389
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
and so

390
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
He is a person who values friendship.

391
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Such a person who values friendship

392
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's been a thousand years.

393
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm afraid I'll never meet this life again.

394
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
and so

395
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
No matter what he did in the future

396
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You don't blame him.

397
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
it is good

398
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I thought Deng Deng

399
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I thought Deng Deng

400
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
There is no normal form all day long.

401
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
It seems to have grown up.

402
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So you and Lu Yan are together.

403
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Brother is relieved.

404
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm also in the dark.

405
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Don't talk about those sad things.

406
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and so

407
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I talked to Lu Yan.

408
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
This kid didn't say a few words at the time.

409
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But I can feel it from his eyes.

410
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
He really loves you.

411
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I love you

412
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
You can entrust yourself to the god.

413
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
If he wants to bully you in the future

414
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Dad and brother will never let him go.

415
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Yes

416
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Wipe the urine

417
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
When you are behind Deng Deng

418
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Don't you wipe your tears?

419
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Go go go

420
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
OK

421
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You don't have to say me.

422
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
We don't cry.

423
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Let's drink one more.

424
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
it is good

425
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Make some happy things

426
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
It's okay

427
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Come on, cheers

428
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Cheers

429
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Why are you here?

430
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Tomorrow is the wedding.

431
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
The bride and groom can't meet the night before.

432
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You are drunk.

433
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Go to rest.

434
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm not drunk.

435
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm not drunk.

436
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I'm not drunk.

437
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I'm not drunk.

438
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm not drunk.

439
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I'm not drunk.

440
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I'm not drunk.

441
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm not drunk.

442
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm not drunk.

443
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Lu Yan

444
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
I am so happy.

445
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I haven't been so happy for many years.

446
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
The first time we got married

447
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You are not willing to

448
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I'm so confused

449
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
We don't know

450
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What is the feeling of loving a person?

451
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
At that time

452
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I ran straight

453
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I thought I could tie someone up.

454
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And I could accept his heart.

455
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Lu Yan

456
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Do you think

457
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I did wrong at the beginning?

458
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I really want to be with you forever.

459
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I want to go to the end of the world with you.

460
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
We haven't been together

461
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
There are mountains and rivers.

462
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I want to be with you forever.

463
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I want to be with you forever.

464
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I want to be with you forever.

465
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I want to be with you forever.

466
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
There must be many opportunities in the future.

467
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Can let us

468
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Go to the mountains and rivers together.

469
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Lu Yan

470
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Can you promise me

471
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Live for yourself once

472
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Three thousand years ago

473
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You are for the old mouse

474
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Three thousand years later

475
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
It's for me again.

476
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
This time

477
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I hope you live for yourself.

478
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I hope you live for yourself.

479
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Why do you say I am so noisy now?

480
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Since I met you

481
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I am no longer the one who can afford to put down the fish.

482
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
You say

483
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Am I in your hands?

484
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
If you didn't meet me

485
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Maybe you will still be that kind

486
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Simple and happy fish lamp.

487
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
If you are not there

488
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
The fish lamp is incomplete.

489
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I am not there

490
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I am not there

491
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I am not there

492
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I am not there

493
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I am not there

494
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I am not there

495
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I am not there

496
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I am not there

497
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I am not there

498
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
I am not there

499
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I am not there

500
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I am not there

501
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I am not there

502
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I am not there

503
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I am not there

504
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I am not there

505
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I am not there

506
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I am not there

507
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
I am not there

508
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
I am not there

509
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I am not there

510
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I am not there

511
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I am not there

512
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
I am not there

513
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I am not there

514
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I am not there

515
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I am not there

516
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I am not there

517
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I am not there

518
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I am not there

519
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
No

520
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
No

521
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:55,560
Come in

522
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:01,920
Come in

523
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,120
Let me see

524
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,600
Whose daughter is going to get married?

525
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,480
Yours

526
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,280
Why are you crying?

527
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,440
My second father

528
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,240
When did you see me crying?

529
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,240
I saw your father's eyes were red just now.

530
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,560
What's wrong with him?

531
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
He got married.

532
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,840
All the old and young in the village

533
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,840
were crying.

534
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,040
Who knows

535
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,240
he thought Deng Deng

536
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,440
married a demon.

537
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,240
That's right.

538
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,440
Lu Yuan is so clever.

539
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,240
He is considered

540
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,840
a clever demon.

541
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,840
Isn't he?

542
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,040
He is a demon.

543
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
He is an old demon who has lived for three thousand years.

544
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,440
Yes.

545
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,440
Old demon.

546
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,240
Old demon.

547
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,240
Why are you staring at me?

548
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,840
I'm looking at you.

549
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
What's so good about

550
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,040
this old man?

551
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,440
My father has a small nose and small eyes.

552
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,240
I didn't expect

553
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,840
he is so smart.

554
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,640
What's the use?

555
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,640
He is just an old man.

556
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,040
In such a happy day,

557
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,440
look at you.

558
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
Okay.

559
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,640
I'll comb your hair.

560
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,640
I'll give you a day's service.

561
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,640
Since I was a child,

562
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,640
I like you combing my hair the most.

563
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,040
Of course.

564
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,240
You are so bright.

565
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,640
Other girls envy me.

566
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,240
Let them envy you.

567
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,440
From the beginning to the end,

568
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,040
wealth doesn't need to be worried.

569
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,640
I'm a man of many sons and daughters.

570
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,440
From the beginning to the end,

571
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,240
I'm a man of many sons and daughters.

572
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,240
From the beginning to the end,

573
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,640
I'm a man of many sons and daughters.

574
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:32,100
The beauty of

575
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,840
像erald

576
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,660
Videos, videos

577
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,280
The auspicious time has come

578
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,200

00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,000
The fireworks

582
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,400
Are the next-gen talent

583
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,760
The baby

591
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,700

Let's make a good relationship.

609
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
Wu Yan.

610
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,760
Let's be a family with this cup of wine.

611
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Wu Yan.

612
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:37,760
Wu Yan.

613
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,760
Yun Xi.

614
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,760
I thought I completely lost you.

615
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,760
I lived for 3,000 years

616
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,760
just to find you

617
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,760
and return the yuan-pellet to you

618
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,760
after I woke up.

619
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,760
I didn't expect

620
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,760
that after 3,000 years,

621
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:22,760
I would really be with you

622
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,760
and be with you forever.

623
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,760
I'm sorry.

624
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,760
I'm sorry.

625
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,760
I'm sorry.

626
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,760
I'm sorry.

627
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,760
After 3,000 years,

628
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,760
I really met you here.

629
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,760
This is the will of God.

630
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,760
I've been very happy

631
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,760
during this period.

632
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,760
Now the meaning of my life

633
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,760
is not just returning the yuan-pellet to you.

634
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,760
I also want to spend

635
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,760
this life with you.

636
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,760
But people have difficulties.

637
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,760
People are important.

638
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,760
This may be

639
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,760
our destiny.

640
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,760
As your husband,

641
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,760
I'll sacrifice this life.

642
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,760
I'll do it.

643
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,760
I just hope

644
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,760
you can get the yuan-pellet

645
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,760
and end this matter.

646
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,760
From now on,

647
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,760
you can live happily.

648
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,760
Deng Deng.

649
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,760
I promised you

650
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,760
that we would live and die together.

651
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,760
I will not break my promise.

652
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,760
I promise you.

653
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,760
I'm sorry.

654
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,760
I'm sorry.

655
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,760
I'm sorry.

656
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,760
I'm sorry.

657
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,760
I'm sorry.

658
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,760
I'm sorry.

659
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,760
I'm sorry.

660
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,760
I'm sorry.

661
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,760
I'm sorry.

662
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,760
I'm sorry.

663
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,760
I'm sorry.

664
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,760
I'm sorry.

665
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,760
I'm sorry.

666
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,760
I'm sorry.

667
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,760
I'm sorry.

668
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,760
I'm sorry.

669
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,760
I'm sorry.

670
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,760
I'm sorry.

671
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,760
I'm sorry.

672
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,760
I'm sorry.

673
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,760
I'm sorry.

674
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,760
I'm sorry.

675
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,760
I'm sorry.

676
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,760
I'm sorry.

677
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,760
I'm sorry.

678
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,760
I'm sorry.

679
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,760
I'm sorry.

680
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,760
I'm sorry.

681
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,760
I'm sorry.

682
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,760
I'm so sorry.

683
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,760
I'm sorry.

684
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,760
I'm sorry.

685
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,760
I'm so sorry.

686
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,760
I'm so sorry.

687
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,760
I'm sorry.

688
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,760
I'm so sorry.

689
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,760

690
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,760
I'm so sorry.

691
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:18,760
I'm sorry.

692
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,760
I'm sorry.

693
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,760
I'm so sorry.

694
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,760
I'm so sorry.

695
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:30,760
It's too late to say I love you

696
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,760
It's too late

697
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:43,760
Ah, to say I love you

698
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:56,760
Ah, to say I love you

699
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:23,760
It's not that easy to die

700
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:56,760
Yun Xi, we finally meet

701
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,760
It's you

702
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
Don't waste your time

703
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
You have no choice

704
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,760
Your life and death are under my control

705
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,760
What are you doing?

706
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,760
You imprisoned me for three thousand years

707
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,760
And you are holding the Saintess' name

708
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,760
You are pretending to be a fake person

709
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,760
And you are making the whole Ling Clan talk nonsense

710
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,760
You betrayed our trust

711
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,760
But you ask me what I want to do

712
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:45,760
Okay, I'll tell you what I want to do

713
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,760
For three thousand years, I only want to do one thing

714
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,760
That is to let you, a traitor, also taste the taste of being imprisoned

715
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,760
And then?

716
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,760
I will lead the whole Ling Clan to the end of this world

717
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,760
Of course, I have to thank you

718
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:14,760
It's your goodwill and stupidity that made me wake up

719
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,760
The whole world will be shaken by my torture

720
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,760
The miserable human will be ashes in my shadow

721
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,760
Let me go

722
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
Let me go

723
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,760
I've been waiting for this moment for three thousand years

724
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,760
To prove your despair and death

725
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,760
I'm so happy

726
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,760
I miss you

727
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,760
I miss you

728
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,760
I miss you

729
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,760
I miss you

730
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,760
I miss you

731
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,760
I miss you

732
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,760
I miss you

733
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,760
I miss you

734
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,760
I miss you

735
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,760
I miss you

736
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,760
I miss you

737
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,760
I miss you

738
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,760
I miss you

739
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,760
I will call your name with all my heart

740
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,760
Until your memory

741
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:36,760
You are my only

742
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,760
Father who walked into the wind

743
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,760
This city is like a cloud, the moon is like a cloud

744
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:50,760
How can I know love?

745
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:55,760
I hide my heart

746
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,760
And make a decision for you

747
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:21,760
When two hearts are so close

748
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,760
When the whole world is occupied by you

749
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,760
I will call your name with all my heart

750
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,760
Until your memory

751
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,760
You are my only

752
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:49,760
Father who walked into the wind

753
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,760
This city is like a cloud, the moon is like a cloud

754
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,760
How can I know love?

755
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,760
I hide my heart

756
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,760
And make a decision for you

757
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,760
I will call your name with all my heart

758
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,760
Until your memory
