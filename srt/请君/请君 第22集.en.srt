174
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:28,510
How dare you break into the execution ground!

175
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,470
Beat him!

176
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,200
You're indeed a monster.

177
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,370
Come on!

178
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,050
Get the weapon.

179
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:06,950
Monster! Monster!

180
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,020
Kill!

181
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,800
Increase the firepower.

182
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,920
Kill them all.

183
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,450
The city gate is heavily guarded.

184
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,730
Not even a mosquito can get in.

185
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,710
[Wanted]

186
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:53,470
Your Ladyship, what should we do now?

187
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,350
Just break in.

188
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:54,910
How?

189
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,720
Master, they have more people than us.

190
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,600
Just go.

191
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,580
Are you crazy?

192
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,660
With these stupid guns,

193
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,220
they'll kill us in no time.

194
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:04,120
I'm the most experienced in invading a city.

195
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,880
Haven't you heard of a saying?

196
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,640
Razzle-dazzle.

197
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,210
Smoke out the enemy.

198
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,370
What's going on?

199
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,970
Over there! Come on!

200
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,410
Be careful.

201
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,470
You think I can't kill you?

202
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,380
Come on, increase the firepower.

203
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,770
Kill him!

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,430
Bring me the bullets!

205
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,250
Oh no, we're surrounded.

206
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,510
You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.

207
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,250
We must make it.

208
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:29,170
I'll distract the fire.

209
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:29,990
See you at the execution ground.

210
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:30,470
OK.

211
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,700
Let's split up.

212
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,360
What the hell?

213
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,870
They're still alive?

214
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,470
At first,

215
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,180
I didn't want to hurt you.

216
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,830
Run! Run!

217
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,120
Why are you running?

218
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,500
Come back!

219
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,620
You won't get away this time.

220
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,580
Do you think the spirit worm will disappear in the body of a spirit creature

221
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,660
after you kill me?

222
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,070
What do you mean?

223
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,910
Actually, you've always known it.

224
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,470
The only way

225
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,620
to get rid of spirit worms within their bodies

226
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,140
is to release all the energy within your body

227
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,060
and sacrifice yourself.

228
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,930
I'm curious.

229
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,110
Will you choose to

230
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,210
continue to protect Dengdeng

231
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,710
or to save these poor spirit beings?

232
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:56,220
General Yan,

233
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,010
I hope you will enjoy the gift

234
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,940
that I prepared for you.

235
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,140
Help!

236
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,470
Help!

237
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,610
Dengdeng!

238
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,820
Sorry.

live well.

00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,160
Didn't you promise to protect me forever?

345
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,320
You said you would always be with me.

346
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:34,840
You can't break your promise.

347
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,580
You must wake up.

348
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,560
Xin! Xin!

349
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,510
Master, don't do this.

350
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,170
You can't live without it either.

351
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,340
You will die.

352
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:11,110
Master!

353
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,130
Move aside!

354
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,690
Go away!

355
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:21,380
Lu Yan.

356
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,700
You are my husband,

357
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,450
now and forever.

358
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,120
You are mine.

359
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,790
Even God can't take you from me.

360
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:34,510
I saved your life 3,000 years ago.

361
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,210
I'll do it again.

I don't think you can pay it off with your life.

If I can't repay it in this life,

425
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,370
then I'll repay it with my next life

I didn't expect you have that skill.

Let me tell you.

435
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,740
Going forward,

436
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,040

437
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,750
Okay.

438

00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,160
Thank you.

452
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:41,130
Thank you, General Yan.

453
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,910
Don't gobble like that.

454
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,380
It's all yours.

455
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,930
You just recovered.

456
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,030
It's because I just recovered,

457
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:02,890
so I have to eat well.

458
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,450
It's good for my health.

459
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,670
Dengdeng will scold you if she finds out.

460
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:08,070
Just don't tell her.

461
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,900
Dad, we're back.

462

464
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,660
Yes, we have.

465
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,840
Dad.

466
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,550

467
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,640
You've recovered?

468
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,590
Yes, I've recovered. Look.

469
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,240
I'm so strong now.

470
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,580
It's fine.

471
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,850
We were worried about you.

472
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,370
Those people suddenly returned to human form.

473
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,030
So we're celebrating.

474
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,190
We drank a little.

475
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:49,940
Yeah.

476
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,510
You freaked me out.

477
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:54,750
It's okay now.

478
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,210
Congratulations on your return, Saintess.

479
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,560
Saintess.

480
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,970
We've waited for you for 3,000 years.

481
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:03,970
We finally got you back.

482
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,770
Finally we've got our savior.

483
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,620
Yes, Saintess.

484
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,620
We can finally live a peaceful life.

485
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:11,510
Thank you, Saintess.

486
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:13,290
This is the only carrot I have with me.

487
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,210
This is for you.

488
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:17,930
Thank you, Rabbit.

489
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,580
I'll keep this gift from you very well.

490
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:22,950

Thank you, General Yan.

493
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,310
Thank you for killing the King of Worm

494
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,940
so that we could transform into human form again

495
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,820
and be reborn.

496
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,100
Thank you, General Yan.

497
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,280
Now everyone is safe.

498
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,440
Leave Yingdu City as soon as possible.

499
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,020
Leave Yingdu City?

500
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,580
Where can we go?

501
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,630
You can go to Qingquan Town.

502
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,580
Or, you can go to my village.

503
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,780
That sounds good.

504
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,750
Great. Go you guys.

505
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,840
There are food and drinks.

506
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,730
There are tons of people. It'll be fun.

507
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:52,950
Go back and pack up.

508
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,920
Just go.

509
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,900
Okay.

510
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,560
Take care.

511
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:57,940
Bye. Bye.

I'm fine.

I'll get well after a few days of rest.

Really?

543
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:48,070
I have to check up on you by myself.

Let me see.

545

Your pulse is weak.

546
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,820
You've consumed a lot of energy.

547
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,310
You won't recover in days.

548

I have to accompany you

549
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,920
at least for a month.

550
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,390
If that's the case,

551
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:12,530
is one month enough?

552
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,430
Yeah.

553

At least one or two years.

No, Chief.

556

He'll die

557
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,180
that way.

558
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,920
It'd better be a lifetime.

687
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:44,980
♫When the whole world is occupied by you♫

688
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:50,010
♫I'll call out your name so hard♫

689
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:54,800
♫Until you respond♫

690
00:42:55,660 --> 00:43:01,300
♫You're the only♫

691
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:07,130
♫Scenery I've walked into♫

692
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,530
♫In this encountering, feel the four seasons♫

693
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:14,620
♫Fate is carved into love♫

694
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:19,930
♫How lucky I am♫

695
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:23,060
♫The decision I made for you♫

696
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:52,280
