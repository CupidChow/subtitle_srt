00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not afraid of anything

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not afraid of anything

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not afraid of anything

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm not afraid of anything

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not afraid of anything

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of anything

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not afraid of anything

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not afraid of anything

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not afraid of anything

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not afraid of anything

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not afraid of anything

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not afraid of anything

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm not afraid of anything

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm not afraid of anything

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm not afraid of anything

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not afraid of anything

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not afraid of anything

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not afraid of anything

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not afraid of anything

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not afraid of anything

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm not afraid of anything

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm not afraid of anything

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not afraid of anything

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not afraid of anything

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not afraid of anything

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm not afraid of anything

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Episode 2

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I brought you here

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
to do the makeup.

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Joke.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No man would do the makeup.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Since the beginning,

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
no man has married before.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Right?

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes.

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You are a single couple.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
No burden.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The pure and sour milk is delicious.

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It will start soon.

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Children's special cold medicine.

41
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
39 children's cold medicine.

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It will start soon.

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Episode 3

44
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Sorry to bother you.

45
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Madam Lu.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
According to the rules,

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
you have to offer the tea to our master.

48
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Please.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's funny.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I told you.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
As a man,

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
how can you be so willing to be humiliated?

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Yes.

54
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Who is talking?

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Why are you again?

56
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You all saw it.

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The master of the fish village is getting married.

58
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It has to be done according to the rules.

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The tea is offered to the master.

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It's a fair and just thing.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Am I right?

62
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Fair and just.

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'm the one who is getting married.

65
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I said it.

66
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I won't lose.

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
And,

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
if you are here to congratulate me,

69
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I will give you a double welcome.

70
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But if someone

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
wants to see me being bullied,

72
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I will also see it clearly.

73
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Now,

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I will also have a chance to settle the score.

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Madam Lu.

76
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You are right.

77
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But everything has a rule.

78
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But the rule of the Qingquan village

79
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
is also your rule.

80
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You can break it or you can stand it.

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You...

82
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You are really...

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You are really...

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Madam, what's wrong?

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Tell us.

86
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I said,

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
if you are thirsty,

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
don't eat too much.

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You are getting married.

90
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If you really want to

91
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
make a living for us,

92
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
we will see you on the stage.

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
See you on the stage.

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay.

95
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Stop arguing.

96
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's done.

97
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Please go to the courtyard.

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I invited the best photographer

99
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
to take a photo for us.

100
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Okay?

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Okay.

102
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay.

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What's this?

104
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I didn't expect it.

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What's this?

106
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's a wooden box.

107
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's so big.

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's big.

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
How is it?

110
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Was it meaningful?

111
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You said it well.

112
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I didn't do anything

113
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
to you.

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Who told me...

115
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
That thing is...

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You said you

117
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
can support me.

118
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You look rich.

119
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You don't even know

120
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
that you have never seen a camera.

121
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Uncle Ya,

122
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
take a photo for us.

123
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Okay.

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You can't blink

125
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
when taking a photo.

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Otherwise,

127
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
it will absorb your soul.

128
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If you are afraid,

129
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
just hide behind me.

130
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't worry.

131
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm here.

132
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I won't let anyone

133
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
hurt you.

134
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Men's mouth

135
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
is a liar.

136
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What are you doing?

137
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Uncle Ya,

138
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
that's it.

139
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Take a photo.

140
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Okay.

141
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Come on.

142
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Drink.

143
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Congratulations.

144
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's so good.

145
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's 666.

146
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
It's so good.

147
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's get a car.

148
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Send it back.

149
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't worry, boss.

150
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll go.

151
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'll send it to him.

152
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Slow down.

153
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's go.

154
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'll send it.

155
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Come on.

156
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Slow down.

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Come on.

158
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Slow down.

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay.

160
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Let's go.

161
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll send it.

162
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Slow down.

163
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Come on.

164
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Slow down.

165
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Okay.

166
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's go.

167
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay.

168
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay.

169
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No drunk, no returning.

170
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll drink for master.

171
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Give it to me.

172
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay.

173
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Okay.

174
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Come on.

175
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Come here.

176
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Where is Gu Beixi?

177
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Where did he go?

178
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I didn't see him

179
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
when I was praying.

180
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I didn't see him

181
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
when the bosses took a photo.

182
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Did he make up

183
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
some stupid idea

184
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
while we were in a mess?

185
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No, master.

186
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I heard that

187
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
he was locked in the woodshed

188
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
by someone.

189
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
How about

190
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
releasing him?

191
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Is it okay?

192
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let him have a good time.

193
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Let him stay.

194
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay.

195
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I won't play.

196
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Are you okay?

197
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm fine.

198
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm telling you.

199
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
He can drink after one drink.

200
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Come on.

201
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No, no.

202
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Come on.

203
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm serious.

204
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I've never been drunk.

205
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm the one who should be drunk.

206
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Don't be shy.

207
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
They're here to give us money.

208
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Can we smile

209
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
when we give you a toast?

210
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's a shame.

211
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Give me some face today.

212
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Don't let others laugh at us.

213
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Okay?

214
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You won't laugh?

215
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I can help you.

216
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Forget it.

217
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Look at you.

218
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What's going on?

219
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I know

220
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
you're sincere

221
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
to everyone.

222
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
But

223
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
don't drink so much

224
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
if you can't drink.

225
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It's all out.

226
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Look at you.

227
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let me wipe it for you.

228
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Thank you, all the lords.

229
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Thank you.

230
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Thank you.

231
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You must drink.

232
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm telling you.

233
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Lu Yan and I

234
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
have experienced life.

235
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Good wine.

236
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
From now on,

237
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
we're a family.

238
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
We'll see each other

239
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
as we see me.

240
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We're in the world, right?

241
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We'll see each other

242
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
even if we're low.

243
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I hope all lords

244
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
can help us

245
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and don't make it hard for me.

246
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Come on.

247
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Fill it up.

248
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Come on.

249
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Cheers.

250
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Cheers.

251
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Fill it up.

252
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Come on.

253
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Cheers.

254
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Cheers.

255
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Come on.

256
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'll drink first.

257
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Come on.

258
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Fill it up.

259
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
All lords.

260
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Okay.

261
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Master, let me do it.

262
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Come on.

263
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay.

264
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Let me do it.

265
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's so good.

266
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Master, it's so good.

267
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You're drunk?

268
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I drank so much.

269
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm like a drunk.

270
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No.

271
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You go and adjust yourself.

272
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Come back later.

273
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Okay.

274
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Don't embarrass us.

275
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Come on.

276
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Go and drink some wine.

277
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Master of Northern Gou.

278
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll drink with you.

279
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Come on.

280
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'll drink with you.

281
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Fill it up.

282
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Master.

283
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
If Yu Deng Deng keeps drinking like this,

284
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
he'll be drunk for three days and three nights.

285
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Will he hurt the master's snacks?

286
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Come on.

287
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Come on.

288
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Drink it up.

289
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Drink it up.

290
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Okay.

291
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Stop drinking.

292
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What?

293
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Master Yu doesn't drink.

294
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Then I'll drink for the bridegroom.

295
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Yes.

296
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
My master doesn't drink.

297
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What?

298
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You don't feel good?

299
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
He really doesn't drink.

300
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
This is my master.

301
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Don't try to bully him.

302
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll drink for him.

303
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Come on.

304
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Okay.

305
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Master Yu, cheers.

306
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Come on.

307
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Come on.

308
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Master.

309
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Cheers.

310
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Cheers.

311
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Fill it up for the bridegroom.

312
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Come on.

313
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Look.

314
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He really doesn't drink.

315
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm so strong.

316
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
How about this?

317
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Let's send the two newbies to the bridal chamber.

318
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Let's make a bridal chamber, okay?

319
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Okay.

320
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Okay.

321
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Okay.

322
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Right.

323
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Make a bridal chamber.

324
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Okay.

325
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Is anyone here?

326
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Is anyone here?

327
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Master He.

328
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Master He.

329
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Master He.

330
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Do me a favor.

331
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Send these two to my brothers.

332
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Let them come to me.

333
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
After that,

334
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'll take you to the back hill to catch the chickens.

335
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Everyone.

336
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's late.

337
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
It's time for the bridegroom to rest.

338
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You should go back and rest, too.

339
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The rules in the village

340
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
are that the second room cannot enter the main room.

341
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
So I asked someone to prepare this room.

342
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Are you satisfied?

343
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't care about that.

344
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I can do whatever I want.

345
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You should rest.

346
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I do need to rest.

347
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Right.

348
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
A moment of spring night is worth a thousand gold.

349
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You're drunk.

350
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
What are you doing?

351
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Playing the role of a prostitute.

352
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What are you doing?

353
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Don't be too much.

354
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm not a prostitute.

355
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm a prostitute.

356
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm a prostitute.

357
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm a prostitute.

358
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm a prostitute.

359
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm a prostitute.

360
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What are you doing?

361
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Don't be too much.

362
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Enough.

363
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If I don't play the role of a prostitute,

364
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
they will look down on me as the owner of the village.

365
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
If they look down on me,

366
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
that means they look down on our village.

367
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
From now on,

368
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
they will bully, suppress and force us.

369
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Once a person has a dirty heart,

370
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
he can do anything dirty.

371
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Get up.

372
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Enough.

373
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
They're gone.

374
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't be nervous.

375
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Have you ever had any wishes?

376
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Marry you.

377
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That doesn't count.

378
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Let me think about it.

379
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's snowing a lot.

380
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
It snowed a lot in a year.

381
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
My mother and I were waiting for my father to come home for the New Year.

382
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
That was the only thing I did to my mother.

383
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It was also the last chance.

384
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
If you have any wishes,

385
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I hope you can go back to the past

386
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
and see what she looks like.

387
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
There are countless Han people in the world.

388
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Only the God of Rebellion can change their fate.

389
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
That's right.

390
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The God of Rebellion can change their fate.

391
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I hope you can go back to the past

392
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
and see what she looks like.

393
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I hope you can go back to the past

394
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
and see what she looks like.

395
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I hope you can go back to the past

396
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
and see what she looks like.

397
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I hope you can go back to the past

398
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
and see what she looks like.

399
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I hope you can go back to the past

400
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
and see what she looks like.

401
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I hope you can go back to the past

402
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and see what she looks like.

403
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I hope you can go back to the past

404
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
and see what she looks like.

405
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I hope you can go back to the past

406
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
and see what she looks like.

407
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I hope you can go back to the past

408
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and see what she looks like.

409
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I hope you can go back to the past

410
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and see what she looks like.

411
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Master.

412
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Brother Wan.

413
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
They've finished the ritual.

414
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Where did they hide?

415
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Where?

416
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Brother Wan, look at your dog.

417
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Take it.

418
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Brother Wan.

419
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Isn't this the boss's belt?

420
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Run!

421
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Hurry up!

422
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Boss.

423
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Why are you here?

424
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Open the door and let me out.

425
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Hurry up!

426
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Open it!

427
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Open it!

428
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Boss.

429
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Who locked you here?

430
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
When?

431
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's already the second half of the night.

432
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You're still drinking with them?

433
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You can't get out for a long time.

434
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The house is there.

435
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Boss.

436
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Boss.

437
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Boss.

438
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Da Hai, you're drunk.

439
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Get out of here.

440
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Lu Yan.

441
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Why did you come here?

442
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Why did you stay in our village?

443
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Why did you hide from me

444
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
when you stayed in our village?

445
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
What are you doing?

446
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
It's not what you think.

447
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You're obsessed with clothes.

448
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I didn't expect you to be so active.

449
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You should have told me earlier.

450
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
No, I just...

451
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Something happened to the boss!

452
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What happened?

453
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Something big happened!

454
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What big thing?

455
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What big thing?

456
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What...

457
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What's going on?

458
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
How did it become like this?

459
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What happened?

460
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Wait.

461
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What's wrong?

462
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I just drank the soup.

463
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
It became like this when I came back.

464
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What's going on?

465
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What's going on?

466
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What's going on?

467
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It can't be.

468
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's a monster.

469
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Da Qian.

470
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Da Qian, come here.

471
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Send more people.

472
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Seal all the exits

473
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
of Qingquan station.

474
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
No one is allowed to leave

475
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
without my permission.

476
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
In case of any news,

477
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
it'll be a trouble for others.

478
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Okay.

479
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Lock the kitchen,

480
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
the bar, and the banquet hall.

481
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
As long as anything

482
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
that can be imported,

483
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
no one can touch it.

484
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Take us to investigate.

485
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Okay.

486
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Let's go.

487
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Wait.

488
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Wait!

489
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You're trying to prove

490
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
that you poisoned the banquet.

491
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You want to destroy

492
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
the 18 mountains' fortress, right?

493
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You're so vicious!

494
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
There's no such thing.

495
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Stop arguing.

496
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I didn't do it.

497
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You know my personality.

498
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I won't use

499
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
such a strange way to destroy it.

500
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
And you're targeting me.

501
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
To be honest,

502
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I've blocked all the exits

503
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
of Qingquan station.

504
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I've blocked all the exits.

505
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
If anyone dares to

506
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
make trouble in my station,

507
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'll dig him out.

508
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I think you're just worried.

509
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
You're afraid that we'll go down the mountain

510
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
to find some help.

511
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Right?

512
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Stop talking nonsense.

513
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Stop talking nonsense.

514
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Find some help?

515
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm doing this for your own good.

516
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Now, the 18 mountains' fortress,

517
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
except for Qingquan station,

518
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
every station is in a mess.

519
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Think about it.

520
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Are you that close to

521
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
other people?

522
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
If you can't find any help,

523
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
your station

524
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
will be swarmed.

525
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Look.

526
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Right?

527
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
They're still breathing.

528
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
How could it be?

529
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
They're all like this.

530
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Can't you see?

531
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
They're breathing.

532
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Erni.

533
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Boss, be careful.

534
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Lock them all up here.

535
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Lock them all up here.

536
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Don't push the Qingquan station.

537
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Where did you learn this kungfu?

538
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
It's better than my station.

539
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
It's called fighting?

540
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Let's go and find out.

541
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Go.

542
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Go.

543
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Get up.

544
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Da Hai.

545
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Go and get them.

546
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Okay.

547
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Be careful.

548
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Be careful.

549
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Go.

550
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Wait.

551
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Run.

552
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Go and get them.

553
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Boss.

554
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Over there.

555
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Boss.

556
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Are you okay?

557
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Sir, let's use the round bar.

558
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
If they get up,

559
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
they'll be so annoying.

560
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Go.

561
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Come here.

562
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Go.

563
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Where's your master?

564
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Is he inside?

565
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Go.

566
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Hurry.

567
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Here.

568
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Come.

569
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Boss.

570
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Are you okay?

571
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm fine.

572
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You take Yu Dengdeng out.

573
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I don't need you to tell me.

574
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
No.

575
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What about you?

576
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I know some art.

577
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I have my own way.

578
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Art?

579
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
No.

580
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I have to stay and fight with you.

581
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's none of your business.

582
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This is our Qingquan station.

583
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
You go back now.

584
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Did you see that?

585
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
He's not a human.

586
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
He can't die.

587
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Go.

588
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Qi.

589
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Tell Qingquan station to leave.

590
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yes.

591
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Hurry.

592
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Why is he so powerful?

593
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
It's not me

594
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I'm not me either

595
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You're not me

596
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You're not me

597
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You're not me

598
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
You're not me

599
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You're not me

600
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You're not me

601
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Stop.

602
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Sir.

603
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
If so, your identity will be exposed.

604
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Why is he so powerful?

605
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Lu Yiniang.

606
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You're the legendary

607
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
hunter who specifically controls the spirit clan.

608
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Second brother.

609
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Master.

610
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Master.

611
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
What does Dandan mean?

612
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
What hunter is this?

613
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Save us, sir.

614
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Save us.

615
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Save us.

616
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Save us.

617
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Stop looking.

618
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Stop looking.

619
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Stop looking.

620
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
The roads up and down the mountain

621
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
are really blocked by Qingquan station.

622
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Do they want us and those monsters

623
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
to be trapped here

624
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
and clean up our 18 mountains?

625
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Yesterday, the chief was still in the big house.

626
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
But today, he became a monster.

627
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
The brothers of Guishan station

628
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
are really worse than dogs and dogs.

629
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Chief Hu.

630
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Yesterday, when you were supposed to come out,

631
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
you weren't there.

632
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Maybe you and the people of Qingquan station

633
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
are on the same side.

634
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
You can do it too.

635
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
What did you say?

636
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Let him speak.

637
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I like to listen.

638
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Say it.

639
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Say it.

640
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I like to listen.

641
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Say it.

642
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I won't say it.

643
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I will.

644
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Listen up.

645
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,000
From now on,

646
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Qingquan station is really on the same side as me.

647
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Who dares to bother Qingquan station again?

648
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
If you touch his hair,

649
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
I will skin you.

650
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Did you hear that?

651
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Did you hear that?

652
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I will skin you.

653
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Did you hear that?

654
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Chief.

655
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Why are you so focused on the fish-sauce garden?

656
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I suspect that Erfeng, Yu Deng Deng,

657
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
is not a human.

658
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Isn't he a trainer?

659
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Yesterday, when I was holding a gun

660
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
and holding his head,

661
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
he could actually block my bullets.

662
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
When I wanted to go up and find out the truth,

663
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
he just went up.

664
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I flew up like a butterfly

665
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
and appeared in the woodshed.

666
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
And,

667
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
he took the fish-sauce garden as his own.

668
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
He was so worried.

669
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
He even went to the fish-sauce garden.

670
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
But,

671
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
he just went up to the tree

672
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
and pulled a big tree for decades.

673
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Is this the ability of a normal person?

674
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
It's reasonable to say that

675
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
the trainer is also a human.

676
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
He can't block bullets.

677
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
That's right.

678
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
He has been in trouble since he came to Qingquan station.

679
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
With his ability,

680
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
if he wants to leave Qingquan station,

681
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
let alone a fish-sauce garden,

682
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
even if the whole station is built up,

683
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
he can't stop him.

684
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You mean

685
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Lu Yan is a monster?

686
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
He made all this up secretly?

687
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
But what is his purpose?

688
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
The poor people in Qingquan station are almost selling their pants.

689
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
How can he have any valuable treasure?

690
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
He is painting

691
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
the fish-sauce garden.

692
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Why isn't Hai listening to me?

693
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Hurry up and explain it to me.

694
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Wait, wait, wait.

695
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Second brother,

696
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
there must be another way.

697
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You don't need to think about it.

698
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
This is the best way.

699
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Hai.

700
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You...

701
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Hai,

702
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
save me.

703
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Master, I really want to save you.

704
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But the second master said,

705
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
the higher the position,

706
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
the more qualified you are.

707
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
The higher the position.

708
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Yes.

709
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Be good.

710
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Let me tell you, Deng Deng.

711
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Our mountain village has reached the point of survival.

712
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
As the leader of the village,

713
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
you must be a good example.

714
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Yes.

715
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I am the leader of the family now.

716
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I am the leader of the village.

717
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I finally made a good name

718
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
for the Zheng family a few days ago.

719
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
What?

720
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Do you want me to be ashamed now?

721
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Didn't my father say

722
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
that my blood can cure the spirits?

723
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I didn't believe it before, but now I believe it.

724
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I can go.

725
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Master,

726
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
think about it.

727
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
A dozen of the village leaders are arrested.

728
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
With your small body,

729
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
your blood is not enough.

730
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Yes.

731
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Let's go to Li Da Xian of Hong Shui Town.

732
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
They are arrested.

733
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
The police caught the criminal.

734
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
I'm not going anyway.

735
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Come back.

736
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Master, master.

737
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
The face is important, the money is important.

738
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Your face is the shoes of the shop.

739
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Yes.

740
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Those villagers are all like this.

741
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
If they run after us,

742
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
how much money do we have to pay?

743
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
How much money is not enough?

744
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It makes sense.

745
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Master Lu,

746
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I'm here to see you.

747
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Master Lu, I'm here to see you.

748
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
There are so many good things in the village

749
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
that I can't bear to sell them.

750
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And you want to sacrifice me

751
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
to get the second house to make money.

752
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I'm willing to take it out and use it for him.

753
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Jade vase.

754
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Red wood table chair.

755
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Golden flower basin.

756
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Master, what's the matter?

757
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I'll do it.

758
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Master,

759
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
you can say what you want.

760
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You don't have to do such a big favor.

761
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Actually, it's nothing.

762
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I just came to see

763
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
if you are still comfortable on your first day of marriage.

764
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You've been doing it for so long.

765
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Is your leg a little sore?

766
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Let me give you a massage.

767
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Golden pastry of Hong Ding Xuan.

768
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Peach blossom soup in the clothing yard.

769
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I can't bear to sell it during the New Year.

770
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Let me do it.

771
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I don't want to eat this. I want to drink water.

772
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Here you are.

773
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Did you sleep well last night?

774
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
If you have any requests, just mention it.

775
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
We are all family now.

776
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Since we are family,

777
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
we should trust each other and be honest.

778
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
You said you hid this identity from me.

779
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It's really not necessary.

780
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
From the first time I saw you,

781
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I knew you were not a common person.

782
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
You are a master of memory.

783
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Okay, okay, okay.

784
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
It's okay.

785
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
What okay?

786
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
It's definitely not okay.

787
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
To be honest,

788
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I admire you from the bottom of my heart.

789
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Speaking of catching the spirit monster,

790
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
my old fish said that

791
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
if you don't practice for a day, you will be slow.

792
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
If you don't practice for three days, you will be a traitor.

793
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Why don't you take this opportunity to practice?

794
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Isn't your father a hunter?

795
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
It would be nice if he could come back and help.

796
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
You don't know about old fish.

797
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
He is bragging.

798
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Only you.

799
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
You are the real talent.

800
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Moreover,

801
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
how can you be so skillful?

802
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
How can you live in the house?

803
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You should come out and serve more people.

804
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
If I help you to catch the monster,

805
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
who will serve elder people tea and water,

806
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
unite brothers and serve Dahong?

807
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You Lu Yan.

808
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Be careful of your eyes and memory.

809
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
You are waiting for me here.

810
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Me?

811
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Of course it's me.

812
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I will do everything.

813
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Do you think it's okay?

814
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
It's not good for you to come.

815
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
What's wrong with that?

816
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
What age is this?

817
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
In our Qingquan Village,

818
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
the most important thing is that everyone is equal.

819
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
As long as you help me to solve the monster,

820
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:19,000
you can enjoy the set meal forever in Qingquan Village.

821
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
The set meal is luxurious.

822
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Do you think it's okay?

823
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
This is good.

824
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Very good.

825
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Then,

826
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Master Lu,

827
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
what do you think?

828
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,000
When do you think we should start?

829
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Start what?

830
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I just pointed out that your suggestion is good.

831
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I didn't agree to help you to catch the monster.

832
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I advise you not to interfere in this matter.

833
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Look, now Qingquan Village is also fine.

834
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You just send those monsters back to their own mountain villages.

835
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
They are now in a group of dragons.

836
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
They won't threaten you.

837
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Isn't it good to do both?

838
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
You are playing tricks on me.

839
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm not playing tricks on you.

840
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I'm thinking for you.

841
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Why do you care about the dispute outside?

842
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
You may hurt yourself.

843
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
It's not your style to harm others.

844
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
Lu Yan,

845
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
such a big thing happened.

846
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
So many people.

847
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Although they are not from Qingquan Village,

848
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
they are all living lives.

849
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
You drive them down the mountain now.

850
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Who can guarantee that the monster won't spread?

851
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
What if you hurt those innocent people?

852
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
What should I do?

853
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
You really don't respect people?

854
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
So?

855
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I thought you were cold,

856
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
but you are warm-hearted.

857
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
I didn't expect you to be like this.

858
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Forget it.

859
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
I'm not going to do anything.

860
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
I'm just doing it for nothing.

861
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Wait.

862
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
What are you doing?

863
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I changed my mind.

864
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I can go down the mountain with you

865
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
and find the spirit monster.

866
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Really?

867
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Yes.

868
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Come on.

869
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
Take off your clothes.

870
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
What?

871
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I underestimated you.

872
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Master,

873
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
you sacrificed too much for us.

874
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I'm sorry.

875
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I'm sorry.

876
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I'm sorry.

877
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I'm sorry.

878
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You like the tea-picking style,

879
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
right?

880
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Why did you change your mind?

881
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
Let's go down the mountain first

882
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
and catch the spirit monster.

883
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
We can come back and eat it later.

884
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
No.

885
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Take it off now.

886
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Yu Deng Deng,

887
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,000
hold on.

888
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
You are willing to sacrifice yourself for the village.

889
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It's just taking off my clothes.

890
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Okay.

891
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I'll take it off.

892
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Brother, turn around.

893
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Okay.

894
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Okay.

895
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Look.

896
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Look.

897
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
You can look at it.

898
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
You can look at it.

899
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
What's wrong with this?

900
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
It's so hard to untie.

901
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
What's this?

902
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Why can't I untie it?

903
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Let me help you.

904
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Don't worry.

905
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Don't move.

906
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,000
There's something wrong with your clothes.

907
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I'm sorry.

908
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I'm sorry.

909
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I'm sorry.

910
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I'm sorry.

911
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I'm sorry.

912
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I'm sorry.

913
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I'm sorry.

914
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm sorry.

915
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm sorry.

916
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
I'm sorry.

917
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I'm sorry.

918
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I'm sorry.

919
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I'm sorry.

920
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I'm sorry.

921
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I'm sorry.

922
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
I'm sorry.

923
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I'm sorry.

924
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I'm sorry.

925
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I'm sorry.

926
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm sorry.

927
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm sorry.

928
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,000
I'm sorry.

929
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I'm sorry.

930
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm sorry.

931
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm sorry.

932
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I'm sorry.

933
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm sorry.

934
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm sorry.

935
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
I'm sorry.

936
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I'm sorry.

937
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
I'm sorry.

938
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I'm sorry.

939
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I'm sorry.

940
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I'm sorry.

941
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I'm sorry.

942
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm sorry.

943
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm sorry.

944
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
I'm sorry.

945
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I'm sorry.

946
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I'm sorry.

947
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm sorry.

948
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I'm sorry.

949
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I'm sorry.

950
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I'm sorry.

951
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I'm sorry.

952
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm sorry.

953
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I'm sorry.

954
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm sorry.

955
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I'm sorry.

956
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
I'm sorry.

957
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I'm sorry.

958
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I'm sorry.

959
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I'm sorry.

960
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
