27
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,410
My head hurts so much.

28
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:48,620
My head hurts.

29
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:51,570
What's wrong?

30
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:54,270
Why does my head hurt so much?

31
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,940
Wei Du, it's getting late.

32
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,700
I want to go back early and rest.

33
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,700
General, it's still early.

34
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,330
Why don't we drink more?

35
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,050
Wei Du, let's talk tomorrow.

36
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,160
Okay. I'll send you back to rest.

37
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,760
No need.

38
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:08,090
Just ask a servant

39
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,520
to tell me how to go back.

40
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:10,430
Okay.

41
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,190
Guards!

42
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,370
General.

43
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,470
Send the general back to rest.

44
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,150
Yes.

45
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,270
I'll go back now.

46
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:18,900
Okay.

47
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,910
It hurts so much.

48
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,790
Dengdeng, how are you?

49
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,020
You're here.

50
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,400
I heard you have a headache.

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,700
Are you okay?

52
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:49,079
I'm fine. Are you okay?

53
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,970
I think something is wrong with your lieutenant.

54
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,030
General.

55
00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:57,440
General Yan went to Ms. Yu's room.

56
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,430
What?

57
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,120
Why did you say that?

58
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,660
Because he lied.

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,660
My father clearly left a mark.

60
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,560
He said he had gone to the direction of the underground palace.

61
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,570
But when he went there,

62
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,250
he didn't even check or look at it,

63
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:15,340
and then he denied it.

64
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,600
Isn't that strange?

65
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,030
Besides,

66
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,650
there are two azaleas in front of his yard.

67
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,000
Those are the azaleas from Dandong.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,370
They've been developed and cultivated by a famous man within recent decades.

69
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,600
They're very expensive.

70
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,130
You can't buy them outside.

71
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,250
My father spent a lot of effort

72
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,100
to get two azaleas for my mother.

73
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,630
Don't you think it's even stranger that he could

74
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,820
get them so easily?

75
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,430
Your doubt is reasonable.

76
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:43,590
But Wei Du and I have been friends for more than ten years.

77
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,150
He is upright and kind.

78
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:47,240
Maybe he has a reason for it and it's inconvenient

79
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,590
for him to tell us about it.

80
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,910
You haven't seen him for 3,000 years.

81
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,270
People change.

82
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:54,200
You should be careful.

83
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,530
I know.

84
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,710
I'll give you more energy.

85
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,500
Then you can fall asleep in a better way.

86
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,170
It's not enough to merely give me the energy.

87
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,570
I punish you to make the bed for the chief.

88
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,960
Why do you punish me?

89
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,580
Of course I need to punish you.

90
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,780
Because you only care about your buddy

91
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,010
and forget your wife.

92
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,320
Are you going to do it or not?

93
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,320
If not, just forget it.

94
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,470
Your buddies are like your limbs.

95
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,990
Women are like clothes.

96
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,360
To repay me,

97
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,190
also help me make the bed tomorrow morning.

98
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,760
Okay.

99
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,830
After you get up tomorrow morning,

100
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:43,450
I'll come to your room to make the bed for you.

101
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,020
It's troublesome to run around.

102
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,590
How about you

103
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:51,760
stay here?

104
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,370
Stay here?

105
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,730
Okay.

106
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,660
Let's just sleep together.

107
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't regret it.

108
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,990
Why would I regret it?

109
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,600
General.

110
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,690
You went to the wrong room.

111
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,890
Please let me take you back to rest.

112
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,850
Your general didn't go to the wrong room.

113
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,580
He'll sleep in my room tonight.

114
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:24,810
General, your room

115
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,430
was decorated by me according to

116
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,990
your preference you used to have.

117
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,490
Aren't you going to take a look?

118
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,380
Your general doesn't need to...

119
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,400
Alright. I got it.

120
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,990
I will go back to my room.

121
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,300
I'll take my leave.

122
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:48,140
I have to go back.

123
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,950
We still have plenty of time.

124
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,460
Forget it. I was just kidding.

125
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,750
I'll spare you this time.

126
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,710
Go back to sleep.

127
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,300
I'm leaving.

128
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,710
By the way,

129
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,550
people here are very sensitive to the Spirit Clan.

130
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,680
You need to be more careful these days.

131
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,150
When I'm not around,

132
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,700
don't use the energy.

133
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:13,740
I know. Don't worry.

134
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:15,000
You should be careful, too.

135
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,800
Don't sleep too deeply at night.

136
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,409
How dare you, Wei Du!

137
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:37,030
Let me see what you're up to.

138
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,270
Li was hurt by the Ghost Vines.

139
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,880
The wound is ulcerated.

140
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,340
The doctors in the city all said that it couldn't be cured.

141
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,170
I'm afraid

142
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,870
only by cutting off his arm can he survive.

143
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,120
General, you have the energy core of the Spirit Clan inside your body.

144
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,180
It is said that it can help create flesh and bones.

145
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:00,470
Please save him, general.

146
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:26,730
General Yan, this is amazing.

147
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,190
Say thank you to the general.

148
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,610
Thank you, General Yan.

149
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,150
Go and rest.

150
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:32,940
Yes.

151
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,850
This energy core is indeed a magical object.

152
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:41,830
General.

153
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,110
With this supernatural ability,

154
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:47,070
you can exorcise all those who are from the Spirit Clan.

155
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,730
This belongs to the Saintess of the Spirit Clan.

156
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,220
How can it be easily used to kill people from the Spirit Clan?

157
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,480
You are right.

158
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,290
Wei Du.

159
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,650
How is it going with inquiring about the Dust-proof Bead?

160
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,380
No news yet.

161
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,990
I've ordered people to search for it

162
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,030
all over the city.

163
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,570
I believe there will be news soon.

164
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,920
I'll take my leave.

165
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,270
Ms. Yu, where are you going?

166
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,510
It's time for lunch.

167
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,430
I'm not hungry. I have something to do.

168
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,630
Ms. Yu, are you looking for General Yan?

169
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:31,410
General Yan was invited

170
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,610
by General Wei early in the morning to discuss something.

171
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:36,950
How about this?

172
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,970
You go somewhere else with me?

173
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,020
Okay. Just go with her.

174
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,960
Give it to me.

175
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,640
Let me help you take it inside.

176
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,550
Let me do it.

177
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:52,810
Give it to me.

178
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,280
Give it to me.

179
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,350
What era is it now? And you still play this?

180
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,330
It's boring.

181
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,270
Ms. Yu.

182
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,450
Relax, relax.

183
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,960
How about I teach you to play something new today?

184
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,620
What is it?

185
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,700
What is this?

186
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,130
-I've never seen it. -I've never seen it.

187
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,360
It's square. Look.

188
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,270
What are you doing?

189
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,030
Big! Big!

190
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,840
Small! Small! Small!

191
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,030
Come on. Let's play together.

192
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,620
Hurry up.

193
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,690
-Come on. -Okay. Let's play.

194
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,810
Place your bets.

195
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,880
-Big! -Small! Small!

196
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,170
Small.

197
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,040
Who dares to bet with me?

198
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,030
Let me do it. Let me do it. Let me do it.

199
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,840
Ms. Yu, what are you betting on?

200
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,360
Those who lose

201
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,180
have to take off the clothes.

202
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,970
Again. Again.

203
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,750
What? You don't dare?

204
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,290
How about this?

205
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,890
If I lose, I'll take off all my clothes.

206
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,600
If you lose, you only have to take off your tops.

207
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,840
Okay. No problem.

208
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,100
Let me do it.

209
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,670
I bet it's big.

210
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,110
Big! Big! Big!

211
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,930
Big! Big! Big!

212
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,770
Big. Small.

213
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:06,470
Big! Big! Big!

214
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,820
Place your bets.

215
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:11,600
Big! Big! Big!

216
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,690
Just admit defeat.

217
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,250
Take your tops off.

218
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,050
Really, Ms. Yu?

219
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,680
Come on.

220
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,270
Master,

221
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,080
Xin and I went to take a bath in the bathhouse,

222
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,040
and tricked a guard.

223
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,450
I saw that dragon tattoo on all their bodies.

224
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:28,190
Master, I found something.

225
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,270
Hurry up.

226
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:34,800
Come on.

227
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,950
Master, I've also checked the training field.

228
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,680
It's true that every soldier has the dragon tattoo.

229
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,120
Does everyone have it?

230
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,000
If everyone has it,

231
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,070
then I don't know

232
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,080
who killed my mother.

233
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:50,080
I sounded Wei Du out just now.

234
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,480
He denied it thoroughly.

235
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,910
I wonder where my father is now.

236
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,250
Did he discover

237
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,270
the dragon tattoos on their bodies?

238
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,650
Ma'am, I'm back.

239
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,590
Xin.

240
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,060
How is it?

241
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,960
Did you find any clues?

242
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,570
I've searched all around the casino.

243
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:12,970
I didn't find the mark left by Chieftain Yu.

244
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,940
You didn't find any mark?

245
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,680
That bastard Wei Du!

246
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,810
He really lied to me.

247
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,420
If my father has left,

248
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,320
it means he has finished the task.

249
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,200
According to his habits,

250
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,190
after he finishes a task,

251
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,040
he will definitely go to the casino to gamble.

252
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,950
But now,

253
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,030
there is no news about him around the casino.

254
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:30,880
That means

255
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,720
he's still in the city.

256
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,470
Still in the city?

257
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,310
Why did Wei Du lie to us?

258
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,430
He wants me to stay away from Lu Yan,

259
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,230
and tries to play tricks with me.

260
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,180
Let me find out what he's up to.

261
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,750
Where is General Wei?

262
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,650
General Wei went out to do something.

263
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,540
I heard that all the soldiers of the Shu Army are skilled in martial arts.

264
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,460
How about we

265
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,830
have a competition?

266
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,580
Ms. Yu.

267
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,540
You're good at swordsmanship.

268
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,630
So Lieutenant Wei is in the mansion.

269
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,960
Why don't we have a competition?

270
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,330
Ms. Yu,

271
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,410
you are the general's distinguished guest.

272
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:32,370
What?

273
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,580
Are you afraid, Lieutenant Wei?

274
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,510
Ms. Yu.

275
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,080
What? You don't dare to fight?

276
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,460
Blades have no eyes.

277
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,720
It's just a competition.

278
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:48,390
Is there any secret

279
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,320
in Lieutenant Wei's martial arts skills?

280
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
Are you afraid that I'll learn them?

281
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:00,190
Lieutenant Wei is good at martial arts.

282
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,200
If it weren't for you...

283
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,630
If it weren't for the Spiritual Clan...

284
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,240
What are you doing?

285
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,010
I... This...

286
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:25,680
General.

287
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,560
Dengdeng!

288
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:29,470
General, I...

289
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,410
I'm fine. I pretended it.

290
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,040
I know you pretended it.

291
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,980
What do you know?

292
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,310
Now, you only know

293
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,220
to be with Wei Du every day.

294
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,900
You don't care about me at all.

295
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,730
To be honest,

296
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,800
don't you think Wei Du is suspicious?

297
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,450
You stay with him every day.

298
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,400
Don't you think he's up to no good?

299
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,430
Back then, Wei and I fought together at the risk of our lives on the battlefield.

300
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,190
We were good brothers who could die for each other.

301
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,310
I still trust him.

302
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,040
Fine.

303
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,250
You trust him?

304
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,050
So you don't trust me?

305
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,440
Lu Yan, let me ask you.

306
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,630
Choose between him and me.

307
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,160
Which of us will you choose?

308
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,190
No, Dengdeng.

309
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,370
Stop messing around.

310
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,460
Who is messing around?

311
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,510
Why do you think I'm messing around?

312
00:14:27,510 --> 00:14:28,490
Am I messing around like this?

313
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:29,640
Lu Yan, you jerk!

314
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,000
You have no conscience.

315
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,030
After he showed up,

316
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,970
you don't even trust me now?

317
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,400
It's not that I don't trust you.

318
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,680
There must be some misunderstanding between you two.

319
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,580
He's not a scheming man.

320
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,280
What misunderstanding? No misunderstanding.

321
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,290
Let me tell you.

322
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,750
It's a pity that

323
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:47,120
Wei Du doesn't act in a play about the fight of imperial harem.

324
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,970
I won't let the general repeat the same mistake.

325
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,840
Zhu Rong!

326
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,120
Zhu Rong!

327
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,670
Zhu Rong! Come out!

328
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:36,960
Are you satisfied with the reunion with your old friend

329
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,640
I've arranged for you?

330
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,260
It's you

331
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,630
who lured them here to look for the Dust-proof Bead.

332
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:53,730
What you want is the return of General Lu

333
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,860
so as to fulfill the great cause of Shu in your mind.

334
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,240
As for how I brought him here,

335
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,380
why do you care?

336
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,190
General.

337
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:05,590
Come in.

338
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,130
But you clearly know the Dust-proof Bead is...

339
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,360
So what?

340
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:16,720
Are you worried that General Yan, whom you care so much about,

341
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,360
will abandon you

342
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,630
for the sake of that woman?

343
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:24,120
Our general is benevolent and cares about his subjects so much.

344
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,550
How would he be like that?

345
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,960
Good.

346
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,560
Bring Yu Dengdon to me.

347
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,440
We'll get what we need respectively, and then we'll be even.

348
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,780
Are all the people in the Ancient Shu City

349
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,150
more important

350
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,100
than Yu Dengdeng?

351
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,420
I believe you

352
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,690
have your own judgment, General Wei.

353
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,450
General, we found the Dust-proof Bead.

354
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,620
It's right inside the underground palace.

355
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,339
Ghost Vines are very dangerous.

356
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,069
If we want to get inside,

357
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,660
we have to put living things there

358
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,589
to attract their attention first.

359
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,369
Master,

360
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,770
I didn't expect the Ancient Shu to be so rich.

361
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,100
There are so many beads.

362
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,310
Which do you think is the Dust-proof Bead?

363
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,500
The Dust-proof Bead is a rare treasure.

364
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,810
It is said that after the first emperor of Shu passed away,

365
00:17:35,810 --> 00:17:37,540
the Dust-proof Bead and other treasures were hidden

366
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,190
inside Shu's shrine.

367
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,310
Do you think

368
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,570
they are weird today?

369
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,100
They played dice and took a bath in the bathhouse

370
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:46,960
with us yesterday.

371
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,160
They don't even dare to look at us today.

372
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
General Wei is too overbearing.

373
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,750
They are so scared of him to be like this.

374
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,330
I think so.

375
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:00,640
Is General Wei

376
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,580
jealous that you're too close to Lu Yan,

377
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,900
so he has teamed up with them to marginalize us?

378
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,720
If that's the case,

379
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,780
General Wei can survive for at least several rounds

380
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,180
in a play about the fight of imperial harem.

381
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,220
Though he's powerful, I'm not an ordinary woman.

382
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,590
Gao.

383
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,630
The five-five-six result of the dice game

384
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,040
yesterday was really amazing.

385
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,520
Let's compete in the game another day.

386
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,400
What do you think?

387
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,310
Ms. Yu,

388
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,950
our army is busy with the intense training every day.

389
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,610
I'm afraid they don't have time to play with you.

390
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,290
If you can't refrain from playing the game,

391
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,640
I can ask someone to find

392
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,270
several idle men from the city

393
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,490
to play it with you.

394
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,780
General Wei, what you're saying

395
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,400
doesn't sound friendly.

396
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,020
I just want to remind you

397
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:45,010
not to ruin the good morale of my army.

398
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,380
-I also want to remind you... -Dengdeng.

399
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,050
We'd better go to find the Dust-proof Bead now.

400
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:51,700
Wei Du.

401
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:52,270
Yes.

402
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,830
How far are we from the treasury?

403
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,620
We'll be there soon.

404
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,180
Let's go.

405
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:55,840
Yes.

406
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,440
Time is running out. Let's hurry up.

407
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,270
Yes!

408
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:24,950
General.

409
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,820
Keep your voice down.

410
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,350
Is this your family's ancestral temple?

411
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,490
Please go to the Mu Pool and wash your hands.

412
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,770
Then take a bow

413
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,090
to show respect for all the former emperors of Shu.

414

418
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:41,620
General.

419
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:07,310
General, please.

420
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,990
How do I wash my hands?

421
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:11,120
Just do it normally.

422
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,490
Kneel.

423
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,430
Master.

424
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,670
Bow.

[Memorial Tablet of Shu's Emperor Baiguan Gaozhao]

427
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,500
By doing this,

428
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:54,980
is it considered as having paid respect to your parents?

429
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,410
What do you think?

430
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,920
Since we've paid respect to your parents,

431
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,650
we're officially married now.

432
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,600
I'll see who'll compete with me for you in the future.

433
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,830
General Wei.

434
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:07,960
Since we've washed our hands and bowed to the ancestors,

435
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,850
can you take us inside now?

436
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,570
I'll get inside with the general.

437
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,980
You and Peng can wait here.

438
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,310
Why?

439
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:20,930
The secret treasury of the royal family of Shu is inside.

440
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,920
Only the members of the royal family of Shu can enter.

441
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,130
You and Peng are outsiders after all.

442
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,420
It's inconvenient for you to enter.

443
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,420
I'll leave these soldiers with you.

444
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:33,100
You can wait here with ease for the time being.

445
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,720
It won't be dangerous.

446
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,330
General Wei,

447
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,100
you're also not a member of the royal family, are you?

448
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,730
Lu Yan and I have got married and performed the formal wedding ceremony.

449
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,130
How come you can go in

450
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,980
but I became a outsider?

451
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,400
Dengdeng, you two wait for me here.

452
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,570
I'll be back soon.

453
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,600
Okay. I'll listen to you.

454
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,950
Come back early.

455
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,510
Don't worry.

456
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:00,290
General, please.

457
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,550
General.

458
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,360
Three thousand years ago,

459
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,460
the Spirit Clan descended from the sky,

460
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,060
invaded our country,

461
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,770
robbed and killed our people.

462
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,890
Wherever the Spirit Clan went, the people were living in misery.

463
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,580
Fortunately, the former emperor and you successively

464
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:42,650
led us to fight the enemy on the battlefield.

465
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,600
Tens of thousands of our people were sacrificed,

466
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,200
and we finally drove the Spirit Clan 50 kilometers away from Shu.

467
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,220
Unfortunately,

468
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,500
we failed in the end.

469
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,330
We couldn't kill all the members of the Spirit Clan.

470
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,740
General, the secret treasury is ahead.

471
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,710
General, please.

472
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,260
General, the thing you're looking for

473
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,040
is right here.

474
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,760
The Dragon-pattern Sword?

475
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,480
It used to be your personal weapon.

476
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,860
After the war,

477
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:56,930
I tried my best to get it back,

478
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,190
and has kept it until now.

479
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,840
On behalf of the tens of thousands of soldiers who died 3,000 years ago,

480
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,770
I hope you can hold the sword again,

481
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:20,380
expel the Spirit Clan of Nine Continents, and kill them all.

482
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,470
I didn't come here for the Dragon-pattern Sword.

483
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,120
Where is the Dust-proof Bead?

484
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,390
General,

485
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,820
you are such a smart man.

486
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,700
You let me lead the way as soon as we entered the underground palace.

487
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,240
You must have known

488
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,670
I've been in and out of the underground palace many times,

489
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,800
so I know everything about this place.

490
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
In that case,

491
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:45,450
I don't have to hide it.

492
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,820
The Dust-proof Bead is indeed hidden in this underground palace.

493
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,830
After you take this sword

494
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,790
to lead us to kill the Spiritual Clan,

495
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:56,900
I will give the Dust-proof Bead

496
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:57,870
to you.

497
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:03,720
Now the war between humans and the Spirit Clan has subsided.

498
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:06,870
I have no intention of killing with this sword.

499
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:09,900
General,

500
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,820
have you forgotten the will of the late former emperor to expel the Spirit Clan?

501
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,070
Have you forgotten

502
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,200
what the former emperor

503
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,450
said to you when the dragon pattern

504
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:24,170
was tattooed on your body?

505
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,810
I found the dragon pattern mark

506
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,850
on the ground which was left

507
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:40,010
by your mother before she died.

508
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,100
I think this mark

509
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:44,970
must have something to do

510
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,030
who killed your mother.

511
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,300
Why do you have dragon patterns on your body?

512
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,720
Back then,

513
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,100
the other soldiers and I

514
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:58,780
thought you had died in the jungle

515
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,590
to save the Saintess of the Spirit Clan,

516
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:04,000
so we tattooed the same dragon pattern

517
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,960
on our own bodies

518
00:27:06,910 --> 00:27:08,540
in order to remember

519
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,440
our Shu soldiers' mission

520
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,670
to kill all members of the Spirit Clan in the world.

521
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,690
The mission of Shu soldiers

522
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:20,390
is never to kill all members of the Spirit Clan in the world,

523
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:22,420
but to protect people all over the world

524
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,980
so that they can live a peaceful life.

525
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,920
If we don't eliminate the Spirit Clan,

526
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,880
how can the world be peaceful?

527
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:31,500
General, we were weak back then

528
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,510
and we failed to eliminate the Spirit Clan.

529
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:36,910
But you have the energy core now.

530
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:38,820
It's the source of the Spirit Clan's energy.

531
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,220
This is our best chance to kill all members of the Spirit Clan.

532
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,980
It's been 3,000 years.

533
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,560
The worlds of humans and the Spirit Clan

534
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,650
have already integrated into one world.

535
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:56,580
They are closely related and cannot be separated from each other.

536
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,440
It's impossible for either party

537
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,800
to kill the other party.

538
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,710
Moreover,

539
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,460
Yu Dengdeng has inherited

540
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,060
the same peace faith which Yun Xi had back then.

541
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,630
I believe she can make

542
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,940
a wise choice.

543
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,570
I also believe

544
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:12,600
she can lead humans and the Spirit Clan

545
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,730
to continue living together in peace.

546
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,360
How can we trust

547
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,860
someone from the Spirit Clan?

548
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,150
General, don't give up your great cause.

549
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:25,230
Enough!

550
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:28,000
No more talking about the energy core.

551
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,890
Give me the Dust-proof Bead.

552
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,460
I knew

553
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,120
you would make such a choice.

554
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,150
However,

555
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,260
even if you're willing to return the energy core,

556
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,460
Yu Dengdeng might not

557
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,410
be able to live until then.

558
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:50,710
What do you mean?

559
00:28:55,350 --> 00:28:56,810
Three thousand years ago,

560
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,910
you were bewitched by that woman

561
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:01,270
and almost lost your life.

562
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,090
This time, I won't let you

563
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,410
make the same mistake again.

564
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,500
What are you going to do to her?

565
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,300
It's not what I want to do to her.

566
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,460
Instead, it depends on

567
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,930
what he wants to do to her.

568
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,670
He?

569
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,090
Zhu Rong?

570
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,820
Wei Du, in order to stall me,

571
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,270
you colluded with Zhu Rong.

572
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,870
As long as I can kill the woman who deceived you,

573
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,090
even if I have colluded with Zhu Rong this time,

574
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,410
so what?

575
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:34,790
General.

576
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,150
Please take this sword.

577
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,220
Wei Du, oh, Wei Du.

578
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,820
This underground palace is well designed.

579
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,350
All the devices and secret passages here are dangerous.

580
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,670
I've been exploring this place for a hundred years.

581
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:01,200
There are still many places I haven't been to.

582
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,660
Besides, this underground palace can block the aura of the Spirit Clan.

583
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,750
No matter how powerful you are,

584
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,980
it's still very difficult for you to find Yu Dengdeng

585
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,580
in this underground palace.

586
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,510
General.

587
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,970
Don't go.

588
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:29,090
Wei Du, you're doing this

589
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,230
to force me to become someone like Zhu Rong,

590
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,490
making the whole world miserable again.

591
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,830
Is this your wish and original intention?

592
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:38,300
You finally got a chance to live again.

593
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,190
Isn't it good to live peacefully?

594
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,350
No!

595
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,430
You are not our general.

596
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,710
Our general won't abandon us.

597
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,230
You are no longer the general

598
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,900
who we followed back then.

599
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,120
I said

600
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,980
Yu Dengdeng

601
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,630
might not be able to survive.

602
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,790
You've underestimated her.

603
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:10,920
She's a chieftain.

604
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,790
According to the message Yu Dengdeng has just sent me,

605
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,360
we've got the Dust-proof Bead.

606
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,010
What?

607
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:18,060
Thank you, Wei Du.

608
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,640
He misjudged it.

609
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,180
Bastard!

610
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,750
The Dust-proof Bead...

611
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:56,590
It's still here.

612
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:00,690
Is there

613
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:01,950
a trick?

614
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:21,820
Delicious.

615
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:23,990
Yummy.

616
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,790
Eat, eat, eat.

617
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,180
You don't forget to eat while you're dreaming.

618
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,490
It's delicious.

619
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:34,770
Stop sleeping.

620
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,430
You're drooling on my clothes.

621
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:37,310
Look.

622
00:32:37,870 --> 00:32:39,990
Master, I didn't sleep well last night.

623
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:40,850
I'm so sleepy.

624
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,310
Dahai,

625
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,220
how long has it been since you brushed your teeth?

626
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,710
Why does your saliva stink?

627
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,510
Does it stink?

628
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,420
Men are just like that.

629
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,010
It doesn't stink, master.

630
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:54,750
Smell it.

631
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,930
So disgusting.

632
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,990
It's not that my mouth stinks. I...

633
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,660
Master, there's a bad smell indeed.

634
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,880
But it smells like...

635
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,560
Like dead men.

636
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,280
Stop talking nonsense.

637
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,360
This is the treasury of the underground palace.

638
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,950
How can there be a smell of dead men?

639
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:26,870
Don't scare me.

640
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:29,090
Unless...

641
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,550
This is not just a treasury.

642
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,050
Could it be that General Wei

643
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,580
is jealous of you for being too close to Concubine Lu

644
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,170
so he wants to trap us here

645
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:40,510
and kill us?

646
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:43,130
Anyway, let's run away first.

647
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,710
Run towards the direction where Lu Yan has gone.

648
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,590
Okay. Let's stay composed.

649
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:52,850
It's good.

650
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,290
So tired from sitting for too long. Take a rest.

651
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:56,740
Take a rest.

652
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,700
My back hurts.

653
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:00,440
Thanks for your hard work. Sit for some more time.

654
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,350
Take a rest.

655
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,770
It's useless for them to run away.

656
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:11,159
What a waste of energy.

657
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:26,590
Why did you run?

658
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,530
I had a stomachache.

659
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,810
I thought there was a toilet over there.

660
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:32,690
Yes, yes, yes.

661
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,630
Master.

662
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,719
They clearly left from that direction.

663
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:40,449
Why couldn't we go out of here

664
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,840
by walking around?

665
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,760
There must be a contraption here.

666
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,570
That means

667
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:48,670
we were tricked by Wei Du.

668
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:50,730
Does he really

669
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:52,630
plan to trap us here?

670
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:55,159
We need to find another way out.

671
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,740
By the way, I have this.

672
00:35:09,490 --> 00:35:11,370
Soldiers, you must be tired.

673
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,410
Let's play.

674
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,550
Have a bet.

675
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,060
Bet?

676
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,540

Right. That's what I mean.

Look.

792
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:51,560
Aren't these two clothes the same as

793
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,850
what the Baile villagers outside there wear?

794
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,050
Take a look.

795
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:58,950
Do you think they are

796
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,420
Dummy's missing friends?

797
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,830
Actually, they didn't disappear at all.

798
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:05,560
They accidentally went into the underground palace and died here.

799
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,210
But Wei Du said

800
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:10,130
there are Ghost Vines at the entrance of the underground palace.

801
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:11,980
Ordinary people can't get in.

802
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:14,900
So there must be other problems in this case.

803
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,060
Maybe my father

804
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,600
found something fishy,

805
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,480
so he took the risk to come here.

806

These people

807
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,230
died here.

808
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,960
Their descendants don't even have a place to hold a funeral for them.

809
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,800
How pitiful.

810

Am I right?

816

I went to a dark place.
