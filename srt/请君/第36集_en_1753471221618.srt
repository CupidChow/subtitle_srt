1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will never let go after we part

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Because you're not me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Because you're not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Because you're not me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Because you're not me

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Because you're not me

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I've been waiting for this moment for 3,000 years

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I will prove your despair and death

10
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Your Majesty

11
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's a pity that you will no longer have a sense after you swallow me

12
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You can only watch the people you care about

13
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The vast land you care about is slowly entering the hell

14
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You think

15
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Look at yourself

16
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You only talk about life is equal

17
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
And then?

18
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You can only rely on the yuan pellet in Lu Yan's body

19
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Even his life is sacrificed for you

20
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You can't even save your beloved

21
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You don't deserve to love him

22
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Go

23
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Your Majesty

24
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Your Majesty

25
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Your Majesty

26
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Why are you still here?

27
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Didn't you get caught by me?

28
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yuan pellet

29
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Lu Yan

30
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
And then?

31
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Li Xi

32
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You're back

33
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That man will use pellets to save you

34
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I thought that if I took it, I would be able to save the world.

35
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I considered the unruly means to be my faith.

36
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It's humans who taught me love and gratitude.

37
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
We once thought that if we were to be considered as the heaven's punishment,

38
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
the weak are not worthy of survival.

39
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Lu Yan told me that the weak

40
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
are not the obstacles to survival at all.

41
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
They are arrogance.

42
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You are arrogant.

43
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Three thousand years ago, I sealed you.

44
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Today, I will completely abandon you.

45
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The Spirit Clan no longer needs you.

46
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Because only love and respect are the rules of survival.

47
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Yun Xi, go save him.

48
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You are like three thousand years ago, running to save him.

49
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Where is the love you are talking about?

50
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You and me talking about love,

51
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
you don't deserve it!

52
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Because you don't understand what love is!

53
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Go to hell!

54
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No!

55
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No!

56
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No!

57
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No!

58
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
No!

59
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Lu Yan.

60
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Lu Yan!

61
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Lu Yan!

62
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Lu Yan!

63
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Lu Yan!

64
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Lu Yan!

65
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Lu Yan!

66
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Lu Yan!

67
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Lu Yan!

68
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Lu Yan, I defeated him!

69
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Lu Yan, I defeated him! Where are you?

70
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Lu Yan!

71
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Lu Yan!

72
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Lu Yan!

73
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Lu Yan!

74
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
You must be joking with me, right?

75
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I know you are here!

76
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Come out, okay?

77
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Can you hear me?

78
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Come out!

79
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Don't hide anymore, okay?

80
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Come out!

81
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Lu Yan!

82
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Where are you?

83
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I want to return Yuan Zai to you!

84
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It will be okay if I return him to you!

85
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Where are you?

86
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You are a mystery that can never be solved with your life

87
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But there is nowhere to find it

88
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's in my heart

89
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Every word that is unknown is about you

90
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It's been ten thousand years

91
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I said I love you

92
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's too late

93
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I said I love you

94
00:12:49,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's too late

95
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Hurry!

96
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Hurry!

97
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Run slowly!

98
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Mom! I am back!

99
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,640
I'm fine.

100
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,280
I'm fine.

101
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,960
I'm fine.

102
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:42,640
I'm fine.

103
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,320
I'm fine.

104
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm fine.

105
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,680
I'm fine.

106
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,480
I'm fine.

107
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,240
I'm fine.

108
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,000
I'm fine.

109
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,600
I'm fine.

110
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,120
Are you all right?

111
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,760
Yes.

112
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,520
Then go home.

113
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,040
Yes.

114
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,280
Be careful.

115
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,480
Yes, Mistress.

116
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,520
Be careful.

117
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,400
I pushed you.

118
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,520
I pushed you.

119
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,560
Mistress.

120
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,440
You're back.

121
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,680
You're well-groomed.

122
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,080
The seeds of the wild leaves are good.

123
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,680
Our land is also rich.

124
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,400
Yes.

125
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,280
By the way,

126
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,120
are there enough people in the clinic?

127
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,560
Don't worry.

128
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,680
Someone is watching over there.

129
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:20,920
Okay.

130
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,000
Go ahead.

131
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:22,920
Okay.

132
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,280
Come on.

133
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:23,680
Let's go.

134
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,280
Come on.

135
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,840
Go.

136
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,480
Be careful.

137
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:25,680
Okay.

138
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,280
Okay.

139
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:27,760
Follow up.

140
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,120
Mistress, are you going out?

141
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,600
Yes.

142
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,600
Okay.

143
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,880
Let's go.

144
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,200
Good.

145
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,520
Yeah.

146
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,240
That's good.)

147
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,360
Come.

148
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,160
Was Intelligent Master having dinner?

149
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,200
Is Second Lad very back?

150
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:07,800
Yes.

151
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,280
It's hard to find. But once we find it

152
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,000
we can definitely get the master's scare

153
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,520
What master?

154
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,360
His master is a fraud

155
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,240
No way

156
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,080
Old man

157
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,160
After dinner

158
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,360
send a telegram to the second master

159
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,280
Tell him to come back quickly

160
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,080
If he doesn't come back, don't come back

161
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:24,800
OK

162
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,760
Come on, let's eat

163
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,080
Daxia, let's eat

164
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,360
Coming

165
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:34,520
Come on

166
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,560
Master

167
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,840
This year, our village

168
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,920
is in a big harvest

169
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
The seeds of the salt

170
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,320
You said you wouldn't mention the salt

171
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,000
Idiot

172
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,560
I just met the master at the door

173
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,520
When I told him about the salt

174
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,560
he didn't feel sad

175
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,320
He went up the mountain again

176
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,240
to the lake

177
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,760
So

178
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,360
the master is back

179
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,640
Da Hai

180
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,720
what else can you do except eating?

181
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,920
No, master is fine

182
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,200
Why are you so unhappy?

183
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,600
He runs around all day

184
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,760
He makes a lot of money

185
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,760
Why did he run into the mountain?

186
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,520
Why?

187
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,720
I went with the master once

188
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
Why is there something else?

189
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,480
Is he looking for his master?

190
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,360
Deng Deng is right

191
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,640
He doesn't tell us

192
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,000
everything

193
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,920
If this continues

194
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,240
what if something happens?

195
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,240
What can we do?

196
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,840
What can we do?

197
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,400
You're here

198
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,120
Come on

199
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,080
Let's eat together

200
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:41,880
For you

201
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,480
Deng Deng's patient

202
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,720
brought us a gift

203
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,840
Where is Deng Deng?

204
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,240
Well

205
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,200
Lu Yan, do you know?

206
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,400
Our village

207
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,640
is in a good harvest this year

208
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,680
The grains in the land

209
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,440
and the fruits in the field

210
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,440
are all very good

211
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,920
In the future

212
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,240
we don't have to worry about eating and drinking anymore

213
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,920
The people outside the village

214
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,320
are very kind

215
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,840
They are very kind

216
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,840
They are very kind

217
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
They are very kind

218
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,840
They are very kind

219
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,840
They are very kind

220
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,840
They are very kind

221
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,760
The children outside the village

222
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,840
are all in school

223
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,800
They are all literate

224
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,560
They can recite poems

225
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,360
They are better than me

226
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,040
Our village

227
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,160
has its own clinic

228
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,080
The doctor you hired

229
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,240
is really a good doctor

230
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,840
He cured many problems

231
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,520
Everyone

232
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,200
is healthy now

233
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,400
and can be at ease

234
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,240
My father and my second father

235
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,680
are still the same

236
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,800
They fight and fight

237
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,840
and marry each other

238
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,800
But

239
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,600
my second father quit smoking

240
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,240
My father

241
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,160
didn't like drinking so much before

242
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,720
The sea

243
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,800
still loves to eat

244
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,600
and drink

245
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,080
Meixi and Shiqi

246
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,840
get along well

247
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,040
Soon

248
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,600
they will be able to drink

249
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,640
their wedding wine

250
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,520
Don't worry

251
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,560
We are all fine

252
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,840
Why do I tell you so much?

253
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
You know

254
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
all these

255
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,640
Right?

256
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,840
Let me

257
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,640
take a good look at you

258
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,440
You have pretty eyebrows

259
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
and pretty eyes

260
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,760
I'm not a girl

261
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
I'm not a girl

262
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
I'm not a girl

263
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
I'm not a girl

264
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
I'm not a girl

265
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
I'm not a girl

266
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,760
I'm not a girl

267
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,760
I'm not a girl

268
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,760
I'm not a girl

269
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:06,760
My eyes are pretty

270
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,760
My nose is pretty too

271
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
My mouth is prettier

272
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,760
You are the person

273
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:31,760
who is pretty everywhere

274
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:44,680
You are always here

275
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,280
and never leave

276
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
Master is back

277
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,280
Come out

278
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,280
Master

279
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:07,280
Da Hai

280
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,680
Why are you sitting at the gate of the village?

281
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,280
I'm waiting for you to eat

282
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
Shiqi, North West

283
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,680
I haven't seen you for a while

284
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,280
Why are you here?

285
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,280
We are here to see you

286
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,880
Yes

287
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,760
We are here to see how you

288
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
I'm angry with him?

289
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,760
How am I angry with him?

290
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,760
You are angry with me

291
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,760
Wine

292
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
Wine

293
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,760
Deng Deng

294
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,760
You disappointed me

295
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,760
Is there a bar in the town?

296
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,760
People who buy wine are all in line

297
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,760
Qianhe Town, right?

298
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
Then why don't you buy some

299
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,760
You give me a taste

300
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,760
Just this

301
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,760
I thought it was a big deal

302
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,760
This is not big

303
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,760
OK

304
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,760
I'll buy it for you now

305
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
You wait

306
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
Two jars

307
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,760
Okay

308
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
Three jars

309
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,760
Pei Xin

310
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
What are you doing?

311
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,760
The coward uses wine to be bold

312
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,760
The enemy uses wine to eliminate the enemy

313
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,760
The drunk person can tell the pain in his heart

314
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,760
It's getting better

315
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,760
Today

316
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,760
Let's give Deng Deng a cruel medicine

317
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,760
Five points

318
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,760
Six six six

319
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,760
Drink

320
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
Come again

321
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,760
Sit down

322
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
Five points

323
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:27,760
Good

324
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
Good

325
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
Five points

326
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,760
Come again

327
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,760
Good

328
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
Good

329
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,760
Deng Deng

330
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,760
Sit down

331
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Dad

332
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
Come

333
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
Deng Deng

334
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
When your mother was alive

335
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,760
When I quarreled with her

336
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
She didn't say a word

337
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,760
But now you are grown up

338
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,760
She's like your mother

339
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,760
Don't say anything in your heart

340
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,760
Why did I fail so much yesterday?

341
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,760
No, no, no

342
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
I said it

343
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
How did you get drunk when you saw the master?

344
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
How did I get drunk?

345
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
Deng Deng

346
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Lu Yan is gone

347
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
But dad is here

348
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
Brothers and sisters are still here

349
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,760
Can't you just tell us?

350
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
Yes

351
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
Master

352
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
If you really think Gu Yan is still alive

353
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,760
You can go to him

354
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,760
We all agree

355
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,760
Right?

356
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
It's going to rain

357
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,760
There needs to be some rainpans in our village

358
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,760
I think there are many things to arrange

359
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Enough, Deng Deng

360
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,760
You won't make money if you lose the money?

361
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,760
Listen to dad's advice

362
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,760
Can't you live for yourself?

363
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,760
I beg you, okay?

364
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,760
Old fish, look at you

365
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,760
The wine is too good

366
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
I can't drink it all

367
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
I'll get a few more

368
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,760
You all wait

369
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,760
I'll be back soon

370
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,760
I'm sorry

371
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,760
Come out to get wine

372
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
But my sister

373
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
Why did you run out?

374
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,760
Do not worry

375
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,760
I'm not here to persuade you

376
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,840
What do you say?

377
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,000
You also look whill about it.

378
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,360
You think Lu Yan is alive too?

379
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,600
I've never done bad things to anyone

380
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,520
in my whole life.

381
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,360
But I'm a man.

382
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,920
So I believe that

383
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,400
she can protect you for life.

384
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,080
And after she sealed the Black Saintess,

385
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,720
her body was not found.

386
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,120
She might have disappeared.

387
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,000
It must not be a coincidence.

388
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,360
So,

389
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,000
why don't you go to her?

390
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,360
I'm not going to her.

391
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,360
Don't use the money as an excuse.

392
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,040
I know it's a lie.

393
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,040
Wait.

394
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,040
Actually, I'm here

395
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,240
to say goodbye to you.

396
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,720
Goodbye?

397
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,800
For the past year,

398
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,560
Shi Qi and I have been helping out at the rescue station.

399
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,560
Now there's a war in the north.

400
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,040
She wants to go.

401
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,960
I promised Uncle Bai to take care of her.

402
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,440
I'm worried about her.

403
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,080
So I want to go with her.

404
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,760
You said that

405
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,280
you would support me to my last hour.

406
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,800
What do you need my help for?

407
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:04,560
1

408
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:06,840
When that happened.

409
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,160
I've talked to Shi Qi about it.

410
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,940
You've done great.

411
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,680
I'll say it to Mr. V.

412
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,920
is to be rewarded.

413
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,880
That's why I can understand

414
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,960
your feelings now.

415
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,240
You don't dare to have hope

416
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,560
because you're afraid of being destroyed again.

417
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,000
But the more you don't dare to face it

418
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,040
and look for it,

419
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,920
the more you'll regret it in the future.

420
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,320
I thought it was nonsense

421
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,320
to listen to you talk about 3000 years ago.

422
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,680
But after all we've been through,

423
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,840
I can see it in my eyes.

424
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,440
Wait.

425
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,600
Lu Yan can wait for you for 3000 years.

426
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,560
Why did you give up on looking for him?

427
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:42,120
Deeply guilty

428
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,880
I'll give it back to you.

429
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,160
Take care of yourself.

430
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,440
Take good care of yourself.

431
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,880
I know.

432
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,160
Even if I have to travel around the world,

433
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,360
and look for the four seas,

434
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,960
I must bring Lu Yan back.

435
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,920
You bitch.

436
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,480
Wei Xi.

437
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,280
Miss Bai is in your care.

438
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,000
You must treat her well.

439
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,200
Mind your own business.

440
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,320
Don't be so sure that you'll find Lu Yan

441
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,960
and become a shameless woman.

442
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,120
She'll abandon you.

443
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,120
What are you talking about?

444
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,200
You brat.

445
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,080
You're being sarcastic again, aren't you?

446
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,600
You...

447
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,000
Don't worry.

448
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,000
I'll definitely find her.

449
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,920
Wait.

450
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,800
Take care of yourself on the way.

451
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,200
We'll be waiting for you.

452
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,200
Okay.

453
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,600
Okay.

454
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,120
Let's go.

455
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:53,600
Okay.

456
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,480
Let's go, Master.

457
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,160
Let's go.

458
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,920
Wait.

459
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Wait for me.

460
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,200
Father.

461
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,280
I'm sorry.

462
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
I was late.

463
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,440
This is what I bought for you.

464
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,800
You love it.

465
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,120
I haven't seen you for half a month.

466
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,000
You don't care about the village.

467
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,280
You don't care about the lantern either.

468
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,200
You're so annoying.

469
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
You don't care about the lantern.

470
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,040
You're leaving.

471
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,920
Get something delicious.

472
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,840
Who are you talking to?

473
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,960
Who says my father doesn't care about me?

474
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:43,380
This is the red sugar

475
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,480
What are the four words?

476
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,400
Lantern.

477
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,880
Lantern.

478
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,600
What does it mean?

479
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,280
Wait.

480
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,200
There are some words that my father

481
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,880
hasn't fully understood yet.

482
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,120
But my master has been practicing for many years.

483
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,200
He told me that

484
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,400
that person is in the Lantern.

485
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,680
If he says that,

486
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,600
there must be a chance.

487
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,600
Master.

488
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,880
You have a master?

489
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,520
Of course.

490
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,400
How can I be so capable

491
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,280
without a master?

492
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,240
What is Lantern?

493
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,520
You're talking better than singing.

494
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,840
I'm lying to you.

495
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,000
Who are you lying to?

496
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,800
You said I'm capable.

497
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,680
You can't say I'm a master.

498
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,920
I'm saying you're not smart.

499
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,680
You're not smart.

500
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,160
You're not smart.

501
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,080
If I'm not smart,

502
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,520
you're not smart.

503
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,600
If you're not smart, think about it.

504
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,040
I'm a master.

505
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,760
You're from the Third Master's family.

506
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,720
Enough.

507
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,760
What do you mean by that?

508
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,840
You two.

509
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,840
Stop arguing.

510
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,720
You should get along well

511
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,880
and take care of each other.

512
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:37,920
I'll be back soon.

513
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,040
Come back soon.

514
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,440
I miss you.

515
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,480
I miss you, too.

516
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,480
I miss you as well.

517
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,880
I love you more to be together.

518
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,680
I'm always with you.

519
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
Yet

520
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:53,760
now,

521
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,720
you haven't met me for too long.

522
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,760
When I asked

523
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,240
those garlics...

524
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,400
What garlics?

525
00:31:59,440 --> 00:31:59,840
The garlics

526
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
I'd sold for no money

527
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,760
to look for.

528
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,400
Do you hear me?

529
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,720
You're

530
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,160
affirmative.

531
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,560
You aren't my daughter anymore.

532
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,440
How can you refuse me?

533
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,600
How dare you shun me?

534
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,600
No

535
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,600
Think again

536
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,600
I've never seen him before

537
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,600
Hello

538
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,600
Have you seen this man?

539
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,600
No

540
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,600
No?

541
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,600
No

542
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
Hello

543
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,600
Have you seen this man?

544
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
No

545
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
No?

546
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
No

547
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Hello, have you seen him?

548
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
No

549
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:33,600
Thank you

550
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
It's okay

551
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,600
Hello, sir

552
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Have you seen this man?

553
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:38,600
No

554
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
No, look at him

555
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:40,600
Have you seen him?

556
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
No

557
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
Have you seen him?

558
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,600
Please put it in the photo studio

559
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,600
I've been paying attention to this for a long time

560
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,600
I've never seen it before

561
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,600
Please help

562
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
Okay, no problem

563
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,600
Thank you

564
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
Are you ready?

565
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,600
Come on

566
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,600
Okay

567
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,600
Yu Deng Deng's original identity

568
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,600
is the sacred daughter of the forest clan, Yunxi, 3000 years ago

569
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
Let's hear it today

570
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,600
These two are the two people who are the most important in the world

571
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
Let's go, let's go, I'm tired today

572
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:38,600
Let's go in and take a break

573
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,600
Have a cup of tea

574
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Plan B

575
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,600
Continue to go to Yingdu City

576
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,600
Good good good

577
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,600
In other words

578
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,600
This General Yan and Yu Deng Deng

579
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,600
Just entered Yingdu City

580
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,600
I found strange things

581
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,600
First, the spirit clan disappeared for no reason

582
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,600
And the old village head Yu

583
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
I don't know

584
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,600
I don't know

585
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,600
I don't know

586
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,600
I don't know

587
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
I don't know

588
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,600
It's clear

589
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,600
Did you wake up on purpose and tell him yourself?

590
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
He is a spirit clan

591
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,600
It's not strange to know

592
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,600
It's okay, let's listen to it

593
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Anyway, what I said is all your glory

594
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,600
Yu Deng Deng at this time

595
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,600
It's so urgent

596
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,600
But what makes him feel anxious

597
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,600
What makes him anxious is

598
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,600
Behind him still with that

599
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,600
General Yan who can't be thrown away

600
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,600
Actually, Yu Deng Deng is too worried

601
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,600
General Yan follows him purely for the previous burden

602
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,600
And think about it

603
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,600
Even if General Yan really believes that Yu Deng Deng is a saint

604
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
Do you love him?

605
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:03,600
I think it's just to repay the kindness of saving each other three thousand years ago

606
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,600
What is General Yan talking about?

607
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,600
How can it be done by love?

608
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
Bullshit

609
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,600
I tell you

610
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
What you said is a rumor

611
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,600
That is, what you said is General Yan

612
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
He and Yu Deng Deng have long known

613
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
Yun Xi and Yu Deng Deng are the same person

614
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,600
I tell you about them

615
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,600
Love is true and love is more than today

616
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
That is a one-eyed fix

617
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,600
I tell you, my master knows more

618
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,600
Master, you go up and talk to them

619
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,600
Don't sit here

620
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,600
You are a big talker

621
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,600
Master, talk to them

622
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,600
Look, I paid the venue fee

623
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,600
You rest for a while

624
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
I paid the venue fee

625
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
Enough, enough

626
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,600
Shut up

627
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,600
Master, you say yours

628
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
You say

629
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
In this case

630
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
Then I will tell you a story

631
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
My own

632
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Actually

633
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Yu Deng Deng and General Yan

634
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,600
After meeting

635
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
Married

636
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,600
No, he is talking nonsense

637
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:04,600
Who is this?

638
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,600
Yu Deng Deng and General Yan

639
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
Although it sounds famous

640
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,600
But when faced with feelings

641
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,600
They are both stupid

642
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,600
The first time I met someone I really liked

643
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
I felt that I was often angry

644
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Not to fight

645
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,600
But then I think

646
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,600
Those are all beautiful memories

647
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,600
They don't love each other

648
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,600
But don't know how to express

649
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,600
Just like in India

650
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,600
Although Yu Deng Deng's mouth is down

651
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,600
Say you don't want to receive

652
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,600
I don't want to receive

653
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,600
Lu Yan

654
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,600
But he knows in his heart

655
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
Once there is danger

656
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Lu Yan will appear in front of him at once

657
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:02,600
When he is helpless

658
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,600
Lu Yan

659
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Will also be his shelter

660
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,600
I don't want to receive

661
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,600
I don't want to receive

662
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,600
Yes, just like this

663
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,600
You watch

664
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,600
Everyone listens to me

665
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,600
Actually in the whole part of India

666
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,600
Yu Deng Deng's apprentice

667
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Standed in a very important place

668
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,600
His apprentice

669
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,600
And became a firm believer

670
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,600
What does he believe

671
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
He is in prison

672
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Passed dozens of days and nights

673
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,600
He suffered a lot

674
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,600
He suffered a lot

675
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
But he didn't give up

676
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
He didn't surrender

677
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,600
Why is he not going to let go

678
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,600
Because he is always a spy

679
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,600
He spy Lu Yan and Yu Deng Deng

680
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,600
Will definitely clear his name

681
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Good good good

682
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Good good good

683
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
Good good good

684
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Good good good

685
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,600
Good good good

686
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Good

687
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
Go go go

688
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Go go go go

689
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Go

690
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,600
What's the mess here?

691
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
Master

692
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
Hurry up

693
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Master

694
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:15,600
The sun is going down

695
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
Shall we continue to catch up?

696
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,600
Find

697
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Next stop

698
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,600
Nanyang City

699
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
it is good

700
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,600
go

701
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,600
I can't remember

702
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,600
How many times have I walked

703
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
For a while

704
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,600
I don't know

705
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Will there be his news in the next town?

706
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:41,600
But it seems to be everywhere

707
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,600
I can find his shadow

708
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
Sometimes

709
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,600
It's about his story

710
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,600
And legend

711
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
Sometimes

712
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
It's a very similar back

713
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,600
I don't know where he is

714
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
But I believe

715
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
As long as I'm still looking

716
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
As long as he is still in the sky of Jiuzhou

717
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
Then we

718
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,600
There is a day of meeting

719
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,600
Lu Yan

720
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,600
If we meet again

721
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,600
I hope

722
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:24,600
How are you

723
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,600
Walk into the scenery

724
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
This city

725
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
The four seasons

726
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,600
How to know love

727
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,600
I hide in my heart

728
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,600
The decision you made

729
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
If you say

730
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,600
Love can be touched

731
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,600
The necklace will be used for sound

732
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:08,600
The most beautiful scenery in life

733
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,600
All heard

734
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
About you

735
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
I don't know

736
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,600
How to know

737
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
All heard

738
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
About you

739
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,600
When two stars are so close

740
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,600
When the whole world is occupied by you

741
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,600
I will call for you with all my heart

742
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,600
Until your memory

743
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:45,600
You are my only

744
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,600
Walk into the scenery

745
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,600
This city

746
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,600
The four seasons

747
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,600
How to know love

748
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:04,600
I hide in my heart

749
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,600
The decision you made

750
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,600
When two stars are so close

751
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,600
When the whole world is occupied by you

752
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,600
I will call for you with all my heart

753
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:33,600
Until your memory

754
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,600
You are my only

755
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Walk into the scenery

756
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,600
The most beautiful scenery in life

757
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:48,600
You are my only

00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,600

You are my only

The most beautiful scenery in life

775
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:53,600
You are my only

776
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
Walk into the scenery
