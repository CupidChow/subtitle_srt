Episode 15

5
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Be careful.

6
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Be careful.

7
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's not worth it.

8
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Be careful.

9
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Put it down.

10
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Put it down.

11
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You can't touch this.

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're the shopkeeper?

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Who are you?

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Don't touch it.

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Don't care who I am.

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Let me ask you.

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Is the sedan chair of the Lu family

18
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
yours?

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What trick did you use to change it?

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You ruined my good deeds

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and lost my man.

22
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
What do you say?

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So you're that

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
arrogant woman.

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What are you talking about?

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
What are you talking about?

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't touch it.

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
you admit

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
you touched the sedan chair?

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
No.

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Our sedan chair is just a sedan chair.

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's a business.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We rent a simple sedan chair.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Shut up.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Stop talking nonsense.

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Pay the money or not.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let's move the things.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Move.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
How dare you?

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Don't be so rude.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You can talk to me.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
This

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
little brother.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Just now,

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I saw your eyes.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
You're the shopkeeper here, right?

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You said

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
your shop

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
ruined my man.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I was very angry.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Very sad.

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Some money

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
was stolen.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I was very angry.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Very sad.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I was very angry.

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Very sad.

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Some money

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
couldn't make up for

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
the pain in my heart.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What do you think

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
should be done?

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What do you want to do?

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Owing people to return people.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's a good thing.

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I think

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
you look good.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
How about

70
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
you kick him?

71
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Master.

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Master.

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Master.

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Master.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Are you okay?

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Master.

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
How are you?

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You're bleeding, master.

79
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What kind of man is this?

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
He beat you like this.

81
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What's going on?

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm bleeding from my teeth.

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm on fire.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Master, you're bleeding.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I believe you.

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Are you okay?

88
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Master, you're...

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This smelly man.

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Beat him.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Beat him.

92
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Go beat him.

93
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He can beat me like this.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're not going to die.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
This guy

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
has a lot of inner strength.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
A few moves.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Interesting.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Master, we're so many people.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Just forget it.

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes.

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He ruined our good thing.

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
How can he just forget it?

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yes.

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Just forget it.

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Everyone just saw it.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The whole house of the antique

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
can beat several Lu family.

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes.

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He's really good.

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm going to get this man.

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Master, this woman's owner

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
looks so much like my master.

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Could it be related to something?

116
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I tried the hairpin left by Yunxi.

117
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
She's not Yunxi.

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Now the most important thing is to find the ashes.

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Our school has a lot of spies out there.

120
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm going to split up with Chang

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
to ask around.

122
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I arranged this room for you.

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You take a break first.

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay.

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Master.

126
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Master.

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Master.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Master.

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'm still in pain.

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll let you see my power

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
when I get you.

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Master.

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Slow down.

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Take it.

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Master.

136
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
No.

137
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
They're so good.

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
How can we beat them?

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Haven't you heard of this saying?

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
No matter how good your martial arts are,

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
you're afraid of the kitchen knife.

142
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I saw their manager go out just now.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Master.

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Master.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Master.

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Master.

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Master.

148
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Master.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Master.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Master.

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Master.

152
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Master.

153
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Master.

154
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Master.

155
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Master.

156
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Master.

157
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Master.

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Master.

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Master.

160
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Master.

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Master.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Master.

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Master.

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Master.

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Master.

166
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Master.

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Master.

168
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Master.

169
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Master.

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Master.

171
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Master.

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Master.

173
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Master.

174
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Master.

175
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Master.

176
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Master.

177
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Master.

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Master.

179
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Master.

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Master.

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000

Master.

207

Master.

208
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Master.

209
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Master.

210
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Master.

211
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Master.

212
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Master.

213
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Master.

214
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Master.

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Master.

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Master.

217
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Master.

218
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Master.

219
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Master.

220
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Master.

221
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Master.

222
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Master.

223
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Master.

224
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Master.

225
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Master.

226
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Master.

227
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Master.

228
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Master.

229
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Master.

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Master.

231
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Master.

232
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Master.

233
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Master.

234
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Master.

235
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Master.

236
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Master.

237
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Master.

238
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Whose money is lost?

239
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This is called

240
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
good cultivation,

241
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and good taste.

242
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Really.

243
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
It looks

244
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
so beautiful.

245
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's not much better

246
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
than the stars on the newspaper.

247
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll give you

248
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
a few if I marry you back.

249
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Oh, my.

250
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,320
Look at your little nose and little lips.

251
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:42,960
Mr. Han,

252
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,440
why are you still sitting here?

253
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,600
Is it done?

254
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,480
Mr. Kang.

255
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,520
Mr. Han.

256
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:03,880
Mr. Han.

257
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,920
What are you doing?

258
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,480
You're awake.

259
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,000
I thought you were dead if you didn't wake up.

260
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,120
Okay, lie down here first.

261
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,080
I'll get you some food.

262
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,720
Don't move.

263
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,920
Lie down and don't run around.

264
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,720
I will.

265
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:04,640
posnt target

266
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,040
The amount of medicine you gave me,

267
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,040
don't say it's human.

268
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,080
Even a blind bear can't wake up.

269
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,560
Don't worry.

270
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,120
The sea is watching you.

271
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,080
When I gave you the medicine,

272
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,080
why didn't you say that the medicine of the soft bone umbrella is strong?

273
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,040
You scared me.

274
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,480
The medicine is too strong.

275
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,600
How about

276
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,520
we go down the mountain to find a doctor to check it?

277
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,560
No need.

278
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,880
I'll be fine after sleeping enough.

279
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,320
Wait. Look at you now.

280
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,240
Sit and sit.

281
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,240
Stand and stand.

282
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,040
Can a girl look good?

283
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,760
Pretty?

284
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,640
Pretty?

285
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,480
Can you?

286
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,600
Can you?

287
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,680
No need.

288
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,360
What do you mean no need?

289
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,120
Then the head must look like a head.

290
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,840
We don't have that kind of person.

291
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,080
Let me tell you.

292
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,240
You're married now.

293
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,640
It's time.

294
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,080
Give me a child.

295
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,000
It's done.

296
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:58,960
It hurts.

297
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,440
When did you learn to fly?

298
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,400
I was thrown out by someone.

299
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,400
Are you okay?

300
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,200
It hurts.

301
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:07,880
My back hurts.

302
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,760
You're new here and you dare to do it.

303
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,000
You're pretty good.

304
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,200
My back hurts.

305
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,600
Why are you here again?

306
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,120
It's me.

307
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,880
What's wrong?

308
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,560
Hai.

309
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,920
How did you serve him?

310
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,240
I told you to serve him with good food and good food.

311
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,840
Why did you...

312
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
He didn't eat a bite.

313
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,720
He just kicked me out.

314
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,960
Why didn't you tie him up?

315
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,920
I tied him up. It's too tight.

316
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,040
Well...

317
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:36,800
Bro.

318
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,720
It's not right to beat him.

319
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,960
Anyway,

320
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,280
it's wrong to beat someone.

321
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,920
Although he deserves to be beaten,

322
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,880
he can't be beaten.

323
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,080
If we wake you up in this way,

324
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,880
you'll definitely feel uncomfortable.

325
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,560
But

326
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,080
after a long time,

327
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,280
you'll know

328
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,640
how much effort you've put into it.

329
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,520
Don't touch me.

330
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,080
What's your name?

331
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,920
Move.

332
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,920
I'm asking you what's your name.

333
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,400
Master, his name is Lu.

334
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,640
His name is Lu Yan.

335
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,200
From now on,

336
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,520
you're Mr. Yu Lu.

337
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,840
You're my second wife.

338
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,840
I advise you

339
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,400
to be more reserved in my territory.

340
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,600
If you're obedient,

341
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,760
you can say anything.

342
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,960
If you dare to cheat,

343
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,280
do you believe me?

344
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,160
Second wife?

345
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,400
Wait and see.

346
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,840
You don't like what you said, do you?

347
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,040
What's wrong with him?

348
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,160
He

349
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,800
made me confused.

350
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,040
My husband

351
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:34,840
is young.

352
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,640
He hasn't found a suitable second wife.

353
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,040
He's either short of money

354
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,240
or has a bad face.

355
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,800
Since he met you,

356
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,000
he's really a good man.

357
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,440
You...

358
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,720
I told you not to touch me.

359
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,680
Do you think I'm having a good discussion with you?

360
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,480
This is the Qingquan Fortress.

361
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,520
Da Hai.

362
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,880
Take out the things.

363
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,080
I'll show you

364
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:53,880
what this is.

365
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:54,920
Look.

366
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,360
What's this?

367
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:57,960
Get out of the way.

368
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,080
What's this?

369
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,080
I got it.

370
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,680
Look at this.

371
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:05,960
A marriage certificate.

372
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,440
See?

373
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,000
Your handprint

374
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,720
is black and white.

375
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,760
You want to deny it?

376
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,080
Listen.

377
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,240
If you obey me,

378
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,080
you can say anything.

379
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,360
But if you don't,

380
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,400
I'll break your leg.

381
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,920
You can be my brother in bed.

382
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,040
This is a good thing.

383
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,120
You want to leave before I finish?

384
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:37,760
Master.

385
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,320
Be careful.

386
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,160
You hit me when I came up.

387
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,760
It's not good to get hurt.

388
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,000
Master.

389
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,600
Are you okay?

390
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,120
Master.

391
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,480
Look.

392
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,000
It's bleeding.

393
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,360
What a beautiful hand.

394
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,120
It's bleeding.

395
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,200
What a pity.

396
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,880
Tell me.

397
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,200
I told you not to resist.

398
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,040
The more you resist, the more I get angry.

399
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,640
Don't underestimate our village.

400
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,920
Although it's a village,

401
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,400
as long as you obey me,

402
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,680
you'll definitely get what you want.

403
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,280
Buy some ointment later.

404
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,520
Wipe it for him.

405
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,040
Okay.

406
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,440
Your husband made it very clear.

407
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,440
You're the one who's hurt.

408
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,800
Stop struggling.

409
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
You can't run away.

410
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,120
Think about it.

411
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,360
Right.

412
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,640
Besides, you've signed the marriage contract.

413
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,760
It's useless to go back on it.

414
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,240
Right.

415
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,200
You want to kill my master.

416
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,280
You'll be dead if you kill him.

417
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,280
How can I say it?

418
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,160
You scared me.

419
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,440
I can stay.

420
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,760
But I have a condition.

421
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,600
Say it.

422
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,760
I don't like to be restricted.

423
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,680
So I can walk around

424
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,120
in this village.

425
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,160
What if you run away?

426
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,440
There are so many people in your village.

427
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,520
How can I run away?

428
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,640
You can't run away.

429
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,720
I can't run away.

430
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,520
If you had done this,

431
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,760
why would I tie you up?

432
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,960
Don't worry.

433
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,520
I'll let the Immortal take you...

434
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,120
Besides,

435
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,000
I don't like to be touched.

436
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,920
Let's not help him.

437
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,480
Come on.

438
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,600
Let him reflect on himself.

439
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,160
Let's go.

440
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,000
You're so stubborn.

441
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,320
Today,

442
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,000
I'll let you go.

443
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,520
Everyone.

444
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,680
Let's go back.

445
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,520
This little white face.

446
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,560
He's afraid of being touched.

447
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,720
I'll break it for you.

448
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,960
What's going on?

449
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,920
Let him go.

450
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,800
Let him go.

451
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,080
Just wait here.

452
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,040
What?

453
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,680
Isn't your North Gou Village

454
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,160
quite brave?

455
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,480
You all dare to come to our Nanteng Village

456
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,800
to get information?

457
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,360
Boss.

458
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:50,280
Boss.

459
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,360
Boss.

460
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,640
Something happened.

461
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,560
Qingquan Village is going to hold a big event.

462
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,960
A group of old men are getting married.

463
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,480
What's so strange?

464
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,360
Not old men.

465
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,080
It's Yu Deng Deng.

466
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,000
He's getting married.

467
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,800
I'll tell you when we get back.

468
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,680
If you bother me and Qingquan Village again,

469
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,000
I'll take his nest.

470
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:11,880
Get lost.

471
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,200
Yes.

472
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,800
What's going on with Yu Deng Deng?

473
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,400
After the young master of the Lu family was lost,

474
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,280
Yu Deng Deng went to the wedding hall of the wedding hall

475
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,480
and fell in love with the boss of the wedding hall.

476
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:22,640
He took it back to the mountain village

477
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,560
without anyone noticing.

478
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,640
A girl.

479
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,080
How can he be so shameless

480
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,280
under the light of day?

481
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,320
Give him a kick.

482
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:30,920
What...

483
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,400
What does it have to do with us?

484
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,120
What does it have to do with us?

485
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,480
The head of my Nanteng Village hasn't been married yet.

486
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,360
Qingquan Village is already in two houses.

487
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,760
Can you two get along?

488
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,200
Boss.

489
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,240
When the old village head was alive,

490
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,080
he went to Qingquan Mountain

491
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,320
to tell you what he wanted to say.

492
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,880
You don't want it yourself.

493
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,320
What is that?

494
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,600
It's weak and not strong.

495
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,320
It's twisted and full of foreign languages.

496
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,800
Young master doesn't like it.

497
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,400
Yes. Yes. Yes.

498
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,880
Don't you like

499
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,280
a bold and bold person

500
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,480
who doesn't hesitate to make small mistakes

501
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,840
and is a little rough?

502
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,880
It would be better if you have a little bit of strength.

503
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,440
You know that again, don't you?

504
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,760
Boss.

505
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,760
The brothers can see

506
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,360
what you mean to Yu Zhaizhou.

507
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,720
See?

508
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,560
You all can see it clearly.

509
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,800
Why can't he see it?

510
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,800
Are you pretending to be stupid with me?

511
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,280
He doesn't know that he should be

512
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,400
a little gentler,

513
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,320
smarter and cuter in front of me, right?

514
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,120
He has already arrived at Qingquan Village.

515
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,520
How about we catch a bunch of thieves?

516
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:31,920
No.

517
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,520
Qingquan Village looks slow.

518
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,880
It's actually very well guarded.

519
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,800
If we act rashly,

520
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,160
he will know

521
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,600
that he can't hang on to his face

522
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,920
and will blame me for ruining his wedding.

523
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,240
Boss, I have an idea.

524
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,160
Good. That's good.

525
00:19:58,920 --> 00:19:59,600
Master,

526
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,920
just change another one.

527
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,920
If you two meet,

528
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,480
you will be stabbed to death.

529
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,440
It's too dangerous.

530
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,720
You said that the one who is handsome and rich

531
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,840
is a man.

532
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,520
Why do you have to be so hard on him?

533
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,080
No.

534
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,720
I still want him.

535
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,080
I want to double the tea bowl and ladle

536
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,600
that he just smashed.

537
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,760
Okay. You are really a master of money and color.

538
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,080
I don't want you to eat anything.

539
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,720
Now, I want to ask for three times more dowry.

540
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,280
Go and ask them to give me the dowry.

541
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,840
The day will be

542
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,040
three days later.

543
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,080
Why is it so fast?

544
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,000
Ask all the people in the 18 mountains

545
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
to come here.

546
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,240
I will collect the dowry.

547
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,240
I just want them to see

548
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,680
that I, Yu Deng Deng,

549
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,680
can take the attack

550
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,840
and kill the good guys.

551
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,640
When we cook the rice with the rice,

552
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,400
the school will be ours.

553
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,720
By the way,

554
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,680
keep an eye on him for me.

555
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,840
I always think that

556
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,360
he agreed too quickly.

557
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,520
I'm afraid that he will run away.

558
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,160
Don't worry, master.

559
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,560
The guard of our Qingquan Village

560
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,840
is not weak and can't even fly a gong.

561
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,520
But I think Lu Yan

562
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,360
is a little fierce.

563
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,600
He will climb on your head one day.

564
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,280
No matter how fierce he is, he is no match for a good player.

565
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,320
If he is fierce,

566
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,520
I have to teach him a lesson.

567
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,440
Oh,

568
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,760
you are so powerful, master.

569
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,520
There is a hall in the village.

570
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:28,240
Miss Lu.

571
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,200
No, Mr. Lu.

572
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,040
You live in Gongbao Courtyard.

573
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,920
This is Yu Xiang Courtyard where the chief lives.

574
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,040
Look, it's lively here.

575
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,880
This is the art hall of our meeting.

576
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,160
It's called the good food hall.

577
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,720
This is where we live.

578
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,560
This is the hot pot house.

579
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,360
This is where we live.

580
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,760
You can go anywhere you want.

581
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,200
That coin is...

582
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,080
That's just a decoration.

583
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,200
Our old village head, Yu Tan Zi,

584
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
is a fan of the village.

585
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,440
He said it was a treasure.

586
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,000
He won't let us take it.

587
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,640
If we play this,

588
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,920
the village will be poor.

589
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,240
It's useless.

590
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,760
The eastern forest is dead.

591
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
The west is hanging over the mountain.

592
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,000
The eight sides are all killed.

593
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,480
The small fortune is broken.

594
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,160
The village of Qingquan

595
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,000
looks like a mess.

596
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,800
It's always in the center of the mountain.

597
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,640
In fact, it's a victory with death.

598
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,000
The planner is a master.

599
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,240
Mr. Lu, I can see that

600
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,160
you are a real man.

601
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,080
How can an old man

602
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,800
be angry with a woman?

603
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,040
When you come,

604
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,800
you must help our big master.

605
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,320
If you look up to me,

606
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,800
I can help you.

607
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,240
But in the village of Qingquan,

608
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,000
you can't always let a woman do it.

609
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,520
Sir!

610
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:00,840
Sir!

611
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,760
Sir!

612
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,320
What are you doing?

613
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,120
What are you doing?

614
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,240
How dare you kidnap my master?

615
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,160
Don't you want to live?

616
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,120
Don't push me.

617
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:07,920
Let go of me!

618
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,800
Isn't this the little shopkeeper

619
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,360
in the new school?

620
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,080
Let go of him.

621
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,840
You want to play the monkey?

622
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,360
I'll ask him.

623
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,960
You...

624
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,720
Let go of him.

625
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,560
Sir.

626
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,760
Are you okay?

627
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,680
You said let go of him.

628
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,560
I won't let go of him.

629
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,160
Let's go.

630
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,800
You said let go of him.

631
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
Didn't you hear that?

632
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:25,760
Sir.

633
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,760
Master.

634
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,120
He's here to give us money.

635
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,400
How can you be like this?

636
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:35,800
Yes, give.

637
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,320
Yes.

638
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,360
Let's make a deal.

639
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,400
I'm a smart guy.

640
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,240
I misunderstood.

641
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
The family of the Miao is here.

642
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,680
Why don't you tell us in advance?

643
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,080
Let's have a meal together.

644
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:44,600
Yes.

645
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,200
Let's go.

646
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,520
Yes.

647
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,800
Master.

648
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,080
Come.

649
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,040
Come, master.

650
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,520
Wen Ji.

651
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,080
Good guy.

652
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,160
Dance.

653
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,160
Let's go.

654
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,080
Sir.

655
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:07,080
Why are you eating with these fools?

656
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,440
Why don't you fight?

657
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,160
Look around.

658
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,040
The mountain village is the culprit of the thief.

659
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,520
Observe closely.

660
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
Don't be impulsive.

661
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,400
Okay.

662
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,040
Let's call it a day.

663
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:22,840
Let's eat.

664
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,360
No.

665
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,160
Master.

666
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,600
Wen Ji is a dance.

667
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,240
It's the rule of the master.

668
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,560
Didn't he go around the world to play?

669
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,120
He even fooled me into saying that he was catching monsters.

670
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:33,920
Mrs. Lu.

671
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,640
You're from my family?

672
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,160
Sit down.

673
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,680
Let's eat.

674
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,120
I'm sorry.

675
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,920
I'm sorry.

676
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,640
We don't have rules for the servants.

677
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,240
What servants?

678
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,360
He's my apprentice.

679
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
Everyone in our village is equal.

680
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,920
If you want to stand,

681
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,760
it's up to you.

682
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,320
Master.

683
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,320
Eat some chicken wings.

684
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,640
I finally got this thing

685
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,320
from those rascals.

686
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,960
Try it.

687
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,080
I don't like this.

688
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,040
You eat more.

689
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,880
You'll be more careful in the future.

690
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,560
I'll eat this sugar cane.

691
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,880
What's this?

692
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,640
This is called a gourd.

693
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,600
It's made of glutinous rice.

694
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,720
Come on.

695
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:18,840
Try it.

696
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,680
Mrs. Lu.

697
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,560
Eat.

698
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,240
What are you doing?

699
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,600
I'm asking you to eat, not these.

700
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,680
Take it.

701
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,760
Here.

702
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,160
Eat.

703
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,880
I prepared this for you.

704
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,160
What do you mean?

705
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,800
What do you mean?

706
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,680
The color of the pickles is not good.

707
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,400
Every yard in our village

708
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,880
has a corresponding share.

709
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,480
You broke the bowl and the basin.

710
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,800
You even hurt my apprentice.

711
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,400
You keep adding up.

712
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,320
The monthly salary has been spent.

713
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,880
If you want to eat something delicious,

714
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,800
you can add more money.

715
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,640
That's it.

716
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,600
From now on,

717
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,120
every meal is a meal.

718
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,600
This is a bowl of steamed buns.

719
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,960
It's fifty cents.

720
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,720
The rest is a new dish.

721
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,880
Eight cents.

722
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,200
If you want to have a meal with meat,

723
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,000
that's great.

724
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,440
How can you be so calculating?

725
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,840
That's how our family is.

726
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,080
Mrs. Lu.

727
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,920
Choose a set of dishes.

728
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,760
In a word,

729
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,920
you are the money of our school.

730
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,480
How can you say that?

731
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,400
Mrs. Lu.

732
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:57,200
I'm not so unreasonable.

733
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,600
You are

734
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,560
my fish now.

735
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,560
As long as you serve me well,

736
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,240
how can you be missing

737
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,680
the delicious food?

738
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,520
Come on.

739
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,360
Let me have a laugh.

740
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,560
You...

741
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,840
Your body is also good.

742
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,080
After you finish laughing,

743
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,040
dance for me.

744
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,760
Don't be too aggressive.

745
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,880
Sir, let's go.

746
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,120
Stop.

747
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,320
You broke my table

748
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,520
and dirtied my food.

749
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,000
You want to leave now?

750
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,600
What's in here is yours.

751
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,000
You gave it to me.

752
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,920
What do you mean?

753
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,600
You look down on us.

754
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,720
We also

755
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,120
eat with our hands, okay?

756
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,200
What's so great about

757
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,480
being the boss of a restaurant?

758
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,600
The news also says that

759
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,320
the duke's general is a coward.

760
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,400
The price of the food

761
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
is also a high or low price.

762
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,640
It seems that you should

763
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,600
follow the rules.

764
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:53,920
Da Hai.

765
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,040
Tell Mrs. Lu

766
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,800
the rules of our mountain village.

767
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,640
Okay.

768
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,960
Listen carefully.

769
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,000
This...

770
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,520
You took it wrong.

771
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,000
Hurry up.

772
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,800
This...

773
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:12,960
The duke

774
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,320
is the master of the mountain village.

775
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,600
He is also the master of your family.

776
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,280
In the future,

777
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,640
you have to listen to the duke's arrangement

778
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,160
when you talk, do things, eat, wear, and live.

779
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,160
You can't be angry with the duke.

780
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,720
You can't

781
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,120
compete with the duke.

782
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,520
The most important thing is

783
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,920
you can't use the duke's favor

784
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,360
to make him angry.

785
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,040
It's a temper.

786
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:34,560
It's a temper.

787
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,240
It's a temper.

788
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,040
Do you hear me?

789
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,760
If you go out of this door,

790
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,720
I'm afraid you won't know

791
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,280
Wen Hui's business in this life.

792
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,280
If you follow the rules,

793
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,200
I can give you a bonus

794
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,160
to tell you what Wen Hui is.

795
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,120
Wen Hui?

796
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,600
You think I don't know?

797
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,480
You were hurt by my dagger.

798
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,440
It's not because you can't hide.

799
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,840
It's because you saw

800
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,600
Wen Hui's blank face on my dagger.

801
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,640
You are in the Qingquan Village.

802
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,680
You are famous for sightseeing and exploring.

803
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,440
Isn't it for Wen Hui?

804
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,160
There is nothing

805
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,640
in the whole Qingquan Village

806
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,840
that can hide from me.

807
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,600
Da Hai.

808
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,120
Read it.

809
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,320
Okay.

810
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,360
The village head is not called.

811
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,960
You can't be entangled.

812
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,840
When the village head wants to pick you up,

813
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,560
you can't just push it off.

814
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,600
Excuse me.

815
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Excuse me.

816
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Excuse me.

817
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,800
Our Qingquan Village

818
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,120
is also a village of etiquette.

819
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,600
The second house should be respected by the elders.

820
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,760
Wake up early and have a cup of tea.

821
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:51,680
Yes,

822
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,320
the main thing is to have a cup of tea.

823
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:53,840
Come on.

824
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:56,840
Come on.

825
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,440
Come on.

826
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,720
Hurry up. It's time for you to show off.

827
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,040
Show off now.

828
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:03,960
Hurry up.

829
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,680
Take it.

830
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,720
The things in your Qingquan Village are really not solid.

831
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,920
The table will break when you touch it.

832
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,040
The cup is also easy to break.

833
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,120
Da Hai.

834
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:18,920
Another cup.

835
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,560
Forget it.

836
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,920
We are already a family.

837
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,480
Don't make up those false theories.

838
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,640
Since the head has already recognized it,

839
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,680
men

840
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,640
are not ashamed of their wives.

841
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:32,840
Come on.

842
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:36,000
I made this myself.

843
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,240
It's been three or four years.

844
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,240
It's finally useful today.

845
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,000
Come on.

846
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,480
Come on.

847
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,320
You two

848
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,960
should work hard

849
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,840
to give me a little fish.

850
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,440
Yes.

851
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,480
This is a good thing.

852
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,360
Come on. Take it.

853
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,600
Hurry up.

854
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,560
This is a good thing.

855
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
Being a second house is more about uniting brothers.

856
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
Love and debt.

857
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,320
Can't be in a row.

858
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,520
Can't be in the middle of nowhere.

859
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,360
We should always keep our smile.

860
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,200
Most importantly,

861
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,320
when others greet you,

862
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,120
you must answer them.

863
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,680
Right?

864
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,400
Go.

865
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,000
Don't do this.

866
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,800
Don't do this.

867
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,520
Don't do this.

868
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,960
Don't mess around.

869
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,000
Be quiet.

870
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,200
This is the first time

871
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,800
they've worked so hard for a year.

872
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,280
It's not appropriate

873
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,600
for you to be such a fool.

874
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,280
This is a good thing.

875
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,120
This is a good thing.

876
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,640
This is a good thing.

877
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,440
Second house,

878
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,840
besides serving the seniors,

879
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,800
uniting brothers,

880
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,240
and serving the master,

881
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,000
the more important thing is

882
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,400
to serve your master

883
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,720
with the spirit of hard work

884
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,880
and goodwill.

885
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,560
And this is the master

886
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,640
of the first house.

887
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,800
Your chicken is called Dahong?

888
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,080
Dahong.

889
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,800
Big and sharp.

890
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,480
Red and bright.

891
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,400
How happy it is.

892
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,040
Right.

893
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,960
Right.

894
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,800
This is your first house?

895
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,680
What's so strange?

896
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,240
It's your brother who serves the chickens.

897
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,120
From now on,

898
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,240
you can't sleep if he doesn't.

899
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,760
You must wake up if he doesn't.

900
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,160
Cleaning the chicken nest

901
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,160
is your job.

902
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,760
But,

903
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,440
you can also spend money

904
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,440
to make it for your friend.

905
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,720
I can do it.

906
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,600
You can ask me.

907
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,800
Come on.

908
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,880
Serve your brother.

909
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:35,920
Do you believe

910
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,400
I'll have roasted chicken tonight?

911
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
How dare you?

912
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,720
You forgot the rules just now.

913
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,200
Master,

914
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,240
I'll show him.

915
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,080
Remember to pay me.

916
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,120
Dahong.

917
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,960
I've played the props with you for a long time.

918
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,440
Don't waste my patience.

919
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,280
Forget it.

920
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,120
I'm not

921
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,920
being unreasonable.

922
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,960
I'm also a man of the West.

923
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,280
Come to my room later.

924
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,760
You should know this is the home-made pattern.

925
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:13,880
Right.

926
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,120
This broken dagger

927
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,240
is nothing special.

928
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,440
To be honest,

929
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,000
the pattern on it

930
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,040
is the home-made pattern

931
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,120
left by our ancestor.

932
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,760
No one else

933
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,680
can use it except us.

934
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,720
It's ugly and hard to draw.

935
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,520
What does it mean?

936
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,200
It's a fish on it.

937
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,960
Our ancestor

938
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,960
made it himself.

939
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,160
It's a little ugly,

940
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,240
but it's very valuable,

941
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,880
okay?

942
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,320
Where did you live

943
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,480
twenty years ago?

944
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,280
Were you always in Qingquan?

945
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,880
I don't remember.

946
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,400
I've been

947
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,200
running around with my father

948
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,040
since I was a kid.

949
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,520
We settled here

950
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,720
after we entered Qingquan.

951
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,800
So

952
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,120
your father built Qingquan?

953
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,720
Yes.

954
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,800
Do you know

955
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,640
there's a creature

956
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,840
called the spirit tribe?

957
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:13,200
It's said that the spirit tribe

958
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,800
used to live in the sky.

959
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,440
Thousands of years ago,

960
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,680
it came down from the sky

961
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,560
to take the earth from humans.

962
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,880
Since then,

963
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
there have been

964
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,080
a great job

965
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,600
called the training master.

966
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,040
The spirit tribe fought against humans

967
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,200
for hundreds of years

968
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,320
and hundreds of rounds.

969
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,240
The training master

970
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,080
defeated the spirit tribe

971
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,320
and fled in a state of panic.

972
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,000
He hid in the mountains

973
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,160
and never dared to come out again.

974
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,520
But in fact...

975
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,160
But in fact...

976
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,760
I lied to you.

977
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,040
Look at your eyes.

978
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,280
Are you serious?

979
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,960
No way.

980
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,680
You really take it seriously, don't you?

981
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,480
I was a kid.

982
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,840
My father told me that.

983
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,280
So your father is a training master?

984
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,720
What training master?

985
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,680
It's all his lie.

986
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,160
Has your father

987
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,480
brought the spirit tribe back?

988
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,640
I don't remember.

989
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,680
You can ask the second master.

990
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,720
He knows

991
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,520
what my father did.

992
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,280
What else do you know?

993
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,280
What do you want to know?

994
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,280
Why are you so interested

995
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,600
in our Jiawen?

996
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,400
Nothing.

997
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,600
I'm just interested

998
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,880
in the training master.

999
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,800
Look at you.

1000
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,880
You're such a good young man.

1001
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:34,800
Why do you believe

1002
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,720
such superstition?

1003
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,480
Let me tell you.

1004
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,040
There is no spirit tribe

1005
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
or training master in this world.

1006
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,560
I've seen my father train.

1007
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,040
It's all the magic tricks

1008
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,120
that my second father and they did together.

1009
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,240
Are you also

1010
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,800
deceived by someone?

1011
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,720
What era is this?

1012
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,080
And someone's surname is Linzuo.

1013
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,840
I haven't finished talking.

1014
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,840
Why are you leaving?

1015
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,760
You're so shameless.

1016
00:35:59,320 --> 00:35:59,840
Master.

1017
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,200
Are you upset

1018
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,200
about the death of the god?

1019
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:03,360
No.

1020
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,800
He just asked me

1021
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,420
about the

1022
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,600
soulmate Wenhui.

1023
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,320
You two are not suitable at all.

1024
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,160
Lu Yiniang is so poor.

1025
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,360
She likes the kind of

1026
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,240
delicate and gentle

1027
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,360
and gentle woman.

1028
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,880
She's so soft.

1029
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,800
She doesn't like us.

1030
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,160
We don't like her either.

1031
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:21,600
Right?

1032
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,480
You know nothing.

1033
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,880
I'm just delicate.

1034
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,680
I'm just gentle and gentle.

1035
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:31,880
Go.

1036
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:32,960
Bring the brush.

1037
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,160
I have to draw a masterpiece

1038
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,280
to make her open her eyes.

1039
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
You're so stubborn.

1040
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,600
You're so good.

1041
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,280
I'll find it for you.

1042
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,520
Master.

1043
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,240
How is it going?

1044
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,880
She doesn't know anything.

1045
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,000
She doesn't know anything?

1046
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:50,760
Then...

1047
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,760
But Wenhui

1048
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,920
and her appearance

1049
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,160
are not just coincidences, right?

1050
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,320
Although she doesn't know anything,

1051
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,000
the identity of the fish stall is very suspicious.

1052
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,320
This Qingquan Village

1053
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,280
must be hiding some secrets.

1054
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,280
But I heard that the old village head

1055
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,200
never returns to the village

1056
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,120
at the end of the year.

1057
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,800
So who else

1058
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,760
would know about this?

1059
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,080
I'm not sure.

1060
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:15,840
I'm not sure.

1061
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,840
I'm not sure.

1062
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,840
I'm not sure.

1063
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,840
I'm not sure.

1064
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
I'm not sure.

1065
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,840
I'm not sure.

1066
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,840
I'm not sure.

1067
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
I'm not sure.

1068
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
I'm not sure.

1069
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
I'm not sure.

1070
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,840
I'm not sure.

1071
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,840
I'm not sure.

1072
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
I'm not sure.

1073
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,840
I'm not sure.

1074
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,840
I'm not sure.

1075
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
I'm not sure.

1076
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,840
I'm not sure.

1077
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,840
I'm not sure.

1078
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,840
I'm not sure.

1079
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,840
I'm not sure.

1080
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:35,840
I'm not sure.

1081
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
I'm not sure.

1082
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,840
I'm not sure.

1083
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,840
I'm not sure.

1084
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,840
I'm not sure.

1085
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,840
I'm not sure.

1086
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
I'm not sure.

1087
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
I'm not sure.

1088
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,840
I'm not sure.

1089
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,440
Ahem.

1090
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,040
Ya ha.

1091
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,640
Lady Lu.

1092
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,440
Lady Lu, you can't sleep?

1093
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,840
Come out and walk around.

1094
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
Yes, Chief.

1095
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,040
I was going to walk around the village

1096
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,640
to get familiar with the environment,

1097
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,840
but I got lost.

1098
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,640
It seems that this hot pot house

1099
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,040
is not where I should come.

1100
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,840
Why shouldn't you come?

1101
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,440
We are a family.

1102
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,040
Just walk around.

1103
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,640
There are many good things here.

1104
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,040
Let me show you.

1105
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,040
Let's go.

1106
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,240
Come.

1107
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
Take a look.

1108
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,240
Come on, please.

1109
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,280
Take a look.

1110
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,400
Phoenix and Spirit,

1111
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,280
the eyes of the bird,

1112
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,040
the tail of the snake,

1113
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,600
and so many remains of the ancient spirit clan.

1114
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,800
You know this too?

1115
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,200
I know one or two.

1116
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,920
These are all broken pieces.

1117
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,720
The ancestor of the Yu family was a hunter.

1118
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:28,660
He got many

1119
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,200
The most valuable is that hard dragon bone.

1120
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,720
If you like it, you can take it.

1121
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,200
There is no soul here.

1122
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,400
The black market is worth a lot of money.

1123
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,040
It's no use if I want that thing.

1124
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:44,800
Lu Yi Niang,

1125
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,960
can you tell me something?

1126
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,160
Who are you?

1127
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:19,560
What I hear is all about you

1128
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,840
When two stars are so close

1129
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,360
When the whole world is occupied by you

1130
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,160
I will call for you with all my heart

1131
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:37,200
Until your memory

1132
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:43,040
You are my only

1133
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:50,460
View

1134
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:57,260
This city is always very beautiful

1135
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,380
I take you

1136
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,560
I'm sure

1137
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:56,840
You are the scenery I made for you

1138
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,340
This city is like you and me

1139
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,840
We are inseparable from love

1140
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:08,840
I have made the decision for you

1141
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:12,840
I have made the decision for you
