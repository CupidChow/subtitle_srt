1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
Editing, contouring & video editing are Officer Wei

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,420
And看空缘

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,880
Video clips are indivisible

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,520
Gl stuffs and glittering

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:22,560
Love happiness

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,960
Love air in the flames

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,560
Haven't had it

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,040
Lining your neck

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,760
You did a better job

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,320
But your pain still lingers

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,320
I still miss you

12
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,320
The rainbow falls, the chaos

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,320
The past is hard to forget

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,320
Tears fall, the deep love

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,320
Becomes a bitter sea

16
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,320
Fate falls, love is buried

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,320
Love and hate are inextricable

18
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,320
Follow me, let go, go away

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,320
I will never let go

20
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,320
You are me

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,320
You are me

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,320
You are me

23
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
You are me

24
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,320
You are me

25
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
This restaurant looks good

26
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
General, would you like to sit down and rest?

27
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
Stop!

28
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
Don't run!

29
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,320
Sir, isn't this the Xiao Mei Palace in Bai Le Village?

30
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,320
Stop! Stop!

31
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,320
Don't kill me!

32
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,320
General!

33
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,320
Xiao Mei, how did you get in?

34
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,320
I don't know. Please forgive me!

35
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,320
Please forgive me! Please forgive me!

36
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,320
Ru Du, what's going on?

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,320
I'm asking you! What's going on?

38
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,320
You... you should have run over from the underground palace

39
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,320
You are still attracting people to the underground palace to make a trap?

40
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
Please forgive me!

41
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,320
There are too many things that I didn't manage to pass on

42
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,320
Hurry up and take her away!

43
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,320
Are you crazy?

44
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,320
Don't let me go! Don't let me go!

45
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,320
Don't let me go!

46
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,320
Ru Du, can you personally send her out?

47
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,320
No...

48
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,320
General, we really don't have a way out

49
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:55,320
The door to the palace is always full of people

50
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,320
We are at the entrance to receive them

51
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:00,320
There are doors that are closed. It's hard to go out

52
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,320
In my opinion,

53
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,320
why don't you leave this girl

54
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,320
to live in peace with us?

55
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,320
She is now in a state of shock and is not suitable for a single person

56
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,320
A'Qing, take her back to the General's mansion first

57
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
Okay

58
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
Let's go

59
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,320
It's okay. Don't worry

60
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Don't worry

61
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Let's go

62
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Wei Du, the ancient people are human

63
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
The people outside are also human

64
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,320
In the future, you are not allowed to use the lives of people to make a trap

65
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
Yes

66
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,320
Go and check

67
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,320
See if there are any outsiders who have been lured into the city with this girl

68
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
Yes, General

69
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,320
So you and my second father went into the palace and found it yourself?

70
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,320
Do you know that we are all worried about you?

71
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,320
You can't say that

72
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,320
We just want to find the Beecheng Pearl

73
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,320
But we didn't expect to meet a monster

74
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
We were confused and were taken in

75
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,320
You can pull it down

76
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,320
You think the palace is suspicious

77
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,320
What's the result?

78
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
Send it yourself

79
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,320
What are you talking about?

80
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
I looked everywhere

81
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
I didn't find it

82
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:46,180
I found those

83
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
It's convenient

84
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
Is it convenient?

85
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Did you find it?

86
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,320
It will be found soon

87
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Master, you didn't find it, but my master found it

88
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,320
I found that every soldier here has that kind of mark

89
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
Really?

90
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,320
Absolutely true

91
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,320
I have confirmed it with Da Hai

92
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,320
Does that mean that your mother's death was done by the people under Lu Yan?

93
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,320
There is no concrete evidence yet

94
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,320
Let's not act rashly and investigate

95
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,320
It must be that deputy general Zhu Rong

96
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,320
You are in danger

97
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,320
Father, father, calm down

98
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
If they really killed my mother's murderer

99
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,320
I will definitely not spare them

100
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
It's just that we haven't found the evidence yet

101
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Don't act rashly and ruin Lu Yan's life

102
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:42,320
How about this?

103
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,320
You stay and go out with me

104
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,320
But the General's mansion is heavily guarded

105
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,320
It's too hard to go out

106
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Miss Yu

107
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Miss Yu, our deputy general invited you back to the room

108
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
I know

109
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,320
General, the person is here

110
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
What's the matter with the deputy general?

111
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
Miss Yu

112
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
Miss Yu

113
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,320
The general is going to hold a ceremony in a few days

114
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,320
You need to prepare some clothes

115
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,320
This is the best tailor in our capital

116
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,320
Let him give you two sets of clothes

117
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Okay, let's measure it

118
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
Yes

119
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,320
Deputy General Wei

120
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,320
What else?

121
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,320
Miss Yu

122
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,320
After the ceremony in the palace

123
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,320
I think there are a lot of things between us

124
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,320
You don't have to hide it anymore

125
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
This is to be honest

126
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,320
The one who came is not good

127
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,320
Deputy General Wei

128
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,320
I, Yu Deng Deng, have always been quick-tempered

129
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Say what you have

130
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
There is nothing to hide

131
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,320
Is it done?

132
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,320
Done

133
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,320
Leave

134
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Yes

135
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
Then I will tell the truth

136
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,320
I don't want our general to marry a woman from the forest

137
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
But given the general's deep love for you

138
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,320
And you have no memory of the past

139
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,320
So I can accept you to be the queen of our Shu

140
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Then I am really honored

141
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,320
But you need to take the responsibility of being the queen

142
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,320
Since you decide to marry the general

143
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,320
You have to forget that you are a spirit

144
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,320
Don't have any more wild ambitions of the spirit

145
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:04,320
If you live with the spirit again

146
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Use the power of the spirit

147
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Causing the people and soldiers in the city to be dissatisfied

148
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,320
Then our Shu State

149
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,320
Can't tolerate a queen like you

150
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,320
Even if the general comes out at that time

151
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Can't save you

152
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,320
I will respect you

153
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,320
Deputy General Wei, you think too much

154
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,320
I grew up eating grains

155
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,320
I never treated myself as a spirit

156
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
But still

157
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,320
To ensure that the future queen of Shu State will not make mistakes

158
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,320
I arranged a guard for you

159
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,320
I will follow your orders

160
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
Want to monitor me

161
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,320
For Lu Yan, I have to endure

162
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,320
Then thank you, Deputy General Wei

163
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,320
Thank you for your hard work

164
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
I just need a man

165
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,320
But I happen to have something unknown

166
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,320
Need to ask you

167
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,320
What is it

168
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
You say you

169
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
Say it out loud

170
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,320
This human and the spirit tribe are so clearly divided

171
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
But Lu Yan is a person

172
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,320
He is a person

173
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,320
He has the yuan of the spirit tribe in his body

174
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,320
You say he is a person or a spirit tribe

175
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,320
And we are so affectionate now

176
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,320
In the future, we will have a bunch of children

177
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Then you say these princes and grandsons

178
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Are they human or spirit tribe?

179
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
How do you think

180
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
It feels more like the blood of the spirit tribe

181
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Then you

182
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,320
Isn't it to be a king of the spirit tribe?

183
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Headache

184
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,320
It's so annoying

185
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
What can I do

186
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,320
Unreasonable

187
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
How dare you teach me a lesson

188
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
If it weren't for the head of the village

189
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,320
I have to give him a seven or eight

190
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,320
So angry

191
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,320
How can this be

192
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Yu Dangdang

193
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
So wild

194
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,320
Unreasonable

195
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,320
General Wei

196
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
General

197
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
What's up

198
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
The underground palace reported

199
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
The girl ran away before

200
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
The other two people who were in the same situation

201
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,320
Have been driven into the underground palace

202
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Then do we have to save people?

203
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Has it been sent in?

204
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,320
Forget it

205
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
Don't make a fuss about this

206
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,320
If the general asks

207
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,320
Just say that the girl has been sent out

208
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
understand

209
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
Where is the girl who escaped from the underground palace?

210
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
The general's people are personally settled

211
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
That girl probably hit the ghost

212
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,320
Scared

213
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,320
The general said that he should not disturb her

214
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
To support her

215
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
So

216
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,320
General is quite interested in this girl

217
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
General Wei

218
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Your general Wei just left

219
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
what

220
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,320
The guys came to train at my door

221
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,320
Miss Yu

222
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,320
General Wei ordered us

223
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,320
Protect you personally in the future

224
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
Such a big shock

225
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,320
Your general Wei really looks down on me

226
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,320
What are you doing

227
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,320
Who

228
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,320
This is going backwards

229
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Backward

230
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,320
Backward

231
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
This is this

232
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
This is

233
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,320
Ah, put my daughter as a woman in the general's house

234
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Or as a prisoner

235
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Oh, dad, you don't understand this

236
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Although the big family

237
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Not the east wind to suppress the west wind

238
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
It's the west wind to suppress the east wind

239
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
But I haven't entered the house yet

240
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
It's definitely not to suppress me

241
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
Is angry at me

242
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
Then according to what you said

243
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
Should thank you

244
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Your general Wei

245
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
Just send you guys

246
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
To protect the future queen

247
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
How about this

248
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
You go find more people

249
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,320
It's best to transfer the house

250
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
Find me everything

251
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
I want to go out and look around

252
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,320
How can I have a card

253
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
What are you looking at each other

254
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Hurry up

255
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
Go go go

256
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,320
Yes

257
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
Hurry up

258
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Hurry up

259
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,320
Miss

260
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
What kind of weapon do you want to buy

261
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Our store is all high-quality good weapons

262
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,320
Take your best, most expensive

263
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
The most powerful Liangbin weapons

264
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Give me all

265
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
You are right

266
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
These are the best weapons in this store

267
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,320
We have long-term

268
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
There are advanced

269
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,320
Can attack and can defend

270
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
Which one do you like

271
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
How do you know

272
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
I like weapons

273
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,320
Wanted

274
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
And this this that

275
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
Take it all

276
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Yes yes yes

277
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
Guests go

278
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,320
Come again next time

279
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
The street ahead

280
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
It feels very rich

281
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Let's go and see

282
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
Come

283
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,320
A little general's mansion

284
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
Can stop our women's way

285
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,320
I'm out of a golden cicada

286
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Master is so smart

287
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,320
Think of a way to attack

288
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,320
Let us all out

289
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,320
You are too thief

290
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
The granduncle is full of small parties

291
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,320
Brother Zhao came to congratulate

292
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,320
It's the honor of our Liu family

293
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
You are welcome

294
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Is it a little new

295
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,320
Is it a golden cicada?

296
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,320
Congratulations

297
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
Thank you

298
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
Congratulations

299
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,320
Thank you

300
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
It looks good there

301
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
go

302
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
Find the treasure

303
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,320
This is a restricted area

304
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
No one is allowed to enter

305
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Am i anyone

306
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
I am your future queen

307
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,320
Miss Yu, this street has no stores

308
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
There is no store

309
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,320
There are no people living

310
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,320
You might as well go to that street

311
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
You all wait for me

312
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Wait for me to be the queen

313
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
Have your good fruit

314
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,320
Go

315
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,320
This ancient place is a big place

316
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,320
Why can't I see the border in the city?

317
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Is there any ancient way to support the city?

318
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,320
Come

319
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,320
Come

320
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,320
General

321
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,320
Where is the one who sent me tea?

322
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
I heard it was

323
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,320
Miss Yu transferred

324
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,320
Yu Deng Deng

325
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,320
Miss Yu said she wanted to go out to the city

326
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,320
Not enough line

327
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,320
So I transferred the soldiers in the house

328
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,320
Pulled all to the city

329
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,320
What did she do in the city?

330
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,320
News came from the front

331
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
Said she was in the city

332
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,320
News came from the front

333
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
Said she went to seven stores in total

334
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
Three households and four shops

335
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,320
And also put a chicken farm in a mess

336
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,320
But only buy and buy

337
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Not using the original art

338
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,320
Don't worry about her

339
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,320
such

340
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,320
The loss of the people

341
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,320
Let the butler check

342
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,320
Find a chance to reveal to the general

343
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
Go ahead

344
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
Go ahead

345
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,320
Not right

346
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,320
After leaving the house

347
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,320
I kept going north and never returned

348
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
Why did you go here again?

349
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,320
Is there a similar scene in a city?

350
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
Yes

351
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,320
There must be something strange in it

352
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,320
I have to take a good look

353
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,320
General Wei

354
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,320
General Wei

355
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,320
Huang Shi

356
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,320
Miss Yu insisted on playing hide-and-seek with the brothers on the street

357
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Then she took the opportunity to throw away all the brothers and ran away by herself

358
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,320
what

359
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,320
Find someone to follow her

360
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,320
Yes

361
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,320
I am here

362
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
Yu Dangdang

363
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
Don't enter here

364
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
My people are hiding inside

365
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,320
I'll keep looking

366
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
No, this is a forbidden area

367
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
No one is allowed to enter

368
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Why can't I enter if others can enter?

369
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
I tell you

370
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,320
If you don't let me in

371
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
I will tell you the general

372
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,320
All are sentenced to death

373
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
Step aside

374
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:24,320
Hurry up

375
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,320
Dare to do

376
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,320
Damn it

377
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,320
After being hit by that bug

378
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
Can't use it

379
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,320
Even less than before

380
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
Dangdang

381
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
Dad

382
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,320
Yes

383
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,320
Can

384
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,320
Did you find someone to go out?

385
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
Not yet

386
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,320
Let's go in and have a look

387
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
go

388
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,320
There she is

389
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,320
Come

390
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,320
Nothing

391
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,320
What are those soldiers doing?

392
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,320
Except here in the city

393
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
There are two entrances with soldiers guarding

394
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,320
I went in and took a look

395
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,320
Nothing

396
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,320
There must be something

397
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Just we haven't found it yet

398
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,320
Girl

399
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,320
Find a little lion

400
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,320
Go quickly

401
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,320
See it

402
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
Then I am here

403
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,320
Here

404
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,320
Here

405
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,320
Did you see

406
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
The location of these three entrances

407
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
And the hole in the ground

408
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
And the gap between us and the mountain

409
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
Five roads in the northeast, southwest and north

410
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
Are all connected

411
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
Is there anything special about this?

412
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,320
This is a formation

413
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,320
Formation

414
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Correct, this formation is called the guardian formation

415
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,320
This formation

416
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
I can't see where the formation is

417
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,320
So who can find this formation?

418
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,320
That is, the person who is not formation

419
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
He only knows where the formation is

420
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
He doesn't say anyone knows

421
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
So this formation

422
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Can only enter

423
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,320
Can't get out

424
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,320
Old fish

425
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,320
Didn't see it

426
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
You really have two blinds

427
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,320
Usually so unruly

428
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
You are really a big hunter

429
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
That's not it

430
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,320
Otherwise, how can I be your father?

431
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
But this formation can only enter

432
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,320
Can't get out

433
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,320
Is it the formation of the Wei Du tribe?

434
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
Impossible

435
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
I have observed Wei Du

436
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
Although this kid lives for a long time

437
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
But his body and body are ordinary people

438
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,320
And this formation is the formation of the Ling tribe

439
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
That needs to be able to support

440
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,320
But Wei Du hates the Ling tribe

441
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,320
How can he use the formation of the Ling tribe

442
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,320
To guard the capital

443
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Is he connected with Zhu Rong?

444
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,320
I haven't thought about this

445
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
That formation

446
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,320
Will Zhu Rong set it up?

447
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Very likely

448
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
But apart from the formation

449
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,320
I found one today

450
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,320
Very strange thing

451
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
I tried to go to the Bichen Pearl today

452
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
Pay attention to the source of energy

453
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,320
But I found that the Bichen Pearl

454
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
There is no ability to absorb or release energy

455
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
So Wei Du was deceived by Zhu Rong

456
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
Bichen Pearl can't release energy

457
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
What is it

458
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,320
Supporting the whole city of soldiers or soldiers

459
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
What is it

460
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,320
Supporting the whole city of soldiers

461
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,320
Lived for three thousand years

462
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
I guess it's that formation

463
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
Let Wei Du and others

464
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
Never leave the capital

465
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,320
Not Bichen Pearl

466
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,320
But that formation

467
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,320
If there is really a formation

468
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,320
How did we come in?

469
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
stupid

470
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
It means that thing is the same as the leather

471
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
Just can't get in

472
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
Today my father and I

473
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,320
Found a few doors to the outside

474
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
But these roads are usually closed

475
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
Must send the source of energy to open

476
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,320
This approach is similar to the ghost city

477
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,320
Sorry, I went to the kitchen to eat

478
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,320
The kitchen things are stinky

479
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,320
But i'm really hungry

480
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,320
I just ate a few bites

481
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,320
Now my stomach is a little uncomfortable

482
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,320
Sorry sorry

483
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,320
Lu Yan

484
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,320
I almost didn't even fight two soldiers today

485
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,320
Why don't we go to Wei Du now

486
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,320
Tell him that the existence of Bichen Pearl

487
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,320
There is no direct relationship with the lives of the whole city

488
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,320
Why don't you give it to me

489
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
He won't believe it

490
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,320
He will only think that we want to take Bichen Pearl

491
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,320
That's right

492
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,320
We really want to grab

493
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,320
That can't be grabbed

494
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
But he will face this sooner or later

495
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,320
Let me handle this

496
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,320
I will find a way to give you Bichen Pearl

497
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
After you get Bichen Pearl

498
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,320
Take your father and them away from this capital

499
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
I will also open the door in advance

500
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,320
What about you

501
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
I stayed behind

502
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,320
I

503
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,320
Don't worry

504
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,320
I will handle the things here as soon as possible

505
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
But i

506
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
I believe you

507
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,320
I also believe in your ability

508
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,320
You can handle it well

509
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
That's it

510
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,320
We are waiting for you in Bailu Village

511
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
You come back as soon as possible

512
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,320
correct

513
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
Xiaomei in Bailu Village

514
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
I don't know why I entered this capital

515
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
I was almost caught in the underground palace

516
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
Fortunately I met

517
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,320
Now I have him settled in the general's mansion

518
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,320
When you leave, take him with you

519
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
Don't worry, leave it to me

520
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,320
It's strange

521
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,320
strange

522
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,320
strange

523
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,320
It's really strange

524
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
What's weird

525
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,320
Not that

526
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,320
Just that Mao Ce is strange

527
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
I'll go to the toilet

528
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
I just watched someone go in

529
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,320
I said i'll wait there

530
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
Wait and wait

531
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,320
Waited for half a day, he didn't come out

532
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
I can't stand it

533
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,320
I said I'll go over and urge him

534
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,320
I just opened the door and I looked

535
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,320
This is fake

536
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,320
Nobody

537
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,200
I opened the door and saw that there was no one.

538
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,880
Did you run into evil?

539
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,600
Like what your master said, a monster?

540
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,920
Don't talk nonsense.

541
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,320
The monsters in the world

542
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,560
are played by the spirit clan.

543
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,080
What monster is that?

544
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,960
Da Hai, what time is it now?

545
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,160
It's just past midnight.

546
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,520
My father told me that he woke up in the middle of the night.

547
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,880
He met the same situation as you.

548
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,160
Someone went in, but no one came out.

549
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,200
He thought someone was watching us in the house.

550
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,720
Now it seems that it's not a spy.

551
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,440
But for another reason.

552
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,400
What do you think?

553
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,520
I'm afraid I'll scare you.

554
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,040
So I think you'd better not rush to drive me out of the city tomorrow.

555
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
Let me prove this guess first.

556
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,200
What's the guess?

557
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,240
Secret.

558
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,800
Seeing you in neighborhood is so ridiculous.

559
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:41,800
I heard that Mr. Lu temporarily citizens

560
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,760
took advantage of anti-inyag很多

561
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,000
his extinguishing skills fit my strength.

562
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,120
If I let you get out of my house,

563
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,920
no one can get out of here

564
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,200
Where do you think you are?

565
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,120
What are you up to?

566
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,360
Kidnap people.

567
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,040
You don't know judgment,

568
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,200
just act!

569
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,800
You two Image Deities?

570
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,320
You're incompetent.

571
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,640
From now on,

572
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,320
we're enemies.

573
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,960
If you dare to harass the criminal again,

574
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,240
don't blame me for being rude to you.

575
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,760
Lu Yan Yuan is strong.

576
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,800
You thought you could live

577
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,360
with him

578
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,480
and live without worries

579
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,200
when you held Master's legs.

580
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,200
Did you forget

581
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,440
that Lu Yan was going to return the yuan-pellet to Yu Deng Deng?

582
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,440
After returning the yuan-pellet,

583
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,160
he was

584
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,560
bound to die.

585
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,760
What?

586
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,040
What?

587
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,440
Your master didn't tell you?

588
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,240
It seems

589
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,720
he doesn't trust you that much.

590
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,600
He stayed

591
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,320
just to save his woman.

592
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,960
If you can catch Yu Deng Deng,

593
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,680
and send him to me,

594
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,280
maybe

595
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,040
I can consider

596
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,800
letting you know more truths

597
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,360
or

598
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
let your dream

599
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,160
last for a while.

600
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,200
You don't have to lie to me again.

601
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,760
Don't even think about it.

602
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,360
The temperature is hot.

603
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,120
Come on.

604
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,600
Now,

605
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,800
everything is planned.

606
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,560
When the loyal figure

607
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,120
rup it up,

608
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,080
Hodong,

609
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:41,080
the

610
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,500
Sure is three

611
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:41,960
Sure is five

612
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,520
s

613
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,200
The girl who brought the general back.

614
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,920
What's going on?

615
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,040
Go ask what happened.

616
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,080
What's going on with that girl?

617
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,520
General Wei sent her here.

618
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,680
She's so smart.

619
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,760
Take her out.

620
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,880
We...

621
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,400
I'll go by myself.

622
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,000
Sir,

623
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,000
they said General Wei sent her here.

624
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,880
I'll wake her up.

625
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,200
Wake up.

626
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:40,960
Sir,

627
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,800
this girl is unconscious.

628
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,080
are you okay?

629
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,160
She was just scared

630
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,000
I'm sorry.

631
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,400
Guards.

632
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,080
General.

633
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,720
Who built this sword?

634
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,920
Most of the soldiers in the mansion

635
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,040
are from the Iron Generals of Duanbi, the south of the city.

636
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,560
General always uses his sword.

637
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,280
Okay, I see.

638
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:17,800
You may leave.

639
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,320
Yes.

640
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,520
Sir, the master wants to see you.

641
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,480
He wants you to come with him.

642
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,600
What's up?

643
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,120
What's wrong with you today?

644
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,360
What do you mean?

645
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,640
You haven't laid the bed for me.

646
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,040
Didn't you lay the bed

647
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,000
well?

648
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,400
Others don't like it.

649
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,640
What are you laughing at?

650
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,160
Nothing, sir.

651
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,760
Did A Xin say something to you?

652
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,000
She said you asked a girl

653
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,760
to sleep in your room.

654
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,680
Wei Du thought it was her idea.

655
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,400
And you know that girl.

656
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,280
She's the girl who helped us

657
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,520
in the Bailu Village.

658
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,200
Why are you so nervous?

659
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,240
Why do you explain so much?

660
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,400
I don't blame you.

661
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:28,840
A Xin.

662
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,520
Go tell Wei Du

663
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,040
that General Lu

664
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,480
will stay with me tonight

665
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,920
and let him down.

666
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,720
Okay.

667
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:38,360
By the way,

668
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,840
tell Peng Da Hai

669
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,040
not to talk to my father.

670
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,760
I'll go now.

671
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,400
Go.

672
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,360
You're mine.

673
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,400
I don't care

674
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,440
what others think of you.

675
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,520
I can't think of you.

676
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,360
What are you doing?

677
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,320
Why do you say that?

678
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,080
What? Why?

679
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,760
Well,

680
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,320
I have to ask General Yan

681
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,520
if I'm wrong.

682
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,720
No, you're not.

683
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,640
You're right.

684
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,080
Right?

685
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,800
It's late.

686
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,520
Go to sleep.

687
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,440
Why are you standing there?

688
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,240
Go to sleep.

689
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,320
He has kept a bullshit lie to you.

690
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,640
You're so fast-witted.

691
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,760
I'm sorry.

692
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,480
Yes, you should.

693
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,560
I didn't spicy it up for you.

694
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,480
No need.

695
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,120
Let's end it here.

696
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,640
Why are you so hurt to me?

697
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,960
I'm being able to drink theagement despondent.

698
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,280
What's wrong with that?

699
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,120
If it wasn't for that monster,

700
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,720
I would've killed you.

701
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,960
Really?

702
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,040
Do you remember

703
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:23,800
the first time we were on the same bed?

704
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,800
Xia Liu!

705
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,920
You're really thinking too much.

706
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,360
Since you're here,

707
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,240
why don't you kiss me first?

708
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,320
Go down.

709
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:43,960
No, I won't.

710
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:44,960
Why should I?

711
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,720
You sent me here yourself.

712
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,080
You only allowed the officials to set the fire,

713
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,360
not the people to light the lamps.

714
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,840
I thought I was dreaming.

715
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,800
I only realized it later.

716
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,600
It's not real to dream.

717
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,640
I only realized it later.

718
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,360
You actually knocked me out.

719
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,200
I didn't knock you out.

720
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,640
Then why did I suddenly faint?

721
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:20,080
I don't know.

722
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,000
Stop pretending. It must be you.

723
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,120
It's really not me.

724
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,760
All right, all right.

725
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,680
Let's not talk about this.

726
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:30,960
By the way,

727
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,200
what are you going to prove tomorrow?

728
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,200
In my heart,

729
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,520
I'm destined to fall in love with you.

730
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,600
You want to know?

731
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,960
If you want to know,

732
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,840
then you can use a secret to change it.

733
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,200
What secret?

734
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,120
A secret about you

735
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,720
that I don't know.

736
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,800
I don't have a secret.

737
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,640
How can it be possible?

738
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,880
How about this?

739
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,240
Let me ask you.

740
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,080
Do you like your life 3,000 years ago

741
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:01,400
or your current life?

742
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,560
Why are you asking this?

743
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,680
Because I think

744
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,240
your general's mansion

745
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,680
is like a scholar.

746
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,000
The house is painted and inked.

747
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:12,840
So

748
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,600
you like

749
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,560
the art of painting and ink.

750
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,640
The general's mansion has always been like this.

751
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,720
They think it's my personal hobby.

752
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,120
I thought you, the general,

753
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,040
liked to see the sword in the sword box.

754
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,920
I don't like it

755
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,120
when there are too many swords in the sand.

756
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,120
Yes.

757
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:36,720
Then

758
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,080
why don't you be a prince

759
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,040
or an emperor?

760
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,880
Why do you have to go to war?

761
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,840
Because the Shu State needs a general

762
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,680
and a man who can lead the army to war.

763
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,080
If I could choose,

764
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,520
I would want to live a peaceful life.

765
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,280
You are not only a general,

766
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,680
but also a hero.

767
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,960
The emperor only fights for his country.

768
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,560
In my heart,

769
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,000
a hero

770
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,040
fights for everyone.

771
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,000
How about this?

772
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,720
When we get back to the Qingquan Village,

773
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,880
I'll make you a yard like this,

774
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,200
so you can live a peaceful life

775
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,560
with no ink and ink.

776
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:33,720
Okay.

777
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,000
Thank you.

778
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,440
How can you just say thank you?

779
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,680
How about...

780
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,760
What do you want?

781
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,800
Forget it. I won't force you.

782
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,000
I'm just kidding.

783
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,200
I'll tell you my discovery.

784
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,320
Actually,

785
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,040
I have a discovery, too.

786
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,360
If love can be touched,

787
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:12,440
the necklace will have a sound.

788
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,760
The most beautiful scenery in life

789
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,800
is all about you.

790
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,200
When two hearts are close together,

791
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,600
when the whole world is occupied by you,

792
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,320
I will call for you with all my strength

793
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:44,440
until I get your memory.

794
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,400
You are the only one

795
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:57,320
who can walk into the scenery.

796
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,000
The rain falls and the leaves fall.

797
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,120
The clouds are separated from the love.

798
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:08,840
I hide my heart

799
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,200
and make a decision for you.

800
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,920
When two hearts are close together,

801
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,440
when the whole world is occupied by you,

802
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:43,240
I will call for you with all my strength

803
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,240
until I get your memory.

804
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,280
You are the only one

805
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,920
who can walk into the scenery.

806
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,840
The rain falls and the leaves fall.

807
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,080
The clouds are separated from the love.

808
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:12,040
I hide my heart

809
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,800
and make a decision for you.
