1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,080
Don’t talk.

3
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,160
Why are you still joking?

4
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,640
Nonsense!

5
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,320
When did this happen?

6
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,640
Not long ago.

7
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,440
You needn’t hold on.

8
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,400
Those chieftains,

9
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,040
I guess, are just like me.

10
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,160
Lu Yan

11
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,479
you knew I would rot

12
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,160
and die,

13
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,280
right?

14
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,400
In fact

15
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,600
you all knew that.

16
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,200
But you all kept it from me.

17
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,520
Right?

18
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,880
Are you my real friends?

19
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,960
I’m going to

20
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,440
kill all those monsters from the spirit clan!

21
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,160
Gu Beixi.

22
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:39,960
Xin, Chang,

23
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,440
follow him!

24
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,520
-Okay.
-Okay.

25
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,280
Why is there so little energy today?

26
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,120
It’s my fault.

27
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,840
I underestimated that girl from Qingquan Stronghold.

28
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,000
I didn’t succeed.

29
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,800
Please give me one more chance.

30
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,640
I will take her essence

31
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,760
to replenish your energy.

32
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,480
If I hadn’t been traumatized by Lu Yan 3,000 years ago,

33
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,160
I would not have to

34
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,640
rely on your energy

35
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,160
to keep me alive.

36
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,680
Get out of the way!

37
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,560
You’re just a human.

38
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,880
How dare you get an energy core?

39
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,760
Give it back to me!

40
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,000
You can’t kill me.

41
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,040
You can’t even touch my real body!

42
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,240
Kill me?

43
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,480
So ridiculous!

44
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,680
Gosh!

45
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,680
This sword was given to you for Yun Xi.

46
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,640
If he hadn’t pierced my chest with his sword,

47
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,400
I wouldn’t be in this state.

48
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,880
Please do not be angry, master.

49
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:02,960
Angry?

50
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,920
I’m not angry.

51
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,360
That girl, with the saintess’ energy core,

52
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,440
is at my fingertips.

53
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,200
If I take her energy core,

54
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,560
I will be able to revive the saintess again.

55
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,200
By then, nine continents

56
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,960
will be the domain of the spirit clan.

57
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,360
That’s right!

58
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,120
Lu Yan,

59
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,400
I will make you kneel at my feet once more

60
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,920
and suffer

61
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,840
the pain of losing everything again.

62
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,560
That’s it.

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:49,920
Stop.

64
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,640
A little longer.

65
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,159
Forget it.

66
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,040
It makes no sense.

67
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,760
So is this the legendary transfer of internal energy?

68
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,560
I thought it was only in martial arts fictions.

69
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,480
Save your vital energy.

70
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,520
Don’t waste it on me.

71
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,440
What if that monster does come?

72
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,560
What will happen then?

73
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,840
You can’t rely on me, an old lady.

74
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,160
You’re still in a joking mood?

75
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,280
With a big shot like you around,

76
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,760
what do I have to fear?

77
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:34,760
A big shot?

78
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,600
Mr. Bu just called you General Yan

79
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,400
and you have so many supernatural powers.

80
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,560
I can tell

81
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,200
you’re not an ordinary person.

82
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,040
If you don’t want to tell me,

83
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,640
I won’t ask you.

84
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,320
But I’ve made up my mind

85
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,200
that even if you are a spirit clansman,

86
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,480
I’m sure

87
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,400
you wouldn’t hurt me.

88
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,600
All right, stop talking.

89
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,400
Here you are.

90
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,360
Eat something to restore your strength.

91
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,120
Glutinous rice cake?

92
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,880
We’re in the wilderness,

93
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,360
so where did you buy them?

94
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,080
Lu Yan,

95
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:02,120
you’ve been protecting me since the day before the wedding.

96
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,600
Just now,

97
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,680
you even saved me at the risk of your life.

98
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,240
Can it be that...

99
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,280
You like me, do you?

100
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,080
Why didn’t you say it earlier?

101
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,680
I’m a very loyal person.

102
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,600
If you behave well,

103
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,120
you might be my real husband.

104
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,520
I’m just kidding.

105
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,080
If I die young,

106
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,799
you’ll be a widower, won’t you?

107
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,480
So you shouldn’t like me.

108
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,160
In that case,

109
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,120
tonight

110
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,520
is the first night

111
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,520
we’ve been together.

112
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,960
I finally understand

113
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,760
what each moment of joy on the night is worth is.

114
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,880
It seems that the two of us

115
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,440
have grown old together, right?

116
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,440
If I die,

117
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,840
could you

118
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,320
spare two or three years

119
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,320
to help me manage the Qingquan Stronghold?

120
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,360
Dahai is reckless,

121
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,040
while my uncle is getting older.

122
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,520
Many people in the stronghold have no home nor property.

123
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,680
We’re so poor.

124
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,600
I worry about them.

125
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,680
Don’t think about it.

126
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,840
I won’t let you die.

127
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,520
Lu Yan,

128
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,480
why are you so kind to me?

129
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,000
You’re so rich

130
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
and handsome.

131
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,960
You have a house, a palanquin and so many fortunes.

132
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,120
So why are you willing to stay in our stronghold?

133
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,160
We’re so poor,

134
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,760
with a bunch of old and sick people.

135
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,480
You’re not after me, are you?

136
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,680
I’m after one thing from your stronghold.

137
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,560
What is it?

138
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,720
Bones of Ying Dragon in Yu’s ancestral temple.

139
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,640
Bones of Ying Dragon?

140
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,200
That’s

141
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,160
the bones of the ancient spirit clan.

142
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,320
Okay.

143
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,560
We have no use for it.

144
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,040
That’s my gift for you.

145
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,920
So...

146
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,120
What I asked you to do...

147
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,160
You mean taking care of those in Qingquan Stronghold?

148
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,280
It’s your business.

149
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,160
If you worry about them,

150
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,480
you must keep alive

151
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,960
and return to your stronghold safely.

152
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,920
Don’t say such discouraging words.

153
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,040
Okay.

154
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,840
Sir,

155
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,200
Gu Beixi has disappeared.

156
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,440
From the places he passed by,

157
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,880
I can smell the blood of the spirit clan.

158
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,400
Now Chang is on guard.

159
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,560
I’ll go look for him.

160
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,080
No.

161
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
Stay here and rest.

162
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,680
I’ll go.

163
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,760
Xin,

164
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,520
take care of her.

165
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,400
No problem.

166
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,120
Be careful.

167
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,880
Come back safely.

168
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,680
Get up.

169
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,280
Let’s sit over there.

170
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,720
Don’t worry.

171
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,360
Mr. Lu will definitely

172
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,200
bring Gu Beixi back.

173
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,040
You’re back!

174
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Where’s Mr. Lu?

175
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,920
Mr. Lu?

176
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,800
I got lost in the woods.

177
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,440
I didn’t see Mr. Lu.

178
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,040
Gu Beixi,

179
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,800
I remember

180
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,360
when I was a child,

181
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,400
you and your father

182
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,040
came to play in our stronghold

183
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,960
where I cut all your hair.

184
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,640
When I recall it now,

185
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,120
I feel so sorry.

186
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,040
It’s okay.

187
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,560
I’ve forgotten it.

188
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,960
How could you forget

189
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,720
our feuds?

190
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,880
Actually, back then,

191
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,200
you were the one who shaved all my hair.

192
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,280
You were beaten up

193
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,920
by your father for a day and a night.

194
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,080
Xin, are you okay?

195
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,480
I didn’t know you’re protected

196
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,440
by both the gun and defensive barrier.

197
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,520
Your two men really care about you.

198
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,480
Where’s Gu Beixi?

199
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,280
Gu Beixi?

200
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,280
I’m Gu Beixi.

201
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,440
Beixi! Beixi!

202
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,120
Gu Beixi.

203
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,080
Gu Beixi, wake up!

204
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,600
Who are you?

205
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,240
Why does your blood have the power to suppress the spirit clan?

206
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,160
Have a guess.

207
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,520
I’ll tell you if you can catch me.

208
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,080
Poor human,

209
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,120
do you think you can escape?

210
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,960
I’m not going to escape.

211
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,200
As long as I can drive you

212
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,120
out of Gu Beixi.

213
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,480
I knew you’d come.

214
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,960
Lu Yan, watch out!

215
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,200
He’s going to take advantage of the glare to poison you

216
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,720
This is the reaction speed of a human?

217
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,800
Let go! Let go!

218
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:16,880
Let go!

219
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,520
-What's going on? -I don't know.

220
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,880
Let’s go and have a see.

221
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,480
Let us out!

222
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,120
Your hand.

223
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,840
Hold on.

224
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,440
It doesn’t hurt.

225
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,960
You’re too cruel to yourself.

226
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
It must be painful.

227
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,840
I just wanted to try it.

228
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,280
My father said

229
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,080
my blood can deal with the spirit clan.

230
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,680
And it’s true.

231
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,200
What do you think?

232
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,080
Do I have some kind of

233
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,320
special origin?

234
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,480
Could I be

235
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,280
the reincarnation of Sun Wukong

236
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,640
or

237
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,000
God Erlang?

238
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,520
Just don’t be Tang Monk.

239
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,560
Or the demon will eat you.

240
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,440
Mr. Lu.

241
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,160
Don’t you think so, Aunt Lu?

242
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
You’re back!

243
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,640
Chieftain Gu,

244
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,520
you only wake up after the fight has ended.

245
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,640
You’ve done me a great favour.

246
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,560
I’m not the only one who’s in deep sleep.

247
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,800
He was my company.

248
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,160
All right,

249
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,320
Let’s go home.

250
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,960
Yes, go home.

251
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,720
Sweetheart,

252
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,400
don’t be so sad.

253
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,840
He’s already gone.

254
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,160
I’m just thinking of my mother.

255
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,880
Mr. Ya was killed,

256
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,160
but I can hold an elaborate funeral

257
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,400
and pay tribute to him.

258
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,240
My father said my mother was buried in her hometown,

259
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,560
but he didn’t tell me where she was buried.

260
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,320
I didn’t even have the chance

261
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,440
to mourn her.

262
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,560
This is a sad story for your father.

263
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,400
He was afraid that you

264
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,480
would be sad with him.

265
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:39,960
Uncle,

266
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,360
you’ve known my father for so long

267
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,320
and seen me grow up.

268
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,520
You must know my mother, right?

269
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,080
How did she die?

270
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,640
I heard it from your father

271
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,720
that when you were little,

272
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,120
he was always out hunting.

273
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,560
One day, a group of outlaws came to your village

274
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,680
to kill anyone they saw.

275
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,920
And they were looking for girls as young as two or three years old

276
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,080
to take them away.

277
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,280
Your mother hid you from them at the risk of her life.

278
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,080
When your father came back,

279
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,920
except you,

280
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,400
all villagers

281
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,520
were killed.

282
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,800
Were they looking for me?

283
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:22,800
And...

284
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:23,840
Why can my blood

285
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,480
hold off the spirit clan?

286
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,320
There’s a reason

287
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,840
for that.

288
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,120
Do you remember you were ill

289
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,320
when you were three or four years old?

290
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,080
Yes, I do.

291
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,280
You told me

292
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,760
my father caught a bird from the mountain.

293
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,800
I ate that bird from the spirit clan

294
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,120
and it cured me.

295
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,600
That’s why I’m so strong.

296
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,800
Yes, there’s something special about your blood.

297
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,040
It has something to do with that bird.

298
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,240
Anyway, you...

299
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,440
Don’t think about it.

300
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,600
It’s a blessing to be back safely.

301
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,920
Mr. Ya, may you rest in peace.

302
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:25,960
Boss,

303
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,240
the carriage to Qingyun Temple is ready.

304
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,360
It’ll be a long journey.

305
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,640
Do you have to go there yourself?

306
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,120
You can ask a subordinate to go instead of you.

307
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,840
You can’t invite a great spirit-hunter

308
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,840
as Master Huangxuan to come.

309
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,080
I must invite him myself.

310
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,600
Guard Qingquan Stronghold

311
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,000
before I come back.

312
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,360
Pay special attention to Lu Yan

313
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,400
and the little boy.

314
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,440
Got it.

315
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,240
Now our spies are in the Qingquan Stronghold.

316
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,360
Don’t worry. There are people

317
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
watching him for 24 hours a day.

318
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,000
Lu Yan,

319
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,200
sooner or later, I will find out your true identity.

320
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,960
Normally,

321
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,200
you can go to Yuxiang Garden if you want to see me.

322
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,480
But you asked someone to invite me.

323
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,400
Now

324
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,120
all the people in the stronghold know it.

325
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,120
If you don’t come to Gongbao Garden,

326
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,440
you will have no chance

327
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,920
to watch the flowers that blossom tonight properly.

328
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,520
Go up and take a look.

329
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,360
So beautiful.

330
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,920
Previously, I was busy preparing forthe wedding and catching the murderer.

331
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,360
I didn’t notice that

332
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,240
this old tree was blooming.

333
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,360
So fragrant.

334
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,480
Under such circumstances,

335
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,880
would a gift

336
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,400
make a handsome man happy?

337
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,880
Bone of Ying Dragon.

338
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:14,840
This is for you.

339
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,520
Thank you.

340
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,640
You are welcome.

341
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,520
I'm a man of my words.

342
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,600
Even if you want a star in the sky,

343
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,880
I will pick it for you.

344
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,160
But

345
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,600
the old bone of the monster is stinky and hard.

346
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,960
What do you want to do with it?

347
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,760
There’s nothing I want to do.

348
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,880
Nothing you want to do?

349
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,000
Being all so mysterious.

350
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,480
Well, Aunt Lu,

351
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,720
I’ve given you a gift.

352
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,320
Won’t you give me

353
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,520
something in return?

354
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,080
Wait a minute.

355
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,760
The gift I want to give you

356
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,160
is in this palanquin.

357
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,160
Go inside and take a look.

358
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,400
Is it that palanquin from before?

359
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,480
Yes.

360
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,960
I saw this snowfall when I was little.

361
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,720
I made that snowman.

362
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,040
How did you create this?

363
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,000
Come on. Take a look.

364
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:37,840
I lived in that house

365
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,360
when I was a child.

366
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,720
I made this snowman when I was little.

367
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,520
My mother made this scarf.

368
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,680
And

369
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,640
I took this carrot

370
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,160
which was from the food

371
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,680
for the fat rabbits of our family.

372
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,280
Mum,

373
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,760
tell me another story.

374
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,320
Okay. After I add more firewood,

375
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,680
I will tell you a story

376
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,560
about a monkey and a rabbit.

377
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,240
It’s snowing.

378
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,320
It’s snowing.

379
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,680
Are you Dengdeng?

380
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,280
Are you coming to ask us to repay the gambling debt?

381
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,800
My father is not Paralyzed Yu.

382
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,240
I know.

383
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,480
Your father told you that

384
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,680
when a stranger came to your house,

385
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,800
you should say that your surname was Lin.

386
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,520
In fact, it is your mother’s surname.

387
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,240
Your father also told you

388
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,000
to protect your mother

389
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,520
when you grew up.

390
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,840
How do you know that?

391
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:51,880
Dengdeng,

392
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,960
your father was right.

393
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,000
You should protect your mother.

394
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,720
You should behave yourself.

395
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,880
Don’t be fastidious about food.

396
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,400
The most important thing is that

397
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,200
you should not say again

398
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,520
that your mother doesn’t love you.

399
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,840
If she hears it, she will feel sad.

400
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:06,840
In fact,

401
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,560
she loves you most dearly.

402
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,160
Also,

403
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,640
don’t be naughty.

404
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,680
She had to look for you in the village

405
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,160
under the scorching sun at noontime.

406
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,040
Your mother’s legs often ache.

407
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,680
Don’t always ask her to carry you on her back.

408
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,080
I didn’t.

409
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,200
Behave yourself and be filial to your mother.

410
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,800
She loves the Dandong Azalea bush in front of the gate most.

411
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
You should not pick those flowers.

412
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,280
You must look after these flowers for your mother.

413
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,320
Do you understand?

414
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,960
I see.

415
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,480
Have you finished your words?

416
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,720
Dengdeng.

417
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,040
Dengdeng.

418
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,400
Mum.

419
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:47,880
What are you doing?

420
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,960
This lady is very strange.

421
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,040
She must have no mother.

422
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,840
How can you talk like that?

423
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,520
She doesn’t go home in such a cold weather.

424
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,320
Girl,

425
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,080
it’s a snowy day.

426
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,720
Why do you stand here alone?

427
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,680
Your clothes are so thin.

428
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,640
Look, look,

429
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,640
your hands are icy cold.

430
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,920
It will snow more and more heavily.

431
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,360
It will get colder and colder.

432
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,680
You should quickly go home.

433
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,200
Your parents must be waiting for you to go back.

434
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,880
I don’t know

435
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,160
why I’m here all of a sudden.

436
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,320
Wear this

437
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,440
on your neck.

438
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,720
You will get warmer.

439
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,480
Girl,

440
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,600
what’s the matter with you?

441
00:29:59,120 --> 00:29:59,960
Nothing.

442
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,200
Go home quickly then.

443
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,960
Dengdeng, let’s go.

444
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,320
Go back quickly.

445
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,400
Please wait.

446
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,560
This village is not safe.

447
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,880
Quickly leave this place with her.

448
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,400
What are you talking about, girl?

449
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,760
This is my home.

450
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,680
Did you remember what I said?

451
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,560
This place is dangerous. Leave here quickly.

452
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:29,880
Okay.

453
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,360
I remember.

454
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,760
Thank you, girl.

455
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,960
When my child grows up,

456
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,760
I will be happy

457
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,160
if she is as beautiful and kind as you.

458
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Go home quickly.

459
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,920
Dengdeng, let’s go.

460
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,960
My father told me

461
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,880
about my mother.

462
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,120
I was very naughty when I was little.

463
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,840
I had no chance

464
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,920
to say sorry to my mother.

465
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,600
Now I have no such an opportunity.

466
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,000
I can only

467
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
create a dreamworld for you.

468
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,240
I haven’t had

469
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,280
such a beautiful dream for a long time.

470
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,640
Thank you,

471
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,000
Lu Yan.

472
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,400
What shall I do?

473
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,240
You are always so kind to me.

474
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,240
I feel I really can’t leave you

475
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,520
in the future.

476
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,160
Sir,

477
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,520
there will be a full moon tomorrow night.

478
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,360
After you get the bone of Ying Dragon,

479
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,800
you should remember to leave
the stronghold with Yu Dengdeng.

480
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,840
In any case, don’t be soft-hearted.

481
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,440
There will be a full moon tomorrow night.

482
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,240
I heard there would be

483
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,480
a lantern show in the town.

484
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,720
Shall we go down the mountain

485
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,240
and visit the lantern show?

486
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:07,760
Are you asking me out?

487
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,880
Yes.

488
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:12,840
Enlightened.

489
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,040
All right. I’ll accept the invitation

490
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,760
even though I don’t go down
the mountain in normal times.

491
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,199
But I can risk my life

492
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,159
to accompany you.

493
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,760
Watch him. I’ll report to our boss.

494
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,640
Okay.

495
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,440
Stop.

496
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,720
Boss.

497
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,360
Boss.

498
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,640
Did anything happen to Dengdeng?

499
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,360
No.

500
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,840
Our men are watching what’s happening.

501
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,040
There is something very strange.

502
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:02,960
I’m not sure about it.

503
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,240
We have to invite

504
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,160
Master Huangxuan to take a look.

505
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,000
This... This...

506
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,440
This...

507
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,720
This is a spirit-gathering formation

508
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,160
used by the spirit clan to gather spirit.

509
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,520
Spirit-gathering formation.

510
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,040
What if it is used to attack a man?

511
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,200
The man is doomed to die.

512
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,520
Lu Yan really wants to kill Dengdeng.

513
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,720
Master, is there a way to break the formation?

514
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,280
To tell the truth,

515
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
there can be a way to break the spirit-gathering formation

516
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,000
if it is controlled by

517
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,200
an ordinary spirit clansman.

518
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,200
But this formation

519
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,280
is based on the bone ashes of ancient spirit clansmen.

520
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,600
The man who is controlling it is very powerful.

521
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,280
The formation can’t be broken.

522
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,400
Even you can’t break it?

523
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,960
My strength is limited.

524
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:07,360
I’m in my seventies.

525
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,000
I don’t want to get into the trouble.

526
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,880
But now

527
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,400
I can tell you

528
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,680
a way to save her life.

529
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,360
He should

530
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,240
never step into the formation.

531
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,400
Fine.

532
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,480
Thank you all the same.

533
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,520
Wan Lishan,

534
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,240
prepare some incense and the carriage.
Send Master back to the temple.

535
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,040
Yes.

536
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,760
There is something I can give you.

537
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,440
Mr. Gu,

538
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,560
have you brought any bullets with you?

539
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,240
Bullets? Bullets?

540
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,120
Thank you.

541
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,080
Come again if you like it.

542
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,960
Excuse me. Excuse me.

543
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,280
Dengdeng.

544
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,200
Gu Beixi, what are you doing?

545
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,280
What’s wrong? Why are you wearing that mysterious look?

546
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:10,560
I’ve come to save your life.

547
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,160
Nonsense.

548
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,160
Dengdeng,

549
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,640
Lu Yan is not an ordinary man.

550
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,360
He is a spirit clansman.

551
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,240
Even if he is a spirit clansman, I will still marry him.

552
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:17,880
Goodbye.

553
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,080
Yu Dengdeng,

554
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,480
can you let me finish my words?

555
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,520
These are the bullets consecrated by Master Huangxuan.

556
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,280
There are four in total.

557
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,200
We each take two bullets.

558
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,600
If you are unwilling to kill him,

559
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,440
I’ll do it.

560
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,120
Stop wagging your tongue.

561
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,040
Leave me alone.

562
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,720
Yu Dengdeng,

563
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,120
have I ever cheated you?

564
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,360
His subordinate

565
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,040
is at the riverbank

566
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,080
and has formed a spirit-gathering formation.

567
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,240
They intend to kill you.

568
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,520
If it won’t happen,

569
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,600
you may think I’m talking nonsense.

570
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,640
But think about it carefully.

571
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,360
Will he take you

572
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,920
to the riverbank tonight?

573
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,960
Gu Beixi, my father

574
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,320
can make up a better story than you.

575
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,280
You just don’t want

576
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,480
to see me live a good life, do you?

577
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,200
Remember to use the gun.

578
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,400
Are you out of your mind?

579
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,120
Sorry to keep you wait.

580
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,680
It’s for you.

581
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,840
What is it?

582
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
Brown sugar glutinous rice cake.

583
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,320
Let me tell you,

584
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,120
it’s very difficult to buy brown sugar glutinous rice cakes from this stall.

585
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,000
He only sells them on the fifteenth day of each lunar month.

586
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,800
The surface of the brown sugar glutinous rice cake is crispy.

587
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,160
There are honey beans inside it.

588
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,440
In our town, we also call them honeyed glutinous rice cake.

589
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,080
If a couple eats them,

590
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,640
their love will be sweet and will never change.

591
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,240
I don’t want it.

592
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:45,920
You don’t have appetite now?

593
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,040
Alright. Then I'll just put it

594
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,240
in my arms

595
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,480
to keep it warm.

596
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:51,880
You can eat it when you want to.

597
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,760
Sir,

598
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,320
the full moon will disappear very soon.

599
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,200
Ying Dragon ashes have been used up.

600
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,720
This is our only chance.
