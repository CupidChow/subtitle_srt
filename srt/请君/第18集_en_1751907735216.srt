1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let go even if you leave me

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Because you're not me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Because you're not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Because you're not me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Because you're not me

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
General Yan

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Since you have to follow me

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Then you have to help

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What do you want to find

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
See if there is anything

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Can't touch by the forest tribe

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Eat, use, play

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
See if there is anything wrong

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
If you want to know this

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Ask the people around him

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I know

18
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Ask me

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I have the best relationship with auntie

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This gentleman, you should ask me

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Who are you two

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What are you doing

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I heard that there is a great shoe master at home

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I didn't expect it to be such a handsome gentleman

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'll ask the kitchen to make some soup for you

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Sister, the old man is going to dinner in your room tonight

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The soup in your kitchen

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Still left for the old man

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Third sister, aren't you going back to your mother's house today?

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What are you doing here?

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I said sister

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What do you mean

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Okay, okay, okay, okay

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Don't quarrel

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hurry up and talk about the situation of the little auntie

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You say first

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Master, look, the little auntie is missing

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Who knows if the next one will be me

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm afraid of being afraid every day

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's right, I'm so scared too

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Master, my heart is beating

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Master, look, people are so scared

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Master

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This case can't be investigated

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Master, it's fake, help me

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Bai Shiqi

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Miss Yu

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I didn't expect that we met on the mountain road

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Can still meet in my house

50
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm sorry

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Last time it was because I asked your father

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The result was a coincidence

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You are here

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Waiting for you

55
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Gu Beixi is looking for me

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Tell me you are his friend

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Want me to help you a little bit

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
So if you have anything in this house in the future

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Just find me

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Gu Beixi

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Gu Beixi this rascal

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I still have friends in India

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I remember

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Friends he said

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Could you be his

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Wife who has not been married

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It turned out to be you

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You are a Bai family

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He is so good at hiding

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Look at your high-pitched figure

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Is a beauty

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
That rascal is cheap

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't say that

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm not a beauty

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm not that bad

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Don't say that, Miss Yu

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Gu Beixi doesn't seem to want to marry me

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's me

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't be sad, let me tell you

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Gu Beixi that rascal

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Not worth your sadness

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He is not a normal person every day

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Shut up

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Like you, a lady

86
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Should find a person who is more suitable for you

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
No

88
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Miss Yu

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Can i ask you a question

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Ask

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The one who came into the house yesterday

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Is your husband

93
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You are married

94
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You are also a woman

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Actually

96
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
He is my second house

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Second house

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You are so young

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Second house

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's a long story

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But don't worry

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He has no evil intentions

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Just like me

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Come to handle the case

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
By the way, Miss Bai

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Now Gu Beixi

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He is still being wanted outside

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Your father should not know

109
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
His son-in-law

110
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Is a wanted criminal

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
If he finds out one day

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
There will be a lot of trouble

113
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I know, don't worry

114
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I will try my best to help him

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,420
I am not a

116
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,000
I won't let my father hurt him

117
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
And I will try my best to help you

118
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You are really righteous

119
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I like you too much

120
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Don't misunderstand

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Appreciate

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I like you too

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You are so cool

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What's going on

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Master

126
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Who is your master

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Then I will call you miss

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Don't care about what you call

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Why did you move Lu Yan's bed

130
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Into my room

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't think

132
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Sir needs a comfortable place at night

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Can't always sleep on the chair

134
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You eavesdrop on us

135
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No

136
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You don't know the nature of the gentleman

137
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
He can't bear to let you sleep on the floor

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
He must let you sleep on the bed

139
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He sleeps on the chair

140
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I ask you

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
When you moved the bed

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Did you attract the attention of others

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No, absolutely not

144
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
If you dare to expose

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Your identity as a neighbor

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If you cause trouble to me

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You know what the consequences are

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Don't worry

149
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What are the consequences

150
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The gentleman himself takes the responsibility

151
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Didn't the gentleman come back with you

152
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Ok

153
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The shadow is round and round

154
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Gently and gently bathed

155
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This Lu Yan

156
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Take advantage of his own self-esteem

157
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
A few points of self-esteem

158
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Three-way

159
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Three-way

160
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Why are you leaving

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Tell him what I said

162
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Bai Shijie

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Bai Shijie

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You are looking for Miss Yu

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'm looking for you

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I have something for you

167
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Is there a man called Lu Yan around Deng Deng

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
You said he was in the second room

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I said he lived in the inn

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Why is there no his figure

171
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Shijie

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You help me

173
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I want to pick up your father

174
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Qingquan Town

175
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Qingquan Town

176
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Gu Beixi

177
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's really you

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Not Chongming Chongxing

179
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Kid, let me ask you

180
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Are you the son of Gu Deshui?

181
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Yes

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Father-in-law

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Wait a minute

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Don't get close

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Who is your father-in-law

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You tell me

188
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
How to become a wanted criminal

189
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You've seen Yu Deng Deng

190
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
We were really wronged

191
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What's the matter

192
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Want to help him

193
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I actually want to help you

194
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Help me

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
OK

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll let you help me

197
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
But you have to know

198
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yu Deng Deng

199
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
He is a military commander

200
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Military command is also effective with me

201
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
If we can't catch the real murderer

202
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I am willing to be punished with him

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Row

204
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's a man

205
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
A man who is righteous

206
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You

207
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Get me back

208
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What are you hiding from

209
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Why do you say you hide from me

210
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I sent you so many letters

211
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No reply

212
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Not even a fart

213
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
What do you mean

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Father-in-law

215
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You may not know

216
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Qingquan Town has eight hills

217
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Each city is full of Lan Jun

218
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It must be some ignorant boy

219
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Stopped your letters

220
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I, Nanfeng Zhan

221
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I didn't receive a letter

222
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm a three-year-old child

223
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So many letters are all blue

224
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So coincidental

225
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Coincidence

226
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I didn't receive a single letter

227
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
OK

228
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
You can come

229
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Let Shi Qi arrange a room for you to rest

230
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Father-in-law

231
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I have one thing

232
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I want to ask you

233
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Can I meet the big miss of the Bai family

234
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Who

235
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The big miss of the Bai family

236
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
No, you saw a ghost

237
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
No

238
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Didn't Shi Qi bring you in just now

239
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Didn't you see it

240
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Isn't Shi Qi

241
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I said the big miss of the Bai family

242
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
My goodness

243
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So far

244
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You don't even know your own wife

245
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This stinky Lu Yan

246
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Call you Hua Xin

247
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Call me Hua Xin

248
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Day and night

249
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Fire

250
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Go

251
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What are you doing

252
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Don't bother me

253
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
My boxing is not finished yet

254
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What boxing is this

255
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Catch monsters and roll the earth

256
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Specially those

257
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Zhang Sanlu's flower-shaped radish

258
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
OK, you practice slowly

259
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What are you doing

260
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Practice with me

261
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Don't let me be serious

262
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
OK

263
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You also secretly practiced

264
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Locking the love

265
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Lu Yan

266
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What are you doing with magic

267
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
My boxing is not finished yet

268
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Don't make trouble

269
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Your boxing

270
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Just deal with me

271
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Don't go out to deal with others

272
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Easy to harm people and sisters

273
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You can deal with the old monster

274
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Isn't it a small thing to deal with others

275
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Row

276
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Don't you want to learn the magic of the spiritual clan

277
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
If you are a little bit obedient now

278
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'll teach you

279
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Be obedient

280
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I haven't paid you yet

281
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'm not a little bit obedient

282
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm not a little bit obedient

283
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm not a little bit obedient

284
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I haven't paid you yet

285
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You threaten me

286
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No, no, no

287
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Who told me to be the boss

288
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Bear with it

289
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The big picture is important

290
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Deal

291
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
it is good

292
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Miss Yu

293
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Miss Yu

294
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Our director said

295
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I gave you more people

296
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But this time

297
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Must be reduced by two points

298
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
In five days

299
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Catch the real murderer

300
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Find the little attitude of the director's home

301
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
what

302
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This director Bai is really a cunning old man

303
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What a coincidence

304
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I thought you were called Bai Shiqi

305
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Miss Shiqi of the Bai family

306
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I didn't expect you to be the big miss of the Bai family

307
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I know

308
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
After you know

309
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I must feel uncomfortable

310
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Maybe you will run away from me

311
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
But I still want to see you

312
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
So I didn't say

313
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What

314
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Even if you really treat me

315
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Miss Shiqi of the Bai family

316
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Then I like you

317
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It's not hard to see

318
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
No

319
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I didn't think about that at all

320
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I always treat you as a friend

321
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I didn't really blame you

322
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
And look

323
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You like Miss Yu

324
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But she doesn't know

325
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
And her husband

326
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I like you

327
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But you don't know

328
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
And there are girls I like

329
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I feel uncomfortable

330
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Quite clear

331
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Why didn't you find it before

332
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You are still sharp

333
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You didn't find me before

334
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm your fiancee

335
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But you must be careful in the future

336
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
If my father knew your little mind

337
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
He won't let you go

338
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Don't worry

339
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
After I help her

340
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I will make it clear to your father

341
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I hope you don't rush to get rid of me

342
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You can fight for it

343
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I can do it too

344
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
And you said it yourself

345
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's always a lifetime

346
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I also want to live with the person I like for a lifetime

347
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Let's go

348
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
My father arranged you in the southern garden

349
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Miss Yu lives in the western garden

350
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
If you want to find her

351
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
A little far

352
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Other victims

353
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Are wandering near the missing place

354
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,860
Maybe the little

355
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Little three-flower cat

356
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Little three-flower cat

357
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Do you think it will

358
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Like the other few

359
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You can control the cat secretly

360
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Right, little auntie

361
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You mean

362
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Little auntie controlled this cat

363
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Can you find her

364
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I try

365
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
That's the cat

366
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What's wrong, it doesn't work

367
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It seems to have some firewood in its body

368
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
No matter how many energies I inject

369
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
There is no response

370
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What to do

371
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I should have seen the two benefactors save me.

372
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,400
How did you become like this?

373
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,880
What's the matter with the missing cases in the city?

374
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,640
The people who disappeared in the city

375
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,400
are actually some spiritual ancestors.

376
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,600
The missing case

377
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,600
is the original three-dimensional ability of the spiritual ancestors.

378
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,920
They can only communicate with others

379
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,280
by controlling some animals.

380
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,000
Then why did you suddenly

381
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,520
become the first person to be killed?

382
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,440
I was the first person to be killed.

383
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,800
I was the first person to be killed.

384
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,000
I was the first person to be killed.

385
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,280
I was the first person to be killed.

386
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,480
Why did so many spiritual ancestors

387
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,000
suddenly become like this?

388
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,200
Some time ago,

389
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,480
a spirit worm that could increase the original power

390
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,080
suddenly appeared in the ghost city.

391
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,760
The nearby spiritual ancestors

392
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,880
were all exhausted.

393
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,640
At first,

394
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,400
the spirit worm entered our body.

395
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,080
It can help us to be more powerful

396
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,120
and change our powers.

397
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,880
But I never thought

398
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,960
that our body was getting weaker

399
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,320
and the spiritual sense was blurred.

400
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,760
The original power was dissipated.

401
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,920
The body gradually became transparent

402
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,360
and became desolate.

403
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,440
Many spiritual ancestors disappeared.

404
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:41,720
Only a few of us

405
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,760
could master the method

406
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,200
to continue to be in the animal body.

407
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,560
What the hell is this?

408
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:48,840
It's just like

409
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,520
the poison that kills people.

410
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,320
But, Yi Tai,

411
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,680
why did you

412
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,760
use that kind of thing?

413
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,080
Master likes me to be young and beautiful.

414
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,760
I'm afraid that one day

415
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,280
I will be old and handsome.

416
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,720
Do you know where the roots

417
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,240
of this spirit worm spread?

418
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,640
I bought it

419
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,000
in a restaurant in the ghost city.

420
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,360
As for

421
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,880
who the boss's boss is,

422
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,320
I'm an ordinary spirit

423
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,280
with no idea.

424
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,680
Lu Yan,

425
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,040
can you

426
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,960
remove the spirit worm

427
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,680
from his body first?

428
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,040
I'll try.

429
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,160
How is it?

430
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,000
This spirit worm

431
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,200
is made of the original power.

432
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,360
No matter how much energy I input,

433
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,960
I can't remove the spirit worm.

434
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,160
Moreover,

435
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,240
the original power will be absorbed and exhausted.

436
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,640
What the hell is this?

437
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,760
It can't be removed.

438
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,120
Is there really no way

439
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,160
to deal with it?

440
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,520
This worm

441
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,360
is not an ordinary spirit worm.

442
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,280
I'm afraid that

443
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,400
it's not a good thing.

444
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,320
It's just like the poison

445
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,360
that kills people.

446
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,200
It's just like the poison

447
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,160
that kills people.

448
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:08,920
I'm afraid that

449
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,360
if it continues to spread,

450
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,280
our spirit tribe will be...

451
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,880
I'm afraid...

452
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,480
I can't hold on anymore.

453
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,000
And you two,

454
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,280
please help us

455
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,560
find a solution.

456
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,600
Spirit worm

457
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,360
Spirit worms

458
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,960
absorb energy faster in their bodies.

459
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,960
I have to set a barrier

460
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,160
to help them delay.

461
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:06,840
Barrier?

462
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,200
Barrier

463
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,080
Barrier

464
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,040
Barrier

465
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,160
Barrier

466
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,280
Barrier

467
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,320
Barrier

468
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,520
Barrier

469
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,640
Barrier

470
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,760
Barrier

471
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,320
It's amazing.

472
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,400
This barrier

473
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,520
can help them

474
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,520
slow down the speed of the original power to be absorbed.

475
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,120
But

476
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,120
they can't leave this barrier.

477
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,720
Once they leave,

478
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,320
according to their current situation,

479
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,400
they can't hold on for more than two hours.

480
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,440
I understand.

481
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:38,760
Lu Yan,

482
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,920
can you teach me?

483
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,680
I want to help you.

484
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,960
You have Yunxi's spirit food in your body.

485
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,560
If you master it,

486
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,160
you should have the same effect.

487
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,080
Then teach me.

488
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,400
Come on.

489
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,600
Spirit worm

490
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,920
The heat spreads the light of the sun

491
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:22,120
Closer to you

492
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,480
Fish light, fish light.

493
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
You're good at

494
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,360
training dogs in the mountain.

495
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,720
Now you can

496
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,080
treat this lantern as a dog that can't be seen.

497
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,040
No problem.

498
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,200
Come on, try again.

499
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,520
Okay.

500
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,320
Feel the heartbeats

501
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,840
You're wrong from the beginning.

502
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,640
But the heart is awakened

503
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:49,400
Hear the sound of the sun

504
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,640
There's such a big difference?

505
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,640
I still want to hear it for many years

506
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,240
I still want to be with you

507
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,400
Because you and I don't want to escape from the dream

508
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,840
Turn around.

509
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,880
Turn around.

510
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,760
The light of the moon

511
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,760
I met you in the sea of people

512
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:17,000
You make me believe in fate

513
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:21,960
The dream of the destined

514
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,480
I must love you

515
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,280
I don't care about the future and the past

516
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,960
All remember

517
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,600
I want to be with you

518
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:46,280
Because you and I don't want to escape from the dream

519
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,480
Turn around.

520
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,760
Turn around.

521
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,320
The light of the moon

522
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:57,080
I met you in the sea of people

523
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,040
You make me believe in fate

524
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,760
Done.

525
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,000
This is so awesome.

526
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,200
So magical.

527
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,160
Lu Yan, I've thought about it.

528
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,120
Since I've learned how to grasp the original power,

529
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,720
I just need to practice.

530
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,400
I think I can do it well.

531
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,040
How about this?

532
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,400
I stay and take care of them.

533
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,440
You go to break your love.

534
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,120
Behind a successful woman

535
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,880
There must be a successful man.

536
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:24,840
I believe you.

537
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,240
No, Deng Deng.

538
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,200
You just learned it.

539
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,080
Don't worry.

540
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,040
I can.

541
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:30,920
Now the most important thing is

542
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,040
To save Peng Da Hai.

543
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,280
I beg you for the cleanliness of my apprentice.

544
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,280
All right.

545
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,280
If you have anything,

546
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,280
Remember to call me by the hairpin.

547
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,360
One escaped and another came.

548
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,720
You think I'm jealous?

549
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,560
Don't worry.

550
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,320
It will be fine soon.

551
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,280
Why?

552
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,560
Because there is a man named Lu Yan.

553
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:24,360
General Lu is very good at martial arts.

554
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,800
As long as he does it,

555
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,320
I will be very happy.

556
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,520
I will be very happy.

557
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,720
I will be very happy.

558
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,160
As long as he does it,

559
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,240
Can put the bad guys who set the bell to ring

560
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,000
All down.

561
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,280
Little Yi Tai.

562
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,280
Little Yi Tai.

563
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,160
Heroine.

564
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,600
Master Yu.

565
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,480
Come to work.

566
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,600
Master Yu.

567
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,040
You...

568
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,880
What's wrong with you?

569
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:02,600
Director Bai.

570
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,440
The deadline you set is not yet here.

571
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,080
You come here first to ask about it.

572
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,960
Master Yu.

573
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,960
Don't play with me.

574
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,640
You are looking for a hunter.

575
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,680
Just investigate the case like this.

576
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,520
If it weren't for my subordinate telling me,

577
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,440
The ghosts wouldn't believe it.

578
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,000
What chicken,

579
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,120
sheep,

580
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,000
pig,

581
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,760
And goose.

582
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,800
What?

583
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,640
You want to stay in my house?

584
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,600
What are you doing here?

585
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,720
Throw them all out.

586
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,520
Go.

587
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,720
Don't do that.

588
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,800
You are all stupid.

589
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,480
You are doing bad things to Director Bai.

590
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,240
Director Bai.

591
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,760
You are too impatient.

592
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,440
I haven't finished my words yet.

593
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,720
My kindness

594
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,720
is also wronged by you.

595
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,640
What do you mean?

596
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,560
These animals

597
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,600
are the evidence that you have solved the missing person case.

598
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,640
These animals are the evidence.

599
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,600
Tell me.

600
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,360
I told you.

601
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,400
Don't be excited.

602
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,400
Let me explain it to you.

603
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,400
These animals

604
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,840
are the missing person in the city.

605
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,760
Recently,

606
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,880
The spirits

607
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,320
found a kind of bug

608
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,080
that can increase their spiritual power.

609
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,920
But after they used it,

610
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,520
they were counteracted.

611
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,840
Their spiritual power was exhausted and their body was exhausted.

612
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,080
They had no choice but to go nowhere.

613
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,320
So they were sacrificed to these animals.

614
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,880
You see, they are weak and violent.

615
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,480
It's because the insects in their body

616
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,520
are attacking them.

617
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,720
They are in pain.

618
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,560
My people

619
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,920
have entered the ghost city

620
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,720
to find out the truth behind the insects.

621
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,800
So they will get the answer in less than a day.

622
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,560
I didn't understand a word.

623
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,800
But I'm so scared.

624
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,440
Go away.

625
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:49,800
Oh my god.

626
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,240
I'm really scared.

627
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,200
What's wrong?

628
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,480
They are all gone.

629
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:53,960
Yes.

630
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,960
They are all transparent.

631
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,760
Yes.

632
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:57,560
Yu Deng Deng.

633
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:58,920
You idiot.

634
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,680
Do you think I'm stupid?

635
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,040
I can believe your nonsense.

636
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,320
What kind of living people

637
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,520
become animals?

638
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,800
Why don't you say I'm a little ghost

639
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,480
and turn into a moth and fly away?

640
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,880
What are you laughing at?

641
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,520
Throw it away.

642
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:11,480
Go.

643
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,360
Don't.

644
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:12,840
Wait.

645
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,720
What's wrong, director?

646
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,320
Look.

647
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,760
Is this

648
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,120
a little ghost?

649
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,400
It seems to be.

650
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,000
Director Bai.

651
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,760
Director Bai.

652
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,320
Be good.

653
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,600
You can't take it out.

654
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,720
You can't take it out.

655
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,360
If you dare to take it out,

656
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,720
it will die for you.

657
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,520
Go away.

658
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,960
It's more valuable than your life.

659
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,560
Why are you here?

660
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,520
Director.

661
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,200
This cat...

662
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,000
What's wrong, Be good?

663
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,440
Be good. What's wrong with you?

664
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,440
You can see it with your eyes.

665
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,040
As long as the cat leaves the house,

666
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,480
it will die immediately.

667
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,480
You can ignore their life.

668
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,640
But this object was thrown away for nothing.

669
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,240
If the county governor blames you,

670
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,520
can you afford to take the list?

671
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,600
But you have no evidence.

672
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,240
You just say that

673
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:57,960
these...

674
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,480
These animals and other things,

675
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,840
how can I explain to the county governor?

676
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:02,120
Director Bai.

677
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,040
I can prove it to you.

678
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,320
But this matter is important.

679
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,320
I can only show it to you.

680
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,920
Let them leave first.

681
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,360
Wait for me outside.

682
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:17,800
Yes.

683
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:19,160
Go.

684
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,360
I tell you, Yu Teng Teng.

685
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,240
Don't play tricks on me.

686
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,920
If you lie to me,

687
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:23,960
you know what will happen.

688
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,640
Yi Tai.

689
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,760
I'm sorry.

690
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,640
I can't hide it from you today.

691
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,640
Yi Tai.

692
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:54,840
I'm sorry.

693
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,120
No.

694
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,320
What did you teach her?

695
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,200
Go.

696
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,000
Be quiet.

697
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,120
Director.

698
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,480
This girl is really playing tricks on us.

699
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:13,880
Go away.

700
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:14,840
Yes.

701
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,040
This porcelain is so sweet.

702
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,560
It's so sweet that my teeth are down.

703
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,320
Teng Teng must like it.

704
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:23,720
Hey.

705
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,960
Everyone is investigating the missing case overnight.

706
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,720
Are you just going to eat and drink here?

707
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,240
You are so weird.

708
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,800
Be careful.

709
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,680
I kick you to death.

710
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:33,800
Bai Shuang.

711
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,840
Why did they come out of the west garden?

712
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,520
The master is still there.

713
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,680
Are they going to trouble Teng Teng?

714
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,640
Teng Teng.

715
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,200
Teng Teng.

716
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,120
Teng Teng.

717
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:52,840
Master.

718
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:53,720
Are you okay?

719
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,160
Gu Bei Xi.

720
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:56,600
Why are you here?

721
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,280
I told you.

722
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,720
I'm willing to die with you.

723
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,600
I saw Director Bai coming out of here.

724
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,560
I didn't bother you, right?

725
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,040
Yes.

726
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,280
Director Bai said he gave me a man.

727
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,480
It's you.

728
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:08,840
Don't worry.

729
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,720
I can deal with him

730
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,080
by asking him everyday.

731
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,520
That's good.

732
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,280
I bought you porcelain.

733
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,080
Here, try it.

734
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,000
You've been busy all night.

735
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,520
I was thinking about it.

736
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,960
Xin, try it.

737
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,200
No need.

738
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,640
It doesn't look delicious.

739
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,080
You don't want it?

740
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,080
You are so silly.

741
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,480
You...

742
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,160
Thanks.

743
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:30,840
Do you want some?

744
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,720
They are here and there.

745
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,600
What are they doing?

746
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,400
It's so crowded.

747
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,680
What else can they do?

748
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,280
Tomorrow is Miss Bai's birthday.

749
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,560
Everyone in Bai's mansion

750
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,760
is preparing her birthday party.

751
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,880
You don't even know your fiancee's birthday?

752
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:47,480
You...

753
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,800
What fiancee's date?

754
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,920
I came to Bai's mansion

755
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,040
to cancel the engagement.

756
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,200
In my opinion,

757
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,360
Miss Bai is tall,

758
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,320
and she's pretty.

759
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,600
She's perfect for you,

760
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,800
the owner of the mansion.

761
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,440
Don't be so lucky.

762
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,720
Exactly.

763
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,960
You always make a mess.

764
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,640
In the future,

765
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,080
we can always

766
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,440
forgive each other.

767
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,120
If it turns out you didn't kiss him,

768
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,680
I'll problems with you

769
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,400
and that my love takeaways.

770
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,440
Nothing.

771
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,120
Let's go.

772
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,560
I'm not with you.

773
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,600
Lan'er?

774
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,960
I'll choose No.1.

775
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,200
Alright.

776
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,580
Go and order something interesting.

777
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,840
I can go myself.

778
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:10,500
Alright.

779
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,400
I'll go myself.

780
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,200
I'll get sarcastic for filming.

781
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,960
You usually look so sluggish and heartless.

782
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,000
I didn't expect you to be so caring to your aunt.

783
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,480
Some people don't look like they're in a good mood.

784
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,160
But they are actually not.

785
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,480
Who are you talking about?

786
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,200
You talk nonsense all day.

787
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,800
By the way, Lu Yan has been there for so long.

788
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,960
Why hasn't he come back yet?

789
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,120
Yeah.

790
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,640
He's been there for a long time.

791
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,520
And then he didn't come back.

792
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,600
Hello, Caocao, I've got you, Mr. Cao.

793
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
How about it? Have you got anything yet?

794
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,080
It's all because the boss is dead.

795
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,560
Of course.

796
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,720
We should only rely on ourselves, other than others.

797
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:07,840
But I've found the suspect

798
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,720
to kill the boss.

799
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,360
Where is he?

800
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,720
Instead of the funeral room.

801
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,280
That is great.

802
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,600
A'xin, you go first.

803
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,360
Let's go.

804
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,600
Come on. Take a look.

805
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:26,720
It's him.

806
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,120
Take off your headgear.

807
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,240
Dad.

808
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,040
Old man.

809
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,400
Who is your old man?

810
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,400
Who told you to kick?

811
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:49,960
Old man.

812
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,800
Let go. Hurry up.

813
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,720
Let go.

814
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,400
Dad.

815
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,520
Dad.

816
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,600
You...

817
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,600
Why are you here?

818
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,280
You old fish.

819
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,560
You're so worried about me.

820
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,240
I haven't heard from you for days.

821
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,600
Why are you here?

822
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,240
Who is the old man?

823
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,000
Dad.

824
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,800
Dad.

825
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,560
Dad.

826
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,160
Dad.

827
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,000
Dad.

828
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:14,800
Dad.

829
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,440
Who is the blind one

830
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,920
who dares to kidnap my dad?

831
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,960
I'll kill him

832
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,360
if I catch him.

833
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,680
It's him.

834
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,240
Dad.

835
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,880
Tell me.

836
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,280
Who is the bastard?

837
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,040
Tell me.

838
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,400
It's...

839
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:28,880
him.

840
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,920
Is he your dad?

841
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,440
Be careful. It's hot.

842
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,280
Slow down.

843
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,400
Slow down.

844
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,000
You're so rude.

845
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
You're so rude.

846
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,200
Why are you here

847
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,520
when I'm

848
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,040
staying in the Qingquan Village?

849
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,400
You're talking about me.

850
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,480
Look at you.

851
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,800
You're drunk again.

852
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,600
You're drunk.

853
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,800
Where have you been these months?

854
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,800
You let your daughter

855
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,720
go without asking.

856
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,480
What's going on here?

857
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,480
Don't talk about this.

858
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,880
Go ask your husband.

859
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,120
How can he

860
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,600
kidnap me here?

861
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
Husband?

862
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Husband?

863
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,600
Husband?

864
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,960
That's a good name.

865
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,520
That's not the point.

866
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,840
Honey, listen.

867
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,000
This guy

868
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,600
is not an ordinary man.

869
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,160
He's a monster of the spiritual clan.

870
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,360
Listen to me.

871
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,360
Break up with him.

872
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,360
I'll find you a better one.

873
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,600
What monster of the spiritual clan?

874
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:34,080
He's the ancient general

875
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,280
from 3,000 years ago.

876
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,280
He's a living man

877
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,600
who ate the spirit of the spirit clan.

878
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,600
There's no better one

879
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,360
than him.

880
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,480
We're the most suitable

881
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,480
and the most compatible.

882
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
What's his name?

883
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,480
Well...

884
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,480
The love of the two worlds.

885
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,480
The love of the two worlds.

886
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,480
That's right.

887
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,480
The love of the two worlds.

888
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,480
Yeah.

889
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
He's the ancient general

890
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,480
from 3,000 years ago.

891
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,480
His surname is Lu.

892
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
Come here.

893
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,480
You mean

894
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,480
he's the ancient general

895
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,480
of the hunting masters?

896
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,480
I knew about the hunting masters

897
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,480
from Deng Deng's words.

898
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,480
Shut up.

899
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
I think

900
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,480
you're the one

901
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,480
from the spirit clan.

902
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,480
Deng Deng.

903
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,480
Why don't you believe

904
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,480
what others say?

905
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,480
Why don't you believe what your father says?

906
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,480
If you marry this bastard,

907
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,480
I'll disobey you.

908
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
You can't disobey me.

909
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,480
You have to admit

910
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,480
that you're my wife.

911
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,480
I've spent all the dowry

912
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,480
that I was given.

913
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,480
Are you trying to piss me off?

914
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
I...

915
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,480
I...

916
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,480
Old Yu.

917
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,480
Don't be angry.

918
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
Don't be angry.

919
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
Old Zhao Ren, don't be angry.

920
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Don't be angry.

921
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
You're injured.

922
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480
Don't be angry.

923
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,480
Don't be angry.

924
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,480
Don't be angry.

925
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,480
Don't be angry.

926
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,480
I'm so mad.

927
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,480
Don't be angry.

928
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,480
Don't be angry.

929
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,480
Old Zhao Ren, don't be angry.

930
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:50,480
Okay.

931
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,480
Look at him.

932
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,480
What are you talking about?

933
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,480
Who's your old Zhao Ren?

934
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
My nephew.

935
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,480
You're just in time.

936
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
You've been listening to me

937
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,480
since you were a kid.

938
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,480
Give him a good talk.

939
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,480
He won't be happy

940
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,480
if he marries that man.

941
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,480
Give him a good talk.

942
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,480
Okay.

943
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,480
Old Zhao Ren.

944
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,480
Old Zhao Ren.

945
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,480
Old Zhao Ren.

946
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,480
You know

947
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,480
what kind of girl you are.

948
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
How can I stop her?

949
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,480
No.

950
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,480
There's one more thing.

951
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,480
I dare not say it.

952
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,480
That Chuan

953
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:21,480
almost killed your girl.

954
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,480
What did you say?

955
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,480
How can you say that, Gu Bei Xi?

956
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,480
You're annoying him.

957
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,480
My dad.

958
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
He's talking nonsense.

959
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,480
It's not true.

960
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,480
Don't talk about me.

961
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,480
Talk about you?

962
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,480
What's wrong with you?

963
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,480
I asked Lu Yan to investigate

964
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,480
the missing case.

965
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,480
How did you get involved?

966
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,480
What missing case?

967
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,480
It's just a spirit worm.

968
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,480
You know about the spirit worm?

969
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,480
When two hearts are so close

970
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,480
When the whole world is occupied by you

971
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,480
I will call your name with all my heart

972
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,480
Until your memory

973
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,480
You are my only

974
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:39,480
The scenery

975
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,480
Only the rain

976
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,480
The moon

977
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,480
The clouds

978
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,480
The love

979
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,480
I hide my heart

980
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,480
To make sure for you

981
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,480
When two hearts are so close

982
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,480
When the whole world is occupied by you

983
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,480
I will call your name with all my heart

984
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,480
Until your memory

985
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,480
You are my only

986
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,480
The scenery

987
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,480
You are my only

988
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:44,480
The scenery

989
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,480
Only the rain

990
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,480
The moon

991
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,480
The moon

992
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,480
The love

993
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,480
I hide my heart

994
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,480
To make sure for you

995
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:06,480
When two hearts are so close

996
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:11,480
When the whole world is occupied by you

997
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,480
I will call your name with all my heart

998
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,480
Until your memory

999
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:26,480
You are my only
