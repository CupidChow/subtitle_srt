1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let go after the storm

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You are me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You are me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You are me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I will be your friend

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You are me

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Episode 11

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Lu Yan, look what I have prepared for you

9
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I made it myself

10
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Lu Yan

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Lu Yan

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Lu Yan

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You can fall asleep while sitting

14
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It must be that the energy you used before has been used up too much

15
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Your body hasn't fully recovered

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll give you some energy

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll give you some energy

18
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'll give you some energy

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Lu Yan

20
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Lu Yan

21
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Lu Yan

22
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What's going on?

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Where is my energy?

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Lu Yan

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Lu Yan

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Lu Yan

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Lu Yan

28
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Lu Yan

29
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Lu Yan

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I just saw you have a little bit of dust on your head

31
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So I want to help you wipe it clean

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's okay

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It must be that I accidentally got dirty when I was grilling fish

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You have been sleeping all day and night

35
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Are you feeling better?

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hurry up and eat something to make up for it

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Guess what I made for you

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Come here

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Look at the grilled fish I made for you

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And your favorite

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No, my favorite brown sugar lollipop

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Although the taste is not very good

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
But it should taste good

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You try it

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Hurry up

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I made this myself

47
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
How is it?

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
How does it taste?

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It's delicious

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You have taste

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
My second brother and Da Hai

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
They all say I don't have the talent to cook

53
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It seems that we are Bo Ya and Ziqi

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You still have taste

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Unlike them

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
They are all ordinary people who don't know how to appreciate

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Why are you looking at me?

58
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
How are the tribes in the capital?

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Gu Bei Xi has already inquired

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Most of the tribes in the capital have escaped from the city after the execution

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Some of the tribes were not discovered by humans before

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Now I'm going out of town

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Do I still have dust on my head?

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I have a bad experience

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I think it's better if you have a hairband

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll go to the store

67
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Wait

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Or you can return the hairband to me

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This is what you gave me before

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What do you want to regret

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't want to regret

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This hairband is a bit old

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I can change you the most popular one

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I think this is good

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Is good

76
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I can change you a better one

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm not an average person

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,080
Don't force yourself.

79
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
You can't beat me now.

80
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,920
You're

81
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,000
a tiger, a sheep,

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,720
and a fish.

83
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,800
Fine.

84
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,760
Since you're saying that,

85
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,160
I'll just eat fish.

86
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,240
It sounds weird.

87
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,920
A tiger, a sheep, and a fish.

88
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,680
You didn't even remind me.

89
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,240
I didn't even think about that.

90
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,240
You...

91
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:12,960
Forget it.

92
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,880
Since you're not recovered yet,

93
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,120
I'll let you go this time.

94
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,640
Come on.

95
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,200
Come on.

96
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,960
Come on.

97
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,720
My daughter,

98
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
you're here to feed me again.

99
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,400
I'm just saying that

100
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,720
my daughter will never forget

101
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,720
her father after she marries a man.

102
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,040
Where's the food?

103
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,600
Did you eat it all?

104
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,000
Do you know to respect your elders?

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,800
No, Master.

106
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,280
What did Lu Yin Niang do wrong?

107
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
Why are you treating her like this?

108
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,160
I'll teach her a lesson.

109
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,800
Don't get involved in the little couple's affairs.

110
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,600
It's not a big deal to have a long-term relationship.

111
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,280
It's too unruly.

112
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes.

113
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's too unruly.

114
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,800
You're right.

115
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,680
You're right.

116
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,560
You're right.

117
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
It's too unruly.

118
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,640
Keep it down.

119
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,880
Someone is following us.

120
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,320
Who?

121
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,560
I didn't see it clearly,

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,840
but he's good at fighting.

123
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,240
It shouldn't be.

124
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,160
Didn't Lu Yin Yang say

125
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,160
that he made a magic array here

126
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,680
to block the source of energy and breath?

127
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,360
Yes.

128
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,720
But ordinary people can't find it.

129
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,160
No matter who it is,

130
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,200
it's all guests.

131
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:23,360
I'll go and have a look.

132
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:23,960
Wait a minute.

133
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,720
I know the enemy's secret.

134
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,000
If you go out now,

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,320
you can't get any advantage.

136
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,280
How about...

137
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,480
Okay.

138
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,280
Okay.

139
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:37,960
Okay.

140
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Okay.

141
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,880
Master,

142
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,160
do you want to talk to Lu Yin Yang?

143
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,800
No.

144
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,560
Sha Ji doesn't need a knife.

145
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,080
If you tell her now,

146
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,600
she can't get better.

147
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,160
Dad,

148
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,080
I haven't finished yet.

149
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,920
Where are you going?

150
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,600
Sha Ji.

151
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,320
I think she's going to be a mess.

152
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,360
Second father.

153
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,960
I'm so tired.

154
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,520
I must have a good sleep.

155
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,600
Sha Ji.

156
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,600
Kid,

157
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,400
don't move.

158
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,560
Why can't I even move the water tank?

159
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,280
Kid.

160
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,560
Don't move.

161
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,960
You entered my Zi Chen's trap.

162
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,720
You want to run away?

163
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,640
You don't even have a door.

164
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,560
I want to see

165
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,720
who is not blind.

166
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,560
How dare you disturb our Qing Quan village.

167
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,080
That's right.

168
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,880
Get out of the way.

169
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:50,800
A Xian.

170
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,240
Master.

171
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,400
Master.

172
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,200
Why are you here?

173
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,080
Hurry up.

174
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,840
What are you talking about?

175
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,680
Master.

176
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
I...

177
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,160
I'm here to test your reaction ability.

178
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,240
I didn't expect that

179
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,080
you would be so good.

180
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Master Yu is great.

181
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,960
Master Er is great.

182
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,520
Brother Da Hai is even better.

183
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,120
Master called me.

184
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm going back.

185
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,360
Master.

186
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,960
I...

187
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,880
Don't push me.

188
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,160
I promised master.

189
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,320
I won't say anything.

190
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,960
What are you doing?

191
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,880
Master.

192
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,880
Actually, the thing is like this.

193
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,520
Master wants to get the hairpin back.

194
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,120
You won't give it to him.

195
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,280
So I want to ask for it.

196
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,520
I want to help master get the hairpin back.

197
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,520
You're so annoying.

198
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,520
You just stole it.

199
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,320
We're a family.

200
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
How can you say that?

201
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,480
Why did he suddenly

202
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,960
take the hairpin back?

203
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,480
Is there any problem with the hairpin?

204
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,600
Say it or not?

205
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,120
Say it.

206
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,120
Say it.

207
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,080
Wait.

208
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,720
Sorry.

209
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,280
What's going on?

210
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,440
I wanted to grow old with you.

211
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,320
But I'm afraid I'm going to break my promise

212
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,160
after today's decision.

213
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,320
Remember.

214
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,080
I, Lu Mou, will repay you.

215
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,760
You treat me as your husband in this life.

216
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
I will marry you in the next life.

217
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,560
This matter will definitely

218
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,640
be a long life.

219
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,880
So�

220
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,280
Too touching.

221
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,280
Oh my god.

222
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,000
Lu Mou was so free and awesome.

223
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,360
As awesome as ever!

224
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,240
Obviously you were provoking herself.

225
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,720
I'll kill him.

226
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,320
Come back.

227
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,360
What did you bet again?

228
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,640
מ big boss

229
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,280
Boss.

230
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,720
Boss.

231
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,040
It's just a confession.

232
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,640
You all

233
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,240
have never seen the world.

234
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,240
You're useless.

235
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,640
Alright.

236
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,040
Since it's clear now,

237
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,800
it's a misunderstanding.

238
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,680
Let's go back and rest.

239
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,720
Go.

240
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,720
Go.

241
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,560
Why are you pushing me?

242
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,520
Let me care about him.

243
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,720
Go.

244
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,360
Deng Deng.

245
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,920
I'm sorry.

246
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,800
I wanted to grow old with you.

247
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,680
But I'm afraid I'll break my promise

248
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,480
today.

249
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,520
Remember.

250
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,440
I'll pay you back.

251
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,760
You'll be my husband in this life.

252
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,240
I'll marry you in the next life.

253
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,480
This is a matter of life and death.

254
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,640
Lu Yan.

255
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,800
Lu Yan,

256
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,600
why are you here?

257
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,320
Don't wake me up.

258
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:15,700
I

259
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,240
?

260
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:16,880
Lu Yan.

261
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,000
You fell asleep again?

262
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,640
Seems you really tired.

263
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,240
You're the General,

264
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,320
but you're so cold-hearted.

265
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,680
You're hiding

266
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,240
such a passionate heart.

267
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,520
Besides,

268
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,920
you're talented.

269
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,160
I've seen

270
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,280
a lot of people like you.

271
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,520
Just now,

272
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,520
I was so surprised

273
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,640
when I heard your confession

274
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,080
in front of so many people.

275
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,400
I was very angry at first.

276
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
I was angry with you

277
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,720
and was angry with you for your own sake.

278
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,480
But for the sake of your confession,

279
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,360
I'll show mercy

280
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,240
and let you go.

281
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,760
Deng Deng, I'm sorry.

282
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,800
I wanted to live with you...

283
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,440
Give it back!

284
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,760
All right, Lu Yan.

285
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,680
You're pretending to sleep

286
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,880
and you even took my hairpin.

287
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,320
You think I won't be happy

288
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,400
if I don't check it?

289
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,600
I just heard

290
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,840
my favorite line.

291
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,600
I'm going to...

292
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,560
All right, all right.

293
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:35,960
Stop talking.

294
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,360
I'm going to...

295
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,760
Stop talking.

296
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:37,520
I'll pay you back.

297
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,640
Please treat me as your husband.

298
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,160
Stop talking.

299
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,360
If I say

300
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,880
I still have feelings for you,

301
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,960
I'll have feelings for you.

302
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,640
What?

303
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,160
You said you wouldn't allow me to learn.

304
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,600
I have to learn.

305
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,840
I have to...

306
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,160
What's your answer?

307
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,040
You heard my confession.

308
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,240
What's your answer?

309
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,840
I...

310
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,920
If you don't answer,

311
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,120
I'll take it as you're a.

312
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,400
I've lost you once

313
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,040
three thousand years ago.

314
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,720
Yesterday,

315
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,280
I almost broke up with you.

316
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,160
Now you know my feelings.

317
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,440
What about you?

318
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,400
What's your answer?

319
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,080
We've made a deal.

320
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,440
If you dare to break your promise again,

321
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,640
I'll kill you.

322
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,640
I'll kill you.

323
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,560
I'll kill you.

324
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,560
I'll kill you.

325
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,840
If you dare to break your promise again,

326
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,920
I'll lock you up in Qingquan Village

327
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,120
and never let you out.

328
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,480
Don't you want to hear my answer?

329
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,600
Then listen carefully.

330
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,200
Thank you, Mi.

331
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,960
Thank you for being in my life.

332
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,200
You've made me not be alone anymore.

333
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,800
I'm happy to share it with you.

334
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,840
I'm sad to be with you.

335
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
I want to say,

336
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,040
whether it's in the past,

337
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,800
now,

338
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
or in the future,

339
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,160
it's great to have you.

340
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,040
I'm happy to be with you.

341
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
I'm sad to be with you.

342
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,040
I don't count.

343
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,360
Yu, didn't you sleep?

344
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,520
Why are you back?

345
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,400
Uncle Yue.

346
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,920
What do you call me?

347
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,000
Call me dad.

348
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,440
Don't let him call me dad.

349
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,680
Why can't you call your father?

350
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,760
He has never been in the tea

351
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,160
Never been to the Yu family's ancestral hall

352
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,200
So not counted

353
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,240
Moreover, the divorce letter is written

354
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,080
You are with him now

355
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,280
No relationship

356
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,600
No signature on the divorce letter

357
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,880
No number

358
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,320
Lu Yan, call dad

359
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,760
He has been in charge of me for three thousand years

360
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,000
Isn't that a curse on me?

361
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,680
Why don't you make sense

362
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,760
You said my daughter

363
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,080
What do i tell you

364
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,920
Then we will go back to Qingquan Village

365
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,680
Let him be a real Yu family

366
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,640
Then wait until the wedding is over

367
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,760
Now you go back to sleep

368
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,200
Don't be so familiar with him

369
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,680
I'll go back first

370
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,560
Ok

371
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,600
Are you done?

372
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,120
go

373
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,080
Wait for him to be angry

374
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll talk about him again

375
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,320
go go go

376
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:21,960
Ok ok ok

377
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,760
You are my real father

378
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,280
Can't afford to be angry

379
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,200
go go go go

380
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,120
This is so angry

381
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,600
So angry

382
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:52,400
In the battle of Yingdu

383
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,560
I can see Lu Yan's feelings for Deng Deng

384
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,240
Why are you still not satisfied

385
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,160
You said Deng Deng

386
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,120
Why are you turning your arms out now?

387
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,680
Since he met that Lu Yan

388
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,360
Don't recognize me as a father

389
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,840
It's really a woman

390
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,000
He is right

391
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,680
I am his father

392
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,600
Why can't it be compared to him

393
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,240
Just met

394
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,040
The smelly man for three months

395
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,360
You, you

396
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,400
How about this

397
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,160
Let's introduce him to another man

398
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,320
That man is called Gu Beixi

399
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:27,880
It's useless

400
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,960
I've done what I should do

401
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,640
Children have their own children's house

402
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:33,920
Don't care

403
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,680
The more you care, the more rebellious you are

404
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,560
Deng Deng gave you

405
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,320
My daughter is still thinking about me

406
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:49,680
Yes

407
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,800
When he asked you to go out to buy cigarettes

408
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,320
By the way, bring some supplements to Lu Yan

409
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,680
Bring him a big man

410
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,360
He is not a big man

411
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,760
It smells good

412
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,120
Later, put a bunch of flowers in Lu Yan's room

413
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,760
Flowers must be with the beauty

414
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,240
The white paper and sacred blood you want

415
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,240
Thank you

416
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,080
Thank you

417
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,280
You walk slowly

418
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,480
Buy a pen and a hand

419
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,160
Buy a pen and a hand

420
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,640
I won again

421
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,320
Come on, come on

422
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:37,680
Good

423
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,360
Come on, come on

424
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,320
Come on, come on

425
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:39,840
Come on, come on

426
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,560
Come on

427
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,440
it is good

428
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,920
I just play one

429
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,040
I don't believe it

430
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,960
You are not a little bastard

431
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,600
Come on, come on

432
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,920
Small

433
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:52,400
Your

434
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,000
Your

435
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,400
Go in, go in, go in

436
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,480
Buy a pen and a hand

437
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,160
This man

438
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,080
Are you done

439
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,480
Big or small

440
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,120
I said you came to smash the factory

441
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,520
Dare to press all the boards

442
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,200
Go go go

443
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,960
Don't sign

444
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,280
Don't break it here

445
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,000
It's broken

446
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:19,840
OK

447
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,080
Come on, come on, sit down

448
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:23,080
Sit down

449
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:24,960
One small one small

450
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,960
Come on, come on

451
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,840
Press the small

452
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,880
Buy a pen and a hand

453
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:30,640
Big

454
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,360
Big

455
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:31,960
Big

456
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:45,920
Come on

457
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,440
Good

458
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:00,760
Master

459
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,800
Why are you back so late

460
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,600
I was delayed on the way

461
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,640
Can't you go over again

462
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,640
I knew as soon as I smelled your clothes

463
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,120
Master, you can't gamble anymore

464
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,920
If you gamble again, you can't turn back

465
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,400
Can't tell Deng Deng

466
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,200
If you leak the secret

467
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,880
I'll expel you from the Qingquan station

468
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,200
Master, my mouth is very strict

469
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,120
Don't tell anyone

470
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:27,760
Master, don't worry

471
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,160
What do I say to anyone

472
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,320
No

473
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,080
Say that

474
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,480
Master bought a supplement for the lady

475
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,480
Yes

476
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,000
No face

477
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,880
Yes, Big Hai

478
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,400
Give Deng Deng the chicken and medicine

479
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,080
Okay

480
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,560
Okay

481
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,720
Hurry up

482
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,640
I'm sleepy

483
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,040
I have to go back and sleep for a while

484
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,320
This stinky old fish

485
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,920
I asked him to buy ginseng

486
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,520
He actually bought me some ginseng

487
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,600
Chicken or a rooster

488
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,440
This rooster

489
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,760
It looks like my big red

490
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,280
There is always a feeling of killing your own husband

491
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,240
Brother rooster

492
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,880
Since you and my big red are chicken ancestors

493
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,600
Then I'll have a hard time today

494
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,600
Sacrifice

495
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,200
Sorry

496
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:38,920
This big rooster

497
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,000
I'll soup it with the supply

498
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,280
What's going on

499
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,400
Why do you always faint recently

500
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,180
Can we consume too much

501
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,440
Eat two buns changer first

502
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,240
Come, you're the one who took advantage of me first.

503
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,360
It's not bad.

504
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,840
I'm so sleepy.

505
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,040
I want to sleep for a while.

506
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,160
Hold on tight.

507
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,760
Don't let go.

508
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,800
Wait.

509
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,560
My heart is breaking.

510
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,760
It's a soul.

511
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,120
How?

512
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,840
Why did the strenght

513
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,280
to average body

514
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:55,400
coating the autumn butterfly land

515
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:55,840
Mayor Fan has lost its inner flower again?

516
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,640
What's wrong with him?

517
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,040
I've put some yuan energy into him.

518
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,000
He's fine now.

519
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,760
Lu Yan.

520
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,640
Deng Deng, you're awake.

521
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,000
Don't worry.

522
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,400
I'm here.

523
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,280
Don't be afraid.

524
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,400
I'm here.

525
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,200
Don't be afraid.

526
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm here.

527
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,040
Don't be afraid.

528
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,920
I'm here.

529
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,760
Don't be afraid.

530
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,640
I'm here.

531
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
I'm here.

532
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
I'm here.

533
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,040
Don't be afraid.

534
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,000
Take care of Deng Deng here.

535
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,640
Lu Yan, we meet again.

536
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,840
You did all of this, right?

537
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,840
You're so weak now.

538
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,440
It seems that you've spent a lot of money to save them.

539
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,840
I advise you not to waste your energy.

540
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,640
Our Saintess Yunxi...

541
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,840
No, it's Yu Deng Deng.

542
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,840
Now I can enjoy the taste of the spirit worm.

543
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
You have to treat her like a child.

544
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,040
I'm not a child.

545
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,640
I'm a child.

546
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,640
I can enjoy the taste of the spirit worm.

547
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,640
What are you going to do to her?

548
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,640
Nothing.

549
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,440
I just planted a bug on her.

550
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,240
I can use her power anytime.

551
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,640
The bug is here, the human is here.

552
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,240
The insect king...

553
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:48,440
You don't want to see the living Yu Deng Deng anymore.

554
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,640
You only had the Saintess Yunxi's yuan pellet.

555
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,840
That's why you had the power to fight me.

556
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,040
Now you're able to be damaged.

557
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,640
But you have to hand over the yuan pellet.

558
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,240
I didn't have the yuan pellet.

559
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,240
We met in the battlefield.

560
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,040
I never lost.

561
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
The End

562
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,840
I underestimated you.

563
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,840
We humans don't understand your spirit realm.

564
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,440
We know how to fight the enemy.

565
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,040
You're too naive.

566
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,840
Deng Deng.

567
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,440
Master.

568
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,040
Master.

569
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,640
Master, don't kill my father.

570
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,240
Master.

571
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,640
Deng Deng.

572
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,240
What should we do?

573
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,040
What should we do?

574
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,040
Master.

575
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,440
Deng Deng.

576
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,240
My father is here.

577
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,240
Chu Rong.

578
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,240
You just want the yuan pellet.

579
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,040
Let go of Yu Deng Deng and the others.

580
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,440
I'll give you the yuan pellet.

581
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,240
Look at you.

582
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,640
Why do you have to bargain with me?

583
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,040
The End

584
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,240
You think the yuan pellet can be taken as you want?

585
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
Wait a minute.

586
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,240
You scared my brother to death.

587
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,200
The

588
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
The

589
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,200
The

590
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,200
How is A Xin?

591
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,200
Don't worry, master.

592
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,200
You have yuan energy to protect your body.

593
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,200
Just rest for a few days.

594
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Wait for yuan energy to recover.

595
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Yes.

596
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
That's good.

597
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,200
I'll give him some yuan energy.

598
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
Wait.

599
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,200
Don't you know what your body is like?

600
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
How can you lose to him?

601
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
I can't leave you alone.

602
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
I was attacked by Zhu Rong

603
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
because he sent me yuan energy.

604
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
But you're in this state.

605
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,200
I'm fine.

606
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
Sir.

607
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

608
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Come on.

609
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
Let me see what's in your body.

610
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
This...

611
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,200
Didn't all the insects die?

612
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
This insect is different from before.

613
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
Zhu Rong worked hard

614
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,200
to take advantage of my yuan energy

615
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,200
to enter the process.

616
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,200
He put this insect in Deng Deng's body.

617
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Then you should go to him.

618
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
I've checked it just now.

619
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,200
This insect is connected to Deng Deng's body.

620
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,200
If the insect is damaged,

621
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,200
Deng Deng will be damaged.

622
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,200
How could this happen?

623
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
It's evolving.

624
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
It's getting harder to deal with.

625
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
Is there no other way?

626
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,200
Think of a way.

627
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,200
This...

628
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Unless...

629
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Let it get out of Deng Deng's body

630
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,200
without any damage.

631
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,200
Do it.

632
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,200
Yes. Do it.

633
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,200
You should...

634
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,200
Don't be discouraged.

635
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,200
Didn't you say before?

636
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,200
It's hard to get through.

637
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,200
It's hard to get through.

638
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,200
There must be a way to deal with it.

639
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
You're the only one who can do it.

640
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,200
Don't worry.

641
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
I'll think of a way.

642
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,200
I believe you.

643
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Master Yu.

644
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
I heard that one of the hunters

645
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
never dealt with the forest tribe.

646
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,200
They only care about the evil spirits.

647
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,200
For example, the god of death or the evil spirit.

648
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,200
You mean that the insect king is also an evil spirit?

649
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
I've said it a thousand years ago.

650
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,200
The spirit insect is not born from the body.

651
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,200
It's the blood of the spirit.

652
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
So I suspect it's the evil spirit.

653
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,200
I see.

654
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,200
You want to deal with it

655
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
by dealing with the evil spirit.

656
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,200
As far as I know,

657
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,200
in the city of Yindu,

658
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,200
there's a hunter who specializes in the evil spirit.

659
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,200
But he's missing.

660
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,200
Deng Deng is in danger now.

661
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
I have to stay by his side.

662
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
I wonder if Master Yu can take me

663
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
to visit this hunter.

664
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,200
Of course.

665
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,200
My daughter's business is my business.

666
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,200
I can find a way to deal with them.

667
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,200
I'll go now.

668
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
Thank you.

669
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Master, what are you doing?

670
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
You can't do this.

671
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,200
Don't talk.

672
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,200
You don't think I'm going to use hairpins

673
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,200
to break the yuan pellet and give it to Yu Deng Deng, do you?

674
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,200
No, Master.

675
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Master likes you so much now.

676
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,200
You can't get hurt by this.

677
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,200
He can't stand it.

678
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
I know.

679
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,200
If I give the yuan pellet to Deng Deng,

680
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,200
it's like giving the endless yuan pellet to Zhu Rong.

681
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,200
Deng Deng will only get weaker and weaker.

682
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,200
Now,

683
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,200
the most important thing is to get the spirit insect out.

684
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,200
But you were just...

685
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Deng Deng's yuan energy has been losing.

686
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,200
I put a spell in his hairpin.

687
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
So,

688
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
once his yuan energy changes,

689
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,200
I can feel it.

690
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
Master,

691
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,200
you're in a bad shape now.

692
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
You must take good care of yourself.

693
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
Zhu Rong

694
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
was hurt by me this time.

695
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
He won't come again.

696
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
Don't worry.

697
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
I'll have a good rest.

698
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
White house

699
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
Go.

700
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Let's go.

701
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Go.

702
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
Go.

703
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,200
Go.

704
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,200
Go.

705
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,200
Go.

706
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Go.

707
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
Go.

708
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
Go.

709
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,200
Go.

710
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,200
Go.

711
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,200
I'll take you there.

712
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,560
Shi Qi!

713
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Uncle An.

714
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
Uncle An!

715
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:20,240
Uncle An!

716
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,520
Uncle An!

717
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,560
Uncle An.

718
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,000
Miss Bao!

719
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,360
Miss Bao!

720
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,520
General Gu.

721
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,520
SYLVIA

722
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,360
Sh익

723
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,480
let go

724
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:15,560
This fine money is mine.

725
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:33,660
Once I get rid of your

726
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,940
dirty pawns

727
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,440
I'll kill myself.

728
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,440
How long have I been sleeping?

729
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,440
Where is my Yuan?

730
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,440
Come in.

731
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,440
Master, I brought you your favorite melon seeds.

732
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,440
How is it?

733
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
Did you have a good rest?

734
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,440
I slept very well.

735
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,440
Come here.

736
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,440
Sit.

737
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,440
Are you thirsty?

738
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,440
I'll pour you a glass of water.

739
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,440
How can you do it yourself?

740
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
Let me feed you.

741
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,440
Is it necessary to be so exaggerated?

742
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,440
You can't move this or take it.

743
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,440
Of course it's necessary.

744
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,440
You are so weak now.

745
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,440
You have to take more rest.

746
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,440
It's just a worm.

747
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,440
It's just a little bug.

748
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,440
It's not pregnant.

749
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,440
It's not allowed to move.

750
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,440
What?

751
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,440
Can it fall out?

752
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,440
No, no, no.

753
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:00,440
Master Lu, you hurry up and control it.

754
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,440
Xing should listen to you more.

755
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,440
It has always been like this for thousands of years.

756
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,440
Master, come here.

757
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,440
This brother said that Master Gu made a message.

758
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Gu Bei Xi?

759
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
Where did he go?

760
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,440
Master Gu went to find Miss Bai Shi Qi.

761
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,440
Director Bai was fired.

762
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,440
On the way to the home of the Bai family,

763
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,440
he met the Xiong Ya village to seek revenge.

764
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,440
Miss Bai is missing.

765
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,440
Bai Shi Qi is missing?

766
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
But don't worry.

767
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:27,440
He said that it is possible that he is in Xiong Ya Village.

768
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,440
Master Gu told you not to worry.

769
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,440
He said that he was in the village.

770
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,440
He said that he was in the village.

771
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,440
Master Gu told you not to worry.

772
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,440
He will definitely save Miss Bai.

773
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,440
Xing, find a way to send a letter to the South Wind Village.

774
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,440
Let them come here to support Gu Bei Xi.

775
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,440
Okay.

776
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,440
Come on, brother, you go have some tea.

777
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,440
Thank you, thank you.

778
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,440
I hope Miss Bai has a good future.

779
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,440
You have to believe in Gu Bei Xi.

780
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,440
He has a way to deal with the devils.

781
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,440
Found it.

782
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,440
Found it.

783
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,440
I found it.

784
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,440
Girl, I finally found it.

785
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,440
Find a way to get rid of the spirits.

786
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:37,440
I heard it all about you

787
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,440
When two hearts are so close

788
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,440
When the whole world is occupied by you

789
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,440
I will call you with all my heart

790
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,440
Until your memory

791
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,440
You are my only

792
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,440
The scenery that I walk into

793
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,440
This city is a long journey

794
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,440
The distance is only love

795
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:19,440
I hide my heart

796
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,440
And make a decision for you

797
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,440
When two hearts are so close

798
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,440
When the whole world is occupied by you

799
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,440
I will call you with all my heart

800
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:50,440
Until your memory

801
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:55,440
You are my only

802
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,440
The scenery that I walk into

803
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,440
This city is a long journey

804
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,440
The distance is only love

805
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:11,440
I hide my heart

806
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,440
And make a decision for you

807
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,440
When two hearts are so close

808
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,440
When the whole world is occupied by you

809
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,440
I will call you with all my heart

810
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,440
And make a decision for you

811
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,440
The End
