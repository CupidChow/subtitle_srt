27
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:52,690
Wei Du!

28
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,510
It's Wei Du.

29
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,710
He's so tough.

30
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,070
What? You can't recognize your lieutenant?

31
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,690
Do you want to save the people outside

32
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,120
or your loyal admirer?

33
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
Make your choice.

34
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,860
Zhu Rong, release him.

35
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,850
Now you feel sorry for him.

36
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,230
He was tortured by the Ghost Vines

37
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,870
in the underground palace.

38
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,820
He's still at the door of Yu Dengdeng.

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,760
What a

40
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,040
loyal dog to you.

41
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,620
If it were me,

42
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,480
I wouldn't want a loyal dog to die.

43
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,660
I only want the energy core in your body.

44
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,200
Give me the energy core.

45
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,440
I can spare your lives.

46
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,270
General.

47
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,500
Don't listen to his slander.

48
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,110
If you don't save him,

49
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,390
he will really die.

50
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,410
If you want to play tricks,

51
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,570
let's see if you're faster

52
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,390
or the Ghost Vines.

53
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,040
You...

54
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:56,270
Father, you're really something.

55
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,180
Not bad.

56
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:08,630
Wei Du.

57
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,820
General.

58
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,670
Beixi.

59
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,650
Uncle Yu.

60
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:09,350
Father.

61
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,380
Father.

62
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,040
I'm fine.

63
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,640
Where is he?

64
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,490
His energy is exhausted. He can't go far.

65
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,830
Wei Du, how are you?

66
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,020
General, Zhu Rong should have escaped to the underground palace.

67
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,670
The underground palace?

68
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,630
Go after Zhu Rong.

69
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,870
Leave Wei Du to me.

70
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:53,260
Let's go, too. Let's go.

71
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:54,850
Be careful.

72
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,680
Father, be careful.

73
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,330
You go there. I'll go this way.

74
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:05,590
This is the last thing

75
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,380
I can do for you.

76
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,030
Although

77
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,580
I have no chance to see you come to the world

78
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,680
and rebuild the glory of the spirit clan.

79
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,360
But with my life,

80
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,720
I can make you reappear in the world.

81
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,250
That's enough

82
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,920
for me in my lifetime.

83
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,270
Oh no.

84
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,240
It's all over.

85
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,550
What do you mean?

86
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,280
What are you talking about?

87
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,690
Purple thunder comes from the east.

88
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,930
The clouds roll in and the wind rises.

89
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,030
The Black Saintess

90
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,510
is here!

91
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,010
Black Saintess?

92
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,110
Who is the Black Saintess?

93
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,420
What Black Saintess?

94
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,110
Black Saintess

95
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,750
is the monster that absorbs life.

96
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,810
I heard from Zhu Rong that

97
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,410
she is the evil spirit

98
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,830
you sealed in the Divine Tree 3,000 years ago.

99
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:58,190
She has been kept in the underground palace

100
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,570
after being found by Zhu Rong.

101
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:05,470
He has been looking for ways to revive the Black Saintess.

102
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,410
Once the Black Saintess is revived,

103
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,730
everything

104
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,240
will be devoured.

105
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:16,450
Darkness and shadows

106
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,390
will rule the land!

107
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,020
No!

108
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,630
Yun Xi, no!

109
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,540
Help me!

110
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,960
Yun Xi, help me!

111
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,800
Help me! No!

112
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,420
Help me.

113
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,190
I seem to have seen the person you mentioned

114
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,920
in the underground palace.

115
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,440
Didn't you just say

116
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,790
I sealed her 3,000 years ago?

117
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,870
Then I'll seal her again.

118
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,790
It requires the power of an energy core

119
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,540
to seal her.

120
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,690
But that energy core

121
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,440
is in the general's body.

122
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,070
Ms. Yu,

123
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,310
I have something to tell you.

124
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,510
Go ahead.

125
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:16,630
Do you know General's wish for the past 3,000 years

126
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,840
is to return the energy core to you?

127
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,570
But he never said

128
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,880
once he gave you the energy core,

129
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,770
his body and soul

130
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,970
will vanish

131
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:34,140
and turn into ashes.

132
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,070
Unless...

133
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,690
Unless what?

134
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:48,690
The Black Saintess

135
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,790
has the same root as you.

136
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,120
If you want to save the world,

137
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:56,590
unless...

138
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,430
you die,

139
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,770
then she can't live.

140
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,810
Ms. Yu,

141
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:14,000
you and General

142
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:17,640
are destined to be entangled in this life.

143
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,240
You should be together.

144
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,620
Although I don't want to admit it,

145
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,820
the people can survive a thousand years ago

146
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:28,870
thanks to you two.

147
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:38,860
I'm going to die.

148
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,830
There's no need to hide

149
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,060
my gratefulness.

150
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:49,690
But there is only one energy core.

151
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,290
You're the person General loves.

152
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,230
In order to save you,

153
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,110
he won't hesitate to

154
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,900
cut open himself.

155
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,250
General was a saintly young master.

156
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,650
He used to be passionate and risked his life

157
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:18,470
to shoulder the burden to save the world,

158
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,800
and suffered a lot.

159
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,370
He should

160
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,180
enjoy this peaceful life.

161
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:31,770
Ms. Yu.

162
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,960
These days,

163
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,710
I've understood.

164
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,090
General

165
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,660
is also the one you love.

166
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,430
In terms of how to make a choice,

167
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,730
Ms. Yu,

168
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:52,080
I believe you have your own idea.

169
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,580
Ms. Yu,

170
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,730
I can't take back

171
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,240
what I did to you.

172
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,060
I'm sorry.

173
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,480
How's it going?

Stop saving me.

I've been living too painfully for the past 3,000 years.

Leaving now is a relief.

General, I must tell you.

187
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,750
I remember why I was immortal.

I was stained with the blood of Golden Crow Saintess.

I was immortal by accident.

190

Later, I saved the soldiers
