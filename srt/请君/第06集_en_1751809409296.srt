1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll never let go after you leave

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You ask, it's not me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You ask, it's not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's not me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's not me

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Episode 16

8
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Come on, take off your clothes

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What?

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm looking down on the old man

11
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's just taking off my clothes

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Okay, I'll take it off

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Brother, turn around

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What?

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Okay, okay, okay

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Take a look, take a look

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Whatever

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What kind of clothes are these?

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's so hard to untie

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What kind of material is this?

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why can't I untie it?

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Let me help you

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Don't worry

24
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Don't move

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
There's something wrong with the clothes

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Xiao Xue, it's not me

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's Jiayi

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Brother, are you okay?

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Master Lu, why did you come down in the middle of the day

30
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and bully our Deng Deng?

31
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Brother, don't talk nonsense

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This...

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
There's something wrong with the clothes

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The color has changed

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm afraid it's using the clothes to absorb the human energy

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It seems that you've been staring at it for a long time

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
A Xin

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Sir

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Bring the person who just died up here

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay

41
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That spirit tribe absorbed its consciousness and essence

42
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
and gave it a poison

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
That's why it's so old

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's like a monster

45
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What's this?

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
We have to catch this spirit tribe as soon as possible

47
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and get rid of it

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Otherwise, it will die in a day

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It's not right to say that these debtors are involved in your wedding dress

50
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
No one has touched your wedding dress

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
They didn't touch my wedding dress

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But they touched something else

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Demon gold

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I have one too

55
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Boss Bu gave it to me

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I've been busy, I forgot it

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'll go get it

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So to speak

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The wedding dress and the demon gold

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
changed color because they absorbed our essence

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
But why

62
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
They just brought Boss Bu's small items

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
and turned into monsters

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And I've been wearing wedding dresses all day

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
But I'm fine

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You are not fine

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Hair

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't worry, I'll get you a mirror

69
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Look

70
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
My

71
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
My hair

72
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You were also hit by that spirit tribe

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm fine

74
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This hairpin can help you to resist the attack of the spirit tribe

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Most of the attacks were blocked by it

76
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
That's why it turned into this color

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Then

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Will Master be so old?

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
One day it will be like this

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
As long as you find that spirit tribe and get rid of it

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Nothing will happen

82
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What if you can't find it

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Don't worry

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Lu Yan and I will be out for a day

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We can definitely get rid of that monster

86
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
By then, you can't get rid of it

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm fine

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm fine

89
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm fine

90
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm fine

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm fine

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm fine

93
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
By then, your master and I will still be the most youthful and beautiful in the whole Qingquan Village

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Then we can't wait

95
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's go

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
OK, I'll clean up

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Second brother, Da Hai

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You must be more careful to stay in the village

99
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Especially beware of Gu Bei Xi

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
If something really happens

101
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Don't fight hard

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You must wait for me to come back

103
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't worry, Master

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Dump all the spies in the school

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We must find that spirit tribe as soon as possible

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yu Deng Deng has now had symptoms of aging

107
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If we don't get rid of that spirit tribe as soon as possible

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm afraid I'll die of aging in a few days

109
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Yun Xi's spirit food will also dissipate with time

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
OK, sir

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll go arrange it

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's you

113
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Take me with you

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You don't know how to catch monsters

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What are you going to do

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I don't want to stay with those old men on the mountain

117
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Not to mention your Qingquan Village

118
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I can't sit back and do nothing

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Although I don't have the ability of this master

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
But I have guns, guns, and brothers

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You take me

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I let my brothers protect your Qingquan Village

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Guarantee to crush those bastards

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If he stays in the mountain village and gets into trouble

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Peng Da Hai must be unable to hold back

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Why don't you put him under your eyes and watch

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If you don't agree

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll let me

129
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Stop talking nonsense and get on the horse

130
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Follow me if you want

131
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Go

132
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Go

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Go to Shizhuang Hall

134
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Wait a minute

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The common people should have run away

136
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Won't wait here

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Then go to the gate

138
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The boss of the Shizhuang Show is here

139
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Lu Tang Jun, come here first

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
These two words have to match

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Did you hear it

142
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Dengzi, Dengzi, hurry up and move forward

143
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The guests are here

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Come here to taste the horse

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He is still in the city

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Just on Yongan Street

148
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Wait a minute

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I know a shortcut

150
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I know a shortcut

151
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I know a shortcut

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I know a shortcut

153
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I know a shortcut

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I know a shortcut

155
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm so thirsty and hungry on the way

156
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Boss Yu

157
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You go to the restaurant at the end

158
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Buy me a few meat pies

159
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
When I come back, give me another cup of tea

160
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm going to catch monsters soon

161
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You still want to eat and drink at this time

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I have to eat and drink enough because I want to catch the monster

163
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
From last night to now

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
For the poor thing in your Qingquan Village

165
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I didn't drink a sip of water

166
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You have to hide from the bad things

167
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You wait

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
It's done

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Mr. Hao

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Thank you boss

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Are you okay

172
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Grandma, grandma

173
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
How to speak

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Have you ever seen such an honorable grandma?

175
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
If you dare to talk nonsense again

176
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Be careful not to marry a wife when you grow up

177
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Boss, do you have a pot of bottom ash?

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What do you want

179
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Stop acting

180
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The fish lantern becomes like this now

181
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Is it because of the monster

182
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Or because of you

183
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Or

184
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Same

185
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
No chance

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Stop pretending to be stupid

187
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I didn't forget what happened yesterday

188
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
After the Qingquan Village accident

189
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You took all the things away

190
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The so-called going down the mountain to catch monsters

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's all for you

192
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
To trick Yu Deng Deng out of the mountain village

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
If I want Yu Deng Deng's life

194
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You don't have to bother

195
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Then you put all your effort into it

196
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What on earth do you want to do with her?

197
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's none of your business

198
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Because she is my woman

199
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Who dares to touch my woman

200
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I have to fight with the king

201
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I tell you

202
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
If you dare to touch a finger of Yu Deng Deng

203
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I will never let you go

204
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Me

205
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I will never let you go

206
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Go inside

207
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Monster, show yourself

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Dog blood, talisman

209
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Do you think you can beat me with these things?

210
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You are really a monster

211
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If you really have feelings for her

212
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Don't do these boring things

213
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The more time you waste with me here

214
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That spirit monster will kill more people

215
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The time left for Yu Deng Deng will also be shorter

216
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What do you mean?

217
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If we can't catch the culprit

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
She can't live tonight

219
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You can choose not to believe

220
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But if you insist on blocking me from catching the spirits

221
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I will not let you go

222
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Lu Yan

223
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Sir

224
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
What's going on?

225
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Lu Yan, are you okay?

226
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm okay

227
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Let's go

228
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
What are you doing with a broken knife?

229
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
To learn

230
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Ghost letter

231
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You won't take advantage of me not paying attention

232
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Do something strange to our Lu Yi Niang

233
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What can I do to her?

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
If she is a woman, what can I do?

235
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's a big man

236
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You dare not

237
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
If you dare to hit her idea

238
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Go

239
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Help me

240
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Is there anyone?

241
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Is there anyone?

242
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Help me

243
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Boss, I'm afraid of the ghost

244
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Welcome, choose more and see more

245
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Please

246
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Just here

247
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Sorry, you can't go in

248
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
why

249
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
This lady's clothes are not good enough

250
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Sorry

251
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Welcome, please

252
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Please

253
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Welcome, please

254
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What clothes to change if you have nothing

255
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Isn't this a hard scene?

256
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
No one against the window

257
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I've seen other places

258
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
No

259
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Please

260
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Your face is dirty

261
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
When did this come on?

262
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You don't have to cover it up

263
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
There is no difference in my opinion

264
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Please

265
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I won't let you die

266
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Let you see through

267
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
This is not a complaint

268
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Who doesn't want to be in front of his favorite

269
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Keep a good image

270
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Stop joking

271
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Who is joking

272
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
How about you

273
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I get it but I don't like it

274
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Boss Lu, your request is really

275
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm embarrassed

276
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Sir

277
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Sir

278
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
We will pass

279
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Mr. Gu searched the warehouse behind

280
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Didn't see Boss Bu

281
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Wait a minute

282
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I feel that his original power is nearby

283
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
You knew he was a spirit

284
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
My husband can calculate, of course

285
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Spirit groups often pretend to be human

286
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Survive in the human world

287
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
There are several spirits in a town

288
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's not a rare thing

289
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You heard it, Deng Deng

290
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
There are many spirits in this town

291
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
But don't worry

292
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I can protect you

293
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Boss Gu

294
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What if we two meet at the same time

295
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Spirit monster

296
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
With your broken knife

297
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Who is still alive

298
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Good good good

299
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Good good good

300
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Boss Gu

301
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Boss Gu

302
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Boss Gu

303
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Boss Gu

304
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Boss Gu

305
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
So beautiful

306
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's Boss Gu

307
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yes

308
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
This is the spirit

309
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Yes, I want to go to the warehouse to eat

310
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Boss Gu

311
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Boss Gu

312
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Boss Gu

313
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Boss Gu

314
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Boss Gu

315
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Welcome everyone

316
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Come to my new product launch

317
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I used to make a copy in the capital

318
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
For the emperor's dragon robe

319
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But in the eyes of those common people

320
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Only wisdom and dog fart rules

321
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Since then I swear

322
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
One day

323
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I want to exclaim the clothes made by the world for me

324
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You are very lucky

325
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Witnessed this miracle

326
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Good good good

327
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Boss Gu

328
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Boss Gu

329
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Boss Gu

330
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What happened to Boss Gu

331
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
What happened

332
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
This is the kind of spirit monster that turns the lights into this

333
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Let him drink a pot

334
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Don't make trouble here

335
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
This is the spirit tribe

336
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Let the people leave here

337
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Yes

338
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Good good

339
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Watch your feet

340
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Be careful

341
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Don't make trouble

342
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Be careful

343
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You are welcome to go out

344
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Are you okay

345
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Here

346
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Go over there

347
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Calm down

348
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Everyone calm down

349
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Uncle Ya

350
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Uncle Ya

351
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Uncle Ya

352
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Why are you here

353
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Boss Gu asked me to come

354
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Uncle Ya

355
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Uncle Ya

356
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Uncle Ya

357
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Uncle Ya

358
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Boss Gu asked me to come

359
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I didn't expect him

360
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I'll send you out

361
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Let's go

362
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
My camera

363
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
No need, what time is it

364
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
My camera

365
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Uncle Ya

366
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Be careful

367
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Slow down

368
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Slow down

369
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
When did this fall

370
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Why are you there

371
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
This is a thing that protects your life

372
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Take it

373
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
it is good

374
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I promise I won't lose it again

375
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Are you okay

376
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Let go of the ball

377
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Let go

378
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Give me a little more

379
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Give me a little more

380
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Stay away from me

381
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I'm gonna go

382
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Why is the antidote so tight

383
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Take it apart quickly

384
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Can't let that monster run

385
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
That monster is hurt

386
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Can't run far

387
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Close your eyes

388
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Close your eyes.

389
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,200
You're so close to me.

390
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,800
You can see my eyes.

391
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,200
The closer you are, the less you can see.

392
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,200
What are you thinking about?

393
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Nothing.

394
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,000
Are you taking advantage of me?

395
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,200
Why are you so close to me?

396
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,600
I'm not taking advantage of you.

397
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,000
I can't move, okay?

398
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
You did it on purpose.

399
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,600
I didn't do it on purpose.

400
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,800
But I like you.

401
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,400
Okay, stop it.

402
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,000
Hurry up and find a way out.

403
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,000
But how do I get out?

404
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,000
By the way,

405
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,600
my father used to talk nonsense when he drank.

406
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
He said my blood

407
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,800
can deal with those strange things.

408
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,600
Now that there are spirits,

409
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,800
I think what he said may be true.

410
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,800
Maybe the dead horse can be a living horse doctor

411
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,000
with my blood.

412
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,800
Did you hear what the girl said?

413
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,600
It seems to be blood.

414
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,800
Blood?

415
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,400
Is this a sword afraid of blood?

416
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,800
What are you doing?

417
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,400
Don't move.

418
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,200
Fortunately, my lord brought black dog blood.

419
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:30,800
You...

420
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,600
You killed the black dog in Qingquan Town.

421
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,600
Bullshit.

422
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,000
He is my brother.

423
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
He saved my life.

424
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Stop it.

425
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,600
The black dog blood is useless.

426
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,800
What's the use?

427
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,200
Don't move.

428
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,400
I'll deal with it.

429
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,400
What are you doing?

430
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,600
Didn't you say you'd deal with it?

431
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,200
I mean...

432
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,000
Okay, stop it.

433
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,000
Turn around and close your eyes.

434
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,600
Hurry up.

435
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,400
Hurry up.

436
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,400
Come on.

437
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
You are so stubborn

438
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,600
to be with these two rascals.

439
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,800
Master Gu,

440
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,400
I don't want to be with you either.

441
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,000
If my master hadn't done it,

442
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
you would be a seed inside.

443
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,800
Right.

444
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,200
Tell me.

445
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,200
What trick are you playing?

446
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Is it so hard to say thank you?

447
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,200
Who wants to thank him?

448
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Didn't you see that monster

449
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,800
was so angry at him?

450
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,600
He said he was a hunter.

451
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Do you believe it?

452
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,000
I do.

453
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,400
He is better than you.

454
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,600
I believe everything he says.

455
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,000
Listen,

456
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,800
from now on,

457
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
be honest with me.

458
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,400
Don't try to get in my way.

459
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,400
Okay, okay.

460
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,800
If we can't catch the criminal,

461
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,400
he won't survive tonight.

462
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,000
What are you doing?

463
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,000
What are you looking at?

464
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
He is pretty.

465
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,600
I do look pretty,

466
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,800
but I won't take advantage of you.

467
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,000
Listen,

468
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'll give you 500 silver dollars

469
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
for saving your life.

470
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,000
It's not the time.

471
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,200
Do you still want to pay?

472
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,200
You?

473
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,400
I'll kill you.

474
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,400
Don't be impulsive.

475
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,400
Just kill him.

476
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,400
Take advantage of him.

477
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,800
You can kill me,

478
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
but you can't kill my aesthetic

479
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,000
and pursuit.

480
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,200
Your aesthetic and pursuit

481
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,600
are to kill people.

482
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,600
People?

483
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,600
What people?

484
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
You can help them lose some weight.

485
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,600
You want their lives?

486
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,400
Make it clear.

487
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
What do you mean?

488
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,400
Your clothes and belt

489
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,400
are not the essence of the man?

490
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,200
Am I that idle?

491
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
Every piece of clothing

492
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
and every piece of clothing

493
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,000
is my hard work.

494
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Everything is my energy.

495
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,600
They can absorb some things,

496
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,800
but they don't absorb

497
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,600
essence.

498
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
They absorb fat.

499
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,600
Why do you want those fat things?

500
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,200
I don't want those things.

501
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,800
I want beauty.

502
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,600
Those fat people

503
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,000
can't wear the beauty of my clothes.

504
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,200
I'm helping them lose weight

505
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,400
to take advantage of them.

506
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
Cut the crap.

507
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,600
How do you prove it?

508
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,800
You can check it anytime.

509
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,400
I sold so many clothes.

510
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,800
I never hurt anyone.

511
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,000
If I'm lying,

512
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,400
and this General Yan wants to kill me,

513
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,000
it's the same as before.

514
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,400
We'll prove it

515
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,800
with your words.

516
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
If there's any lie...

517
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,800
You can come to me anytime.

518
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,000
My shop,

519
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,400
silk shop,

520
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,200
and all my shops

521
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,600
are in Qingquan Town.

522
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,400
I won't leave.

523
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Xing, Chang,

524
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,200
search around

525
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,600
for anything that could kill people.

526
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,200
Yes.

527
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,600
I'll go with you.

528
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,800
Let's split up.

529
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,800
Why did you

530
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,400
show your true self in public?

531
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,600
I don't want to either.

532
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,800
But there are lights flashing.

533
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,000
I'm dizzy.

534
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,800
Isn't this Uncle Ya's camera?

535
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,200
It's a camera.

536
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,000
It must be a camera.

537
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
It's a camera.

538
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It's a camera.

539
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,000
It's a camera.

540
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
It's a camera.

541
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
Uncle Ya?

542
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,600
I'll send you out.

543
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,000
Let's go.

544
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,200
What's the time?

545
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,200
Girl, look at the road.

546
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
He's not Uncle Ya.

547
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,200
He's the ancestor of Uncle Ya in Yirong City.

548
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,800
How are you?

549
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
I'm fine.

550
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,400
I'm as strong as before.

551
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,800
The speed of the poison

552
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
is getting faster.

553
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,800
I'm fine.

554
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,600
Why don't we

555
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,600
go to the photo studio?

556
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,400
Wait.

557
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,000
Why are you staring at me?

558
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,400
Linzi is in the photo studio.

559
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,000
There should be some time.

560
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,400
Find it carefully.

561
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,800
Okay.

562
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Mr. Lin, if you're worried about her,

563
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,200
go and have a look.

564
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,200
No need.

565
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
Find that spiritual group.

566
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,800
Solve her as soon as possible.

567
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,800
Mr. Lin,

568
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm sorry.

569
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,200
I'm sorry.

570
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
I'm sorry.

571
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I'm sorry.

572
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
I'm sorry.

573
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,400
I'm sorry.

574
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,200
It's okay.

575
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,600
Once we catch the spirit monster,

576
00:32:58,600 --> 00:32:59,800
her hair will turn black.

577
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,800
Don't be afraid.

578
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I'm afraid.

579
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,600
I just didn't expect

580
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,200
that I'm still

581
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,000
as pretty as before.

582
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
You're pretty.

583
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
I'm serious.

584
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:18,800
You're really pretty.

585
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,200
We've seen each other since we were kids.

586
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
When we were kids,

587
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,600
you were as skinny and slender as a kid.

588
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,800
You've grown up.

589
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,200
You've finally grown up.

590
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,600
You're a little bit like that.

591
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,200
You're so strong.

592
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
You can't even protect yourself.

593
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Although your hair is white now,

594
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,200
it looks pretty poor.

595
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,400
I think it's okay

596
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,600
if it's white all the time.

597
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,800
Who asked you to think so?

598
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,200
I'm worried

599
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,000
if I keep looking at you like this,

600
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,800
what will Lu Yan Hui think?

601
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,200
Why do you always mention that man?

602
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:17,020
If you're really afraid of being a

603
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,220
marry-off topic what will you do?

604
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:24,420
I think

605
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,020
when the time comes

606
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:31,420
when you become theMartian has completely converted into a great weapon

607
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,020
it will be easy for him all the time.

608
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,620
Do you think

609
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,140
I will give that ungrateful woman

610
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,020
a reason to come back again?

611
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,820
For now,

612
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,420
only once,

613
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,200
He...

614
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:47,940
Sir.

615
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,380
Check these out.

616
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,500
These are the photos of the North Elk?

617
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,020
All the old men are here?

618
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,240
But none of them are here?

619
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,160
These are Qirs.

620
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:08,540
We got them here chained to us

621
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,400
since they were close.

622
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,520
But those children

623
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,080
has been missing for over a month.

624
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,640
Sir, look.

625
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,560
This is the wedding photo of you and the Chief.

626
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,320
I remember it now.

627
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,520
It's said that there is a kind of spirit

628
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,560
that produces a slightly invisible poison.

629
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,360
It should release this poison

630
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,560
when taking photos.

631
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,400
Then it is used as a medium

632
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,000
to absorb the energy of the poisoned person

633
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,040
into its own body.

634
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,000
The Chief should have a special body

635
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,280
so that it didn't get completely poisoned.

636
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,440
So awesome.

637
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:36,800
Humans can't understand it.

638
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,680
It doesn't mean that the power of the spirit doesn't exist.

639
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,680
Then why is he okay?

640
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,800
He didn't see it clearly.

641
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,040
What a coincidence.

642
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,640
You didn't see it clearly.

643
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,680
Shut up.

644
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,960
But Tong Wei is a spirit.

645
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,160
Why did he kill Boss Bu?

646
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,280
He tried to fight us

647
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,920
and attacked you.

648
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,600
You said that

649
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,880
he looked like a toothed uncle.

650
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,880
Then the toothed uncle...

651
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,960
I'm afraid that the toothed uncle has...

652
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,520
He won't.

653
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,000
Let's go find him now.

654
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,320
Maybe we can save him.

655
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,400
Hurry up. Let's go.

656
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,280
Hurry up.

657
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,920
Chief.

658
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,240
Are you okay?

659
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:24,960
Hurry up.

660
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,000
Let's go.

661
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,320
I'm fine.

662
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:30,760
This...

663
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,560
What's wrong?

664
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,920
I'm getting old.

665
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,200
Wait.

666
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,360
Don't worry.

667
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,760
I'll ask my brothers to find him.

668
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,400
We'll definitely find that spirit monster.

669
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,680
It's too late.

670
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,400
It takes at least an hour for the villagers to go down the mountain.

671
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,480
But we can't sit here and wait.

672
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,640
Sir.

673
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,240
This is the news from the informant.

674
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,360
The injured spirit group

675
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,360
is heading south.

676
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,480
The spirit group is heading south.

677
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,680
The spirit group is heading south.

678
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:05,880
The spirit group is heading south.

679
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,720
The spirit group is heading south.

680
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,120
Be careful.

681
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,240
Don't follow me.

682
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
Hurry up.

683
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,920
I found the spirit group's energy.

684
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,680
Sir told me to protect you.

685
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,880
I don't need you to protect me.

686
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:34,800
One more person

687
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,320
will give us more clues.

688
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,440
Go find him.

689
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,440
Hurry up.

690
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,080
Okay.

691
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
Come here.

692
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,120
Hurry up.

693
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:00,520
This...

694
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,040
This is...

695
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,120
Judging from the size of the skull

696
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,480
and the length of the leg,

697
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,760
it should be some teenagers over ten years old.

698
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,560
Those kids?

699
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,480
Be careful.

700
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,280
This is Uncle Yashu's treasure.

701
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,120
When he was 50 years old,

702
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,800
my father gave it to him personally.

703
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,040
I'm very sure.

704
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:48,080
It seems that this is the old town he killed.

705
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,960
Finally, I found this stupid house.

706
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
There are no far-off waves

707
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,080
in the ten miles of square.

708
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,720
It seems that he has left here.

709
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,080
Sir, let's go out and find him.

710
00:38:59,080 --> 00:38:59,720
Yes.

711
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,720
Let's go find him.

712
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,920
I can hold on.

713
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,040
Let's rest here for a while.

714
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,600
A'xin, come here.

715
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,320
Let's go.

716
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,040
Dengzi...

717
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,400
What are you both doing that you're so nervous?

718
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,920
Don't look at me like this.

719
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,880
I have my strength.

720
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,400
I also have my legs.

721
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,760
I'm telling you,

722
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,280
when I catch that monster,

723
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,960
I will make a supp defenders for you first.

724
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:55,680
Dad.

725
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,840
Not bad.

726
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,520
I'll take a kiss

727
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,960
and let you all see

728
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,000
Stop talking

729
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,240
When are you still joking

730
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,800
Nonsense

731
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,520
When did it become like this

732
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,680
Not long

733
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,400
You're still forcing it

734
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,720
Those creditors

735
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
Should be the same as me

736
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,200
Lu Yan

737
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,520
You knew I would come early

738
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,360
Will die

739
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,320
Right

740
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,880
I'm sorry

741
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,880
I'm sorry

742
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:57,880
I'm sorry

743
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,880
I'm sorry

744
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,880
I'm sorry

745
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,880
I'm sorry

746
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,880
I'm sorry

747
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,880
I'm sorry

748
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,880
I'm sorry

749
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,880
I'm sorry

750
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,880
I'm sorry

751
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,880
I'm sorry

752
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,880
I'm sorry

753
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,880
I'm sorry

754
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,880
I'm sorry

755
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,880
I'm sorry

756
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:11,880
I'm sorry

757
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,880
I'm sorry

758
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,880
I'm sorry

759
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,880
I'm sorry

760
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,880
I'm sorry

761
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:16,880
I'm sorry

762
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,880
I'm sorry

763
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,880
I'm sorry

764
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,880
I'm sorry

765
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:20,880
I'm sorry

766
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,880
I'm sorry

767
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,880
I'm sorry

768
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,880
