[Episode 18]

27
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,670
General Yan,

28
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,340
since you insist on following me,

29
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,140
you have to make contributions.

30
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:46,800
What do you want?

31
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,289
I wonder if there is any place

32
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:49,370
that spirit clan can't go.

33
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,690
Food, daily necessities and entertainment.

34
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,580
Check them to see if anything is wrong.

35
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,180
If you want to know that,

36
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,870
ask people around her.

37
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,440
I know it. Ask me.

38
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,660
I'm the closet girl to last concubine.

39
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,820
Sir, you'd better ask me.

40
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,040
Who are you two?

41

What are you doing here?

I heard an eminent evil-expelling master come to the house.

43
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:13,330
I didn't expect to see such a handsome gentleman.

44

have dinner at your place tonight.

48
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,430
Save your soup

49
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,670
for our Master.

50
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,970
Sister Three, aren't you supposed to visit your parents' home?

51

Alright. Alright. Alright.

Please tell us about last concubine.

Who knows if I would be the next one missing?

I feel so afraid every day.

62
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,800
Yeah. I'm afraid too.

-I'm so afraid.
-Master.

There is no way to investigate the case.

68
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,590

Ms. Yu.

72
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,810
I never expected to meet you in my home again

73
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,470
after the day in the mountain.

74
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:08,770
I apologize.

75
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,230
We made a mistake last time

76
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,940
because we tried to ask for your father's help.

77
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,020
Why are you here?

78
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,329
I'm waiting for you.

79
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,640
Gu Beixi has talked to me.

80
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:21,480
He told me you are his friend

81
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:23,690
and asked me to give you some help.

82
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,880
So if you need any help

83
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,910
in the mansion,

84
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,940
come to me.

85
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,680
Gu Beixi?

86
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,579
How come that stupid guy

87
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,400
has a friend in Yingdu?

88
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,650
I got it.

89
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,770
The friend he mentioned.

90
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,870
Are you

91
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:43,370
his fiancée?

92
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,070
So it was you.

93
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,780
Your family name is Bai.

94
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,700
He covers it so well.

95
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,720
Look at you, tall girl.

96
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,110
You are such a beauty.

97
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:00,060
He is so lucky.

98
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,990
Don't say that. Ms. Yu.

99
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,200
Besides,

100
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,700
Gu Beixi doesn't want to marry me.

101
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:09,820
Then...

102
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,510
Then I shall apologize for being brusque.

103
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,300
I mean...

104
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,860
Don't be sad. Let me tell you.

105
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,519
That stinky guy doesn't deserve your feelings for him.

106
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,920
He doesn't have manners.

107
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,930
There's never enough dilly-dally and nonsense from him.

108
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,450
A lady like you

109
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,000
should find someone who

110
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,390
matches you better.

111
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,930
No. No.

112
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:29,990
Ms. Yu,

113
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,990
can I ask you a question?

114
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:32,730
Go ahead.

115
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,030
Is the guy who came here yesterday

116
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,280
your husband?

117
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:40,060
Have you got married?

118
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,350
A doomed love.

119
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,450
Actually,

120
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,000
he is my heroic husband.

121
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,250
Heroic husband?

122
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,930
You even have a heroic husband

123
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,090
at such a young age?

124
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,140
This is a long story.

125
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,650
But rest assured.

126
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,800
He definitely means you no harm.

127
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,130
He came here for the same purpose. To investigate the cases.

128
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,980
Oh, right. Ms. Bai.

129
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,400
Gu Beixi is still wanted outside.

130
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,620
I suppose your father

131
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,040
doesn't know his prospective son-in-law is wanted.

132
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,690
If he knows it someday,

133
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,930
there will

134
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,820
definitely be more troubles.

135
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,470
I know.

136
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:23,510
Rest assured.

137
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,690
I will do my best to help him handle troubles.

138
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,350
I won't let my father hurt him.

139
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,690
And I will do my best to help you, too.

140
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,420
You are very loyal to your friend.

141
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,770
I like you so much.

142
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,510
Don't get this the wrong way.

143
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,980
I admire you.

144
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,390
I like you so much, too.

145
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,500
You are so

146
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:42,870
straightforward.

147
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,560
What's happening?

148
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,260
Master.

149
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,040
It's the bed I prepare for Mr. Lu.

150
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,240
Don't call me Master.

151
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,070
Then I'll call you Ms. Yu.

152
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,250
Forget about the titles.

153
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,190
Why did you move Lu Yan's bed

154
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,470
into my room?

155
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,640
I just think

156
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:06,840
Mr. Lu needs a comfortable place to sleep at night.

157
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,700
He can't sleep in the chair forever.

158
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,100
You eavesdropped us?

159
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,910
I didn't.

160
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,230
You know his character.

161
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,750
He wouldn't let you sleep on the floor.

162
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,830
He would let you sleep in bed.

163
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,630
And sleeps in the chair himself.

164
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,760
Let me ask you.

165
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,510
When you moved the bed,

166
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,350
did you catch others' attention?

167
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,550
No. Absolutely not.

168
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,830
If you dare to blow your cover

169
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,390
and let others know you are spirit clansmen,

170
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:32,990
which will bring me trouble,

171
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,440
you know what will happen, don't you?

172
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,390
Rest assured.

173
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,470
If anything goes wrong,

174
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,909
Mr. Lu will face all the consequences himself.

175
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:41,710
Mr. Lu didn't come back with you?

176
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,310
Surrounded by women,

177
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,090
he is having a sweet dream now.

178
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,030
Lu Yan.

179
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,830
With his beauty,

180
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,130
he flirts with various women.

181
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,080
Why are you leaving?

182
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,550
Tell him what I said.

183
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,030
Bai Shiqi.

184
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,240
Bai Shiqi.

185
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,960
You want to see Ms. Yu?

186
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,070
I want to see you.

187
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,830
Let me ask you one thing.

188
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,030
Did a man called Lu Yan

189
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,200
come to Dengdeng?

190
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,350
You mean her

191
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,600
heroic husband?

192
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,390
No wonder I can't find him

193
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,590
in the inn he lives in.

194
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,710
Shiqi.

195
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,190
Please do me a favor.

196
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,660
I want to see your father.

197
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,290
[Wanted]

198
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,920
Qingquan Town.

199
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,240
Gu Beixi!

200
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,540
It is you.

201
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,670
Not someone sharing your name.

202
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,220
Pal. Let me ask you.

203
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,460
Are you the son of Gu Deshui?

204
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,090
Yes.

205
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,059
Father-in-law.

206
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:33,620
-I...
-Hold on a second.

207
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,880
Don't cozy up to me.

208
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,940
I'm not your father-in-law.

209
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,020
Let's get something straight.

210
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,750
How did you become a wanted man?

211
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,650
I bet you have met Yu Dengdeng.

212
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,410
We are wrongly accused.

213
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,820
What? Are you trying to help her?

214
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,920
Actually, I want to help you.

215
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,610
Help me?

216
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,670
Alright, I'll let you help me.

217
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,310
But you must know.

218
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,740
Yu Dengdeng

219
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,580
has written a soldier writ.

220
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,110
The writ also works for me.

221
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:05,120
If we can't catch the culprit,

222
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,750
I'm willing to take the punishment with her.

223
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,340
Cool.

224
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,030
You are a man.

225
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,070
You made a good speech.

226
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,210
You.

227
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,600
Pick it up for me.

228
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,180
Why are you hiding?

229
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:18,940
Tell me who gives you the right to hide?

230
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,500
I've sent you so many letters.

231
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,610
You never replied.

232
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,760
Not a single word.

233
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,840
What do you mean?

234
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:29,920
Father-in-law.

235
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,870
You may not know

236
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:34,160
that various forces are living

237
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,450
in the18 mountains of Qingquan Town.

238
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,670
There must be some naughty boy

239
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,490
who has blocked your letters.

240
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,620
I haven't received one single letter in Nanfeng Stronghold.

241
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,210
Are you trying to fool me?

242
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,230
So many letters. Did all of them get blocked?

243
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,360
Such a coincidence?

244
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,190
Coincidence. I never received one single letter.

245
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,150
Alright.

246
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:54,650
As long as you are here.

247
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,490
Let Shiqi arrange a room for you to rest.

248
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,790
Father-in-law.

249
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:02,680
I want to ask you to do me a favor.

250
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,670
Can I see Ms. Bai?

251
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,670
Who?

252
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,560
Ms. Bai.

253
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,020
I mean. What's wrong with you?

254
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,270
Didn't Shiqi show you in?

255
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,410
Didn't you see her?

256
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,190
Isn't Shiqi the seventeenth?

257
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,750
I mean the eldest Ms. Bai.

258
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,990
Oh, boy.

259
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,570
It turns out that you don't

260
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:25,140
even know who is your fiancée until now.

261
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,070
Bad Lu Yan.

262
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:32,870
Such an unfaithful playboy!

263
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,010
Lu Huohuo chops and changes so often.

264
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,580
What are you doing?

265
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:48,830
Don't interrupt me.

266
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,630
I haven't finished my practice.

267
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,180
What are you practicing?

268
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,390
The ground-rolling monster-catching kungfu.

269
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,850
Especially for fickle playboys.

270
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,260
Alright. Take your time.

271
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:05,880
[Ice Cream]

272
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,790
What?

273
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Practice with me.

274
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,540
Don't let me win. Be serious.

275
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,350
Cool.

276
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,020
You have practiced locking arrest.

277
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,870
Lu Yan. You use skills.

278
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,910
That's cheating!

279
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,250
I haven't finished practicing.

280
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,010
Stop it.

281
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:45,190
Your kungfu can only deal with me.

282
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,510
Don't use it to fight against others.

283
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,370
You may hurt yourself and others.

284
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:52,190
I can deal with an old monster like you.

285
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,390
It will be a piece of cake to beat others.

286
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:56,870
Alright.

287
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:59,510
You want to learn spirit clan's skills, don't you?

288
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,350
If you behave, I will teach you.

289
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,710
Behave?

290
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,030
I have got a score to settle with you,

291
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,340
how come you are threatening me?

292
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,090
Calm down. Calm down.

293
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,090
I'm the Chief.

294
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:09,590
Hold my temper. Think about the bigger picture.

295
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:10,240
Deal.

296
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:11,810
Alright.

297
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,150
Ms. Yu.

298
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:19,830
Ms. Yu.

299
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,570
Master left a word for you.

300
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,010
He has arranged a crew for you.

301
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:24,270
But you have

302
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,550
to be quicker.

303
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,590
Catch the culprit in five days.

304
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,630
Find Master's last concubine.

305
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,430
What?

306
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,510
Chief Bai

307
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,380
is so foxy.

308
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,590
What a coincidence!

309
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,390
Your name is Bai Shiqi.

310
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,100
I thought you rank seventeenth in the Bai Family.

311
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,210
I didn't expect

312
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,210
you are the Ms. Bai.

313
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,420
I know.

314
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,110
I thought you would feel uncomfortable

315
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,570
after you know it.

316
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,760
Maybe you will avoid seeing me.

317
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,870
But I want to see you.

318
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,280
So, I didn't tell you.

319
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,070
What?

320
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,710
Even if you thought I am

321
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,840
the seventeenth lady in the Bai Family,

322
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,070
it's not hard to tell

323
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,350
that I like you, right?

324
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:43,930
I mean.

325
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,210
I never think it that way.

326
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,450
I have been treating you as my friend.

327
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:50,510
I didn't blame you.

328
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,660
And you see.

329
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:54,040
You like Ms. Yu.

330
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,080
But she has no idea at all.

331
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,550
She has her own

332
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:58,330
husband.

333
00:13:59,310 --> 00:13:59,910
Me?

334
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,270
I like you.

335
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,940
But you know nothing at all, either.

336
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,880
And you have an interest in another girl, too.

337
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:08,070
Karma.

338
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,070
It's fair.

339
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,070
I didn't realize

340
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,170
you have a sharp tongue.

341
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,210
You didn't realize I'm your fiancée, either.

342
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,620
But

343
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,220
you have to be careful here.

344
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,340
If my father realizes your thought,

345
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,560
he won't let you go.

346
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:30,320
Rest assured.

347
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,030
After I solve the problem for her,

348
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:34,230
I will make myself clear to your father.

349
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,650
I hope you don't distance yourself from me in a hurry.

350
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,270
You can pursue your love,

351
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,180
and so can I.

352
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,510
And you said

353
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,470
human can only live once.

354
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,830
I want to spend my life with the one I like, too.

355
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,950
Let's go.

356
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,830
My father has arranged you in South Garden.

357
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,830
Ms. Yu lives in West Garden.

358
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,640
If you want to see her,

359
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,960
it's a little bit far.

360
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,050
[The Bai Mansion]

361
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,860
Other victims

362
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:15,590
stayed for a short time at the place where they went missing.

363
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,020
It may be the same with last concubine.

364
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,290
The calico cat of the last concubine.

365
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,350
Will it be…

366
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,710
Same with others,

367
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,390
you can control the cat secretly,

368
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,920
can't you? Last concubine.

369
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,980
Do you mean

370
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,260
last concubine controlled the cat?

371
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,690
Then is there any way to find her?

372
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,510
Let me have a try.

373
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,840
What's wrong? Can't you do that?

374
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,240
There is something alive in its body.

375
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:10,180
No matter how much energy I pour in,

376
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,420
nothing happens.

377
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,510
Then what shall we do?

378
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,290
Thank you for saving my life.

379
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,910
How did you become like this?

380
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:41,230
What's the matter about the disappearances in Yingdu?

381
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,990
Those missing people

382
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,150
are actually all spirit clansmen.

383
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,210
The cases are actually because we have lost our energy.

384
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,800
We can only communicate with others

385
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,480
by controlling animals.

386
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,440
Then why do so many spirit clansmen

387
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,040
become like this of a sudden?

388
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,790
Not long ago,

389
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,250
a kind of spiritual worm which can increase energy

390
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,500
suddenly appeared in the Mysterious Market.

391
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,450
Neighboring spirit clansmen all go to get it after hearing the news.

392
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,450
In the beginning,

393
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,150
the worm got into our bodies.

394
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,900
It did help us greatly increase our energy

395
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,160
and make us energetic.

396
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:13,700
But we didn't expect

397
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,030
that our bodies became weaker and weaker.

398
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,160
Our spirit blurred,

399
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,910
and our energy vanished.

400
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,079
And our bodies gradually became transparent

401
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,000
till we die.

402
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:24,450
Many spirit clans have died.

403
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,270
Only a few of us grasped the method

404
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:28,490
of living inside an animal.

405
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,750
What is that?

406
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,920
It's the same as

407
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,590
harmful poison.

408
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,530
But, last concubine, you look fine.

409
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,780
Why did you use

410
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,840
that kind of trash?

411
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,590
Master loves me because I'm young and beautiful.

412
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,850
I'm afraid that one day

413
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:48,420
I will be old and ugly.

414
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,790
Do you know the cradle

415
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,550
of the spiritual worm?

416
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,320
I bought it from a tavern in the Mysterious Market.

417
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:57,880
As for where the seller got them,

418
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,700
an ordinary spirit clansman like me has no idea.

419
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:04,870
Lu Yan.

420
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,080
Then

421
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:09,070
can you expel the spiritual worm from her body?

422
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,200
Let me have a try.

423
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,300
How is it going?

424
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:35,140
The spiritual worm is fed on energy.

425
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,370
No matter how much energy I pour in,

426
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,850
I can't expel it.

427
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:39,920
And

428
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,050
all my energy will be absorbed.

429
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,680
What darn worm is it?

430
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,030
They only get into the body but don't get out.

431
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,230
Is there really no way to deal with them?

432
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,480
They

433
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:51,950
may not be the ordinary spiritual worms.

434
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,540
I'm afraid that if they continue to spread,

435
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,390
we spirit clan may…

436
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,170
We may...

437
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,790
I can't hold on anymore.

438
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,630
And I would like to ask you to

439
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,030
help us find a solution as soon as possible.

440
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,540
The spiritual worms are inside their bodies.

441
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,420
The speed of eating energy is getting faster.

442
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,910
I have to set up a barrier,

443
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:50,030
so as to help them prolong their lifetime.

444
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:50,800
A barrier?

445
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,200
It's amazing.

446
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,500
This barrier can help them

447
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,140
slow down the rate at which the energy is eaten.

448
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,190
But...

449
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,080
They can't leave the barrier.

450
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,750
Once they do,

451
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,610
with their current condition,

452
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,270
their lives won't last more than four hours.

453
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:20,410
Understand.

454
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,340
Lu Yan.

455
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,400
Can you teach me?

456
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,260
I want to help you to reduce some of the burdens.

457
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:32,590
There is Yun Xi's spirit inside your body.

458
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:34,110
If you master it,

459
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,880
it should have the same effect.

460
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,560
Then teach me.

461
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:39,890

00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,860
there must be a successful man.

514
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:08,780
I trust you.

515
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,190
Well, Dengdeng.

516
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:12,230
You've just learned it.

517
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,050
Don't worry, I can do it.

518
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,070
The most important thing now

519
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,330
is to save Peng Dahai.

520
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,850
I'm counting on you for Dahai’s innocence.

521
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,620
Okay.

522
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,710
If anything happens to you,

523
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,200
remember to call me with the hair pin.

One just ran away, while another is coming.

528
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,500
Do you think that I'm easy to deal with?

529
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,810
Don't worry.

530
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,540
It will be fine soon.

531
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,490
Why?

532
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:11,210
Because there is a general named Lu Yan.

533
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,290
He has powerful energy and skills.

534
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,030
As soon as he takes action,

535
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,090
he could kill all those bad guys

536
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,730
who released the spiritual worms.

541
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,530
Seems that something needs to deal with.

542
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,460
Master Yu!

543
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,150
Well,

544
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,870
what’s going on?

545
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,790
Chief Bai, the date that you set has not yet arrived.

546
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,630
Are you here now for expressing your concern?

547
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:53,950
Master Yu.

548
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:56,070
Don't play games with me.

549
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,070
This is how you spirit-hunter investigate cases?

550
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,750
If my men hadn't told me,

551
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,640
I wouldn't believe it.

552
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:03,650
Look at

553
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:06,850
these chickens, sheep, pigs,

554
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,610
and even geese.

555
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:09,670
Well,

556
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:12,130
you want to cook these animals in my home?

557
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,280
What are you waiting for?

558
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,260
Throw them all out!

559
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:16,950
Go!

560
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,180
Don't do that!

561
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:24,270
You're all stupid.

562
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:26,540
You're only doing bad things for Chief Bai.

563
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,120
Chief Bai, you're too eager.

564
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:30,790
I haven't finished my speech yet.

565
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:32,060
You've wronged

566
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:34,310
my kind heart greatly.

567
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,040
What do you mean?

568
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,920
These animals

569
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:41,150
are the evidence for you to solve the missing people case.

570
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,510
These animals are evidence?

571
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,630
Tell me about it.

572
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,580
Don't get excited when I tell you.

573
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,980
Let me explain it to you like this.

574
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,590
These animals

575
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,840
are the hosts of the missing people in the city.

576
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,580
Recently,

577
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:57,830
the spirit clan

578
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,400
found a kind of worm.

579
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,110
It can increase their spirit
energy.

580
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,740
But after they used it,

581
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:04,360
it backfired..

582
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,920
Their spirit energy was gone, and their bodies disintegrated.

583
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,230
They had no choice and didn’t know what to do.

584
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,230
They were driven into a corner.

585
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:11,470
So they chose the bodies of these animals as their hosts.

586
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,980
You can see that they are weak and violent.

587
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,580
It's because the spiritual worms in their bodies

588
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,640
are eating them up.

589
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,030
They are in pain.

590
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,650
And my subordinate

591
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,020
has entered the Mysterious Market

592
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,320
to find out the truth

593
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:23,840
about trafficking these spiritual worms.

594
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,820
So within a day,

595
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,180
we'll have the answer.

596
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,410
I didn't understand a single word that you said.

597
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,820
But I'm scared.

598
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,280
Chief.

599
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,070
God, I'm really scared.

600
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,020
Well.

601
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,280
Are they all gone?

602
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:37,990
Yes.

603
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,140
They've all gone transparent?

604
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:40,780
Yes.

605
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,690
Yu Dengdeng.

606
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:42,950
Are you stupid?

607
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,870
Do you think that I am also as stupid as you?

608
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,590
Do you think that I can believe your crap

609
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,650
about changing living people into a bunch of animals?

610
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,920
Why didn't you say that my last concubine

611
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,890
turned into a moth and flew away?

612
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,700
What are you laughing at?

613
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:54,960
Throw them away.

614
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:55,750
Go!

615
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,090
No, don't do that.

616
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,150
What's wrong, Chief?

617
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:01,670
Look!

618
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,350
Is this my last concubine’s cat?

619
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,800
It looks like... It really is!

620
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,170
Chief Bai.

621
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,900
Chief Bai, you...

622
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:11,450
My dear.

623
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,600
You can't take it out.

624
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,800
You can't take it out.

625
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,520
If you insist on taking it out,

626
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,820
believe it or not, it will die.

627
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,580
Get off me!

628
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,850
The cat's life is worth more than yours.

629
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:21,710
Why are you here?

630
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,110
Chief, Chief, this cat…

631
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,430
What's wrong, my dear?

632
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,580
My dear, what's wrong with you?

633
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,500
You've got eyes, and you can see it.

634
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,120
If this cat leaves the circle,

635
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,400
it will die in a moment.

636
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,270
You can ignore their lives.

637
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,660
But if the evidence disappeared,

638
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:37,380
the County Magistrate will blame you.

639
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,680
Can you bear it?

640
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,370
But you have no proof.

641
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,850
Just these, these,

642
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,450
these spirits and animal things that you have said,

643
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,590
how can I explain this to the County Magistrate?

644
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,470
Chief Bai,

645
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,250
I can prove it to you.

646
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:49,900
But,

647
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,910
this is a matter of great importance.

648
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,590
I can only show it to you alone.

649
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,430
Tell them to leave first.

650
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,840
Wait for me outside.

651
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,030
Yes.

652
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,360
Let’s go.

653
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,440
I'm telling you, Yu Dengdeng.

654
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,770
Don't play tricks on me.

655
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:06,780
If you lie to me,

656
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,710
you know what will happen to you.

657
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:11,930
Last concubine.

658
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:12,960
I'm sorry.

659
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,050
I guess that I can't help you to hide it today.

660
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,770
Last concubine.

661
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,390
I am sorry to offend you.

662
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,070
Well...

663
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,660
What are you calling her?

664
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,230
Little boy.

665
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:56,200
Chief.

666
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,550
That girl really lies to us, right?

667
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,080
Get away.

668
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:58,990
Yes.

669
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,850
The glutinous rice cake is so sweet!

670
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,380
It's so sweet that my teeth can’t bear it.

671
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:08,310
I think that Dengdeng must like it.

672
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:10,090
Everyone's been investigating those missing people all night.

673
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:12,360
You're the only one who's relaxing here, eating and drinking.

674
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,500
If you are still dripping acid, with sarcasm,

675
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,830
I'll kick you severely!

676
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,070
Uncle Bai.

677
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,630
How did they get out of the West Garden?

678
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:29,090
The Master is still there.

679
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,130
They are not going to bother Dengdeng, are they?

680
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:33,900
Dengdeng!

681
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:35,790
Dengdeng!

682
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:36,520
Master!

683
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:37,480
Are you okay?

684
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:38,970
Gu Beixi!

685
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,350
Why are you here?

686
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:41,890
I told you

687
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,790
that I will always stand by you.

688
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,260
I just saw Chief Bai walking out of here.

689
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,300
Did he give you any trouble?

690
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:47,740
Did he?

691
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,070
Chief Bai said that he sent some people to help me.

692
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,250
So it was you.

693
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,750
Don't worry, he just did the daily questioning.

694
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,830
I can handle him.

695
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,330
That's ok.

696
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,230
I bought you some glutinous rice cake.

697
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:59,290
Well, have a taste.

698
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,050
I've been working all night.

699
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,870
That's exactly what I want to eat.

700
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,180
Xin, try some too.

701
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,220
Even though I don't even need to have a taste,

702
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,110
I know that it does not look as good as what Mr. Lu bought.

703
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:09,640
Since you don't want to eat,

704
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,130
why don’t you save your crap?

705
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:11,690
You…

706
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,190
Thank you.

707
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,000
Do you want a piece?

708
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,750
These people go back and forth.

709
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,780
What's all the fuss about? It’s so bustling.

710
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,910
What else can they do?

711
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,540
Tomorrow is Ms. Bai's birthday.

712
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,610
All the people in the Bai Mansion

713
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,740
are preparing for her birthday party.

714
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:31,010
You don't even know about your fiancée’s birthday?

715
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,670
What fiancée?

716
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,190
I'm here to break off my engagement.

717
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,310
In my opinion,

718
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,430
this Ms. Bai...

719
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:41,410
She's tall and pretty.

720
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,870
She's more than enough to match you, the chieftain of the stronghold.

721
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:46,620
Don't be unaware of the blessings in your life.

722
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,940
That's right.

723
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:53,480
You are matching the unsuitable man and woman together.

724
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:02,430
Chief Bai usually looks cunning, slippery

725
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,770
and heartless.

726
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,510
I didn't expect

727
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,380
that he was so concerned with last concubine.

728
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:12,390
Someone seems to be insane in daily life.

729
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:15,840
Actually, she is really insane.

730
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,460
Who are you talking about?

731
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,320
You're always talking nonsense.

732
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,170
Well,

733
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,460
Lu Yan has been there for a long time.

734
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,140
Why hasn't he come back yet?

735
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:27,670
Yeah.

736
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,790
He has been gone for a long time.

737
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,030
Speak of the devil and he'll be here.

738
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,550
Sir.

739
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,170
How's it going? Did you find out anything?

740
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,860
The tavern owner is dead.

741
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,560
What did I say?

742
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,520
It's better to count on yourself than on others.

743
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,150
But I found the suspect who killed the owner.

744
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,400
Where is he?

745
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,030
In the Storage Room.

746
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,230
Great!

747
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,570
Xin, you go first.

748
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,310
Okay.

749
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,510
Gu Beixi, take our weapons.

750
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,130
Go and meet him.

751
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,310
Come on, take a look.

752
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:10,470
That's him.

753
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,920
Take off the hood.

754
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:36,610
Father!

755
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,560
Father-in-law!

756
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,850
Who's your father-in-law?

757
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:39,860
Who told you to kick him?

758
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,230
Former Chieftain!

759
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,200
Let go! Hurry up!

760
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,080
Let go! Let go!

761
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:43,160
Let go!

762
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:44,030
Father!

763
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:46,940
Father!

764
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,080
You... You...

765
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,020
You! What are you doing here?

766
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:51,770
You old bastard Yu!

767
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:52,960
I am so worried about you.

768
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,830
I haven't heard from you for days.

769
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,180
Why did you come here?

770
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,360
Who the hell is it?

771
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,890
How dare he kidnapped my father?

772
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:04,450
Let me catch him and I'll cut him into pieces.

773
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,700
It’s…It's him.

774
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,820
Father, say it out...

775
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,060
Who is the bastard? Tell me!

776
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:11,330
It's…

777
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:12,870
It's him!

778
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,940
Is this your father?

779
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,200
Be careful, it's hot. Slowly.

780
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,240
Slowly, slowly.

781
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,130
Yu Dengdeng!

782
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,740
You are an unfilial girl.

783
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:35,880
Why didn’t you keep down-to-earth

784
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,740
and stay at Qingquan Stronghold?

785
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:38,730
What are you doing here?

786
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,080
You're still finding fault with me?

787
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,230
Look at you.

788
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:44,270
You've been drinking again? You're drunk.

789
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:46,460
Where have you been for the past few months?

790
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,390
You left me alone and unconcerned.

791
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:50,650
I don't know what this is all about today.

792
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,910
Don't ask me.

793
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,300
Ask your good husband.

794
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,780
How could he have so confusingly

795
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,250
tied me up here?

796
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:57,990
Husband?

797
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:01,370
That's a good name.

798
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:02,950
That's not the point.

799
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,320
Daughter, I want to tell you

800
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:07,980
that this guy is not an ordinary person.

801
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,820
He's a monster of the spirit clan.

802
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,680
Take my advice.

803
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:11,820
Break up with him.

804
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:13,720
I'll find you a better one.

805
00:38:14,470 --> 00:38:16,110
He is not a monster of the spirit clan.

806
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,700
He's an ancient general from 3,000 years ago.

807
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,250
He's a living person who ate the energy core.

808
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,220
If you want to find a better one for me,

809
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,070
I think there's no one better than him.

810
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,140
The two of us are the most suitable and compatible.

811
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,570
There is a saying…

812
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,510
It is…

813
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:31,290
Be in perfect harmony.

814
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,540
Be in perfect harmony. That's right.

815
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,380
Be in perfect harmony.

816
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,620
Three thousand years?

817
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,060
And the ancient general?

818
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,450
His surname is Lu?

819
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:43,460
You, you come over here.

820
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,480
You mean that

821
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,520
he is General Lu, the ancestor of the spirit-hunter?

822
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,110
I also learned about the spirit-hunter

823
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,540
from Dengdeng.

824
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:53,850
Shut up!

825
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:54,990
In my opinion,

826
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:58,230
you're the combination of spirit clan and human being.

827
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,260
Dengdeng,

828
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,870
Why do you believe what other people say,

829
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,460
but not your father?

830
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,120
If you marry this guy...

831
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,830
I won’t agree.

832
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:08,440
You can't disagree.

833
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:11,100
You have to accept this marriage even if you don't like it.

834
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,100
I've spent all the dowry they gave me.

835
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:16,510
Are you trying to make me angry?

836
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,770
I... I...

837
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,670
Old Yu...

838
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,780
Please, don't be angry.

839
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,140
Don't be angry. Don't be angry.

840
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,940
Father-in-law, please calm down.

841
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,200
You're still injured.

842
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,130
It’s not good for you to get angry.

843
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,600
Don't get angry. Don't get angry. Don't get angry.

844
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,260
Come on, come on, take it easy.

845
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,120
I'm so angry.

846
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,660
Don't be angry, don't be angry!

847
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,630
Come on, come on, come on, father-in-law.

848
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:33,220
Take your medicine. Come on.

849
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,640
All right, all right, all right.

850
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,190
Look at you.

851
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:38,250
What are you talking about? Who's your father-in-law?

852
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,560
My nephew, you're just in time.

853
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,470
You've always listened to me since you were a kid.

854
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,740
Talk to Dengdeng.

855
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,660
If she marries that guy,

856
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,820
she'll never be happy.

857
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:49,870
Talk to her.

858
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:50,780
Ok. Ok. Ok.

859
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,040
Father-in-law.

860
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:53,390
You.

861
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,030
Father-in-law, Father-in-law.

862
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:56,490
You know

863
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,590
your own girl's temper better than me.

864
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,910
Can I stop her?

865
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,580
There is another thing that I dare not say.

866
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,290
It was that guy who

867
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,010
almost killed your girl.

868
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:05,970
What did you say?

869
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,380
What are you talking about, Gu Beixi?

870
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,180
How dare he?

871
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:08,770
I inadvertently blurt out.

872
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,960
Father! Father! Father!

873
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,790
He's talking nonsense.

874
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,790
There's no such thing.

875
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:13,000
Don't talk about me first. Talk about you.

876
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,130
What's wrong with you?

877
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:15,790
I asked Lu Yan to investigate missing people.

878
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:16,950
Why did you get involved in it?

879
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:19,010
It is not a case about missing people.

880
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,230
It's about spiritual worms.

881
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,560
You know about spiritual worms?

882
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:32,210
