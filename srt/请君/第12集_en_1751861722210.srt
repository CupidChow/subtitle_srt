1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will never let you go

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's not me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
But you are me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are me

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:02:09,580
《My Impressible Dark

8
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,960
what kind of person

9
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:28,740
only suddenly

10
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,840
passed Mission

11
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,620
killed

12
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,340
When a powerful primordial spirit is lost,

13
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,780
the sky of Ghost Division

14
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,420
will be haunted.

15
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,980
They once existed in Zhang's clan.

16
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,100
They turned the last primordial spirit into blessings

17
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,140
and left it to the living primordial spirits.

18
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:40,260
Everyone pastaed herヽⅢ‍Ⅰ‍Ⅰ Celestial statewide

19
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,900
The end is near.

20
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,500
A misguided lynx

21
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,260
Renanych

22
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,980
Stray from the presence of past

23
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,980
I'm afraid I can't.

24
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,980
This long voice,

25
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,980
I leave myself,

26
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,980
and I leave love.

27
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,980
I hide my heart,

28
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,980
and make a decision for you.

29
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:29,980
Here, take it.

30
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,980
Take it.

31
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,980
Don't take anything.

32
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,980
What if it's poisonous?

33
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,980
Let's go on.

34
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,980
Stop playing in the sea.

35
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:47,980
Let's go.

36
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,980
Here.

37
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,980
Here it is.

38
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:20,980
Chang Le Restaurant.

39
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,980
Why did you bring us here?

40
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,980
This is not only a restaurant.

41
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,980
This is a place for those

42
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,980
who can't live in the mortal world

43
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,980
and can have a very powerful spiritual activity.

44
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,980
I'm going to find a drug called

45
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,980
the five-spice pill.

46
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,980
This can solve the coma of the Lv Dian.

47
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,980
Five-spice pill?

48
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,980
It sounds delicious.

49
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,980
Tell me how to make it.

50
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,980
I'll go back to Qingyuan Station later.

51
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,980
I'll make it too.

52
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:44,980
You want to make it too?

53
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,980
This five-spice pill

54
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,500
is made of the

55
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,980
100-year-old cockroach spirit,

56
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,980
the spring-like wings,

57
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,980
and the Avia growing on the body.

58
00:05:58,980 --> 00:05:59,980
Enough. Stop talking.

59
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,980
I'm going to throw up.

60
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,980
Why is this smelly thing

61
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,980
called the five-spice pill?

62
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,980
Because it's very rare.

63
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,980
Many spirits want it.

64
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,980
So I got a

65
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,980
nice name.

66
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:13,980
Is there anything strange about this pill?

67
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,980
It can only wake up people who are asleep.

68
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,980
This is mainly used to

69
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,980
replenish the air and kidney.

70
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,980
This is a good thing.

71
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,980
Then you don't need it.

72
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,980
Yu De.

73
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,980
The spirits inside are very powerful.

74
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,980
You'll be exposed when you go in.

75
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,980
Wait here for me.

76
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,980
Don't walk around.

77
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,980
Okay.

78
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,980
By the way,

79
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:43,980
you have this hairpin.

80
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:44,980
Don't lose it again.

81
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,980
Wait for me.

82
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:58,980
Wait for me.

83
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,980
Guys,

84
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,980
throw up the weapons.

85
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,980
Who is it?

86
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,980
Is the second half of the book

87
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,980
of the thousand years of the subject

88
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,980
in the ghost room?

89
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,980
The book you're talking about

90
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,980
has been

91
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,980
taken away by a ghost.

92
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,980
Ghost?

93
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,980
Brother Ghost.

94
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,980
I heard that you've got

95
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,980
a lot of treasures recently.

96
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,980
Yeah, Brother Ghost.

97
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,980
Yeah.

98
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,980
Share it with the others.

99
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,980
Yeah.

100
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,980
I'm so happy.

101
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,980
I'm so happy.

102
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:56,980
I'm so happy.

103
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,980
Yeah.

104
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,980
It's not that I can't.

105
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:01,980
But you have to tell me first

106
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,980
who you like so much today.

107
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,980
Come to drink.

108
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,980
Ghost, right?

109
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,980
I want to make a deal with you.

110
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,980
Where did you come from, little white face?

111
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,980
What good things can you have?

112
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:24,980
Come on.

113
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:27,980
Come on.

114
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,980
This eagle stone is a treasure

115
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,980
that the spirit clan

116
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,980
collected when they first came to Jiuzhou

117
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,980
three thousand years ago.

118
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,980
There are only a few left in the world.

119
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,980
How did you get it?

120
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,980
I got it at random.

121
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,980
Good.

122
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,980
What do you want to exchange?

123
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,980
I want both people and goods.

124
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,980
Ghost.

125
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,980
Ghost.

126
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:25,980
Ghost.

127
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:33,980
Master,

128
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,980
where can we find a master

129
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,980
in such a big ghost city?

130
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,980
Stupid.

131
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,980
It must be a gambling house.

132
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,980
The fish stall is the fish stall.

133
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,980
It's a side stall when it comes to gambling.

134
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,980
It's not a rumor.

135
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,980
What are you talking about?

136
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,980
My father is a gambler.

137
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,980
That's right.

138
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:49,980
But this gambling house

139
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,980
is divided into three, six and nine levels.

140
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,980
The gambling houses

141
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,980
we just walked over

142
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,980
are the ones

143
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:54,980
where my father is.

144
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:55,980
Which one can get in?

145
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,980
Where do you think the fish can go?

146
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,980
My father has been walking in the world for many years.

147
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,980
He has a habit of marking the mark.

148
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,980
It's convenient for us to find him.

149
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,980
Why don't we split up?

150
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,980
Yes. Yes.

151
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,980
Split up. Hurry up.

152
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,980
Split up.

153
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,980
Let's split up.

154
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:13,980
Let's go.

155
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,980
Let's go together.

156
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,980
Let's go.

157
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,980
Hurry up.

158
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,980
Hurry up.

159
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,980
There are so many strange things

160
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,980
happening in Yingdu recently.

161
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,980
Many of my brothers

162
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,980
were injured by that trainer.

163
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,980
That's right.

164
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,980
That old man is so evil.

165
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,980
He ran so fast.

166
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,980
But he still hit me.

167
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,980
Look. Here. Here.

168
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:04,980
Here. Here.

169
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,980
Yingdu.

170
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,980
Did my father leave the ghost city

171
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,980
and return to Yingdu?

172
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,980
What are you looking for?

173
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,980
What does it look like?

174
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,980
It's just a...

175
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,980
How can I describe it to you?

176
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:27,980
Anyway, you'll know

177
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,980
when you see it.

178
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,980
What are you doing?

179
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,980
It's nothing.

180
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,980
It's nothing.

181
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,980
I found it.

182
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,980
Come here. Come here.

183
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:43,980
What are you looking at?

184
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,980
What does it mean?

185
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,980
You probably don't know this.

186
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:48,980
This is a snake.

187
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,980
It's a snake.

188
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,980
It's a snake.

189
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,980
You probably don't know this.

190
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,980
This is a technique

191
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,980
invented by the master.

192
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,980
It means different points

193
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,980
in different combinations.

194
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,980
It's not easy to expose

195
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,980
your own people.

196
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,980
Look.

197
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,980
It should be written

198
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,980
that the master came to the ghost city

199
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,980
to find something.

200
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,980
He didn't find it.

201
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,980
He got lost.

202
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,980
The money is gone.

203
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,980
Gone?

204
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:15,980
Mom.

205
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,980
Let's look for it again.

206
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,980
It should be here.

207
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,980
Here. Here.

208
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,980
I found it.

209
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,980
Look at this.

210
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:25,980
It says

211
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,980
that within seven days,

212
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,980
he searched all the junk stores,

213
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,980
antique shops,

214
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,980
and old goods stalls.

215
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,980
He still didn't find it.

216
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,980
He searched them all.

217
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,980
What is Old Yu looking for?

218
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,980
I don't know.

219
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,980
It's not written on it.

220
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,980
Look again.

221
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,980
Here. Here.

222
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,980
Here. Here.

223
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,980
You know it?

224
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,980
It's clever.

225
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,980
What does it say?

226
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,980
The master shouldn't be here.

227
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,980
Are you sure?

228
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,980
It says so.

229
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,980
It's a curse.

230
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,980
It's a curse.

231
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,980
It's still a curse.

232
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,980
Here.

233
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,980
This place

234
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,980
is really not where it belongs.

235
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,980
It's gone.

236
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,980
We should tell the master

237
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,980
that the master is not here.

238
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,980
The master is not here.

239
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,980
Sirs,

240
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:21,980
are you all right?

241
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,980
Sir.

242
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,980
I'm sorry.

243
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,980
I didn't mean to.

244
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,980
How did you walk?

245
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,980
Did you have your eyes closed?

246
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,980
You didn't mean to.

247
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,980
You almost broke your bones.

248
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,980
Pei Qing, pay me.

249
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,980
I just stepped on it.

250
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,980
How could I break my bones?

251
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,980
You stepped on it.

252
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,980
I have to pay you.

253
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:46,980
You're trying to cheat me.

254
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,980
I did.

255
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,980
What's wrong?

256
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,980
You cheated me.

257
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:51,980
You didn't even pay me.

258
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,980
What are you doing?

259
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,980
What are you doing?

260
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,980
Let go.

261
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,980
You...

262
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,980
What are you smelling?

263
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,980
My nose

264
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,980
can tell the difference between human and spirit.

265
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,980
You smell like human.

266
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,980
Someone!

267
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,980
Someone is in a ghost room.

268
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,980
Someone, come here.

269
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,980
Someone is in a ghost room.

270
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,980
Someone is in a ghost room.

271
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,980
Human.

272
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,980
What's wrong with human?

273
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,980
Human can't come to a ghost room.

274
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,980
I'm here to see.

275
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,980
What are you doing?

276
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,980
Come here.

277
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,980
Come here.

278
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:37,980
Come here.

279
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,980
Come here.

280
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,980
Come here.

281
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,980
What are you doing?

282
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,980
Come here.

283
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,980
Ghost!

284
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,980
Ghost!

285
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,980
Scientists!

286
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,980
Ghost!

287
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,980
妖我跟你講

288
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,980
妖, 你们快去

289
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,980
妖, 你快去

290
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,980
妖, 你们快去

291
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,980
妖, 你快去

292
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,980
妖, 你快去

293
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,980
妖, 你快去

294
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,620
Shi 5 years.

295
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,020
125 years!

296
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,540
Something happened.

297
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,100
Let's go and check.

298
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:25,980
What's happening?

299
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,060
What's going on?

300
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,140
What was that about?

301
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,380
I don't know.

302
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,860
Why was he so Luis when we were in panic?

303
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,780
You found out.

304
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,900
Yeah.

305
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,220
What's wrong?

306
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,420
Your eyes are Premiere.

307
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,340
Close your eyes.

308
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,180
I'll take you home.

309
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,740
Just run

310
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,060
failed

311
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,700
Don't touch

312
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,300
accessible

313
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,560
I am not going!

314
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,740
I am going out!

315
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,420
I need a leave!

316
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,240
Leave!

317
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,040
Don't hide in here.

318
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,600
Tell them not to kill you.

319
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,440
Everyone st ironic!

320
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,820
I will stop when I see your face.

321
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,880
Get out!

322
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,880
Eternal Love

323
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,040
Isn't this

324
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,800
Qingquan Love

325
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,400
Isn't this the place where Lu Yingnan and master pist before?

326
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,640
Cover it up.

327
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,040
Mr. Pan, you're confused.

328
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,320
Why should I cover it up?

329
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,720
Are you confused or am I?

330
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,200
Today is the wedding day.

331
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,480
Don't break the rules, okay?

332
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,840
What... what rules are these?

333
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:18,440
Don't run.

334
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,200
Be careful of your stomach.

335
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,800
What... what's going on?

336
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,040
Why are you eating like this?

337
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,880
You silly boy.

338
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,920
Why are you eating like this?

339
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,040
Don't try to jump up and down in the future.

340
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,360
If you hurt the child, I won't forgive you.

341
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,360
What child?

342
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,040
Who's the child?

343
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,400
Who's the child?

344
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,600
Your child is so big.

345
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,600
Mother.

346
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,160
Mother.

347
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,600
Mother.

348
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,200
Mother.

349
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,120
Mother.

350
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,360
You finally woke up.

351
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,480
It's all fat.

352
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,040
I was just having a dream.

353
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,600
I was so scared.

354
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,560
What did you cook for me?

355
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,200
Wine.

356
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,840
What's the point of wine?

357
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,200
You've been unconscious for half an hour.

358
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,760
If it weren't for me, you would still be unconscious.

359
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,720
You had a nightmare, too, right?

360
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,240
What did you dream about?

361
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,520
I didn't dream about anything.

362
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,480
Wait.

363
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,480
What's wrong with us?

364
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:20,920
Look.

365
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,480
Isn't it

366
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,200
the second master's amulet?

367
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,080
Why is it grey?

368
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,440
Where's mine?

369
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,080
We should have been plotted.

370
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,200
This amulet saved our lives.

371
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,240
What happened just now?

372
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,240
Where's my master?

373
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,000
Let's leave here first.

374
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:39,800
Let's go find the lamp.

375
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,200
Let's go.

376
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,080
Hurry up.

377
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,160
Master Hu is back.

378
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,400
Did he wait for them to get in trouble?

379
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,120
You can open your eyes now.

380
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,280
You're safe now.

381
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,560
Who told you to hug me?

382
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,120
I can walk on my own.

383
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,880
So clumsy.

384
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,520
I even sprained my ankle.

385
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,240
Can you walk on your own now?

386
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,400
Yes.

387
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,920
What a bad luck.

388
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,120
Don't move or scream.

389
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,800
Brother, this is a bone crack.

390
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,000
It hurts, okay?

391
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,800
Are you okay?

392
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,880
I'm going back to save the Da Hai and the others.

393
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,960
The original power is not magic.

394
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,120
You can't move your legs tonight.

395
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,960
I'll find a way to bring your friends out.

396
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,600
This place is far from the Qianhe Town.

397
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,080
I can't go there.

398
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,600
I'll go there with you.

399
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,400
I'll go with you.

400
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,560
I'll go with you.

401
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,440
I'll go with you.

402
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,440
I'll go with you.

403
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,360
I'll go with you.

404
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,360
I'll go with you.

405
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,160
Sister,

406
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,880
we'd better find a place to settle down.

407
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,720
Find a place to settle down?

408
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,880
You and me?

409
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,240
If you take the opportunity to take revenge on me,

410
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,040
I can't even run away.

411
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,840
But if he doesn't agree,

412
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,880
he'll leave on his own.

413
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,880
What if he leaves me here and can't go back to Qianhe Town?

414
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,160
What?

415
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,520
You don't dare?

416
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,240
What are you afraid of?

417
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,080
Afraid?

418
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,400
In my dictionary,

419
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,200
I never say I'm afraid.

420
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:11,960
Let's go.

421
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,840
What are you doing?

422
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,920
Put me down.

423
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,720
Don't move.

424
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,120
I'm sorry.

425
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
I'm sorry.

426
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,120
I'm sorry.

427
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,120
I'm sorry.

428
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
I'm sorry.

429
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
I'm sorry.

430
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
I'm sorry.

431
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
I'm sorry.

432
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
I'm sorry.

433
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,120
I'm sorry.

434
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,120
I'm sorry.

435
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
I'm sorry.

436
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,120
I'm sorry.

437
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
I'm sorry.

438
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
I'm sorry.

439
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,120
I'm sorry.

440
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
I'm sorry.

441
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
I'm sorry.

442
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,120
I'm sorry.

443
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,120
I'm sorry.

444
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,120
I'm sorry.

445
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
I'm sorry.

446
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
I'm sorry.

447
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
I'm sorry.

448
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
I'm sorry.

449
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
I'm sorry.

450
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
I'm sorry.

451
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
I'm sorry.

452
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,120
I'm sorry.

453
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,000
I've set up an barrier around here.

454
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,920
You can rest here.

455
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,320
After dawn,

456
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,720
we'll go back to Qianhe Town.

457
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
It's going to rain.

458
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
You can sleep first.

459
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
I'm not sleepy.

460
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
Just kidding.

461
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,040
I'm sleeping now.

462
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,960
You're so clumsy.

463
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,360
I'm not a little secretive.

464
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,560
You're not sleepy?

465
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,520
If you're not sleepy, I'll sleep first.

466
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,560
I don't have any sense after I fall asleep.

467
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,560
You're the only one here to watch the night.

468
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
My throat itches.

469
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Hungry?

470
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
No.

471
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,960
There's a river nearby.

472
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,760
I'll get you a fish

473
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
and grill it for you.

474
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,120
No need.

475
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,160
You're the only one I have.

476
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:30,160
Walking into the scenery

477
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,160
This long rain

478
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,160
is like a season

479
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,160
The distance is like a love story

480
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,160
No need to bother.

481
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
It's not a bother.

482
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,160
The only thing I can do is

483
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:53,160
to walk into the scenery

484
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,160
This long rain

485
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:57,160
is like a season

486
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,160
I thought you were a noble man.

487
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,160
You know this kind of thing.

488
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,160
I've been waiting for you

489
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,160
for so long

490
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,160
I've been waiting for you

491
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,160
for so long

492
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,160
Okay.

493
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,160
Come on.

494
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,160
Try it.

495
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
What?

496
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Are you afraid I'll poison you?

497
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
You're afraid of poison?

498
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,160
Even if you're a ghost,

499
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,160
you have to be a thin-skinned ghost.

500
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,160
There are only two of us now.

501
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,160
You can tell me

502
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,160
when you're going to do it.

503
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,160
Do it?

504
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,160
Kill me.

505
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,160
Stop pretending.

506
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,160
I know.

507
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
I was your old friend before.

508
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,160
You designed the Spirit Formation

509
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,160
to take away his spirit stones.

510
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,160
Now you kill me.

511
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,160
Revenge and blood hatred.

512
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,160
You can save him.

513
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,160
One move, two kills.

514
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Who told you that?

515
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,160
You don't care about that.

516
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
He's not your so-called old friend.

517
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,160
But my

518
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,160
The one who admires

519
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,160
is hard to open in the heart.

520
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
I know.

521
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
I'm just curious

522
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,160
what you can make a woman

523
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,160
who has been wandering for three thousand years

524
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,160
look like.

525
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,160
You can make a person like you

526
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,160
remember for thousands of years.

527
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,160
You've been thinking about it all the time.

528
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
You want to kill me for him.

529
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
General.

530
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,160
General.

531
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,160
General.

532
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,160
After passing this valley,

533
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,160
we can see the reinforcements of the capital.

534
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,160
Be careful, everyone.

535
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,160
This powder is poisonous.

536
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
Cover your noses.

537
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,160
Brothers,

538
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,160
cover your noses.

539
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,160
Don't look at the cover.

540
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
Open your eyes.

541
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,160
General.

542
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,160
What happened to them?

543
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,460
This is close now. Be careful!

544
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,900
Okay.

545
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,640
In particular,

546
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,280
Wait for me when you play.

547
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,520
There're no more reinforcements,

548
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,360
General Yan.

549
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,080
You're passed out today.

550
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,080
Chu State will be doomed.

551
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,640
I'm so pied-down,

552
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,160
just don't expect me to succeed.

553
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,680
Do you think I'll die when you kill me?

554
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,280
General Yan, you do still love me,

555
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,560
but your love

556
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,440
will kill you.

557
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,960
I'm going.

558
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:28,960
Zhurong,

559
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,160
don't kill people anymore.

560
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,040
We came to Jiuzhou

561
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,520
to survive.

562
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,080
Why did you kill the innocent?

563
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,160
Yunxi,

564
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,640
you're too naive.

565
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,080
The world is full of weak and strong people.

566
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,200
Only the winners

567
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,880
have the right to live.

568
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,560
War

569
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,680
will only destroy this land

570
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,760
and make both tribes unable to survive.

571
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,280
Jiuzhou is vast.

572
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,640
Humans have many wisdoms.

573
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,160
Our tribe

574
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,200
should learn how to survive

575
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,760
on this land.

576
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,440
And both tribes

577
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,560
should live in peace.

578
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,080
Humans are humble and humble.

579
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,320
They don't deserve to live with the tribe.

580
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,080
As the sacred daughter of the tribe,

581
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,080
why do you keep

582
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,160
favoring humans?

583
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,920
Whether humans or the tribe,

584
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,840
every grass and tree

585
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,880
is a life.

586
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,280
The sacred daughter of the tribe

587
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,920
will never say such

588
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,320
lowly words.

589
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:32,800
Yunxi,

590
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,720
have you sealed your heart?

591
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,480
You don't want to kill.

592
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,080
You're angry with our future

593
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,000
and disregard us.

594
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,400
The future of the tribe

595
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,400
is not achieved by killing and conquering.

596
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,680
Since you're the sacred daughter of the tribe,

597
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,520
don't force me to be cruel.

598
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,520
If that's the case,

599
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,360
don't blame me for being ruthless.

600
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,960
The baby girl has an important case

601
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,600
of somebody playing a target.

602
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,600
You're not the avoidance of others.

603
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,160
You're a diabol.

604
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,000
Championship ofcrafty tapiated.

605
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,360
He ran twice.

606
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,280
General, be careful.

607
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,100
Wan 안녕禅

608
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,280
Water

609
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,340
You're awake.

610
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,740
It's you.

611
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,460
I can't let you go.

612
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,420
Where is this place?

613
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,820
Don't worry.

614
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,100
It's safe here.

615
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,940
I set up an enchantment here.

616
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:59,540
Other spirits won't come in.

617
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,140
Where are my soldiers?

618
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,020
Zhurong was seriously injured.

619
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,980
He has already withdrawn his soldiers.

620
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,300
Your soldiers

621
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,060
should also leave to escape.

622
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:10,900
I'm going to find them.

623
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,300
What?

624
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,660
How do you feel?

625
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,380
Feel better?

626
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,380
Much better.

627
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,980
Why is your ancestors' blood green

628
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,980
while yours is red?

629
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,820
I'm the sacred undead from the Holy Spirit Tribe

630
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,580
were RPG balanced with the timing.

631
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,780
I'm a matcher between

632
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,060
this green forest and the market

633
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,660
you'll be different from others.

634
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,300
Thank you for saving my life.

635
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,220
I'll find a chance to repay you in the future.

636
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,380
I'm just doing what I can.

637
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,220
You don't need to repay me.

638
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,100
I don't like to owe others.

639
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:33,020
If you insist on repaying me,

640
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,100
can you take me to Jiuzhou?

641
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,340
You want to go to Jiuzhou?

642
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,980
Although you saved my life,

643
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,660
I won't agree to anything that could

644
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,740
threaten the safety of the people of Jiuzhou.

645
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,740
Don't misunderstand, General Yan.

646
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,700
We thought that

647
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,420
everything in the human world and Jiuzhou

648
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,300
were lower-level creatures.

649
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,180
They were the food of the forest.

650
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,860
But after we came to Jiuzhou,

651
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,940
we found that

652
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:10,060
everything had spirits.

653
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,700
The grass and the trees had spirits.

654
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,620
How could we kill them so easily?

655
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,100
So I want to go to Jiuzhou

656
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,500
to see if there's another choice

657
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,180
between the people and the forest,

658
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,020
besides fighting each other.

659
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:35,300
General Yan, can you protect me?

660
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:40,180
So you want to...

661
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,580
I've always hoped that

662
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,460
the people and the forest could live in peace

663
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,780
and be harmonious.

664
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,580
I never had the chance

665
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,980
to know the human world before.

666
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:53,460
If I'm lucky enough to go to Jiuzhou,

667
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,700
maybe I can find some ways.

668
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,540
If you really want to go,

669
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,340
I won't force you.

670
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,940
I can take you to Jiuzhou.

671
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,460
But you have to promise me

672
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,980
that you won't use your power

673
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,580
and will follow me.

674
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,460
If you ever threaten the people of Jiuzhou

675
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,100
and do anything to them,

676
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,980
I won't let you go.

677
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:26,060
Okay. I promise you.

678
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,300
The Saintess of the Spirit Tribe.

679
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,900
Maybe she's a chance

680
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:33,500
for the two tribes to turn the tables.

681
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,500
The Saintess of the Spirit Tribe

682
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,340
What is this place?

683
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,940
Why did you bring me here?

684
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,460
This is the most prosperous street in Shu.

685
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,420
Miss, just look around.

686
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,220
Pick whatever you like.

687
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,220
This one is beautiful.

688
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,100
Let me teach you.

689
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,540
Let me see.

690
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,020
Open it like this.

691
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,340
Close it like this.

692
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,380
You can try it.

693
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,060
Miss.

694
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,340
What's the matter?

695
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:43,340
You haven't paid me.

696
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,620
Pay you?

697
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,220
Here.

698
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,260
Thank you, General.

699
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,220
Let's go.

700
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,420
What you gave him just now

701
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,340
is the most valuable thing in the world.

702
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,060
Thank you.

703
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,740
Thank you.

704
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,420
Thank you.

705
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,100
Thank you.

706
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:01,740
Thank you.

707
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,420
Thank you.

708
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,020
Thank you.

709
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,660
Thank you.

710
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,380
Thank you.

711
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,020
Thank you.

712
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:05,740
Thank you.

713
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:06,420
Thank you.

714
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,500
What you gave him was money.

715
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,860
With money,

716
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,700
he can exchange it for this.

717
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,300
In the trade between humans,

718
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,300
equality and exchange are the key.

719
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,100
Every household

720
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:21,060
can exchange money through their own labor.

721
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,620
Buy what they need.

722
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,260
People can get what they need.

723
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,060
Life is very interesting.

724
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,820
Equality and exchange.

725
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,260
Interesting.

726
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,300
In the future, the Spirit Tribe

727
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,460
will also be taught the way to trade with the world.

728
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,060
If there is a world of the spirit,

729
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,700
it will be called

730
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,700
the Ghost World.

731
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,500
What do you think?

732
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,100
The Ghost World?

733
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:49,980
Good.

734
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,700
It will be called the Ghost World.

735
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,780
Thank you.

736
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,980
Come on, old team.

737
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,820
One for each person.

738
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,460
Thank you.

739
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,700
We have it all.

740
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,540
Are these

741
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,780
your soldiers?

742
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,660
Yes.

743
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,580
They are serving the people.

744
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,660
The soldiers of Shu are very affectionate.

745
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:18,940
This is a common sight.

746
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:25,060
The strong don't bully the weak.

747
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,180
They are very affectionate with the weak.

748
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,780
Humans and the Spirit Tribe

749
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:32,300
are different.

750
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,740
The strong in the Spirit Tribe

751
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,940
only take the food of the weak.

752
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,020
The weak die of hunger.

753
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,980
They don't have the affection you mentioned.

754
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:49,260
Other spirits may not have it.

755
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,620
But you do.

756
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,180
You saved me on the sand.

757
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,140
Isn't it because you have compassion in your heart?

758
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,820
Look.

759
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,500
What's so funny?

760
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,260
Isn't it funny?

761
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,020
Am I funny, too?

762
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,820
They have a lot of affection.

763
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,420
For example...

764
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:32,060
OK.

765
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,580
Please.

766
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:35,180
For example, when a child is in danger,

767
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,980
parents will protect their children

768
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,580
without any hesitation.

769
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,420
Likewise, when parents are in danger,

770
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,580
the child will make the same choice.

771
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,380
Protect each other.

772
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,980
Life is not easy.

773
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:52,900
Yes.

774
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,980
You've been walking for so long.

775
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,740
Are you tired?

776
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:56,180
I'm not tired.

777
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,140
But you...

778
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,100
Look at you.

779
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,380
You're sweating.

780
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,020
What's this?

781
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,140
There's another kind of love called love between men and women.

782
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,820
If you love each other deeply enough,

783
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,620
you may also give your life for each other.

784
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,180
You mean

785
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,980
living people can die for each other?

786
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,340
Why is love between men and women so powerful?

787
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,660
It's hard to explain.

788
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,820
Only those who have experienced it can understand.

789
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:33,380
Have you ever experienced love between men and women?

790
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,820
The love story of the two of us

791
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,820
is all about you.

792
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,820
When two hearts are so close together,

793
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,820
when the whole world is occupied by you,

794
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:17,820
I will call for your name with all my heart

795
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:22,820
until I can remember you.

796
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:28,820
You are the only one

797
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:35,820
who can walk into the scenery.

798
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,820
This is a promise.

799
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,820
The moon is falling.

800
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,820
The distance is about to cross.

801
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:46,820
I hide my heart

802
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,820
and make a decision for you.

803
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,820
Our love most important thing is

804
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:56,960
the anniversary party that we

805
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:13,820
Chen Xiaoxiao's parents held on

806
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:16,820
The long-awaited anniversary drama

807
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,820
will be aired soon.

808
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,020
The anniversary will be on me.

809
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,820
I will find you

810
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:28,820
Until I find your memory

811
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:35,820
You are the only one for me

812
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:42,820
The scenery I remember

813
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:46,820
This city is like a mirage

814
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,820
I can't get out of love

815
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:53,820
I hide my heart

816
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,820
The decision I made for you
