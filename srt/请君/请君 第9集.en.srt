Isn't this what you said you wanted yesterday?

Dahai.

175
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:28,900
Mr. Wu,

176
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:29,920
what brings you,

177
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,490

178
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,780
You flatter me.

179
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,409
Miss Yu.

180
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,540
Today, I've come to bring you a great gift.

181
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:39,680
Thank you, Mr. Wu.

182
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:42,180
We old-fashioned people can't appreciate art

183

and don't have the money to do it.

184
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,080
Miss Yu,

185
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,850
let's not talk about art today.

186
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,590
How about

187

188
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,450
I heard that your heroic husband ran away some time ago.

189
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:56,010
Now there is a shortage of someone to serve.

190
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:56,870
And

191
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:59,070
we have one actor

192
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,650
with our promotion.

193
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,510
He could be your alternative.

194
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:03,840

Miss Yu.

197
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,970
His last name is also Lu?

198
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,490
How can that be?

199
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,590
From now on,

200

his last name is Yu.

201
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,760
If you would like to support him,

202
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,090
he can have any last name.

203
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,400
Go away. His last name is whatever he likes.

204

Our chief,

205

206
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040

-Just leave.

Sit down.

213

00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:10,510
Sir.

Master.

516
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,510
It's you again, isn't it?

517
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:16,790
What are you talking about?

518
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,040
We're here to save you.

519

If I hadn't just saved you,

you would have been killed long ago.

Don't play nice here.

522

526

The energy of the illusory spirit is low.

527
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,250
But it is good at manipulating butterflies.

528
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,410
The powder from its body

529
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,590

to get hit.

533
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,070
And it's hard to break.

534
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:52,200
It moves secretly

so many spirit clansmen's coveting?

Whether she is Yun Xi or not,

540
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,750
we must protect her first.

541

If Yu Dengdeng is really my Master,

542

What will you do?

544
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,160
What else can I do?

545
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,330
Give her back her energy core.

546
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,160
I hope she will continue to practice

547

As long as I can finish this,

I would have no regrets.

00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:43,270
Sir,

557

you can rest assured.

Good.

So, he actually didn't do anything to you.

564

How dare he?

I, Yu Dengdeng,

am young, strong and smart.

567
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:02,300
Would he dare to make a move on me?

What's more,

I still have the spiritual blood.

Just for our fainting today,

I have to make up a convincing story.

But for this life-threatening hate,

I can't let him go so easily.

he's been hiding in the shitty sedan chair company.

Now that he finally shows up,

I'll find a chance to kill him.

I won't allow that.

587
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,130
His skills are quite strange.

588
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:36,040
I'm afraid instead of hurting him

589
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,370
you will get shot first.

If so,

I'll be the one to kill him with my own hands.

There is no reason to bother your Nanfeng Stronghold.

don't give him the chance to explain.

This spirit clansman who doesn't like you at all

betrayed you and tried to kill you.

-I'm not hungry.
-Let's go.

609
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,070
It's too late when you're hungry.

610
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,040
I've eaten.

611
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:19,410
Mostly because your speech was so well.

612
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,070
It was, wasn't it?

613
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,940
I think she took it in.

614
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,800
I think so, too.

615
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:22,690
Let's go.

616
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,290
Think about it.

617
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,150
No need to be depressed.

618
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,520

Please, ahhhhh.

624

Miss Yu, there is something on your mind.

625
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,230
It's hard to get rid of the anger.

626
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:32,240
Simply put, it's an inflammatory condition.

627
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,940
And is there any quick cure?

628
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,590
Toothache is not a disease.

629
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:37,600
In fact, no amount of medication will help.

630
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,670
As long as the worries of Miss Yu are gone,

631
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,720
and she is happy.

632
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,870
When the inflammation is gone, this pain

633
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,070
will heal naturally.

634
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:45,940
Got it.

635
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:47,610

639

you are depressed.

640
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,960
Is it because you met Lu Yan

641
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,810
at the bottom of the mountain?

642
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,610
I can't hide anything from you.

643
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:16,110
You still can't forget him.

644
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:21,910
I…

645
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,980
I don't know what's wrong with me.

646
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,990
I do hate him so much.

647
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:31,100
But sometimes I wonder that

648
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,290
we are in this situation today.

649
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,480
Was I wrong at the beginning?

650
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,200
If at the beginning, I didn't take him up here.

651
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,110
Would it still have become what it is today?

652
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:46,910
For me,

653
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,760
I don't know why he wants to harm your life.

654
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,530
Maybe he is

655
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,960
heartless,

656
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,040
and with no humanity.

657
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,910
But it's definitely not because

658
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,780
our Dengdeng is not doing well enough,

659
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,110
or did something wrong.

660
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,530
Everyone can see that

661
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,900
you are true to him.

662
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,040
If he doesn't cherish you,

663
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,810
he's just not blessed with it.

664
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,300
Our Dengdeng deserves the love

665

of the best man

666

Gu Beixi,

881
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,300
why did you come to our Qingquan Stronghold?

882
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,190
What are you doing?

883
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,230
Why come to my room in the middle of the night? A sneak attack?

884
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,950
Qingquan Stronghold is too poor

885
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:46,310
to be sneak attacked.

886
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,660
I made you some pear soup.

When you were a child,

889
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,360
didn't you often steal pears from our back mountain?

890

893
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,840
Don't worry, it's not poisonous.

894
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:07,380
I used honey to cook this.

What's more,

896
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,980
if I really wanted to take over your Qingquan Stronghold,

I wouldn't have to use such a dirty trick.

give me this whole bowl of soup?

There's nothing to be unwilling to.

Dengdeng,

908
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:48,120
do you remember the first time we met

909
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,360
when we were kids?

910
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,240
I remembered

911
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,610
the first time we met,

912
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,980
you beat me up

913
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,040
and told my father about it.

914
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,880
After coming home, I got beaten by my father again.

915
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,250
I remembered.

916
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,000
That's because you shaved my hair first.

917
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,730
That's the reason I beat you up.

918
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:06,780
What about all the bad things you've done to me?

919
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,840
I didn't mention any of that to my dad.

But you.

921
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:12,970
My father beat me every time after he met you.

922
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,130
And then whenever I met you,

923
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:16,690
my butt ached.

924
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,540
You were so sharp when you were a kid.

925
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:22,890
Where did that all go?

If you add some wine,

00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,190
it would be even better.

As for your cheeks,

how come you still think about drinking?

930
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,310
If you were drunk and fell into the water,

931
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,040
you wouldn't even get drowned.

Your swollen face

934
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:48,700
can make you flow on top of the water.
