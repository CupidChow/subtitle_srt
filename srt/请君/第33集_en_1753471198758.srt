1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll never let go after you leave

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You ask you, it's not me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You ask you, it's not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You ask you, it's not me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You ask you, it's not me

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm going to lose my life

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Daqian took us to the Hongqing Village to compete

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm going to lose if I'm serious

10
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm almost dead

11
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This kid is not fooling around

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hongqing Village is the scoundrel who is known for his smelly name

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
How did you come to our place

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Weren't you not here a while ago

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
We were thinking of going down the mountain to hunt

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
In the end, they were caught by their people

17
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Daqian is angry

18
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I asked them to meet under the mountain this afternoon

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I didn't expect it to be a three-win-two-win

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In the end, we calculated this

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Competing with the gun and the fist

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Daqian will definitely not lose, right

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I didn't expect to get to the second round

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Their third brother doesn't follow the rules

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The routine is very dirty

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I hit Daqian on the ground every two shots

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Now it's the third round

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's called what

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Dare to compare

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No one said before

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What is it to compare

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
In the end, it's two people holding guns

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Pointing at each other's heads

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Really betting

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You see, you say

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Where have we seen this

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll come back to you quickly

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
These lifeless monkeys

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Use some despicable means

40
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Come back and laugh on the first day

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can't bully our enemies, master

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Don't agree

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Master, hurry up and go see

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I tell you, Daqian is so shameless

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
If someone breaks down, it's over

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Go, go, go

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Just bring people back

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Don't make any demons

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't worry, dad

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
What happened

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Lu Yan

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Daqian hid from us

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Went to the competition with Hongqing

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Now it's time to be in the critical moment

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm almost dead

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's go save him

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
it is good

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Go quickly

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Go go go

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Master, master

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Don't come

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Safety first

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Don't play anymore

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'll give you a hug

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Brother Daqian

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Come

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Hit

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Hit

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hit

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hit

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
stop

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't give him a hug

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Give him a hug

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Give him a hug

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Hurry up, he's not beautiful

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Stop

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't force him

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Who dares to touch my grandma

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Master

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Interesting

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This town is not big

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Not even a house

83
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Your village is a woman's word

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That's right

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You are right

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You are right

87
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Hongqing Village

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's not good to play like this

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Good or not

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Today is your Qingquan Village

91
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Hurry up and come to deliver life

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
How to play

93
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
What to do

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Can't play

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Can't play, you talk

96
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That land belongs to us

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Right

98
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I want to die

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
My grandma is with you

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The boss's fire is so big

101
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So capable

102
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You guys come

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Wait, let me do it

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Right, I want to play with my master

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's talk about it after we get tired

106
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You look a few years old

107
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't be scared later

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm willing to bet

109
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If you win, you can take the man

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
OK, if you lose

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I want both the man and the land

112
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Come on

113
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Good

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What's going on

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What kind of magic is this

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Just a high-level revenge

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Forget it

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Hero young man

119
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Just a piece of land

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I can say it

121
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Then talk

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Right

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Come on, it's just a piece of land

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Go, go

125
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Don't be so arrogant

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
How dare you play hard

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I want to live, right

129
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Wait, calm down

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Give me the gun

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Master, don't die

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Give me

133
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Boss, don't sing

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let's just forget it, master

135
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Let's just forget it

136
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's just forget it, master

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's just forget it, master

138
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Let's just forget it

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Let's just forget it, master

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Go

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Go, go, go

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Say something

144
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Say something

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Play hard

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What's going on

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Right

148
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What's going on

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What's going on

150
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why are you fighting

151
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What's going on

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What's going on

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What's going on

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What's going on

155
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Be careful

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Don't be afraid

157
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
All my brothers in Nanfeng Village

158
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Come to help

159
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Don't make trouble

160
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Come on, brothers

161
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Work

162
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Everyone has some work in their eyes

163
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Take care of the boss

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Take care of it

165
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Thank you

166
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What are you polite for

167
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Everyone is their own person

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
You've been busy since I met you

169
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I don't have time to chat

170
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Let's talk about it

171
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What do you want to talk about

172
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You can talk about anything

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Talk about

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
How did you get into the medical team

175
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
After I escaped from that shabby temple

176
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Ran to the hospital outside the village

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The doctor there saved me

178
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Also taught me some medical skills

179
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Now I am also a

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
A person who can save lives

181
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What happened later

182
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Why didn't you come to me

183
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Are you still blaming me

184
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Seventeenth

185
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Seventeenth

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Your medical team is in poor condition

187
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Can't you change a place

188
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
This is too dangerous

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What should I do like yesterday

190
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Don't ask me

191
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Talk about you

192
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
How about you

193
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You

194
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
How are you with Miss Yu

195
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
How are we

196
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
We are the best brothers now

197
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
He

198
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm with Lu Yuan every day

199
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The two people are very close

200
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Bitter

201
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I guess it won't take long

202
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I can be an uncle

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You completely let go

204
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Otherwise

205
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I can afford to let go

206
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Moreover

207
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Want to marry me

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's right at the door of Nanfeng Village

209
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You haven't changed at all

210
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Right

211
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Still so handsome

212
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
My legs hurt

213
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll be busy first

214
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Doctor

215
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
What happened

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Sulfur

217
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Sulfur cotton

218
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Bear with it

219
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
My legs

220
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Shabu

221
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Here you are

222
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It hurts

223
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Drink some water

224
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's been hard on you these two days

225
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't be so polite

226
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Just this little thing

227
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Moreover

228
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Just treat it as a brother

229
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Training physical strength

230
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Otherwise, I can't even get a gun

231
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Can't even get a gun

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Bear with it

233
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Let the doctor see

234
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It will be fine in a while

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Where is the pain?

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Go go go

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Come on

238
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Please come inside

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Come on

240
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm fine

241
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm fine

242
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'm fine

243
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm fine

244
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'm fine

245
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Honey, are we going to the wrong place?

246
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Listen again

247
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Go

248
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Uncle and aunt, are you sick?

249
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It's okay

250
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I suddenly feel that my stomach doesn't hurt

251
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I don't want to see a doctor

252
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Hurry up, go go go

253
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Don't go

254
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's done

255
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Laughing

256
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's still scary

257
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
No, why are you more ugly when you laugh than crying?

258
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Will you laugh

259
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We are men

260
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm not a girl who can sing

261
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't know this professional

262
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Come on, let me teach you

263
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Don't talk

264
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Lose teeth

265
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Smile

266
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Bite people

267
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The hula hoop is almost out

268
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What are you laughing at?

269
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Go back

270
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Gu Bei Xi

271
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I am a clinic

272
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
If you keep messing around like this

273
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm going to kick people

274
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Boss, it's not easy to light this thing

275
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The stove finally burned

276
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
This is the medicine I finally found

277
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You lit it

278
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Mu Bei Xi

279
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What are you doing?

280
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What are you doing?

281
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Help

282
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yes, good intention

283
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Boss, is Miss Bai angry?

284
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
No

285
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I think it's probably because I helped

286
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What?

287
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Helped

288
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Let's leave

289
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
What to leave

290
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You go first

291
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I want to stay here

292
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
You can do it yourself

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Hurry up

294
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Go go go

295
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Go go go

296
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Busy

297
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Here

298
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Come on, I have a glass of medicine

299
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
To celebrate everyone's victory

300
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I asked the firehouse to prepare a few dishes

301
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Especially the immortals, they are dead

302
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You eat more and drink more

303
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Come on

304
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What do you mean by eating more and drinking more?

305
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You know what you're doing

306
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Don't get angry

307
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Are you stupid?

308
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Old fish

309
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What are you doing?

310
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Old leader, do you want to go to the toilet?

311
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Go to the toilet

312
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Go to the toilet

313
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Master, Master.

314
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Master, Master.

315
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm embarrassed.

316
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm sorry, Master.

317
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I'll propose a toast to Master.

318
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's good.

319
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
That's good.

320
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'm going to propose a toast to Master.

321
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You almost burned the Red Green Fortress down for me today.

322
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm so...

323
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I'm so sorry.

324
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm so sorry.

325
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm so sorry.

326
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Enough, Daqian.

327
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
We're brothers.

328
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Don't say that.

329
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Sit down and eat.

330
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll eat first.

331
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yes, yes, yes.

332
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The wine is expensive.

333
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Come on, sit down and eat.

334
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It's still summer.

335
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Hurry up and sit down.

336
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Sit down.

337
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Eat more.

338
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What's wrong, daughter?

339
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Are you unhappy?

340
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm fine.

341
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I just feel uncomfortable.

342
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Eat more.

343
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Come on.

344
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm full.

345
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You guys eat more.

346
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm going back to my room.

347
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Master.

348
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
This isn't your food.

349
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Let's go back after we finish eating.

350
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Master.

351
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Master.

352
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
How can you make Deng Deng angry again?

353
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
When did I get angry?

354
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
You're not angry.

355
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Why don't you eat?

356
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
How can you not know?

357
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Why are you here?

358
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm just a little worried about you.

359
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm fine.

360
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I just haven't been here for a while.

361
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Maybe it's because the war has just ended.

362
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Maybe I haven't calmed down yet.

363
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'll be fine after a while.

364
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Let me send you back to rest.

365
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
No need.

366
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I can go up by myself.

367
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You're tired.

368
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Go to bed early.

369
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
If you need anything,

370
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
remember to call me by a taxi.

371
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Okay.

372
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Hong Qingzhan?

373
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yunxi.

374
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You hate them, right?

375
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Ah!

376
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Deng Deng.

377
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What's wrong?

378
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I just had a nightmare.

379
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Don't be afraid.

380
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm here.

381
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What's wrong outside?

382
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Why did the purple thunder suddenly strike today?

383
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The weather has changed a lot lately.

384
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's often like this.

385
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Deng Deng.

386
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You just said

387
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
what did you dream about?

388
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I dreamed

389
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
of a lot of dead people.

390
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What did you dream about?

391
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I dreamed

392
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
of a lot of dead people.

393
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Who are they?

394
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The most tired person

395
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
is the one who gives up

396
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
and loves the girl.

397
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The real one.

398
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yunxi.

399
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
No!

400
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Help me!

401
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yunxi!

402
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Help me!

403
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's nothing.

404
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
It's so dark.

405
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I can't remember anything.

406
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Deng Deng.

407
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
No matter what happens,

408
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
you can't hide anything from me.

409
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Do you understand?

410
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm not hiding anything from you.

411
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You care about me so much.

412
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I have to make you worry about me every day

413
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and make you nervous.

414
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Okay.

415
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Don't think too much.

416
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'll be fine.

417
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Yunxi.

418
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yunxi.

419
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Go to sleep.

420
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'll stay here with you tonight.

421
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Okay.

422
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm not afraid of you.

423
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Go to sleep.

424
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yunxi.

425
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Okay.

426
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I'm going to sleep.

427
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Hurry.

428
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Hurry.

429
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Hurry up.

430
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Hurry up.

431
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Hurry up.

432
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Hurry up.

433
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Hurry up.

434
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Hurry up.

435
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Hurry up.

436
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
We're almost there.

437
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
We're almost there.

438
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Hold on.

439
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Hurry up.

440
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
No.

441
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
No.

442
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
What's going on?

443
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Are you a doctor?

444
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Inside.

445
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Doctor!

446
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
We're here.

447
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Doctor!

448
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Doctor!

449
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Doctor!

450
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Doctor!

451
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,840
Doctor!

452
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,040
Doctor!

453
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:56,880
Doctor!

454
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,440
Slow down.

455
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,160
There are many villagers who need medical treatment.

456
00:19:59,160 --> 00:19:59,800
Doctor!

457
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,520
What's wrong?

458
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,280
The sky was hit by lightning just now.

459
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,400
Many villagers were hit by lightning.

460
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,280
Some of them are injured.

461
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,280
Please save them, doctor.

462
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,240
Go in, go in.

463
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:06,640
Hurry.

464
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,840
Come out and help us, everyone.

465
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,440
Come.

466
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,480
Slow down.

467
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,160
It's so serious.

468
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,920
Slow down.

469
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,400
Slow down.

470
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,240
Why are you standing there?

471
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,120
Help us.

472
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,000
Don't eat anymore.

473
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,720
Help us.

474
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,120
Chief.

475
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,760
Chief, it's right ahead.

476
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,520
Master, you're here.

477
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,520
Great Khan.

478
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,840
Father, what's wrong?

479
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:46,480
What's going on?

480
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,640
Last night, there was a thunder.

481
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,120
The animals were scared and didn't dare to get up.

482
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,760
Look.

483
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,800
The chicken nest is broken.

484
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,640
You said...

485
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,400
Really?

486
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,520
What's wrong?

487
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,640
Nothing.

488
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,440
Let me do it.

489
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,040
Get up.

490
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,600
Get up.

491
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,080
Look.

492
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,000
Get up.

493
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,920
What's going on?

494
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,640
So amazing.

495
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,360
Look.

496
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,920
Great.

497
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:25,560
Wait.

498
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,360
Let me take you back to rest.

499
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:29,360
OK.

500
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,080
OK.

501
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,760
Go back.

502
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,680
Go back.

503
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,840
Great.

504
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,040
It's OK.

505
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:49,840
Don't worry.

506
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,680
I'm just a little sleepy.

507
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:56,960
Wait.

508
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,120
Come in.

509
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,240
Wait.

510
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:02,840
Wait.

511
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,800
Why are you here?

512
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,640
I didn't disturb you, did I?

513
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,400
Wait.

514
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,120
Do you know what the surprise is?

515
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,960
What surprise?

516
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,200
Guess who I met.

517
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,400
Who?

518
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,240
Bai Shiqi.

519
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,000
Bai Shiqi is still alive.

520
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,360
Miss Bai.

521
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,480
Where is she now?

522
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,400
Long story.

523
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,960
She is in the rescue team at the foot of the mountain.

524
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,840
She is being treated.

525
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,160
What happened?

526
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,800
Why did the medical team come to Qingquan Mountain?

527
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,040
Yes.

528
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,440
I didn't hear about any disaster.

529
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,880
Why are you so worried?

530
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,880
Last night,

531
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,240
we had a few thunder strikes.

532
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,760
How could the farmers

533
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,040
survive that?

534
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,160
The house was destroyed.

535
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,160
Several people were injured.

536
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,120
They were treated in the mountains.

537
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,200
You may not believe it.

538
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,800
I heard from the medical team

539
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,000
that the Red Green Fortress in Tiansha

540
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,320
was hit by something.

541
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,200
They were all killed in one night.

542
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,680
What?

543
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,960
What a coincidence.

544
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,000
What a coincidence?

545
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,520
Nothing.

546
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,640
How did they die?

547
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,120
I don't know.

548
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,760
Maybe they were evil

549
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,280
and God took them away.

550
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,360
But it doesn't matter.

551
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,480
Shi Qi told me

552
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,480
that he missed you and wanted to see you.

553
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,240
Okay.

554
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,000
Lu Yan.

555
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,720
I haven't seen Miss Bai for a long time.

556
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,880
I'll go to see her first.

557
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,960
I'll be back soon.

558
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,480
Okay.

559
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,280
Go.

560
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,200
Go.

561
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,520
Sir.

562
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,600
Are these bodies unusual?

563
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,040
They don't have shadows.

564
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,800
They really don't have shadows.

565
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,880
What's going on?

566
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,200
It's hard to predict the future.

567
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
Yesterday, their village head

568
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,840
fought with the master.

569
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,200
Today, they're all dead.

570
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,200
It's really the master's fault.

571
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,400
Yesterday, the master was so angry.

572
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,640
Now he can be relieved.

573
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,880
I'm sorry.

574
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,640
I'm sorry.

575
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,480
I'm sorry.

576
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,920
The Monk's Hall

577
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,880
The Monk's Hall?

578
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,480
You know this hall?

579
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Three thousand years ago,

580
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,240
the master decided to seal his evil thoughts

581
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,880
to pacify the conflict between human and spirit.

582
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,200
Stop it.

583
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,480
Yun Xi.

584
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,080
Are you really willing to

585
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,640
kill me for those weak humans?

586
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,680
I'm not going to kill you.

587
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,760
If you keep going,

588
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,680
you'll make a big mistake.

589
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,600
There will be no space

590
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,680
for the spirit to survive in the world.

591
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,200
What I want

592
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,720
is for the spirit to live together.

593
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,560
Stop it.

594
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,720
Don't make any more mistakes.

595
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,240
Listen to me.

596
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,560
Don't make any more mistakes, okay?

597
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,640
You're the one who's wrong.

598
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,560
It's you.

599
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,920
Only I can lead the entire Ge Li Clan

600
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,240
to create a new world.

601
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,360
Only me.

602
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,280
Only me.

603
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,160
If you don't leave me tomorrow night,

604
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,640
don't blame me for sealing you.

605
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,160
The master sealed the Dark Spirit Stone

606
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,400
in the ancient tree of the East Sea.

607
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,920
I've seen this map in the spirit stone.

608
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,200
Yun Xi.

609
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:19,920
No.

610
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,720
Yun Xi.

611
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,960
Yun Xi, no.

612
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,880
I thought

613
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,840
it was all over.

614
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,200
But it just started.

615
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,680
It just started.

616
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,160
Sir,

617
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,680
you mean...

618
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,200
Xin,

619
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,800
I've seen this map in the underground palace.

620
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,200
It's right next to Zhu Rong's body.

621
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,160
It seems Zhu Rong has revived it.

622
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,280
Oh no.

623
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,600
The master sealed it for a thousand years.

624
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,280
He's so angry that

625
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,120
he'll come back to take revenge on you.

626
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,000
God's will...

627
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,280
God's will...

628
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:14,880
What?

629
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,840
The master once told me

630
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,160
if the blood is removed from the sacred tree,

631
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,760
not only will the master be swallowed up

632
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:22,680
and become its shadow,

633
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,800
but also it will increase its original power

634
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,480
and bring disaster to the world.

635
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,160
No wonder.

636
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,240
No wonder I found Deng Deng's shadow

637
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,880
is lighter than usual.

638
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,960
That proves that his action has begun.

639
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,600
Yesterday's Purple Tear

640
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,280
and the wounds in the village today.

641
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,280
No wonder the master

642
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,000
reacted so harshly to the Red Green Fortress.

643
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,560
The master is kind.

644
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,120
Although he's a little impatient,

645
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,200
he won't kill anyone.

646
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,400
Yes.

647
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,320
He's really different from usual

648
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,080
when it comes to the Red Green Fortress.

649
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,040
Sir,

650
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,040
the master has lost his memory.

651
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,960
He doesn't know about these things.

652
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,360
We still have a chance to save him.

653
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,640
Let's stop him.

654
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:10,760
Where's the East Sea Bay?

655
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:11,840
I'll take you there.

656
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,120
Hold on.

657
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,400
Hold on.

658
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,360
It's okay.

659
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,000
It's okay.

660
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,840
It's okay.

661
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,520
It's okay.

662
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,560
Shi Qi.

663
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,080
Shi Qi.

664
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,520
Look who I brought here.

665
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,640
Deng Deng.

666
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,200
Miss Bai,

667
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,640
are you okay?

668
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,720
That's great.

669
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,400
It's good that you're back safely.

670
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,600
You don't know that

671
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,120
I heard that you were in trouble

672
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,880
and made everyone worried.

673
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,920
Especially Gu Bei Xi.

674
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,800
He sent people to look for him everywhere.

675
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,200
He's so worried.

676
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,760
Deng Deng,

677
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,800
can you save me some face?

678
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,520
I'll tell you the truth, okay?

679
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,200
I'm not afraid of you.

680
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,120
I'm not afraid of you.

681
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
I'm not afraid of you.

682
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
I'm not afraid of you.

683
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
I'm not afraid of you.

684
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,280
Can you tell me the truth?

685
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,520
He's crying a lot.

686
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,760
Your clothes...

687
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,080
This is a dress that I borrowed from the villagers.

688
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,640
Although it's not as pretty as it looks,

689
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,520
it's warm.

690
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,760
And Deng Deng, do you know?

691
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,560
When I started,

692
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,400
I was worried that they wouldn't like me.

693
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,880
But later I found that they're all nice people.

694
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,320
And they take good care of me.

695
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,320
I don't know how tojudge them.

696
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,880
What the hell happened?

697
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,800
Why you did a rehearsal for the medical analyzing team?

698
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
I was injured

699
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,640
when I escaped from that shit temple.

700
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,320
And I pass out halfway.

701
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,040
It was the doctor here who saved me.

702
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,360
I don't have a place

703
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,360
to stay, so I have nothing to depend upon now.

704
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,200
Keeping up some medical skill and helping people

705
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:09,800
is good, too.

706
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,080
I heard everything about your family

707
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,280
Everything will be fine.

708
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,160
The descendants of Xiong Ya Village

709
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,760
are really in trouble.

710
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,200
God is really ungrateful.

711
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,720
He made others suffer.

712
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,680
But they live a carefree life.

713
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,600
Deng Deng,

714
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,440
it's all in the past.

715
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:29,920
And

716
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,640
don't you think I'm doing fine now?

717
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,120
I'm treating and saving people

718
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,720
as a good deed.

719
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,440
Good people will get good rewards.

720
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:38,800
You

721
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,200
are so kind.

722
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,640
You are so kind.

723
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,040
Doctor!

724
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,120
Doctor!

725
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,160
Doctor!

726
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,360
Save my father!

727
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:50,320
Come on.

728
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,120
Hurry up!

729
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,720
Hurry up!

730
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,640
They are badly injured.

731
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,000
Yes.

732
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,000
Yesterday, there was a thunder in the village.

733
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,200
They burned more than ten houses.

734
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,400
Many people were injured.

735
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,760
We can't get through today.

736
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,080
I'll help you.

737
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,520
You must be safe.

738
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,480
Be careful.

739
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,640
Don't worry.

740
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,520
Doctor!

741
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,480
Doctor!

742
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,600
I'll go and see him.

743
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,800
Shadow.

744
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,160
My shadow.

745
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,640
Once the Black Saint is revived,

746
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,920
everything will be swallowed up.

747
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,240
Darkness.

748
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,600
Shadow.

749
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,320
It will rule the earth.

750
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,040
Run!

751
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,000
Your majesty!

752
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:14,720
Stop.

753
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,280
Does it hurt much?

754
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,800
No.

755
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,760
Mr.

756
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,360
he is here indeed.

757
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,280
D Different!

758
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:39,960
D Different!

759
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,000
You...

760
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,800
Wait!

761
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,320
What's going on?

762
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,200
Wait!

763
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,440
Shiqing!

764
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Wait!

765
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:23,720
Wait!

766
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:24,400
Wait!

767
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,000
If you kill me,

768
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,600
he won't live.

769
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,000
Do you think

770
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,200
you can save him?

771
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,000
What do you mean?

772
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,200
I'm the same as Yunxi.

773
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
If you hurt me,

774
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,000
he'll be hurt too.

775
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,800
If you kill me,

776
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,600
he'll die too.

777
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,600
If you kill me today,

778
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,200
when you go back,

779
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,800
you'll see his body.

780
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,200
What do you want?

781
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,000
What's wrong?

782
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,800
Be patient.

783
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,200
Do you know how much I hate this world?

784
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,200
When I devour Yunxi,

785
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,000
I'll turn this world

786
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,000
into my shadow!

787
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,400
Wait.

788
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,000
Wait.

789
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,800
What's wrong with him?

790
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,800
He was fine just now.

791
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,600
I don't know why he's like this.

792
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:37,600
Yeah.

793
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,000
He flew out suddenly

794
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,400
and vomited blood.

795
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Then he fainted

796
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,600
like someone pinched his neck.

797
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,600
I'll take him back.

798
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
He's gone!

799
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Yeah!

800
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,400
Yeah!

801
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,600
I didn't see it wrong.

802
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,400
Yeah!

803
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,800
I didn't see it wrong.

804
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,600
No!

805
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,400
He's gone!

806
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,600
He's gone!

807
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,600
Yeah!

808
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Master.

809
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Master.

810
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,600
Master, you look much better.

811
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,600
Luckily, I'm fine now.

812
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,800
Change another one.

813
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,400
Wait.

814
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,800
You've been lying in bed for hours.

815
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,400
Why are you still awake?

816
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Give it to me.

817
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,400
Wait a little longer.

818
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Master.

819
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
You've put in so many yuan energy for Master.

820
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,800
He didn't wake up.

821
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
Is there really something wrong?

822
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,600
Deng Deng was badly hurt this time.

823
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:23,400
Even if I put in a lot of yuan energy for him,

824
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,600
he needs three hours to wake up.

825
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,600
It seems that

826
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,400
what that man said is true.

827
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,400
He and Deng Deng

828
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,800
are both damaged.

829
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,000
If I hadn't stopped just now,

830
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I really can't imagine the consequences.

831
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Master.

832
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,600
It's not your fault.

833
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,800
A Xin doesn't know how powerful this is.

834
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,000
Actually, she's been sure about it.

835
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,600
You won't hurt her.

836
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,600
Let's go.

837
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,000
Deng Deng should wake up.

838
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Okay.

839
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
He's awake!

840
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,600
He's awake!

841
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Deng Deng is awake!

842
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
Deng Deng.

843
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
I'll go tell Lu Yan.

844
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
Deng Deng.

845
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
Deng Deng.

846
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,600
Deng Deng.

847
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,600
I'll go tell Lu Yan.

848
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
Deng Deng.

849
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:06,600
He's awake.

850
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,600
He's awake, right?

851
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Deng Deng is awake.

852
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,600
Don't get up. Just lie down for a while.

853
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,600
Are you okay?

854
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,600
He's awake! He's awake! He's awake!

855
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,600
Honey.

856
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,600
What kind of blood did you get?

857
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,600
I don't know either.

858
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
Lu Yan.

859
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,600
What's wrong with me?

860
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,600
What's wrong with him?

861
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,600
How is he?

862
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
Deng Deng's blood pressure is stable.

863
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
He's fine.

864
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
That's great.

865
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,600
Take the Chinese medicine.

866
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Yes.

867
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
The medicine.

868
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
The medicine.

869
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Here.

870
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
I told you he's fine.

871
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Don't worry.

872
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
Here.

873
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,600
He's drinking the medicine.

874
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,600
Here.

875
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,600
Here.

876
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,600
Here.

877
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,600
Here.

878
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,600
Here.

879
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,600
Here.

880
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,600
Here.

881
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,600
Here.

882
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
Take another sip.

883
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,600
How do you feel?

884
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:15,600
I feel better.

885
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
I'm fine.

886
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,600
That's weird.

887
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,600
I didn't see anyone hurt you.

888
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
Why are you so badly hurt this time?

889
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
Yes, Deng Deng.

890
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,600
You're usually a good eater and a good drinker.

891
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,600
Why are you suddenly like this?

892
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
That's right.

893
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
Shi Qi and I were scared.

894
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
Yes.

895
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
It's a good thing that the Second Master is capable

896
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,600
to help you get rid of these sins.

897
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,600
Otherwise...

898
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,600
Are you okay?

899
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,600
I'm fine.

900
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
Deng Deng just recovered.

901
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,600
He needs to rest.

902
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,600
Why don't you go back and rest?

903
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,600
I'll stay and accompany him.

904
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,600
No need.

905
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
I'm already awake.

906
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,600
I don't need anyone to accompany me.

907
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
You don't have to worry.

908
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
Just go.

909
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
What?

910
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,600
You don't believe me?

911
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
Otherwise,

912
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,600
I'll go down and run for you.

913
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
Don't.

914
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Deng Deng,

915
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,600
don't make any more trouble.

916
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,600
Lie down.

917
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:08,600
Then you should go.

918
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,600
I'm so sleepy.

919
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
You should go.

920
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
Otherwise, how can I sleep?

921
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,600
Enough.

922
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Enough.

923
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,600
Let's go back.

924
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
It's okay.

925
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,600
It's normal.

926
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600
It's hard to avoid bloodshed in the mountains.

927
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,600
Yes.

928
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,600
You should go.

929
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
I just want to sleep for a while.

930
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,600
I'll be fine after a nap.

931
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,600
Let's go.

932
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,600
Don't hurt your hand.

933
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,600
Have a good rest.

934
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,600
Let's go, right?

935
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
Call me if you need me.

936
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
I'll go.

937
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,600
Okay.

938
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,600
Let's go.

939
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
Go.

940
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,600
Sir,

941
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
you've been frowning tonight.

942
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,600
What's in your mind?

943
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,600
The shadow of Deng Deng is getting lighter.

944
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,320
I just checked the blood vessels in his body.

945
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,840
I found that it had been damaged by half.

946
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,880
If this continues,

947
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,920
even if I use my yuan energy,

948
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,640
it won't last for a few days.

949
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
So fast?

950
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,440
Could it be...

951
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,880
Could the master only wait here

952
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,240
to be devoured by him?

953
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:08,080
If I can still be touched,

954
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,240
I will use my voice if I miss you.

955
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,520
The most beautiful scenery in life

956
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,600
is all about you.

957
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,960
Deng Deng's heart is so close to yours.

958
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,360
When the whole world is occupied by you,

959
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:40,200
I will call your name with all my strength

960
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:45,200
until I can remember you.

961
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:51,160
You are the only one

962
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:57,960
who can walk into the scenery.

963
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,760
This city is full of leaves

964
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,560
and all the clouds are in the sky.

965
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,600
I avoid my heart

966
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,040
to decide for you.

967
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,760
I'm sorry.

968
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,760
