1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll never let you go after you leave

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You are me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You are me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You are me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm the one who's in danger

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You are me

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 1

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I found it!

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Honey, I finally found it

10
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
A way to get rid of the spirit worm

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What way?

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I've been flying for a long time

13
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I finally found a way to deal with the ancient king from the巡略师

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's called the Bichen Pearl

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Bichen Pearl?

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Three thousand years ago, there was once a Bichen Pearl in the Gushu dynasty

17
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
But with the change of dynasty

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm not sure if this Bichen Pearl is still in the Gushu capital

19
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
But we can try

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The Gushu will be in the east of the forest, not far from us

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Wait, can you get on the road?

22
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Of course I can

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm fine, I can eat, I can drink, I can jump

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Besides, Lu Yan is with me

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What else are you worried about?

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Okay, let's go now

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I haven't packed my luggage

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll pack my luggage first

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hurry up

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Miss, Miss

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hurry up

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Hurry up

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Miss

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Hurry up

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Hurry up

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Bring these young and beautiful girls back to the mountain

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Miss

38
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What are you doing?

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Where is Miss Zhang? Hurry up

40
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll lure them away

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You run first

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
No, I can't

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Where is she?

44
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Where is she?

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's her, get her back

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Shi Qi, run

47
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't move

48
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Don't move

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let me go

50
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Let me go

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Wang Zhiliang

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Kneel

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't move

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't move

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Go

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Where is your Miss?

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm not talking

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Kill them all

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Go

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Stop

61
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Stupid girl

62
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm the one who killed them, I'll go with you

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You let them go

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Why are you back?

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Don't move

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Dad

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
They say Miss Bai has a good temper

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's true

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let go of my daughter

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What do you want?

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Isn't it just money?

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'll give it all to you

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Director Bai

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Didn't he lead the army to our mountain village before?

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Now you know to beg for mercy

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's too late

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Other than the girl, the rest of them are dead

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Dad, dad

79
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Shi Qi

80
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Why are you here?

81
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Little Madam

82
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Little Madam

83
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Little Madam

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Why are you back?

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You

86
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You and the prince

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Are my

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Teacher

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
They say this little woman is a monster

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I just think so

91
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Dad

92
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Dad

93
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Brother, you have to hurry up

94
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The boss said he wouldn't let anyone in

95
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You're so annoying

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You are the young master of the Bai family

97
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You are really different from the women of Shan Shan

98
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You are so annoying

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Where are the others of my Bai family?

100
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Where did you lock them?

101
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The others of the Bai family are all dead

102
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Where are they?

103
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The others of the Bai family are all dead

104
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Where are they?

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Where are they?

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Where are they?

107
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Where are they?

108
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Where are they?

109
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The others of the Bai family are all dead

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Where are the others?

111
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Why are you hiding?

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Are you afraid?

113
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll protect you

114
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll protect you

115
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You bit me

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Let's see how I deal with you

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
If you dare to come over

118
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll kill myself here

119
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You are

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Brother

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Brother

122
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't really hurt him

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
This is the price our boss will keep

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
If he really dies

125
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The boss must die

126
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'll let you go today

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You go to the station

128
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's go

129
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It's really the Xiong Ya Village that robbed the Bai family

130
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You are right

131
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
These two days, the brothers went to the shops

132
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
To investigate

133
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
They saw the human pawns of the Xiong Ya Village

134
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The things of the Bai family

135
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Are you sure Miss Bai is in the Xiong Ya Village now?

136
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Yes

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
But

138
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
She was caught in the Xiong Ya Village

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's no different from dying

140
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
No one can get people out of the Xiong Ya Village

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Can't get them out?

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I, Gu Bei Xi, want to see

143
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
How much she can do

144
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You don't want to face the Xiong Ya Village alone, do you?

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Don't be impulsive

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
At least

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't wait for your brothers from the South Wind Village to come and go together

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
But Bai Shi Qi can't wait

149
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
She helped me so much

150
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I can't leave her alone

151
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Mr. Gu

152
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Look, the city of Yingdu is not peaceful recently

153
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Many brothers have gone out to search for the future

154
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Look, there are only a few of us left

155
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Which one is not up and down?

156
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We can't get out

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Leave the rest to me

158
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You are all brave enough

159
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I can't let you take the risk with me

160
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Otherwise, I, Gu Bei Xi, will be bored

161
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
There is one more thing

162
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You say

163
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Where to get the sharpest knife in the city?

164
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Go

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,280
So many Bri never darauf

166
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,680
Why are you awake?

167
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,440
Go to sleep

168
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,000
When I get here this afternoon, I will have a rest

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I will wake you up when you arrive

170
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Someone said something just now

171
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It woke me up

172
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I didn't say anything

173
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I heard it.

174
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,440
I heard it again.

175
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,440
Deng Deng, I'm sorry.

176
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,960
I wanted to grow old with you,

177
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,920
but I'm afraid I'm going to break my promise today.

178
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,440
Remember, I must repay you.

179
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,880
You will marry me in this life.

180
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,000
This is a life-and-death matter.

181
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,520
What's wrong with you?

182
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,520
Why are you not even listening to me?

183
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,640
You have to listen to this a dozen times every day.

184
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,840
I'm used to it.

185
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,880
It's boring.

186
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,200
You must rest well recently.

187
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,200
You can't have an over-the-top mood

188
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,000
and over-use your primordial energy.

189
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,320
I'm afraid it will increase the loss of your primordial energy.

190
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,320
You said not to use primordial energy.

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,080
Is it this?

192
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,600
Stop playing these useless tricks.

193
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,880
How is this useless trick?

194
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,480
I've studied this trick carefully.

195
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,720
This flower can not only lead the way,

196
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,680
but also transmit the message.

197
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,400
The most important thing is that it can track.

198
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,360
You have to be good in the future.

199
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,720
Otherwise, you will do everything behind my back.

200
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,240
I'm a good person.

201
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,560
What's going on?

202
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,440
This magic is limited in time.

203
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,240
You'd better use your hair to send me a message.

204
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,840
You can't use your primordial energy anymore.

205
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,240
Am I not good enough?

206
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,240
I'll try again.

207
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,960
You are a flower god.

208
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,440
Before the matter of the spirit worm is solved,

209
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,720
you have to listen to me.

210
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,320
Then let me go first.

211
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,160
Do you want to sneak attack me?

212
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,480
You have to step on me first,

213
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,000
then hit me with your fist.

214
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,280
What's going on today?

215
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,320
Why do you know everything I want to do?

216
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,840
I added soul-chasing technique to your hair.

217
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,760
Soul-chasing technique?

218
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,080
I've integrated my primordial energy into your primordial energy.

219
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,080
So every time you use your primordial energy,

220
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,480
I can feel it.

221
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,320
No matter how much you use your primordial energy,

222
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,320
I can feel it.

223
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,120
No matter where you use your primordial energy,

224
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
I can feel it.

225
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,680
So you are the kind of husband

226
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,120
who is very scary in the book.

227
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,120
You love me so much that you want to control me.

228
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,920
You don't even have enough eyes.

229
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,200
You even want to touch my little feet.

230
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,480
If I fall in love with someone else,

231
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:28,400
you will lock me in a small dark room and let you do whatever you want.

232
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,160
So you like this kind of play.

233
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,200
You are so bold and generous.

234
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,600
You are so deep in my heart.

235
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,600
Soul-chasing technique is used to deal with enemies.

236
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,600
Now I use it to find out

237
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,600
the state of the primordial energy that has been lost in the body.

238
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,600
In addition,

239
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
it may be able to find out Zhu Rong's traces.

240
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,600
So now,

241
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
have you found out Zhu Rong's traces?

242
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
Maybe it's because Zhu Rong

243
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,600
hasn't used his primordial energy for a while.

244
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
It's also possible that

245
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,600
he has escaped to a place

246
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,600
where even the soul-chasing technique can't be used.

247
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,600
It's okay.

248
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Take your time.

249
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
I'll find it with you.

250
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,600
I think the soul-chasing technique you just mentioned is interesting.

251
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
I have a new way of playing.

252
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Are you going to die?

253
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
What's wrong, Master?

254
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,600
No.

255
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
I have to go to their car.

256
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,600
Can you calm down for a while?

257
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Are you going to be annoying?

258
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
There are only two of them in your car.

259
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,600
A single man and a single woman.

260
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,600
When the car is still small,

261
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,600
if that kid takes advantage of me,

262
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,600
I'll be in a hurry to cry.

263
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
When the car is not small anymore.

264
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Stop the car, sea!

265
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
What are you doing?

266
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
Master.

267
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Stop the car.

268
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Come here.

269
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
Sit here.

270
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,600
What are you doing?

271
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
If I don't come, you'll suffer a lot.

272
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,600
Do you know?

273
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,600
You haven't married yet.

274
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,600
You're so shameless.

275
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,600
What kind of attitude is that?

276
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,600
Do you have any eye power?

277
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,600
It's okay.

278
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,600
Let him see if he wants to.

279
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
Lu Yan, come and eat some fruit.

280
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Old fish.

281
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
You've never fed me grapes.

282
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
You're so good.

283
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,600
You forgot your father when you married a man.

284
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Let me ask you.

285
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Lu Yan and I were caught by a monster.

286
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
Who did you save first?

287
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
What's the problem?

288
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,600
I'm tired.

289
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
I'm going to sleep.

290
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
You can't sleep.

291
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,600
Deng Deng.

292
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,600
Deng Deng.

293
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Deng Deng.

294
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,600
Deng Deng.

295
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Deng Deng.

296
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,600
Deng Deng.

297
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,600
Deng Deng.

298
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Deng Deng.

299
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,600
Deng Deng.

300
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Deng Deng.

301
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
Deng Deng.

302
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Deng Deng.

303
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Deng Deng.

304
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,600
Deng Deng.

305
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,600
Deng Deng.

306
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,600
Deng Deng.

307
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,600
Deng Deng.

308
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,600
Deng Deng.

309
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,600
Deng Deng.

310
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Deng Deng.

311
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Deng Deng.

312
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,600
Deng Deng.

313
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Deng Deng.

314
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,600
Deng Deng.

315
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Deng Deng.

316
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,600
Deng Deng.

317
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
Deng Deng.

318
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,600
Deng Deng.

319
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,600
Deng Deng.

320
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,600
Deng Deng.

321
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,600
Deng Deng.

322
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,600
Deng Deng.

323
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Deng Deng.

324
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Deng Deng.

325
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,600
Deng Deng.

326
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,600
Where's Deng Deng?

327
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,600
Deng Deng.

328
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,600
Deng Deng.

329
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,600
Deng Deng.

330
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
Come on.

331
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,600
Deng Deng.

332
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,600
Deng Deng.

333
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,600
Deng Deng.

334
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,600
Deng Deng.

335
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,600
Deng Deng.

336
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
Deng Deng.

337
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Deng Deng.

338
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,600
Deng Deng.

339
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,600
Deng Deng.

340
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Deng Deng.

341
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,600
Deng Deng.

342
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Deng Deng.

343
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,600
Deng Deng.

344
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
Deng Deng.

345
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,600
Deng Deng.

346
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
Deng Deng.

347
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
Deng Deng.

348
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Deng Deng.

349
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
Deng Deng.

350
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,600
Deng Deng.

351
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,600
Deng Deng.

352
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,000
Yes, surely.

353
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,300
Where's Ru Yan?

354
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,200
He woke up last time

355
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,800
as soon as you ordered yourable.

356
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,500
Why is he still unconscious now?

357
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,400
Come on.

358
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Brother Xiaoan,

359
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,360
Mr. Sun came here

360
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,360
to ask me to deliver the container.

361
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:17,000
Let Steve

362
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,120
to take a look at it.

363
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Wow,

364
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,400
you Eyes closed

365
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,560
PET bottle

366
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,560
You're a heartless girl.

367
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,560
If it weren't for Lu Yan

368
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,560
who gave you the Yuan energy tree,

369
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,560
you wouldn't be able to wake up today.

370
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,560
I, Yu Dongdong, am lucky.

371
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,560
Lord Yan saw me and went around.

372
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,560
All right, old fish, don't cry.

373
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,560
It's okay.

374
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,560
Don't worry.

375
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,560
I thought I could take the Yuan energy tree back.

376
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,560
I was too impatient.

377
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,560
But it's okay.

378
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,560
They're on their way.

379
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,560
When they get here,

380
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:21,560
I'll get everything back for you.

381
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:32,560
The Yuan energy tree

382
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,560
Come on.

383
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,560
I can do it myself.

384
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,560
It's not that bad.

385
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,560
This is the closest village

386
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,560
to the capital of Gu Chu.

387
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Let's take a break here.

388
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,560
Wait.

389
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,560
Wait for me at the inn.

390
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,560
I'll go to the village with Xing

391
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:05,560
to see if anyone here

392
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,560
knows about the Bicheng Pearl.

393
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,560
I'll go with you.

394
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
All right, you'll faint if you go out.

395
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
Don't follow me.

396
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,560
You're making me worried.

397
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,560
Let him go.

398
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
All right.

399
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
I'll help them move their luggage here.

400
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
I'll go to you later.

401
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
Okay.

402
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
Let's go, Xing.

403
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,560
Okay.

404
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,560
Brother, help me.

405
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
Okay.

406
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,560
You're so talented.

407
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,560
I'll go with Da Hai.

408
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,560
Go.

409
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,560
You're too...

410
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
I'll go with Da Hai.

411
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,560
You're too much.

412
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,560
You can't lose anything.

413
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,560
I'm not pregnant.

414
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,560
Why are you so dirty?

415
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:39,560
Let's go.

416
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
Hurry up.

417
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,560
Boss, have you seen this?

418
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,560
No, I haven't.

419
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
You haven't?

420
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,560
I haven't.

421
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
Have you seen this?

422
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
Hello.

423
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,560
This.

424
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,560
Have you seen this?

425
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,560
No.

426
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,560
Do you know the state of Bicheng?

427
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,560
I haven't heard of any state.

428
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560
Have you seen this Bicheng Pearl?

429
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
No.

430
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,560
This is the old capital of the ancient rat.

431
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,560
But the people in the village

432
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,560
haven't even heard of the ancient rat.

433
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
Sir, I asked a lot of people.

434
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,560
They don't know about the news of Bicheng Pearl.

435
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,560
Did we find the wrong place?

436
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,560
How about we meet in the east tomorrow?

437
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,560
And I found that the villagers here

438
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,560
are a little strange.

439
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
Yeah.

440
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,560
I found it too.

441
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,560
This is the totem of the ancient rat.

442
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,560
Excuse me.

443
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,560
Where did this totem come from?

444
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
What totem?

445
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,560
This is the totem of the ancient rat

446
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,560
from 3,000 years ago.

447
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,560
Are you a resident of the ancient rat?

448
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,560
This is a pattern passed down from generations of our village.

449
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,560
I don't know how it came from.

450
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,560
As for the ancient rat country you mentioned,

451
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,560
I really don't know.

452
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,560
Sir,

453
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,560
that's weird.

454
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,560
The villagers all use the totem of the ancient rat

455
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,560
but say that they are not residents of the ancient rat.

456
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,560
The ancient rat has been distant for more than 3,000 years.

457
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,560
Maybe the villagers here

458
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,560
have forgotten their ancestors.

459
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,560
It may also be because the villagers are too cautious

460
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,560
and are unwilling to tell the truth to us,

461
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,560
but no matter what,

462
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,560
this village must have a certain relationship with the ancient rat country.

463
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
A Xin,

464
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,560
we have to stay here for two more days.

465
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
As long as there is a glimmer of hope,

466
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,560
we must investigate.

467
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,560
What's going on?

468
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,560
You picked a woman for so long.

469
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,560
You went down the mountain to pick her?

470
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,560
You went down the mountain to pick her?

471
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,560
Who are you?

472
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,560
You are the head of Xunya village.

473
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,560
I am Gu Bei Xi of South Wind Village.

474
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,560
I am Gu Bei Xi of South Wind Village.

475
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,560
I am here to investigate.

476
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,560
We have always been close to each other.

477
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,560
Do you really think I am afraid of you?

478
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,560
Since you are here,

479
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
don't think about leaving.

480
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:36,560
Little brat,

481
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,560
you dare to come to my village to investigate?

482
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,560
You are really tired of living?

483
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,560
I will satisfy you now.

484
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
I will satisfy you now.

485
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,560
Do you know why I like to use a gun?

486
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,560
Why do I use a knife today?

487
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
Because it hurts more to kill people with a knife.

488
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,560
And I die slower.

489
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,560
You bastard!

490
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,560
Brother,

491
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
do we have some misunderstanding?

492
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,560
We have no grudge and no enmity.

493
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,560
We can make it clear.

494
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,560
Don't use a knife to shoot.

495
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,560
Bai Shi Qi's matter is about Gu Bei Xi.

496
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,560
If you offend the Bai family,

497
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,560
you offend our South Wind Village.

498
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
Where is Bai Shi Qi?

499
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
He is in the backyard.

500
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
I will kill him.

501
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,560
Brother.

502
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,560
Our family is also locked in the backyard.

503
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,560
Please save them.

504
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,560
Please save them.

505
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,560
Stand up.

506
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,560
I will save a good person today.

507
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,560
You find a place to hide.

508
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,560
I will go to save them.

509
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,560
Thank you, brother.

510
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,560
Thank you.

511
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,560
Thank you, brother.

512
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,560
Don't be afraid.

513
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,560
I am not from Xunya Village.

514
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,560
I am here to save you.

515
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,560
Go to help.

516
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,560
Okay.

517
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,560
Did you see a girl?

518
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,560
She is over 20 years old.

519
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,560
She is very beautiful.

520
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,560
She is tall.

521
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,560
We don't know.

522
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,560
Maybe she is in the next room.

523
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,560
Help each other.

524
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,560
Okay.

525
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,560
Shi Qi.

526
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,560
Shi Qi.

527
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,560
Shi Qi.

528
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
Shi Qi.

529
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,560
Shi Qi.

530
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,560
Shi Qi.

531
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,560
Shi Qi.

532
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,560
You...

533
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
Shi Qi.

534
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,560
I am here to save you.

535
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,560
I am here to save you.

536
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,560
I am here to save you, Shi Qi.

537
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Shi Qi.

538
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,560
Shi Qi.

539
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,560
It's me, Shi Qi.

540
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
I am Gu Bei Xin.

541
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Shi Qi.

542
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
It's me.

543
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Look at me.

544
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,560
It's me.

545
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
Look at me.

546
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
It's me.

547
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,560
Gu Bei Xin.

548
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
Bei Xin.

549
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
Gu Bei Xin.

550
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,560
It's me.

551
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:29,560
Gu Bei Xin.

552
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
My father...

553
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
My father is gone.

554
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,560
They...

555
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,560
They...

556
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:40,560
They killed my father in front of me.

557
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
My father...

558
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
Don't be afraid.

559
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,560
I will help you to get back your car.

560
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,560
They said my family is gone.

561
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,560
I have no home, Gu Bei Xin.

562
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,560
It's too late.

563
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,560
I have no home.

564
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,560
What about me?

565
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,560
I will be your home from now on.

566
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
Gu Bei Xin.

567
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,560
Can you help me to get my father back?

568
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,560
My father will not die.

569
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,560
He will not die.

570
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
Please help me.

571
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
He will not die.

572
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,560
He will not die.

573
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,560
I beg you.

574
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,560
I beg you.

575
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
Don't eat and drink.

576
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,560
Someone broke into the mountain village.

577
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,560
Why are you all standing there?

578
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,560
Find him.

579
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,560
Gu Bei Xin of the mountain village is not far away.

580
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,560
I will kill him today.

581
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,560
Search.

582
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
Shi Qi, they are too many now.

583
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,560
I will send you out first.

584
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,560
Leave the rest to me.

585
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,560
Go.

586
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
Go.

587
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,560
Find the boy from the south village.

588
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,560
I will kill him today.

589
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
You didn't see it, right?

590
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,560
Although I use guns,

591
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:37,560
this is the same kung fu I learned when I was a child.

592
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,560
Go there.

593
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,560
What should we do?

594
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,560
What should we do?

595
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,560
We seem to be surrounded.

596
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
I will lure them away.

597
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,560
There is a Taiping Village not far from here.

598
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
There is a old temple of the city.

599
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,560
Wait for me there.

600
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,560
No.

601
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,560
You will come here to save me.

602
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,560
I know you will run away later.

603
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
You go back to the south village and then come to save me.

604
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:01,560
There is no time.

605
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
Listen to my arrangement.

606
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,560
Gu Bei Xin.

607
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,560
You have to promise me.

608
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,560
You will come to me.

609
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,560
You won't leave me alone.

610
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,560
Don't worry.

611
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,560
I have nothing else.

612
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,560
I am lucky.

613
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:25,560
Keep it.

614
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,560
Then it's a deal.

615
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
I will wait for you in that shabby temple.

616
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
You don't come.

617
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,560
I don't go.

618
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,560
I will wait for you.

619
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Catch him.

620
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,560
Hurry.

621
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
Little girl.

622
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,560
I will let you die there today.

623
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
Shoot.

624
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,560
I will kill you.

625
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Shoot.

626
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
Chase.

627
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,560
Hurry.

628
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,560
Hurry.

629
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,560
Hello.

630
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,560
Have you seen this?

631
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,560
Take a good look.

632
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Master.

633
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,560
People here are so strange.

634
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,560
You said the name is Bailesun.

635
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,560
But there is no face.

636
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,560
It's too scary.

637
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,560
I also think it's strange.

638
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
Sorry.

639
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,560
It's not on purpose.

640
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,560
Where did you go?

641
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
Let me find it.

642
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Eat something.

643
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
What's wrong?

644
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,560
Is it okay?

645
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,560
Firefly.

646
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,560
Are you okay?

647
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,560
Firefly.

648
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,560
Ordinary people.

649
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
Firefly.

650
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
What?

651
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Firefly.

652
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
What firefly?

653
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
What's wrong?

654
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,560
There is something wrong with him.

655
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
He often talks nonsense.

656
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
Don't mind.

657
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
Firefly.

658
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,560
Let's go home.

659
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,560
Firefly.

660
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
It's okay.

661
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,560
Go home.

662
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,560
Don't be afraid.

663
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,560
Firefly.

664
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Don't be afraid.

665
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,560
Firefly.

666
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
It's interesting.

667
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,560
Firefly.

668
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,560
How long has it been?

669
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,560
I didn't get any useful information.

670
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
What should we do?

671
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,560
Go to another place.

672
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
Okay.

673
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,560
Lu Yan.

674
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,560
A'xi.

675
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,560
Let's go.

676
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,560
Go.

677
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,560
Go.

678
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,560
The morning has arrived.

679
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,560
Bride and groom bow to heaven and earth.

680
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,560
First, bow to heaven and earth.

681
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,560
Second, bow to heaven and earth.

682
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,560
Second, bow to heaven and earth.

683
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
Master.

684
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,560
It looks like a wedding.

685
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,560
Third, bow to heaven and earth.

686
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,560
Ceremony is over.

687
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,560
Let's go.

688
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,560
It doesn't look like a wedding.

689
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,560
It looks like a soul.

690
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
It's okay, master.

691
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,560
Don't be afraid.

692
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,560
I'll go ask them.

693
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,560
Who are you?

694
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,560
This...

695
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,560
Sorry.

696
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Wrong door.

697
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,560
Sorry to bother you.

698
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
Yes.

699
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,560
It's so scary.

700
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
Oh my god.

701
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
It's so scary.

702
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,560
My goosebumps are all up.

703
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,560
Although this village is very strange,

704
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,560
I've already checked it.

705
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,560
There are no spirits here.

706
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,560
They are all normal people.

707
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,560
Wait.

708
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,560
Wait.

709
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Father.

710
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
Second father.

711
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,560
I finally found you.

712
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,560
I found something strange.

713
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,560
What strange thing?

714
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,560
They all said that your stall

715
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,560
is not allowed to be put in front of my house.

716
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,560
They said it's useless, right?

717
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,560
You blinded your dog's eyes.

718
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,560
Look at these people.

719
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,560
They are all acting strange.

720
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,560
Even if they hit like that,

721
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,560
they don't even look at each other.

722
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,560
We saw a wedding just now.

723
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,560
Everyone's face is all wet.

724
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,560
Okay.

725
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,560
Everyone, wake up carefully.

726
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,560
Think carefully.

727
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,560
Are the people in this village

728
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,560
not like them?

729
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,560
Why did you hit my stuff?

730
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,560
One person is different.

731
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
You mean

732
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,560
the idiot who keeps talking about fireflies?

733
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,560
What idiot?

734
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,560
You.

735
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,560
I think that idiot is very strange.

736
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,560
So I put a tracking trick on him.

737
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,560
Our top priority now

738
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,560
is to find that idiot.

739
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,560
Maybe he will know

740
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,560
what happened in this village.

741
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,560
Why did you hit my stuff?

742
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,560
You are really like my auntie Lu.

743
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,560
You really have a good reputation.

744
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,560
You are still beautiful.

745
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,560
You are too smart.

746
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,560
You can't control yourself.

747
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,560
Don't be silly.

748
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
Don't worry about the baby.

749
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,560
I'm happy to.

750
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,560
How dare you hit me?

751
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,560
Come with me.

752
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
It's here.

753
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,560
Is anyone here?

754
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,560
Is anyone here?

755
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
Is anyone here?

756
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
We are coming in.

757
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,560
Excuse me,

758
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,560
we want to ask you something.

759
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
Don't be nervous.

760
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
We are not bad people.

761
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,560
We just came to ask him something.

762
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,560
It's you.

763
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,560
We don't have any weapons.

764
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
Don't worry.

765
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
By the way,

766
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,560
we brought something.

767
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,560
Come on.

768
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,560
This is for him.

769
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,560
If you think

770
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,560
there are too many people and it's not safe,

771
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,560
I can stay here alone

772
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:40,560
and talk to him.

773
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,560
Deng Zheng,

774
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,560
you don't know the situation.

775
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,560
Why do you stay?

776
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,560
It's okay.

777
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,560
Lu Yan said they are all ordinary people.

778
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,560
What if?

779
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,560
What if something happens?

780
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,560
Just ask.

781
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,560
What's his name?

782
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,560
I don't know.

783
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,560
I only know his surname is Sun.

784
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,560
He is a embroiderer.

785
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,560
He is the smartest person

786
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
in our village.

787
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,560
But later,

788
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
everyone called him a fool.

789
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,560
Why did he become a fool?

790
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
What's your relationship with him?

791
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,560
I'm the child of Zhang's host.

792
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,560
My name is Xiao Mei.

793
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,560
The Zhang family beat me every day.

794
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
He would stop me when he passed by.

795
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,560
I saved his life.

796
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,560
But later,

797
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,560
he became a fool.

798
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,560
Don't worry.

799
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,560
We won't hurt him.

800
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,560
Yes.

801
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,560
Yes.

802
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,560
Miss,

803
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,560
have a cake he likes.

804
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,560
Have you seen this?

805
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
Great.

806
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,560
Long Wen.

807
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
Long Wen.

808
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
Long Wen.

809
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
What Long Wen?

810
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,560
Where have you seen Long Wen?

811
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,560
Long Wen.

812
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,560
Long Wen.

813
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
Long Wen.

814
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,560
Let him have a rest.

815
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,560
Dai Hai,

816
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,320
Stay here and take care of this brother.

817
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,480
Xiao Mei,

818
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,800
I've arranged my apprentice

819
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,760
to take care of him here.

820
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,720
Don't worry.

821
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,160
Yes, don't worry.

822
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,280
Come in.

823
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,760
Oh, my God.

824
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,840
It's late at night.

825
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,360
Why don't you come over to sleep?

826
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,240
It's late.

827
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,520
Why don't you sleep?

828
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,640
Are you hiding something from me?

829
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,240
I'm not.

830
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:09,840
I'm not.

831
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,600
I'm not.

832
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,400
I'm not.

833
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,240
I'm not.

834
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,040
I'm not.

835
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,840
I'm not.

836
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,640
I'm not.

837
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,640
I'm not.

838
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,640
I'm not.

839
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
I'm not.

840
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,840
You're hiding something from me.

841
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,440
What can I do?

842
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:22,760
Go back to sleep.

843
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,280
Don't lie to me.

844
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,760
I can see it.

845
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,560
You've been worried since you came out

846
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,720
from that silly embroidery shop in the daytime.

847
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,540
Especially when you heard that dragon's

848
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,840
and fireflies,

849
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,040
you were very angry.

850
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,160
Do you know anything?

851
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,600
Don't ask. Go back to sleep.

852
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,920
Dad, don't try to fool me.

853
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,360
I'm your daughter.

854
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,600
Do you want to tell me?

855
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,200
No.

856
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,280
Fine.

857
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,440
I'll go to my dad for justice.

858
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,840
You can't stand the torture.

859
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,000
What are you going to do?

860
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,920
You know my character.

861
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,360
If you don't tell me,

862
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,920
I won't give up.

863
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,880
I'll tell you.

864
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,840
This dragon's

865
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,240
has something to do with your mother's death.

866
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,240
It has something to do with my mother's death?

867
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,320
I heard from my dad

868
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,920
that when I was a kid,

869
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,640
a group of bad guys

870
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,640
broke into the village

871
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,760
and killed my mother and some people in the village.

872
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,320
What happened, dad?

873
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,640
Wait.

874
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,720
Actually, I've talked to your mother.

875
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,920
We feel very good.

876
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,120
We've agreed to live together for a lifetime.

877
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,720
We don't want to live the same year, the same month, the same day.

878
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,920
But we want to die the same year, the same month, the same day.

879
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,960
I'm sorry.

880
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,840
But that day,

881
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,920
I had to go hunting early.

882
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,760
When I came back, I...

883
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,840
Xiaorou.

884
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,640
Xiaorou.

885
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,520
Xiaorou.

886
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,080
Xiaorou.

887
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,240
Li Rong.

888
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,680
Xiaorou.

889
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,320
Ni Kerui,

890
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,640
is sleeping.

891
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,640
The seal left behind by Li Siqin.

892
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,040
I think this seal

893
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,040
must have something to do with the murderer who killed Ningning.

894
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,640
Then I looked for you everywhere.

895
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,440
The villagers told me

896
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,240
they gave you to a beggar

897
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,440
and brought you out of the village.

898
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:19,040
Does the fool know anything?

899
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,240
Does he know

900
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,240
how my mother died?

901
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,440
He...he...

902
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,640
He should know.

903
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:34,840
Dad.

904
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,240
Dad, it's okay.

905
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,040
Let's go to the fool tomorrow morning.

906
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,840
He'll know if we ask him.

907
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,040
I found the seal

908
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,040
left by your mother

909
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,240
before she died.

910
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,240
I think this seal

911
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,640
must have something to do with the murderer who killed Ningning.

912
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,040
I'll contact him.

913
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,440
Sir.

914
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:10,840
Sir.

915
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:12,640
What's wrong?

916
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,640
Nothing.

917
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,240
Is it because of what the owner's father said?

918
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,040
Actually, the dragon doll they were talking about

919
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,640
I have one.

920
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,840
If love can be touched

921
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:46,040
Missing you will be heard

922
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:54,240
The most beautiful scenery in life

923
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:00,440
It's all about you

924
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,640
When two hearts are so close

925
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,840
When the whole world is occupied by you

926
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,840
I will call you hard to find you

927
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,840
Until your memory

928
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:23,840
You are the only one

929
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:30,840
walking into the scenery

930
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,440
This city is like a rain shower

931
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,440
The clouds are separated by love

932
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:42,040
I hide in my heart

933
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,440
The decision I made for you

934
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,440
When two hearts are so close

935
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:11,440
When the whole world is occupied by you

936
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:16,440
I will call you hard to find you

937
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:21,440
Until your memory

938
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:27,440
You are the only one

939
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:33,440
walking into the scenery

940
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,440
This city is like a rain shower

941
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,440
The clouds are separated by love

942
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,440
I hide in my heart

943
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,440
The decision I made for you
