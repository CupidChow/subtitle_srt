[Episode 25]

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,160
Sir.

28
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,289
Sir, what's going on with you?

29
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,170
Nothing.

30
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:54,990
Is it because of the event

31
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,070
Chieftain Yu just told you?

32
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,930
Actually, I have a dragon mark on me,

33
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,289
the kind they were talking about.

34
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,530
Right now I'm the only one

35
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:12,660
who has it.

36
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,540
What...

37
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:17,220
What is this all about?

38
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,260
My father branded this dragon mark on me,

39
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,610
to remind me of the hardships

40
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,020
of human being's life,

41
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:26,630
and our fight against the spirit clan.

42
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,690
But Chieftain Yu said...

43
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,360
I find it odd as well.

44
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:36,240
The most important thing now

45
00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:37,870
is to find the Dust-proof Bead.

46
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,060
Later, I will

47
00:02:40,329 --> 00:02:41,790
definitely get to the bottom

48
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,620
of this.

49
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,880
Bai Shiqi!

50
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,110
Shiqi!

51
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,080
Shiqi!

52
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,450
Shiqi.

53
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,350
Bai Shiqi!

54
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,430
Bai Shiqi!

55
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,380
Shiqi!

56
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,830
Don't come here. Don't come here.

57
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,339
Don't come here.

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,320
Don't come here. Don't come here.

59
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,360
Don't be scared. I'm a human being.

60
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,780
There were monsters.

61
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:36,409
They killed a lot of people.

62
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,760
Don't be scared.

63
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,040
Let me ask you something.

64
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,350
Have you seen a girl with long hair,

65
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,650
and wears white?

66
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,320
They took her. They took her.

67
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,159
Did she carry this gun with her?

68
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,680
They took her.

69
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,460
That girl used this gun to shoot the monsters,

70
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,480
but she missed.

71
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,070
And then she was caught by the monsters.

72
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:27,440
Dad.

73
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,150
We have to go now.

74
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,500
Where is he?

75
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,400
What's wrong?

76
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,650
I can't find my father

77
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,210
and my uncle.

78
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:36,800
Last night,

79
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,060
I did hear their footsteps,

80
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:39,380
leaving their room.

81
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,820
They must have gone to find the Dummy.

82
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:48,400
Weird.

83
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,790
Why no one is here?

84
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,320
My dad didn't come here.

85
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,060
Where did Dahai and the Dummy go?

86
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,130
He probably has left a short time ago.

87
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,970
My dad has left a note for me.

88
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,840
Lv Er and I are gonna take care of some things. Don't worry.

89
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,780
Sneaky old man.

90
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,220
He left without saying goodbye.

91
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,350
Who?

92
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,250
What's going on?

93
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,030
Open the door!

94
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,020
Someone set a fire outside.

95
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,720
How dare you try to burn me?

96
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,900
I'll kick your...

97
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,450
You didn't even let the beauty save the hero.

98
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,690
Next time.

99
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,020
Come out, son of a bitch!

100
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,710
You're capable of setting fire.

101
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,340
Why are you hiding now?

102
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,560
The arsonist has gone.

103
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,550
So quickly.

104
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,940
We only had a few words with the Dummy,

105
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,560
and someone wants to kill him.

106
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,360
It seems that the dummy

107
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,350
knows some secrets.

108
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,630
Maybe this is

109
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,160
why this village

110
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,190
is so strange.

111
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,150
Master,

112
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,810
what happened?

113
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,890
Never mind what had happened.

114
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,540
I asked you to look after the man. Where is he?

115
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,130
I almost forgot.

116
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,740
Master, come and save the Dummy with me.

117
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,110
I slept too sound at night

118
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,700
and didn't notice.

119
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,750
After I woke up, I found that many villagers

120
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,420
went to the Dummy's room and took him.

121
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,350
I followed them quietly and saw that

122
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
they were trying to kill him.

123
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,360
Let's go now.

124
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Quick. Quick. Quick.

125
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,060
Kill him. Kill him. Kill him.

126
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,990
Harder!

127
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,540
Kill him. Kill him.

128
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,230
Master. Here.

129
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:39,560
Stop it！

130
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,490
Kill him.

131
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:47,170
What are you doing?

132
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,830
How dare you use illegal punishment to kill a man?

133
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,030
Do not think you are above the law?

134
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,590
They know black magic.

135
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:53,190
You are devils.

136
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,470
You are monsters.

137
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,100
You people are more like monsters.

138
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:00,740
I'm warning you.

139
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,130
This is a private matter of our Baile Village.

140
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,770
Leave right away.

141
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,560
Go mind your own buiness.

142
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:08,630
Do you have any idea

143
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,810
what kind of person I am?

144
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,370
I love meddling in other people's business.

145
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,830
You're treating a man's life as if it were grass.

146
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,890
This is my business now.

147
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,600
You...

148
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,890
The Dummy is the sinner of our village.

149
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,500
He shouldn't come back.

150
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,070
Sinner?

151
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,550
He offended the Cliff Man.

152
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:26,700
He wants to tell the secret inside the cliff.

153
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:29,710
Clearly he wants us all to die with him.

154
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,440
Who is the Cliff Man?

155
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
The Cliff Man

156
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,840
is a Mountain God

157
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,210
who protects Baile Villiage.

158
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,990
He blesses us with good harvest,

159
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,790
safty and health.

160
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,980
Who is against the Cliff Man

161
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,810
is our enemy.

162
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,150
Protect the Cliff Man! Protect the Cliff Man!

163
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,790
Protect the Cliff Man! Protect the Cliff Man!

164
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,780
Protect the Cliff Man! Protect the Cliff Man!

165
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,580
Protect the Cliff Man! Protect the Cliff Man!

166
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,670
You can't take him with you.

167
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:04,930
If we let him go today,

168
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:05,810
the Mountain God

169
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,020
will punish us.

170
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,810
I will definitely take him today.

171
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:09,950
Go!

172
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,420
Can we take him now?

173
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:22,960
You...

174
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,410
You... You...

175
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,430
Sir. Chieftain.

176
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,500
Still haven't heard from Chieftain Yu?

177
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:39,100
Chieftain. He is awake.

178
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,700
You're awake.

179
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,910
Did two elderly men come to yours yesterday?

180
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,020
The dragon mark. The dragon mark.

181
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,750
Don't be scared. Don't be scared.

182
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,380
Calm down.

183
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,930
We're not going to hurt you. Don't be scared.

184
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:51,410
Xin.

185
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,110
Don't be scared.

186
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,660
Calm down.

187
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,970
The dragon mark.

188
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,440
Who did such a cruel thing?

189
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,670
Who

190
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,110
are you?

191
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,520
Do you remember what has just happened?

192
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,130
The village head wanted to kill you.

193
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,910
I remember I was battered unconscious by the villagers.

194
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,050
It was you

195
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,760
who saved me.

196
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,820
Yes.

197
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,760
What do you remember?

198
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:46,440
Did two elderly men

199
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,430
come to see you last night?

200
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:49,530
Yes.

201
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:51,750
Why did they come to yours?

202
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,270
They

203
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,030
asked me...

204
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,600
I can't go to bed because of this guy.

205
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:05,870
That smells so sweet.

206
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:11,670
Can melon seeds get you drunk?

207
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:18,660
Go.

208
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,610
He is awake.

209
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:31,710
Don't be a afraid.

210
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:33,340
Don't be scared, child.

211
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:34,550
Don't be scared.

212
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,800
Let me ask you about two things.

213
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,920
First,

214
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,380
you were a Xiucai.

215
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,800
How did you become like this?

216
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,500
What a dumb question!

217
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,370
Let's talk business.

218
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,090
Let me show you something.

219
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,470
This is a Dust-proof Bead.

220
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,590
This is a totem.

221
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:58,270
Think carefully. Have you seen them before?

222
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,380
The Cliff Man.

223
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:02,660
The cave. The cave.

224
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,020
Are you saying you have seen the thing

225
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,490
where the Cliff Man lives?

226
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,690
Yes.

227
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,510
The cave. The cave.

228
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,220
Let's go.

229
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,350
This is the totem.

230
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,950
Is this the dragon mark you're talking about?

231
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,780
Where have you seen it?

232
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,170
It's a long story.

233
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,890
Baile Village

234
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,630
was a very ordinary village.

235
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,190
I am a native and I lived here

236
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:47,120
until I became a Xiucai.

237
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,710
I left and worked as a teacher

238
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,700
in the county school.

239
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,650
Later I found that

240
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,620
Baile Village had changed.

241
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,930
People's face became expressionless.

242
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,720
Many of my childhood friends

243
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,130
went missing.

244
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,770
Who are you looking for?

245
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,260
Granny, I'm Sun Xiucai.

246
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,200
I came to see Da Niu.

247
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,370
Da Niu went there.

248
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,670
Where?

249
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,710
Our Da Niu went there and became the Cliff Man.

250
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,410
He lives a deity's life now.

251
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,870
The Cliff Man.

252
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,520
[Wan Shun Grocery]

253
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,380
Shui Sheng has become the Cliff Man.

254
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,000
Who is the Cliff man exactly?

255
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:27,710
The Cliff Man

256
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,310
is the God who protects our Baile Village.

257
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,440
All my friends have become the Cliff Man.

258
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,430
But no one can explain

259
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,040
who is the Cliff Man exactly.

260
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,520
Later I heard that

261
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,200
people went missing

262
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,030
when they went fishing

263
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,910
at Liu Creek outside the village.

264
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,540
So I went to Liu Creek by boat

265
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,240
to find the truth.

266
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,950
I row with the current

267
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,940
and went into a karst cave.

268
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,020
And then what happened?

269
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,700
I don't remember.

270
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:03,140
I only remember

271
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,670
something horrible happened in there.

272
00:14:07,330 --> 00:14:08,910
I was so scared after I came out.

273
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:11,650
I wanted to tell the truth to the villagers.

274
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,700
But they forced me

275
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:15,150
to shut my mouth.

276
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,360
And then...

277
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,390
And then those villagers

278
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,260
hammered two bronze nails into the back of your skull,

279
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,470
which caused your memory loss.

280
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,390
They worried that I would tell the secret of the Cliff Man,

281
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,450
and brought disasters to the village.

282
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,670
Please think again.

283
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,460
What was in the karst cave exactly?

284
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,820
And that is the connection between the dragon mark and the Dust-proof Bead?

285
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,290
Are you okay?

286
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,780
I was in a dark place.

287
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,290
The glowworms...

288
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,220
It was the glowworms that helped me get out.

289
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,130
How about the Dust-proof Bead?

290
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,020
Have you seen it?

291
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,350
I can't remember.

292
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,030
I am so horrified

293
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,760
I am so horrified

294
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,610
every time I saw those images.

295
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,000
That was hell.

296
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,470
Try to clam down.

297
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,370
It's okay.

298
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:05,600
No more thinking. No more thinking.

299
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Have some rest.

Boss. We've finally found you.

334
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,610
Are you alright?

335
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,720
I heard about what happened to Miss Bai.

336
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,560
I'm so sorry for your loss, boss.

337
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,620
Do you think she is dead?

338
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,390
She told me that

339
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,800
she would not leave

340
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:47,520
until I came.

341
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,080
Boss,

342
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,710
I know you're sad because Miss Bai has gone.

343
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,260
But I heard that Chieftain Yu and her people went to Lingdong.

344
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,990
We haven't heard from them for days.

345

Miss Bai is gone.

348
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,819
If Chieftain Yu's life is in danger now...

349
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,160
Where did she go?

350
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,329
She went to Lingdong.

351
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,390
Be careful.

352
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
My goodness.

353
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,270
This is the entrance the dummy told us about.

354
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,610
But it doesn't have a karst cave here.

355
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,620
He didn't lie to us, did he?

356
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,790
He didn't.

357
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,020
We are fooled

358
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,920
by the Cloaking,

359
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,330
a commonly used trick

360
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,100
to shift time and space.

361
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:02,040
The entrance of the cave he saw

362
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,030
was just a cover.

363
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,310
This entrance could change

364
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,300
into anything.

365
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,060
So people who got out

366
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,170
wouldn't be able to find the way back,

367
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,900
even if they had left marks.

368
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,070
They couldn't find the way back.

369

I got it.

370
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:16,470
It's like the Peach Garden

371
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,180
in the novel.

372
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:18,940

It's so dark here, master.

376
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:54,950
So dark.

377

do you think this is a place

384
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,230
which leads to Hades?

385
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,510
That's so terrifying.

386
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:16,610
Stop the nonsense.

387

are these people wearing?

I've never seen them before.

They're wearing the clothes of the Ancient Shu period.

Have you been here before?

I know

407
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,970
because this town is a duplicate

What was carved on the stone tablet?

413
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,060
It's the history of the fights

[Yong's Rain Gear]

Maybe the survived ones in Ancient Shu

built this?

424
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,920
If that is true,

425
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,550
it can not remain the same

to a grown man.

It's a big town.

why do you want to split up?

00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,510
Don't you think this town is strange?

451

on the stone tablet.

455
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,510
So you think...

456
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,730
The one who built this town

457
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,680
must have a close relationship with him.

458

He must have noticed that, too.

459
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:36,650
That's why he agreed to split up.

460
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,840

will him away from you?

518
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,470
There is one here.

519
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,730
Keep going forward.

520
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,630
Master.

521
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,650
Be careful.

522
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:30,820
Master.

523
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,030
Look.

524
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,360
Look, it stops here.

525
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:44,550
The underground palace?

526
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,470
Maybe my dad and uncle went in there?

527
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:50,870
What's this?

528
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:51,610
Watch out!

529
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,500
Who are you? How dare you try to intrude?

530
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,050
What's going on?

531
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,030
General, they are spirit creatures.

532
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,270
Spirit creatures?

533
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,070
Watch out!

534
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:58,200
Wei Du.

535
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,480
General.

536
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,420
General.

537
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,430
It really is you.

538
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,280
It really is you.

539
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:20,930
General.

540
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:23,930
You are finally back.

541
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:26,080
General.

542
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,710
Wei Du.

543
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,560
How come it is you.

544
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,010
General.

545
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,610
Wei Du.

546
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,510
Welcome General.

547
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:51,510
Welcome General. Welcome General.

548
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,590
This... This...

549
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:56,410
This...

550
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:57,570
Why is...

551
00:27:58,670 --> 00:27:59,660
Please get up.

552
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:04,900
General.

553
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:07,380
You are finally back.

554
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,460
Lu Yan,

555
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,860
what is going on?

556
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,200
Saintess of the spirit clan.

557
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,840
General, please.

558
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:29,910
I knew you didn't like

559
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,520
the decoration of the Shu Palace.

560
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,040
So this general's mansion

561
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,230
is a duplicate of your mansion

562
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,120
in your adulthood

563
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,000
after you left the palace.

564
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,430
Everything here

565
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,110
was arranged in the way you like.

566
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,680
This backyard is self-contained.

567
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,360
It has four rooms for each one of you.

568
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,550
The Shu Palace.

569
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:51,840
So you're not the general of Shu,

570
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,420
but a prince.

571
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,640
Our general is the prince whom the late emperor cared about the most.

572
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,550
The late emperor entrusted his country

573
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,700
to general.

574
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:02,090
But our general

575
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,950
offered to go to the battlefield

576
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,600
and lead the fight against the spirit clan.

577
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,010
It seemed like a lifetime ago.

578
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:11,400
Master,

579
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,840
you went down the mountain to marry your concubine.

580
00:29:12,930 --> 00:29:14,110
He turns out to be a general and a prince.

581
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,340
You won the lottery.

582
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:17,570
What concubine?

583
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,080
It's him. Lu Yan.

584
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:20,960
Lu Yan is the concubine whom my master married.

585
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:21,810
How dare you!

586
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,230
A man is honorable.

587
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:23,890
How can our general

588
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,770
be her concubine?

589
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,000
He is your vice-general indeed.

590
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,970
You two have the same temperament.

591
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:35,060
Wei Du,

592
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,310
they are only joking.

593
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:38,310
Don't take it seriously.

594
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,860
How can they make a joke about you?

595
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,670
Master, let's go over there.

596
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,230
What's this?

597
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:51,140
Jade screen.

598
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:51,800
Oh my gosh.

599
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:52,540
Daihai.

600
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:54,870
General,

601
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,340
is she really the saintess of the spirit clan?

602
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,210
Isn't the saintess

603
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,580
dead?

604
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:06,080
Yun Xi's body was expired then,

605
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,210
but her spirit was not.

606
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:10,610
I used more than 3000 years

607
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:11,960
to repair her spirit,

608
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:14,030
so she became Yu Dengdeng at the present time.

609
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,390
What's this?

610
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,570
You got the spirit clan's energy core

611
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:18,940
and came back to life.

612
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,810
And you disappeared after you killed Zhu Rong.

613
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,700
It was because you went to save the saintess.

614
00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:29,210
Back then, Zhu Rong was dead,

615
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,630
and the war between human being and the spirit clan was over.

616
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,100
Yun Xi died trying to save me,

617
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,990
so I had to save her.

618
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:43,370
So your relationship with her is...

619
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,320
We have got married.

620
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:49,960
What?

621
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:01,050
General,

622
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,360
I had people prepared a banquet for you.

623
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,710
Please come with me, everyone.

624
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,280
Please.

625
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,540
Master, what are you looking at.

626
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:20,750
Let's go.

627
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,130
It's dinner time. Go.

628
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,480
- Let's go. - Coming.

629
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,850
General. Guests.

630
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,000
Please.

631
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:38,320
Here.

632
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:44,700
Great wine.

633
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,310
General Wei,

634
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,190
please don't mind me

635
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,340
being very straightforward.

636
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:54,930
Go ahead.

637
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,120
Well,

638
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,040
I feel like

639
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,650
you are an ordinary man.

640
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,820
How come you can live such a long life?

641
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,770
Dahai.

642
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,950
Back then, after general had left,

643
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,920
the eldest prince inherited the throne.

644
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,570
But Shu fell apart several years later.

645
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,100
My men and I tried to leave the capital city,

646
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,970
but we were ambushed by the spirit clan.

647
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,520
The spirit clan was obsessed with creating the elixir.

648
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
They tested the drug on us.

649
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,490
Most of my men were killed by it.

650
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,010
We survivors took the chance

651
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,150
and ran out.

652
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,820
We lived with the refugees outside the city.

653
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:44,730
After that,

654
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,220
we didn't know where to go.

655
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,470
Nor did we have the funds to rebuild our country.

656
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:52,140
I remembered the royal family's treasury

657
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,200
was here, according to legend.

658
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,720
So I brought

659
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,280
some refugees with me here.

660
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,910
General,

661
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,830
it should be there.

662
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,490
Good.

663
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,510
Go.

664
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,790
It should be here.

665
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,900
I didn't expect to find the royal family's treasury

666
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:23,290
in the underground palace.

667
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:26,240
Among the refugees,

668
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,650
there was a spirit-hunter who can do powerful magic.

669
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,640
He set a magical gimmick at the entrance.

670
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,190
Cut.

671
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:34,360
So we are free from the troubles from the outside.

672
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,380
Years later,

673
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,670
we realized those who survived the drug test

674
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,050
had become immortal.

675
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:46,350
So we started to build a city.

676
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,460
And the civilians had lived their life

677
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,890
happily here.

678
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:56,700
General,

679
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,820
do you remember the dream city

680
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,770
we talked about during the war?

681
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,610
We've built it now.

682
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,150
Wei Du,

683
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,139
of course I remember.

684
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,100
You've done an honorable thing.

685
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,690
Where is the treasury exactly?

686
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:29,800
Only the Emperor of the Shu would know.

687
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,210
Does it have a lot of treasures in there?

688
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,370
Yes, of course.

689
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:37,639
Did you also plant the vines

690
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,639
at the gate of the underground palace?

691
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,590
They're called the Ghost Vines.

692
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,510
The spirit clan planted them.

693
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:50,360
Back then, the local spirit creatures

694
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,679
wanted to break into the underground palace.

695
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,719
But the palace has many traps,

696
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,889
which made it hard to invade.

697
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,650
So the spirit clan planted the

698
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,790
very aggressive Ghost Vines,

699
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,230
hoping to slowly break into the palace.

700
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:04,020
Maybe Zhu Rong's death

701
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,680
weakened the spirit clan's power.

702
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,030
They gave up afterwards.

703
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:11,860
Is there any way we can get into the palace

704
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,950
and keep away from the Ghost Wines?

705
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,390
It's even hard to get close the palace

706
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,070
because of the vines,

707
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,790
not to mention getting inside of it.

708
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,280
The guards there

709
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,560
are not only protecting the underground palace,

710
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,900
but also preventing the civilians

711
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,520
from the Ghost Vines.

712
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:30,430
General Wei,

713
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,290
since your man are guarding the palace day and night,

714
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,850
have they seen two elderly men going inside?

715
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,490
I haven't seen them.

716
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,240
The elderly men you mentioned...

717
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,550
Wei Du,

718
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,950
the two men are Dengdeng's family.

719
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,420
They arrived here ahead of us.

720
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,680
They should be in the underground palace now.

721
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,360
General, that's impossible.

722
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:01,030
Shu's treasury is below the underground palace.

723
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,180
It is heavily guarded.

724
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,470
No intruders are allowed.

725
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,650
Also, it's impossible to go in

726
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,160
without being attacked by the Ghost Vines.

727
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,720
Maybe the two elderly men

728
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,070
are still in the city.

729
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,950
How about I send someone to look for them?

730
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,250
General Wei, according to you,

731
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,570
you've set up a magical gimmick outside the city,

732
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,420
to protect the town from invasions.

733
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,980
But we met a man earlier

734
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,670
when we were passing through

735
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,740
a town.

736
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:34,480
He said many villagers had came in here by mistake.

737
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,510
It is not unusual if one or two people

738
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,980
came in here by mistake in the past thousands of years.

739
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:42,020
But they got out.

740
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,110
How about you guys?

741
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,520
Did any resident here

742
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,770
ever get out of town?

743
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,190
The residents here are living their life peacefully.

744
00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:52,960
They don't want to interact with the outside world.

745
00:36:53,290 --> 00:36:54,320
So they never went out.

746
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,970
But in that town，

747
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,120
we've seen many dragon totems

748
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,030
which are similar to Shu's.

749
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,390
Didn't some survived citizens of Shu

750
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,420
take those totems out?

751
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,460
Well...

752
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:11,230
Maybe the villagers who came here by mistake

753
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,130
saw our totems.

754
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:15,100
They started to use them after they got out,

755
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:17,110
to this day.

756
00:37:18,870 --> 00:37:20,410
What a coincidence.

757
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:25,950
Wei Du,

758
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,290
we came here

759
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,540
to look for the Dust-proof Bead.

760
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,580
Do you

761
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,630
know anything about it?

762
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:40,140
The Dust-proof Bead, known as the national treasure?

763
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,560
Yes.

764
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,950
It has been missing

765
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,660
since the fall of the capital city.

766
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,260
I will have to ask around

767
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,200
to get more details.

768
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,870
That would be great, General Wei.

769
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,070
Are you okay, Dengdeng?

770
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:04,610
I'm fine.

771
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,700
Maybe this wine is too strong.

772
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,130
Let me send you to your room.

773
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,090
General,

774
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:13,320
I've asked my people to wait outside.

775
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,750
And we have Ms. Yu's room ready.

776
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,430
Have some good rest, Ms. Yu.

777
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:20,930
Okay.

778
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,460
Guards!

779
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:24,410
Send Ms. Yu back to her room.

780
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:24,860
Yes.

781
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,480
That's okay.

782
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,030
We're going back with her.

783
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,440
Right? Let's go, master.

784
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:30,680
Let's go.

785
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,640
General,

786
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,570
Ms. Yu

787
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,020
is a spirit being after all.

788
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,340
The residents in our city

789
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,760
hate the spirit clan deeply.

790
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,670
Ms. Yu needs to be careful

791
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,300
in the city from now on.

792
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,790
No worries.

793
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,390
I will make sure she's safe.

794
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,550
General,

795
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:04,720
why do you

796
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,900
need the Dust-proof Bead?

797
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,120
Dengdeng's has some health issues,

798
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,760
and the Dust-proof Bead can cure her.

799
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,510
Ms. Yu has some health issues?

800
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,020
We have an excellent doctor in town.

801
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,490
How about I ask him to come here

802
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,620
and examine her?

803
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,790
There's no need for that.

804
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,310
Dengdeng will be fine

805
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,540
after we find the Dust-proof Bead.

806
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:28,310
That's good.

807
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,100
General, do you still remember

808
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,180
our days in the army?

809
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,640
We drank wine

810
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,240
and kill the enemies together.

811
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,290
How great it was!

812
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,870
Our Shu was powerful

813
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,210
and prosperous.

814
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,110
Our life was so comfortable.

815
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,200
But the spirit clan,

816
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,660
killed our citizens

817
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:57,970
and invaded our country.

818
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,480
My head hurts so much.

819
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:07,910
Why?

820
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,650
Why does my head hurt so much?

821
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:20,550
