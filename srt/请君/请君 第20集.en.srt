Father!

28
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,560
I told you

29
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,550
this was a misunderstanding.

30
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,870
-Why did you... -What misunderstanding?

31

He used to want to kill you.

32
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,090
Living with a man like this for all your life

33
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:49,090
is too dangerous.

34

Write the divorce letter now.

37

Write a divorce letter?

You've gone too far, huh?

39

You've gone too far, Yu.

40
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,230
I...

41
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,310

Dengdeng and I...

I'm talking to Dengdeng.

47
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,920
Why are you interrupting?

48
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,979
I won't divorce him.

49
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:11,380
Right.

50
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,270
I support you.

51
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,250
It's him who has

52
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,930
been protecting me all the way here.

53
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,480
Otherwise,

54
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,079
I would have died many times.

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,150
Can you still see

56
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,100
such a lively daughter?

57
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,170
What you said makes sense.

58
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,829
You're blinded by love again.

59
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,150
Am I blinded by love

60
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,940
or do you have prejudice against him?

61
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,430
I can see clearly

62
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,920
how he treats me, and I know it clearly.

63
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,930
I don't need you guys to tell me.

64
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:34,680
Dengdeng,

65
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,070
don't think that I don't know you well.

66
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:38,740
I've also told you

67
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,760
if a woman

68
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,280
wants to achieve something big,

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,340
she can't be greedy for man's beauty.

70
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,230
Even if you can't find a toad with three legs,

71
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,190
a man with two legs

72
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,140
can be found everywhere.

73
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,260
Go back to the Qingquan Stronghold.

74
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:49,920
I'll find the best one for you.

75
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:50,730
I don't care.

76
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,230
I don't like any of them.

77
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,590
Besides,

78
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,130
when I married him,

79
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,990
I asked for many dowries from them.

80
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,320
If I have to divorce him,

81
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:00,830
all those dowries should be returned to them.

82
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,350
Yes.

83
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,500
Your ladyship is right.

84
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,300
Chieftain Yu,

85
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,180
the dowries of our Xin's Sedan Chair Company

86
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,440
are worth over a hundred thousand silver dollars at least.

87
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,030
Who do you think you are?

88
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:10,920
Just return the dowries.

89
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,720
I'll see how you can return them.

90
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,060
I will return them.

91
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,220
You will return them?

92
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:18,710
Yes!

93
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:20,530
How are you going to return them?

94
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,380
Let me calculate it.

95
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,460
If you want a divorce...

96
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,500
Calculate it carefully.

97
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,450
It'll be considered as

98
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,310
our Qingquan Stronghold's debt.

99
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,310
According to the daily doubled interest,

100
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,780
if we add up all the compound interest...

101
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,960
Add up all the compound interest...

102
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,360
How much will it be?

103
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,980
More than 90,000 taels.

104
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,610
You can't pay it off all your life.

105
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:41,920
I'll pay it back for you.

106
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,500
What are you talking about?

107
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,300
Shut up.

108
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,650
None of your business.

109
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,460

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,909
Have you dealt with everything properly?

175
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,080
The medicine store was burned,

176
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,200
but Long Ears was caught.

177
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,720
Come on. You must be hungry.

178
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,990
You're full. It's my turn.

179
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:36,630
Go and solve the remaining problems.

180
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,390
Yes.

181
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,280
Wait.

182
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,600
They ruined the trade.

183
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,100
Go and give them some trouble.

184
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,150
Dahai is coming back.

185
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,850
We're going back to the Qingquan Stronghold.

186
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:07,370
Old friend, I didn't use you this time.

187
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,100
Right.

188
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:13,260
Your Lv Family's ancestral fortune-telling skill is just a trick.

189
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,250
Nonsense.

190
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,930
But this peach wood sword is real.

191
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,960
Once the sword is drawn out,

192
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,490
something bad will happen.

193
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,130
I'll go get some of it.

194
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,260
Where are you going?

195
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,480
There's food but no wine.

196
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,680
I'll go get some wine.

197
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,080
Dengdeng doesn't allow you to drink wine.

198
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:36,310
If neither you nor I tell her,

199
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,630
how would she know?

200
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,610
I'll be back soon.

201
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,310
Don't tell anyone about it.

202
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,910
Can't you make her less worried?

203
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:43,820
Got it.

204
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,020
Okay.

205
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,860
Thanks. Thanks. Thank you, everyone.

206
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,110
So many people.

207
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,610
So many delicious food.

208
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,140
Come here.

209
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,700
Hello, sir.

210
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,670
Have a seat over there.

211
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,350
Hello.

212
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,400
I haven't seen you for a long time.

213
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,260
I haven't seen you for a long time.

214
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,160
In order to hide their own identities,

215
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,690
these creatures of the Spirit Clan

216
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,210
have suffered a lot.

217
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,250
They either lost their lives,

218
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,700
or even lost their original bodies.

219
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,020
Now I think about it. They're really pathetic.

220
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,100
Just like the last concubine,

221
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,150
she loves Chief Bai so much.

222
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:43,500
She doesn't even dare to tell him about her real identity.

223
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,470
Can't they love each other just because

224
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,030
they were born different,

225
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,760
and come from different races?

226
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,750
Actually, the Spiritual Clan and humans are the same.

227
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,880
They are both raised by their parents.

228
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,890
They both know love, hatred, coldness and warmth.

229
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,760
He knows pain when he's hurt.

230
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,240
He'll be grateful if you treat him well.

231
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,720
Actually, they also want to

232
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,750
live an ordinary life,

233
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,090
and live a simple and happy life

234
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,560
with their beloved ones.

235
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,420
Lu Yan, let's help them.

236
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,220
How do you want to help them?

237
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:28,110
I want to

238
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,960
try the energy you've taught me to use.

239
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,520
Sir, your wine.

240
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,380
Thank you.

241
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,770
-Just get back to work. -You're welcome.

242
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,960
Old man, I've said everything I need to say.

243
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,760
Why did you still come here?

244
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:02,860
Help!

245
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,350
Run!

246
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,570
What species is this?

247
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,040
Miss.

248
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,260
Run!

249
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,070
-Are you okay? -I'm fine.

250
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,180
What is this?

251
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,330
Catch him!

252
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,440
Catch him!

253
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:32,900
Father!

254
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:34,870
-Dad! -Yu!

255
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,360
-Don't go over there. -Yu!

256
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,360
What's wrong with you?

257
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,340
-Yu! -Dad!

258
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,960
Xin, summon the sedan chair.

259
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,550
Yu.

260
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,010
Father.

261
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,260
They are all monsters.

262
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,200
Catch them all!

263
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,110
Catch them!

264
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,840
Father, what's wrong with you?

265
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:50,970
Go!

266
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:51,590
Go.

267
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,460
Go.

268
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,990
Hurry up!

269
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,580
Yu.

270
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,730
Lu Yan.

271
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,670
He will protect himself. Let's go.

272
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,860
Why are you still standing there?

273
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:11,770
Chase them!

274
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:12,520
Yes!

275
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,760
Sir, don't be afraid.

276
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,310
I'm here.

277
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,810
Be quick. Come on.

278
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,000
I've set a defensive barrier for this sedan chair.

279
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,330
These animals are safe.

280
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,920
What's wrong with my father?

281
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,870
Why did he suddenly hurt other people?

282
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,250
Now we must find a reliable place

283
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,300
and stay here

284
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,390
so that we can save and treat Chieftain Yu.

285
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:44,390
My uncle once said

286
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,810
every time he came to Yingdu,

287
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,550
he would go to a shabby temple outside the city and stay there.

288
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,750
Why don't we go there?

289
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:49,800
Okay.

290
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,680
No, Dahai.

291
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,490
Dahai hasn't been saved out yet.

292
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,440
I'll go save Dahai. You guys go first.

293
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,390
Okay. I'll entrust Dahai to you.

294
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,220
Remember.

295
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,840
After you find Dahai, disguise yourselves and leave the city.

296
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,900
Be careful.

297
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,630
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

298
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,320
Let's go.

299
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,710
Check the place in the front.

300
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,230
Yes!

301
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,350
This way.

302
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,360
Come on. Drink the wine.

303
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,630
Why is it so noisy outside tonight?

304
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,530
Right.

305
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,310
Why are there many people there? What's the matter?

306
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,640
Forget it. Let's drink.

307
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:47,450
Come on. Eat.

308
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,830
Young Master, what are you doing here?

309
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,300
Chief Bai ordered

310
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,220
you to release Peng Dahai.

311
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,680
What? You don't obey Chief Bai's order?

312
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:01,650
Hurry up.

313
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,020
Don't you obey your chief's order?

314
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,850
Hurry up, or he'll fire you.

315
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:04,390
Release him now.

316
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,110
Okay.

317
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:14,380
What's going on?

318
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,810
Can't you sense it?

319
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,920
Didn't the chief say he'd release me?

320
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,050
Rescue me from jail?

321
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,580
It's fake?

322
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:21,420
Let's go.

323
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,240
Hurry up!

324
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:25,890
This guy...

325
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,480
Let's go.

326
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,540
How dare you hit me!

327
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:37,550
[Order for Arrest]

328
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:38,350
Come and have a look.

329
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:47,500
[Order for Arrest]

330
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,430
If you find these people, go to the police station and report it.

331
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,830
Then you'll be rewarded.

332
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,410
Chieftain Gu,

333
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,410
as soon as I came out,

334
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:51,230
you performed the drama of Lin Chong Fled At Night.

335
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,030
It was so exciting.

336
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,850
The more exciting part is coming.

337
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:00,240
Well, who did you guys offend?

338
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:01,990
What do you mean by you guys?

339
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,160
It's us.

340
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:05,430
From today on,

341
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,430
let's play the game of

342
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,480
catching a turtle in the jar with him.

343
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,079
Catching a turtle in the jar.

344
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,369
Who is the turtle?

345
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,410
We are.

346
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,099
Go!

348
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,540
Stop!

349
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:40,960
Raise your head.

350
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,290
Go away at once!

351
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:48,580
I'm sorry.

352
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,580
She reeks of alcohol.

353
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,310
Stop!

354
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,640
What a bad luck.

355
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,980
Go away!

356
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,180
Wait.

357
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:04,070
Take off your turban.

358
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,100
I told you to take off your turban!

359
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,030
Take it off!

[Order for Arrest]

364
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,650
Interesting.

365
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,280
Take off your turban.

366
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,340
Take it off!

367
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:23,600
Hurry up!

368
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,110
Hurry up.

Mr. Scar Face.

370
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,760
Mr. Scar Face.

371
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,530
-Ms. Bai. -Ms. Bai.

372
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,000
You two know each other?

373
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,700
He once saved my life.

374
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,520
Mr. Scar Face, where are you going?

375
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,720
I'll take you there.

376
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,670
Ms. Bai,

377
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:49,420
if you do this, it's difficult for us to do our job.

378
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,160
Yes.

379
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,930
Can you still do your job if you offend me?

380
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,620
-Right. -Right.

381
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,920
Let's go.

382
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,940
Let's go, Mr. Scar Face.

383
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,110
Why are you here?

384
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:03,870
To help you.

385
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,890
-Help me? -Chieftain Gu! Chieftain Gu!

386
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:10,740
Who are you?

387
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,490
I'm...

388
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,920
Yu Dengdeng's apprentice, Peng Dahai.

389
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,720
Isn't Peng Dahai a man?

390
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,470
No, my lady.

391
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:17,540
I don't have time to explain.

392
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,200
In short, I was poisoned by a drug of the Spiritual Clan.

393
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,600
I'm sometimes a woman, and sometimes a man.

394
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,860
Where are you going?

395
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,900
I'll take you there.

396
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,900
We're going to the south of the city.

397
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,490
Can you drive?

398
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:39,570
I've never driven a car before, but I've seen others drive it.

399
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,980
My driver drives this car every day.

400
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,840
Even if I couldn't drive, I've learned it by seeing it.

401
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,590
Sit tight.

402
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,820
Oh my God.

403
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:56,230
A car isn't started like this.

404

All the animals are settled.

414
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:44,830
Let me see. Come on.

415
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,460
There are spiritual worms inside my father's body.

416
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,490
Father!

417
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,150
Father, are you okay?

418
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:05,910
Yu!

419
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,840
Father!

420
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:08,440
Father!

421
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,480
-Yu. -Father.

422
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:21,130
Yu.

423
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,990

00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,850
Dengdeng.

425
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,620
Did I scare you?

426
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,440
Chieftain Yu,

427
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,550
do you remember how the spiritual worms

428
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,150
entered your body?

429
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,220
I only remember that

430
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,560
I sneaked into the banquet hall.

431
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,940
There was a lot of delicious food.

432
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,430
While I was eating, I...

433
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,850
Why am I here?

434
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,130
What happened?

435
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,700
Uncle, take care of my father for me.

436
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:14,410
Just go.

437
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,530
Lu Yan, come out.

438
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,810
Yu.

439
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,360
I've told you many times.

440
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,110
Don't go. Don't go.

441
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,190
You insisted on going.

442
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,540
How come my father got infected with spiritual worms?

443
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,400
It was not easy for me to find him.

444
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,050
I thought after this case was closed,

445
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,170
I could take him back to the Qingquan Stronghold

446
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:44,610
to enjoy a good life.

447
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:49,560
It seems that the long-eared member of the Spirit Clan didn't lie to us.

448
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,810
The King of Worm can control the host.

449
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,000
He was probably trying to kill people

450
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,060
by using Chieftain Yu at the banquet.

451
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,440
He made a scene at the banquet

452
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,500
so as to distract others' attention.

453
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:04,790
What a brilliant move to kill a person with a borrowed knife and create a diversion.

454
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,680
I can't let him get close to my father anymore.

455
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,080
As long as he is still alive for one more day,

456
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,770
my father will be in danger for one more day.

457
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,050
The Spirit Clan in the city

458
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,120
will continue to suffer the pain of being bitten by spiritual worms.

459
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,860
We must find him as soon as possible.

460
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,590
There were many people at the banquet today and the situation was complicated.

461
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,540
It was not difficult to sneak in.

462
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,390
He was wearing a windbreaker

463
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:23,230
and walking with strange sounds.

464
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,570
Those who have seen him must remember him.

465
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,830
We can go to the Bai Mansion to inquire about it.

466
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,430
Maybe we can find some clues.

467
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,310
We can look for...

[Sanskrit Flows All over the World]

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,650
Speak of the devil. You came.

471
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:03,730
-Hurry up. Take this away. -Okay.

472
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,310
I have a phobia about blood.

473
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,240
Sir, I'm sorry.

474
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,590
I didn't expect

475
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:14,010
Paralyzed Yu would be out of his mind.

476
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,900
Sometimes, the Spirit Clan made trouble.

477
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:20,170
Sometimes, he was out of his mind.

478
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:21,990
He didn't look like

479
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,540
being out of his mind.

480
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,090
Right.

481
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,440
Could it be that he had also

482
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,510
got infected by a worm of the Spirit Clan?

483
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,370
Don't worry.

484
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,210
I will investigate it and find out the truth.

485
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:34,630
You've said the same thing before.

486
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,110
Where is the suspect of the Spirit Clan you've caught?

487
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,230
He's... He's dead.

488
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,690
He's dead?

489
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,110
What about the physical evidence?

490
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,420
It's gone, too.

491
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:52,740
No.

492
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,290
Sir, don't be angry.

493
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,580
Please don't be angry.

494
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,910
Be careful of your wound. Be careful of it.

495
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,670
Give me three days. Just three days.

496
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,410
I promise I'll catch the suspect.

497
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,010
For the people of Yingdu,

498
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:17,130
it's fine that my arm is injured.

499
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,760
But those who came here tonight

500
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,710
are people with fame and prestige.

501
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,050
If the higher-ups know about this,

502
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,370
will it be useful if you only catch Paralyzed Yu?

503
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,490
A man in a windbreaker.

504
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,950
He also walked with strange sounds.

505
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:44,270
One more photo.

506
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,310
It's that journalist.

507
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,270
Journalist?

508
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,470
Do you know him?

509
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:54,670
No.

510
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,300
But at the banquet,

511
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,620
I saw him sneaking around.

512
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,260
He disappeared while I was not noticing it.

513
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,880
His expression was also weird,

514
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,950
so I remember him.

515
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,920
But there are so many newspaper offices in the city.

516

If we search one by one,

In the past, if there was a banquet in our mansion,

520
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:13,540
it was common for the journalists

521
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,670
to come to report it.

522
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,860
So they needed certificates to go in and out.

523
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,860
They also needed to get registered.

I thought there was something suspicious about it.

528

What's wrong with you?

688
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:51,490
I'll go ask Mr. Lu to come.

689
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,290
It's too late.

690

Let me do it.

Help me pin him down.

How about just giving it up, Dengdeng?

699
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,960
I'll try again.

700
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:41,630
I can do it.

701
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:44,040
Dengdeng, listen to me.

702

Dengdeng, you've done your best.

707
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,020
Listen to me. Stop it.

708
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:06,060
Don't try to persuade me.

709
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:09,110
Your ladyship, you can't hold on like this.

710

Dengdeng!

711
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:21,380
Get out!

712
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:23,670
Get out!

713
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:26,790
Get out!

714
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,510
Get out!

Dengdeng, listen to me.

716
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,010
You've done your best, Dengdeng.

717
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:38,430
Uncle,

718
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,510
don't persuade me.

719
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:42,680
I was still young when my mother passed away.

720
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,160
I couldn't do anything.

721
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,510
I finally found my father.

722
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,740
I can't watch him die without doing anything.

723
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,360
But before your father wakes up,

724
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,520
you might pass out.

725
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,260
How am I going to explain it to Yu after he wakes up?

726
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,170
Dengdeng.
