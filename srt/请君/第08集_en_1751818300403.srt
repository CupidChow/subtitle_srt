1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let go even if you go far away

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You ask you, it's me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You ask you, it's me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You ask you, it's me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You ask you, it's me

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Episode 16

8
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Is it ready? Here, for you

9
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What is it?

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Red sugar lollipops

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't want to eat lollipops

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You don't want to eat it now?

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay, then I'll put it up

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Put it in my arms and wrap it

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's cold

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Eat it when you want to eat

17
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Sir, the moon night is in a hurry

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But the red sugar lollipops are out of stock

19
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
This is our only chance

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let's go to another place

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay, where to go?

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Go over there

23
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Go

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So many fireflies

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
How can there be fireflies in this season?

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is the surprise you gave me?

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I've never seen so many fireflies

29
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The elderly say that where there are fireflies

30
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
is where the gods come

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It seems that the old heaven must have seen me

32
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I must have seen me be a good person and do good things

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So I was specially rewarded

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Do you have any wishes that haven't come true?

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You have fulfilled my wish

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
My biggest wish now is that your wish can also come true

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I believe in you

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
There is a destined dream

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I must love you

40
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't regret

41
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The past is so bright

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Lu Yan, you also make a wish

43
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Where are the fireflies?

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Sorry

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I have to do this

46
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Lu Yan

47
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Lu Yan is not a mortal, he is a spirit

48
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Even if he is a spirit, I will still marry him

49
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The way you fought the wild people at that time

50
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's really beautiful

51
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I forgot to be afraid

52
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I just look at you

53
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
For you

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Take it

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't worry, I'm here

56
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I won't let anyone hurt you

57
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Lu Yan

58
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Why are you so good to me?

59
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Lu Yan

60
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Lu Yan

61
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Lu Yan

62
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You only know that my blood can fight against the spirit

63
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But you don't know that my father told me

64
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
that you are not a mortal

65
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You are a spirit

66
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I have to go

67
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I have to go

68
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I have to go

69
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I have to go

70
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I have to go

71
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I have to go

72
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I have to go

73
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I have to go

74
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I have to go

75
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I have to go

76
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I have to go

77
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I have to go

78
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I have to go

79
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I have to go

80
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I have to go

81
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Lu Yan

82
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I have to go

83
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
Gu Bei Xi is telling the truth.

84
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,320
I'm so nice to you.

85
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,280
Why did you kill me?

86
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,480
Even if you're from the Lin Clan,

87
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,880
I can accept it.

88
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,000
But you want my life.

89
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,600
Why did you do that?

90
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,920
I'll give you one last chance.

91
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,720
Give me a reason.

92
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,840
As long as you say it,

93
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,000
I can believe you.

94
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,400
Say it!

95
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,600
Say it! Why don't you say it?

96
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,880
Say it!

97
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,520
Since you won't say it,

98
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,960
you forced me to do it!

99
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,520
Leave the Qingquan Town.

100
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,840
We'll never meet again!

101
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You're the one who's always the secret.

102
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,000
You're the one who's always the secret.

103
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,440
You're the one who's always the secret.

104
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,840
You're the one who's always the secret.

105
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,440
You're the one who's always the secret.

106
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,840
You're the one who's always the secret.

107
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,840
You're the one who's always the secret.

108
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,840
You're the one who's always the secret.

109
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,840
You're the one who's always the secret.

110
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,320
punishment

111
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,520
Without my loving,

112
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Master's spiritual

113
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,520
Is he really Yun Xi?

114
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
Wait, boss

115
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,520
Boss

116
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,520
Boss, why are you back?

117
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,520
Where is Yu Deng Deng?

118
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,520
Is there anything?

119
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,520
He's fine, he's fine

120
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,520
He brought us back

121
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
What about the spirit monster?

122
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,520
Boss

123
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,520
The master said

124
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,520
We can't afford to annoy the monster

125
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,520
In the end, this is the Qingquan

126
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
It's Yu Deng Deng's own business

127
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
Let's leave it alone

128
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,520
Bullshit

129
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,520
His Yu Deng Deng's business

130
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
It's my business

131
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
Let's go, let's go

132
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,520
I go, I go

133
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:42,520
What's wrong?

134
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,520
Didn't eat again

135
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,520
Didn't eat

136
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,520
I don't eat

137
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,520
It's easy to say that he doesn't eat

138
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
What to do

139
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,520
Is there any meaning to you living?

140
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
Can't even send food in

141
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
I'll send it to him

142
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
Deng Deng

143
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
Deng Deng

144
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,520
Why are you here?

145
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Deng Deng's

146
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Upstairs

147
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
Deng Deng came back yesterday

148
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
No one is here

149
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
Don't even eat

150
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,520
You know Deng Deng wants face

151
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
Can he see you if you break in?

152
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,520
It's Lu Yan again

153
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,520
See how the master will clean it up

154
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,520
Old

155
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
All know

156
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Know

157
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
They all say that the family can't be out of the house

158
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
Isn't this bullying?

159
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,520
One is back, one is not back

160
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,520
This surname Lu

161
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,520
It must have greened our Deng Deng

162
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,520
Not

163
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
Sell ​​that leg

164
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,520
I clean it all

165
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
No no no

166
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,520
Second master

167
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
That monster is not armed

168
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,520
What's the use of you going?

169
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
I'm going to lie down

170
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,520
No no no

171
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
You stay too

172
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,520
You don't watch this fish creditor, I drive

173
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
What to do

174
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,520
Give it to my boss

175
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,520
You take care of the fish creditor

176
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,520
Go

177
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
Not

178
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,520
Boss

179
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Boss

180
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
Boss

181
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,520
I made a big contribution

182
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
What are you doing

183
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,520
I was in front of his house just now

184
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,520
I gave him a eye drops

185
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,520
Now he is not your opponent

186
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,520
Don't do those useless things

187
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,520
It's too late to fight between men

188
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,520
Deng Deng's family

189
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,520
Fish stall is father

190
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,520
Second master is mother

191
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,520
Maybe the second master can really say something about love

192
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,520
Yes yes yes

193
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
Now is your best chance

194
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,520
Let Yu Deng Deng quickly forget Lu Yan

195
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,520
Let him know that you are the best person in the world for him

196
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,520
Hold this opportunity

197
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,520
Can take down Yu Deng Deng in one sentence

198
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
I can't think so much now

199
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,520
Deng Deng is now unable to find food every day

200
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,520
I feel bad when I see it

201
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
The little master is heartache

202
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,520
What I think now is that he can be happy

203
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,520
Other things are easy to say

204
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,520
Boss, your words are really amazing

205
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
You said you usually have a lot of power to Yu Deng Deng

206
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
Can't talk

207
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,520
Is it necessary to be like this now?

208
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,520
Anyway, hold on

209
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,520
Hold on

210
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
Then hate the demon

211
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:00,520
I'm good at demon

212
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,520
I summarized

213
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
I I I summarized

214
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,520
Hurry up

215
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,520
Hurry up

216
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,520
Go in

217
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
Come here

218
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Hurry up

219
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,520
I don't know why you are looking for me

220
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,520
Our business this month's security fee

221
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
I paid a lot of them

222
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,520
I didn't come for money

223
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,520
I heard that your business

224
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,520
I rented a batch of sedan chairs at Xingji sedan chair

225
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
Is this the case?

226
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
Yes

227
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,520
For so many years

228
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,520
Someone from our business went out for business

229
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,520
Or have a wedding

230
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
I've been renting their sedan chairs

231
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
By the way

232
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,520
By the way, notify everyone around you

233
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,520
In the future, you can't have any contact with the people of Xingji sedan chair

234
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,520
Otherwise, don't be so confused in the future

235
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
Yes yes yes

236
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
Come back

237
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Go help me find a few

238
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,520
Sing a song

239
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
Sir

240
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,520
Sir

241
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,520
What do you think about yesterday's matter?

242
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,520
In this world

243
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,520
Only the blood of the saint can break my spirit formation

244
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
Maybe

245
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,520
Our previous directions are wrong

246
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:51,520
So Yu Deng Deng may really be my master

247
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,520
I don't think so

248
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
I don't think so

249
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
I don't think so

250
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
I don't think so

251
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,520
So Yu Deng Deng may really be my master

252
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,520
This matter needs to be verified again

253
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,520
A Xin

254
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,520
You go to investigate Yu Deng Deng's childhood

255
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
If she really is the saintess of the house

256
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
Maybe some broken mud will be left

257
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
A Chang

258
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
Sir

259
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,520
You go to find out the whereabouts of the fish stall

260
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,520
I'll go now

261
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
Sir, something happened

262
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
People who rented our sedan chair before came to withdraw

263
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
Said no rent

264
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,520
Even our old client Meng boss also sent people to withdraw

265
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,520
why

266
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Can't our sedan chair be quality?

267
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
Did Qingquan Village force them to withdraw?

268
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
Not Qingquan Village, it's Nanfeng Village

269
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
Nanfeng Village

270
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,520
You go tell the guests

271
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
Even if you rent our sedan chair

272
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
If Nanfeng Village comes out again

273
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,520
We are responsible for driving them out

274
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,520
A Xin

275
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
A Xin

276
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,520
These business is not done

277
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,520
Go ahead and respond to them

278
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,520
Okay

279
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:03,520
Sir

280
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
Yu Deng Deng is in our hospital

281
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
Why did he jump out of Nanfeng Village?

282
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
What is he Gu Bei Xi?

283
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
I was wrong before

284
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,520
Don't fight anymore

285
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
It's up to you now

286
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,520
Go talk to that woman next to Lu Yan

287
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,520
What is the origin?

288
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,520
Master

289
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,520
Master

290
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,520
Master, that dish

291
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,520
I'll put it at the door for you

292
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
Remember to eat

293
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,520
What's wrong with you?

294
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
Still no movement

295
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
No

296
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,520
Master, you can't think of it

297
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,520
Stop talking nonsense

298
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,520
My master only cares about killing enemies

299
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
How can you hurt yourself?

300
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
You don't understand

301
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,520
I've been back for two or three days

302
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,520
You said he didn't go out

303
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
No

304
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Didn't that person come back?

305
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
quarreled

306
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,520
I guess this time

307
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,520
Lu Yi Niang really pissed off the master

308
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,520
When Master and Master quarreled before

309
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
I didn't see it like this

310
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
This man came

311
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,520
I feel that he has a bad face

312
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
It's a disaster

313
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,520
God of Man

314
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,520
God of Man

315
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
God of Man

316
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
God of Man

317
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,520
Master, what's wrong with Lu Yi Niang?

318
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,520
Don't ask

319
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,520
Master

320
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,520
Just

321
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
Master

322
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,520
Master

323
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
There is a fire in the village

324
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,520
What are they doing at this time?

325
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
go

326
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
Big brother

327
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
Why don't you knock on the door again?

328
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,520
In case something happens to the master

329
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,520
Yes

330
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
Yes

331
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
Right

332
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
Ya

333
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,520
Go out

334
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Go out

335
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
Big boss

336
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
Big boss

337
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Big boss

338
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,520
Big boss

339
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,520
Big boss

340
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
Master

341
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Big boss

342
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,520
What are you doing here in the early morning?

343
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,520
Is there anything busy in the village?

344
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,520
Can you let people sleep well?

345
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,520
Master, you

346
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,520
Are you okay?

347
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,520
Nothing

348
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
What can happen

349
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,520
Pig liver, intestine, rabbit head

350
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,520
What are you doing?

351
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,520
The days are over

352
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,520
How many times have I told you

353
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,520
The days in our Qingquan Village are not over

354
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,520
Even if it's me

355
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
Can't be wasted

356
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520
Yes yes yes

357
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,520
Let's split it together

358
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,520
Next step

359
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,520
Split it

360
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
I'm out of my head

361
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
I've been resting for two days

362
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,520
Nothing happened in the village, right?

363
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,520
No

364
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,520
No one came to trouble

365
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
Absolutely no

366
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,520
Didn't make any money

367
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,520
How can we have that way?

368
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,520
Go and have a look

369
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Go go go

370
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,520
Go

371
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,520
Are you okay, master?

372
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
It's okay

373
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
What does this mean

374
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,520
No, everyone is afraid of you

375
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
See the sky of the palace

376
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
This is

377
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
Yes yes yes

378
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,520
What's the use of hanging two beauties?

379
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,520
Don't hang two beautiful men for me

380
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
Isn't the beauty a mistake?

381
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
What's the sound of the house?

382
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
Don't

383
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Go go go

384
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,520
Go go go

385
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Go go go

386
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,520
For you

387
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
For me

388
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
Take the thing that must be brother

389
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,520
You are a mystery that can't be solved in one life

390
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,520
It can't find the answer

391
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,520
In my heart

392
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,520
Don't move

393
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Don't move

394
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Something wrong with the clothes

395
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,520
It's been ten thousand years

396
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,520
Say i love you

397
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Don't move

398
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
Don't move

399
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
Don't move

400
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
Don't move

401
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,520
Don't move

402
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,520
Don't move

403
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,520
Don't move

404
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,520
Don't move

405
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
Don't move

406
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,520
Don't move

407
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
Don't move

408
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,520
Don't move

409
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
Don't move

410
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
Don't move

411
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,520
Don't move

412
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,520
Don't move

413
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
Don't move

414
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,520
Don't move

415
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,520
Don't move

416
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
Don't move

417
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
Don't move

418
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
Don't move

419
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,520
Don't move

420
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Don't move

421
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,520
Don't move

422
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
Don't move

423
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,520
Don't move

424
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
Don't move

425
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,520
Don't move

426
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,520
Sorry

427
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,520
I have to do this

428
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,520
Don't move

429
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,520
Don't move

430
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,520
Master

431
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,520
I'm home

432
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,520
So master

433
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,520
I'll let someone

434
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,520
I let this smelly man

435
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,520
Live in this place

436
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,520
From inside to outside

437
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,520
All over the place

438
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,520
I can't see anything

439
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,520
OK?

440
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
Yes yes yes

441
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
Yes yes yes

442
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
Why are you so nervous?

443
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
Over the new house

444
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,520
It's not the money of everyone's mouth

445
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,520
No

446
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,520
Isn't everyone afraid that you are angry because of the outsiders

447
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,520
You're angry and you don't know

448
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
For him

449
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,520
Yes yes yes

450
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,520
I can't see

451
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,520
I can't see

452
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,520
I can't see

453
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,520
I can't see

454
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,520
For him

455
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,520
Yes yes yes

456
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,520
In my heart, he is nothing

457
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,520
Not even the darkness of our mountain village

458
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,520
Angry for him

459
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,520
Not worth it

460
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
Yes yes yes

461
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,520
That's right

462
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,520
Isn't it said in the old saying?

463
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,520
How can he sail?

464
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,520
How can you run?

465
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,520
This is called air

466
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
What is it?

467
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
This is what the new resident left

468
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,520
All are some

469
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
A little bit of details

470
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
I'll let them burn it later

471
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
Don't burn

472
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,520
Sold

473
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,520
Sold

474
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,520
Save the money

475
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,520
I want to go down the mountain

476
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
This is also my son

477
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
I want to go up and down

478
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,520
Yes yes yes

479
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,520
This is just right

480
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
Yes yes yes

481
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
Also

482
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
For him not worth it

483
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
Take that broken sedan chair

484
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
Take it out

485
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
Yes yes yes

486
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,520
Take it out

487
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
As long as you are happy

488
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,520
Must take it out

489
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
Another house

490
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,520
Let you go there

491
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
I have something to ask you

492
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
It's time to go

493
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
This fire station

494
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,520
A small town behind the head of Mount Ishibashi

495
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,520
Fewer people

496
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,520
Last year the owner of the village

497
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,520
For the sake of occupying the farm

498
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
We've been hit by a rock.

499
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,520
Now the injured people are here to help us.

500
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
They want to build a mountain village to transport stones.

501
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,520
They want to pass by us and borrow the stones.

502
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,520
No.

503
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,520
The Fire and Fire Village is behind the mountain of South Wind Village.

504
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,520
If it can develop,

505
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,520
South Wind Village will be a great place to live.

506
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,520
It's easy to get by.

507
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,520
It can even run a little bit.

508
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,520
Why not borrow the stones?

509
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,520
That's right.

510
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,520
There's nothing else.

511
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
The name is just not good.

512
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
Fire and Fire Village.

513
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,520
There's no good person in the name.

514
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,520
Yes.

515
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
Master is right.

516
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
It's disgusting.

517
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,520
It's annoying.

518
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,520
Yes.

519
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,520
It's disgusting.

520
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
We're all famous actors.

521
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
It's settled then.

522
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,520
Also,

523
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,520
when I beat their village head last year,

524
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,520
he scolded me.

525
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,520
I hate it when people scold my mother.

526
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,520
It's not too late for a gentleman to take revenge.

527
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
Da Hai.

528
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,520
Tomorrow,

529
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,520
we'll have dozens of brothers

530
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,520
to take down this mountain village

531
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,520
that doesn't even have a name.

532
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,520
Chief.

533
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,520
You can't be ridiculous.

534
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,520
I think Chief is doing this to save the people.

535
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,520
Think about it.

536
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,520
Fire and Fire Village is under the South Wind Village.

537
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,520
They're like a walled up grass.

538
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,520
Maybe one day,

539
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
Gu Bei Xi will take them down.

540
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
It's not good for our village.

541
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
Da Qian.

542
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,520
Your old house was under the foot of Fire and Fire Village.

543
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,520
I can understand.

544
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,520
How about this?

545
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,520
I'll give you this chance.

546
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,520
A hero.

547
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,520
A small fire and fire village.

548
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
Why are you afraid of him?

549
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,520
Okay.

550
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
As you wish.

551
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,520
I'll do as you say.

552
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,520
I'll go get ready.

553
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,520
Okay.

554
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,520
I've taken a few days off.

555
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,520
I have a few things to do.

556
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,520
I need to speed up.

557
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,520
Today, I'll take care of it

558
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,520
for Chief.

559
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
The first one.

560
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,520
Our mountain village's hunting facility is old.

561
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,520
Er Hei advised me to change it.

562
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
I advised him to cut it.

563
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,520
We'll change it together.

564
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
I'll send someone to order a new batch.

565
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,520
I've made the look.

566
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
Just like this.

567
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,520
Look carefully.

568
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,520
This person looks familiar.

569
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,520
Is she like that Lu Yi Niang?

570
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
Lu Yi Niang?

571
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
Yes, yes, yes.

572
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
She's like her.

573
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
Change it or not?

574
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,520
Change it.

575
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,520
Change it.

576
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,520
Change it.

577
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
Change it.

578
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,520
The second one.

579
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,520
The kitchen prepared some dishes for that Lu.

580
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,520
It's a luxury.

581
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,520
But

582
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,520
it's a hard-work of the cook.

583
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,520
We can eat it

584
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,520
during the New Year.

585
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
We can cook it.

586
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
Yes.

587
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,520
We need a good name for the hunting facility.

588
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,520
I'll give it a name.

589
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,520
So that we can order food later.

590
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
What's written?

591
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,520
Read it.

592
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,520
Wolf's heart, dog's lung,

593
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,520
dog's heart, jump, jump, jump,

594
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
eat.

595
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,520
етьB

596
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
group horse

597
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,520
This

598
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,520
Yeah.

599
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
So,

600
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,020
gave

601
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,520
thezenia

602
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,720
the

603
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,520
the

604
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
eat?

605
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,020
Yes.

606
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,400
The

607
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,520
same get

608
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,520
is

609
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,800
Qingquan Village is the symbol of

610
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,680
the men and women of 18 mountains.

611
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,120
How can you just sit around?

612
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,440
What do you mean?

613
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,400
For the sake of our village,

614
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,480
we should be responsible for the destruction of the Qing Dynasty.

615
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,440
Great!

616
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,360
There should be no more

617
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,920
new schools in the village.

618
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,280
Great!

619
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,000
That's right!

620
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,760
That's right!

621
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
So our school's boss...

622
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,000
Sir!

623
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,600
Another group of troublemakers are here.

624
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,360
Did he come here himself?

625
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:27,880
No.

626
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:28,880
Take the money and send them away.

627
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,080
This is the third batch today.

628
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,640
Qingquan Village is in trouble again.

629
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,360
If this continues,

630
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,560
we will be in trouble.

631
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
As long as he is happy,

632
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,160
he can do whatever he wants.

633
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,360
Sir!

634
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,480
Sir!

635
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,680
We have news about Yu Tanzi.

636
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,640
Yingdu?

637
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,600
Sir!

638
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,200
Yu Tanzi hasn't been back to Qingquan Village

639
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,440
for several months.

640
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,280
He is still here.

641
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,400
Our subordinates outside

642
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,360
found that he was in Yingdu

643
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,120
when he was last here.

644
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,640
But we can't say

645
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:01,840
the exact location.

646
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,560
Yingdu is not peaceful recently.

647
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,320
Yes.

648
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,280
It's strange.

649
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,600
Such a big troublemaker

650
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,160
is so powerful.

651
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,200
So

652
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,640
I went to another person

653
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,600
according to your order.

654
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,560
Recently, the second boss

655
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,560
went to the back hill to sweep the tomb.

656
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,280
In addition to the tomb of his mother,

657
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,240
he went to a small tomb

658
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,280
to burn the paper.

659
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,760
Kid.

660
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,840
It's been 20 years.

661
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,280
If you were alive,

662
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,240
you would have grown up to be a big girl.

663
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,720
Luckily, your mother

664
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,840
took care of you.

665
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,160
You wouldn't be lonely.

666
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,960
I have put your memorial tablet

667
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,960
in the Yu family's ancestral hall.

668
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,520
When the old village head comes back

669
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,120
and tells the truth to the big boss,

670
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,360
he will remember your background

671
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,080
in the family history.

672
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:53,880
Sir.

673
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,640
Do you want me to go to Qingquan Village?

674
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,240
I'll go there myself.

675
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,680
Deng Deng.

676
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,520
I'm here to see you.

677
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,120
Madam Lu.

678
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,840
It's not appropriate to come here without invitation.

679
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,280
The Eagle Dragon Valley is destroyed.

680
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,200
The border is broken.

681
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,360
The Yu family's ancestral hall

682
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,160
is not a place

683
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,160
that you can break in.

684
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,800
Why is the person in the position

685
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,160
also called Yu Deng Deng?

686
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,880
Our Deng Deng is young and weak.

687
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,240
I've thought of a way

688
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,400
to make a big attack.

689
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,520
As a fake king,

690
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,360
it's not enough to protect the King of Yan.

691
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
A fake king

692
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,600
is not enough to be a chess piece.

693
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,360
You're lying, aren't you?

694
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,720
You're the one who's lying.

695
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,880
You're a big liar.

696
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,480
I know you have a lot of knowledge.

697
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,280
But you have to be kind.

698
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,400
I just want to ask you one thing.

699
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,840
Twenty years ago,

700
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,360
where is the Golden Wood Bird

701
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,520
that the old village head brought back?

702
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,720
It ate it.

703
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,000
It ate it?

704
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:21,840
Don't you believe it?

705
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,600
I can't help it if you don't believe it.

706
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,440
It ate it.

707
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,200
Second Master.

708
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,200
I'm here.

709
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,320
Da Qian, don't come in.

710
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,360
I'll come to see you again.

711
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,120
Da Qian.

712
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:56,640
Da Qian.

713
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,440
A feeling that comes to my mind

714
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,560
that nobody thought of it.

715
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,480
You're just a voter.

716
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,040
Sorry, Da Qian.

717
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,160
I wasдержived by my lack of differences

718
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,320
for the past 15 years.

719
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,080
But now I have to say it.

720
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,600
She's a good person.

721
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,360
But if you want the stars in the sky,

722
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,560
I'll take them off for you.

723
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,840
I'm so nice to you.

724
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,800
Why do you want to kill me?

725
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,960
Even if you're from the Lin Clan,

726
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,240
I can accept it.

727
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,400
But you want my life.

728
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,160
Why do you do this?

729
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,160
I'll give you one last chance.

730
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,800
Give me a reason.

731
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,840
As long as you say it,

732
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,800
I can believe you.

733
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,560
Since you don't say it,

734
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:17,760
you forced me.

735
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:29,280
Say I love you.

736
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,720
I'm sorry.

737
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,240
Leave the Qingquan Town.

738
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,760
We'll never see each other again.

739
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:54,320
I'm so sorry.

740
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,000
respects Yours.

741
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,600
Another Lingsuo.

742
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,280
The soul-sting?

743
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,800
The soul-sting is weak and weak.

744
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,720
It's not strong enough.

745
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,120
I've set up an enchantment in Qingquan Village.

746
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,600
They can't get in.

747
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,640
Now,

748
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,680
someone is watching Yu Deng Deng.

749
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,680
I'm getting more and more curious

750
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,760
if he's Yunxi.

751
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,280
Sir,

752
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520
I know a place.

753
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,800
Maybe I can find a way.

754
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,360
The Enchantment of Qingquan Village

755
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,040
Finally, someone is reading.

756
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,000
He's so shameless.

757
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,040
Shameless. Shameless.

758
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,360
Let me see which bastard is it.

759
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,920
I'm the one who's blind.

760
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,200
You look familiar, little brother.

761
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,760
You are...

762
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,000
the one who stood by the Saintess...

763
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,880
Stop being so friendly.

764
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,920
I'm here to find books for you.

765
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,120
For whom?

766
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,360
Don't worry about that.

767
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,200
General Yan.

768
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,400
I just smelled

769
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,400
the energy of your body.

770
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,440
It smells like him.

771
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,360
It seems to be true.

772
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,360
Since you're the Envoy of the Nobles,

773
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,880
I'm really lucky.

774
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,560
Don't make a fuss about it.

775
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:57,760
Zhu Rong led the nobles to carry out the tyranny.

776
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,200
General Yan killed him.

777
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,520
He's my idol.

778
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,360
Alright.

779
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,360
I'm here to find a book

780
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,840
written by the Taoist Master of Tang Dynasty.

781
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,480
There are many records

782
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,280
about nobles and spiritual masters.

783
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,360
Do you know...

784
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,560
I know.

785
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,240
The Book of the Thousand Years.

786
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,280
You know this book?

787
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,640
It's about the history of the thousand years.

788
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,080
It's about the three realms.

789
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,720
It's about solving the six mysteries.

790
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,080
The author of the book is the one

791
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,880
who wrote the thousand years

792
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,160
of the Longyang Zi.

793
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,600
You're really

794
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,280
a good follower of General Yan.

795
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,080
You have a good taste.

796
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,600
I admire you and General Yan.

797
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,480
I'm like a rain of rain.

798
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,400
I'm so happy.

799
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,360
My dear.

800
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,640
Where is the book?

801
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,400
I'm in a hurry.

802
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,960
Sit down.

803
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,040
I'll get it for you.

804
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,040
Here it is.

805
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,960
Here it is.

806
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,280
Look carefully.

807
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,840
How is General Yan doing lately?

808
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,160
Alright.

809
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:06,880
No need.

810
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,560
Thank you.

811
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,360
Where is the last half of this book?

812
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,360
I only found this half.

813
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,280
I also specially checked it.

814
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,200
The last half of it

815
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,200
recorded all the secrets

816
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,040
about the exploration of the spiritual masters.

817
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,720
I looked all over the world,

818
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,880
but I couldn't find the last half.

819
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,320
General Yan looked for it,

820
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,480
but I couldn't find it.

821
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,480
I didn't find it.

822
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,480
I didn't find it.

823
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,480
I didn't find it.

824
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,480
I didn't find it.

825
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,480
I didn't find it.

826
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,480
I didn't find it.

827
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,480
I didn't find it.

828
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,040
Why did you look for it?

829
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,400
You don't have to meddle in our business.

830
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
You don't have to say anything.

831
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,480
If there's a rumor about General Yan,

832
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,480
I'll come back to you.

833
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,280
I'll take the book.

834
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:55,840
I know.

835
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:56,840
I dare not.

836
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,240
Something big is going to happen.

837
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,560
Something big is going to happen.

838
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,040
Pack it up.

839
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
Sixth. Sixth.

840
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,080
The Saintess might be back.

841
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,240
We finally got to stay here.

842
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,400
Why are you hiding from us

843
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,840
when the Saintess is back?

844
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
Why are you hiding from us?

845
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,560
The snacks that General Yan

846
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,000
personally took out

847
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,840
must be the Saintess.

848
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,440
The Saintess gave the yuan to General Yan

849
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,240
and caused a lot of trouble.

850
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,320
Now that the Saintess is back,

851
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,560
I'm afraid the storm will rise again.

852
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,560
You and I should keep it safe.

853
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,560
I know the essence of being a debtor.

854
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:39,560
I didn't expect it to be so clear.

855
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,320
It's only a few days.

856
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,040
The money in the bank

857
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,720
has been taken away by the moneylender.

858
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,880
Fine.

859
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,040
I'll just take it as

860
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,720
this is a waste of money.

861
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,680
Sir.

862
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,960
Did you find out

863
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,520
how to keep the fish lantern?

864
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,280
We need to find the last part.

865
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Now there are spirits

866
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,080
secretly trying to

867
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,200
keep the fish lantern.

868
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,840
I'm worried.

869
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,320
Sir.

870
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,320
You kept the fish lantern

871
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,480
not only because

872
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,080
she might be the Saintess.

873
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,080
What else?

874
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,360
I'm just asking.

875
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,040
Since the safety of the fish lantern

876
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,040
is the first priority,

877
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,680
why don't you

878
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,040
return the previous hairpin to her?

879
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,040
I'm sorry.

880
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,040
I'm sorry.

881
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,040
I'm sorry.

882
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,040
I'm sorry.

883
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,040
I'm sorry.

884
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,040
I'm sorry.

885
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,040
I'm sorry.

886
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,040
I'm sorry.

887
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,040
I'm sorry.

888
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,040
I'm sorry.

889
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,040
I'm sorry.

890
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,040
I'm sorry.

891
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,040
I'm sorry.

892
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,040
I'm sorry.

893
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,040
I'm sorry.

894
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,040
I'm sorry.

895
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,040
I'm sorry.

896
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,040
I'm sorry.

897
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,040
I'm sorry.

898
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,040
I'm sorry.

899
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,040
I'm sorry.

900
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,040
I'm sorry.

901
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,040
I'm sorry.

902
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,040
I'm sorry.

903
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,040
I'm sorry.

904
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,040
I'm sorry.

905
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,040
I'm sorry.

906
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,040
I'm sorry.

907
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,040
I'm sorry.

908
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
I'm sorry.

909
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,040
I'm sorry.

910
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,040
I'm sorry.

911
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,040
I'm sorry.

912
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,040
I'm sorry.

913
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,040
I'm sorry.

914
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,040
I'm sorry.

915
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,040
I'm sorry.

916
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,040
I'm sorry.

917
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:49,040
I'm sorry.

918
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,040
I'm sorry.

919
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,040
I'm sorry.

920
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,040
I'm sorry.

921
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,040
I'm sorry.

922
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,040
I'm sorry.

923
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,040
I'm sorry.

924
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,040
I'm sorry.

925
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:57,040
I'm sorry.

926
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,040
I'm sorry.

927
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,040
I'm sorry.

928
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,040
I'm sorry.

929
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,040
I'm sorry.

930
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,040
I'm sorry.

931
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,040
I'm sorry.

932
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,040
I'm sorry.

933
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,040
I'm sorry.

934
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,040
I'm sorry.

935
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,040
I'm sorry.

936
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,040
I'm sorry.

937
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,040
I'm sorry.

938
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,040
I'm sorry.

939
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,040
I'm sorry.

940
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,040
I'm sorry.

941
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,040
I'm sorry.

942
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,040
I'm sorry.

943
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,040
I'm sorry.

944
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,040
I'm sorry.

945
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,040
I'm sorry.

946
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,040
I'm sorry.

947
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,040
I'm sorry.

948
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,040
I'm sorry.

949
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,040
I'm sorry.

950
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,040
I'm sorry.

951
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,040
I'm sorry.

952
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,040
I'm sorry.

953
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,040
I'm sorry.

954
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,040
I'm sorry.

955
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,040
I'm sorry.

956
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,040
I'm sorry.

957
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,040
I'm sorry.

958
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,040
I'm sorry.

959
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,040
I'm sorry.

960
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,040
