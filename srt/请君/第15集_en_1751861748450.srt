1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let go even if you walk away from me

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You ask me, it's not me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You ask me, it's not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You ask me, it's not me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You ask me

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You ask me, it's not me

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Ok

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Master, why don't we go to the master?

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
My dad wants this book so much

11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I just want to set up a stall and get him out

12
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is such a big city

13
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Master doesn't know we are here

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He may not know now

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But he can hear it

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Ok

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The room is ready

18
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It's not sold out

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I can't do without it

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You don't go to your baby

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No hurry, find your dad first

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We will talk about the baby later

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You are a rich man

24
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You are not a small man

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It's good to have a girl like you

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You are so picky

27
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Yu Deng Deng, you are angry with me, right?

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Just kidding

29
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Thank you, master

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You can help us

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Thank you

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I will buy you a good wine when I find my dad

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Remember what you said today

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The book is sold

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't miss it

36
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So smart

37
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Buy one and send two

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Come, have a look

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Have a look

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The book is so good

41
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I will buy one

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I will buy one

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Where can I buy these good books?

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Come, have a look

45
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Come, have a look

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The book is so good

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Master, don't say you are a master

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You don't have a book

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You are so busy

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Why people nowadays don't like to read books?

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The famous book of the West Family

52
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The Thousand-Year Book

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's sold out

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's so strange

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Master, A Xin

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I have dealt with the Rose Lü store

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Okay

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This book is useless

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Give it back to Lu Yuan

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Master, why is the owner selling books on the street?

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You three are here

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Do you have a permit?

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Take it out and have a look

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hurry up

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Police, police

66
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Yes, why not?

67
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Wait, we will find it for you

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Hurry up

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I will find it for you

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I will find it for you

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I will find it for you

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Chase

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Chase

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Catch them

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Master, should we go and help?

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't worry

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If there is any danger

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I can feel it

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Want to chase me

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But you don't know who is the old lady

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I will go and help

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay

84
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I will go and help

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Who are you?

86
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why are you following me?

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Are you a pervert?

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why are you sniffing?

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Get out

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hero

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We have never met

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We have no grudge, right?

93
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I have something to do

94
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I have to go

95
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Don't come over

96
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What are you doing?

97
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't force me to do it

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Hero

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You are really good at martial arts

100
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I admire you

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Misunderstanding

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Misunderstanding

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You said I am not your opponent

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Why are you staring at me?

105
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
No need

106
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,360
She

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Your那么 tricks are really supervisor

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The man who caused the human thought

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,540
To your power

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Unlike human

111
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I believe that

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,880
I want to have more power

113
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:30,820
I swearfood,You try to slay him

114
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,300
But it seems like it may used to be against me.

115
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,640
Get ready.

116
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,100
holes and co directional

117
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,660
Where is he?

118
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,260
He's gone again?

119
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,220
Did he run away?

120
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:06,940
Wait.

121
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,100
You're not hurt, are you?

122
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,660
I'm fine.

123
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,860
Who is that person?

124
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,340
Why did he find me?

125
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,340
I can't be sure who it is yet.

126
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,740
General Yan, are you too nervous?

127
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,980
I think that monster is just pretending to be alive.

128
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,500
He didn't hit you once.

129
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
I'm not sure.

130
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
I'm just worried.

131
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,620
I'm worried.

132
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,620
I'm worried.

133
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,620
I'm worried.

134
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,620
I'm worried about you.

135
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,540
I'll take you back to the inn first.

136
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,020
The masked man came prepared.

137
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,300
He's been watching you for a long time.

138
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,420
You have to be very careful these days.

139
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,940
How about I help you with the search?

140
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,740
No need.

141
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,580
I mean, I can find it myself.

142
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,860
That masked man

143
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,340
should have been badly injured today.

144
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,820
He shouldn't sneak attack me again.

145
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,780
Okay.

146
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,780
I'll be watching you from afar like before.

147
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,220
If you have anything,

148
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,380
just call me by a fan.

149
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,140
Then you should rest early.

150
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:28,820
Understand?

151
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,180
Lu Yan.

152
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,860
Our grievances come at the same time.

153
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,820
Thanks for tonight.

154
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,340
There are young people

155
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,420
who have lost their Wi-Fi,

156
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,420
and will keep on taking apart

157
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,100
those worn out tablets.

158
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,020
Then you will need to

159
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,760
$總是要轉ar

160
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,260
總要不要乱打

161
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,620
The paper may have wet deixa

162
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,940
but I want to find the right...

163
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,300
I have so many papers...

164
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,460
I don't even know if

165
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,980
I should come out or not.

166
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,540
No.

167
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,460
You don't have to do that.

168
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,500
Who are you trying to scare?

169
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,900
Why is the monster here again?

170
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,500
None of your business.

171
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,100
Yu Deng Deng,

172
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,340
you're not soft-hearted, are you?

173
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,220
You forgot that he was going to kill you before.

174
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,380
Deng Deng,

175
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,780
I did it for your own good.

176
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,060
We grew up together.

177
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,140
I won't harm you.

178
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,660
You said nothing as the owner of the village.

179
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,500
But as a woman,

180
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,940
you know too few men.

181
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,140
Now, men can do anything

182
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,380
to cheat women.

183
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,500
Pretending to be cool, playing cool,

184
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,300
being a hero, saving beauty.

185
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,460
If you don't have a heart,

186
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,580
you'll be cheated again.

187
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,060
It's not the time.

188
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,900
You're talking about this?

189
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:56,540
Da Hai,

190
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,860
do you have news about my father?

191
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,460
Yes, Master.

192
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,420
Let's get to the point.

193
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,500
I've been waiting for a long time.

194
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,900
I've been waiting for a long time.

195
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,700
But I didn't see

196
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,740
Master's shadow.

197
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,940
That's strange.

198
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,020
He's been looking for

199
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,380
the thousand-year-old theme.

200
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,620
Why hasn't he shown up yet?

201
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,820
Is he not in India?

202
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,700
I don't think so.

203
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:15,700
Master,

204
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,980
I'll go to the city later

205
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,140
and look for the gambling house

206
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,900
and the mahjong hall again.

207
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,300
Maybe Master has gone gambling.

208
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:23,700
Da Hai,

209
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,340
Da Hai,

210
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,500
go and look for it.

211
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,780
I'll keep an eye on your master.

212
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,660
Don't be fooled by the gambling again

213
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,420
and make mistakes.

214
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,220
Okay, okay, okay.

215
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,020
Master is gone.

216
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,060
Gu Shanzu, come with me.

217
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,700
Let's go.

218
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:38,900
Don't turn around.

219
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,380
I'll give you a round.

220
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,420
Your little finger is too small.

221
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,260
Let's go.

222
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,020
Stop looking.

223
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:42,780
Come back and look.

224
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,420
Let's go.

225
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,020
Okay.

226
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,100
Master, be careful.

227
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,140
Who is that person?

228
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,820
Could it be...

229
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,380
Master,

230
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,060
what happened just now?

231
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,900
Someone attacked Yu Deng Deng just now.

232
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,180
That person...

233
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,700
How is it?

234
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,300
Three thousand years ago,

235
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,580
when I killed Zhu Rong,

236
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,020
she used the illusion

237
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,340
created by the gold butterfly

238
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,420
to help her disappear in the air

239
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,500
and appear in the air.

240
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,180
And the person who attacked Yu Deng Deng just now

241
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,620
also used this trick.

242
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,700
I'm sorry.

243
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,420
I'm sorry.

244
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,180
I'm sorry.

245
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:50,900
I'm sorry.

246
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,660
I'm sorry.

247
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,340
I'm sorry.

248
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,140
I'm sorry.

249
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,100
Zhu Rong?

250
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,380
But she died in front of you.

251
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,300
How could she come back to life?

252
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Could it be

253
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,140
someone is imitating Zhu Rong?

254
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,300
Or maybe

255
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,140
it's related to Zhu Rong?

256
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,220
I've been to the whole of Yingdu City.

257
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,900
There's no sign of Zhu Rong.

258
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,540
But no matter who this person is,

259
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,300
since she has threatened

260
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,420
Yu Deng Deng's safety,

261
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,140
I must find out.

262
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,660
Xin,

263
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,700
send all the spirits

264
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,780
of the spirit tribe here.

265
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,180
Pick some good food

266
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,340
and protect Yu Deng Deng

267
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,420
with all your might.

268
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,060
Sir,

269
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,780
I was about to report this to you.

270
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,300
There used to be a lot of spirits

271
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,380
in Yingdu City.

272
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,100
But in the past two months,

273
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,620
a lot of strange things have happened.

274
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,980
There are not many spirits

275
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,700
that can be summoned now.

276
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,740
Lu Yan,

277
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,540
it's been 3,000 years.

278
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,300
You still keep your promise.

279
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,460
You haven't changed at all.

280
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,380
I was able to get rid of Yun Xi 3,000 years ago.

281
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,740
After 3,000 years,

282
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,380
I won't let you guys live well either.

283
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,940
Lu Yan,

284
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,140
I will definitely

285
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,140
get rid of you.

286
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,980
I promise you.

287
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,700
I will never let you guys

288
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,300
die.

289
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,300
I will definitely

290
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,900
get you out of here.

291
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:38,900
Gu Ran,

292
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,620
you came early in the morning

293
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,500
and left a lot of smoke.

294
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,420
If my master finds out,

295
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,660
he will beat us to death.

296
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,860
You are all grown up.

297
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,380
You still talk like a master.

298
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,780
Can you be like a man?

299
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,820
I...

300
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,140
Am I not a man?

301
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,980
If you are a man,

302
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,540
then stop your waist.

303
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,340
No.

304
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,860
It's already late.

305
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,140
You still want to come here?

306
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,900
Besides, it's already night here.

307
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,820
How can you

308
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,220
even open the door in the daytime?

309
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,820
Who said I came here to have fun?

310
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,580
I came to find my father for your master.

311
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,860
This place is unfamiliar.

312
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:11,580
You have to use some Taoism.

313
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,420
Taoism?

314
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,020
Three sects, nine worlds.

315
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,140
Have you seen those people?

316
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,660
They are not soldiers or bandits.

317
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,060
They are bandits and bandits.

318
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,100
They even have their own name.

319
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:26,580
It's called Pa Men.

320
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,660
Gui Gong?

321
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,740
That's a long story.

322
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,500
Gui Gong is a servant

323
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,940
who works in the restaurant.

324
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,900
He serves old customers.

325
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,900
He is a good man.

326
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,500
He is a good bodyguard.

327
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,700
He is paid to do this.

328
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,500
They have seen a lot of people.

329
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,060
They must know a lot of things.

330
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,940
He must be the most well-informed person

331
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,580
in Yingdu City.

332
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,740
Let's go and meet them.

333
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,620
Come in and sit for a while.

334
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,460
Wait a minute.

335
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:58,980
Mr. Cheng.

336
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,980
Drink.

337
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,420
You guys are eating and drinking.

338
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,660
You two are very famous.

339
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,460
How come you are here?

340
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:15,380
I'm Gu Bei Xi from Nanfeng Village, Qingshan Mountain.

341
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,860
I'm new here.

342
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,540
You may not know me.

343
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,220
But do you know Wang Wu from Xiong Ya Village?

344
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,780
Or Liu Ma Zi from Jiu Feng Mountain?

345
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,780
Liu Ma Zi?

346
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,540
What a coincidence!

347
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,140
That's my uncle.

348
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,420
Yes.

349
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,060
That's your uncle.

350
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,580
That's my brother.

351
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,300
We just finished drinking that day.

352
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:36,820
Look.

353
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,380
That's a coincidence.

354
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,740
We are a family.

355
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:40,020
Come on.

356
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,860
Let's drink together.

357
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,620
Look.

358
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,980
An uncle and a brother.

359
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,500
Guys, I have a question.

360
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,020
Has there been a 50-year-old man in Yingdu City

361
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,660
with long and dirty hair

362
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,220
who can't walk or walk at all?

363
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,380
He can't even walk on the sidewalk after he built a house.

364
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,580
Is there such a man?

365
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,420
You can see him every day.

366
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,900
But do you think he is...

367
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,020
Have you seen him?

368
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,180
No.

369
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:05,540
No.

370
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,620
Yingdu City is not so peaceful recently.

371
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:09,980
You saw him when you entered the city.

372
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,820
The police station at the gate of the city is tight.

373
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,780
There are few people who let him go.

374
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,620
He didn't go to the casino.

375
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,020
Something must have happened.

376
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,500
This young man is...

377
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,180
My...

378
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,100
My...

379
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,300
My wife's apprentice.

380
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,100
Okay.

381
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,220
He is also our own brother.

382
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,140
Come on. Let's drink.

383
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,060
Come on.

384
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,220
It's not good to drink in the daytime.

385
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,900
What do you mean?

386
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,180
I'll give you a face.

387
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,380
Wine? Water?

388
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,660
It's fun to drink in the daytime.

389
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,660
Come on.

390
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,660
Come on.

391
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,580
Come on.

392
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,980
Come on.

393
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:54,940
Come on.

394
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,900
Come on.

395
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,500
Eat.

396
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,220
Don't be so stingy.

397
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,220
Come on.

398
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,900
Damn it.

399
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,020
Da Han.

400
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,220
What are you doing?

401
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,020
What's going on?

402
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:05,780
Give me face.

403
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,620
No. I misunderstood you.

404
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,820
He has never seen the world before.

405
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,060
He can't enjoy good wine.

406
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,260
Come on. Let's drink together.

407
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:12,940
Pour it.

408
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:14,660
He is a country boy.

409
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,660
Come on.

410
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,500
Come on.

411
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,540
Drink.

412
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,620
Damn it.

413
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:35,240
The

414
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,060
Don't look at me.

415
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,860
Sorry. Sorry.

416
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,860
A girl is in my arms in the daytime.

417
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,540
Get away.

418
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,540
I have no time to talk to you.

419
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,020
You are a little chili.

420
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,700
Come on. Let's go.

421
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,580
Cheng Da Hai.

422
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,140
Where are you going?

423
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,860
Come on.

424
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,980
There was a man just now.

425
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,980
Where did he go?

426
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,380
You are fooling around.

427
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,180
I know you even if you are a ghost.

428
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,060
What's going on?

429
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,740
It's just a matter of time.

430
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,700
Who knows after the spirit monster died,

431
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,420
I haven't come back yet.

432
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:44,420
Anyway, my master said

433
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,500
he would help me

434
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,900
to find the corpse.

435
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,820
So,

436
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,380
you are the ghost?

437
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,380
No.

438
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,620
If it wasn't me,

439
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,180
I wouldn't have found you a good person.

440
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,420
I wouldn't have helped you to chase my master.

441
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,180
Right?

442
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,460
No. Gu Zai Chu.

443
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,860
What should we do?

444
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,500
Don't worry.

445
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,500
You won't die.

446
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,180
I'll go find it.

447
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,500
Don't worry too early.

448
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
He is a police captain.

449
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,700
And he saw what you look like.

450
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,860
You two dare to attack the police?

451
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,220
Oh, no.

452
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,700
He saw what you look like this time.

453
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,020
You...

454
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:43,940
You...

455
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,460
Stay away from me.

456
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,460
Master.

457
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,100
Stop hiding.

458
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,340
I saw it.

459
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,260
Why did you draw Lu Yang under your Knotted Rape?

460
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,580
Where is your sword

461
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,700
and a wreath under your nose?

462
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,380
This song slopes on my temple to protect me.

463
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:08,380
kingdoms.

464
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,820
Why do you draw Lu Yang's portrait?

465
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,820
Are you going to

466
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,500
turn a blind eye to the past and go back to the past?

467
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,340
What do you mean?

468
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,180
Don't talk nonsense.

469
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,740
Then why did you draw it?

470
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,620
I'm going to scold him.

471
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,460
Okay.

472
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,940
Despicable and shameless.

473
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,860
Lu Huohuo.

474
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:38,580
A sinister and cunning old monster.

475
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,020
How is it?

476
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,900
Did you scold him well?

477
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,220
Yes.

478
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,260
You old monster.

479
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,060
Let me show you.

480
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,580
No.

481
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,380
Don't bite.

482
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:49,940
Throw it away.

483
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,500
Well...

484
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,660
I didn't say anything.

485
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,580
Why are you so excited?

486
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,180
You must have a ghost in your heart, right?

487
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,900
Why are you talking so much today?

488
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,460
No, master.

489
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,340
Did you hear me?

490
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,380
I'm not a ghost.

491
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:00,140
I will never be with him.

492
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,260
You have a ghost, right?

493
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:01,860
Rest early.

494
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,420
I'm tired.

495
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,460
She wants to see you.

496
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,420
You hate him?

497
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:25,060
Can't you see it?

498
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,980
All had a ghost in her heart.

499
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,780
Can't you say that too?

500
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,700
First,

501
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,580
Lu Yan is not a human,

502
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,140
but a human

503
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,940
and a spirit.

504
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,020
General Yan

505
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,980
can kill the spirit

506
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,820
and make people's hearts beat faster.

507
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,580
It seems that the information

508
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,700
about making people's hearts beat faster is not confirmed.

509
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,300
Second,

510
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,420
Lu Yan

511
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,980
is despicable and shameless.

512
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,220
He is a real villain.

513
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,300
His feelings for people are deceiving.

514
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,580
It seems that I forced him to return to the mountain village.

515
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,660
Third,

516
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,740
Lu Yan

517
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,660
is a cunning and cunning man.

518
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,060
He has threatened me many times.

519
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,740
I don't need it.

520
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,180
Sir, you haven't slept yet?

521
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,380
What are you hiding?

522
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,660
Nothing.

523
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,260
Let me pour you a cup of wine.

524
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,260
Come on, show me.

525
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,700
Sir.

526
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,460
Sir.

527
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,020
I advise you not to look.

528
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,260
Despicable, shameless, and shameless.

529
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,620
A cunning, cunning and cunning monster.

530
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,540
Sir, I picked it up on the roadside.

531
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,780
I don't know who wrote it.

532
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,060
I don't know who wrote it.

533
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,380
Who else can write such a painting

534
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,260
and such a note?

535
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:38,140
Sir, don't be angry with the master.

536
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,300
He has misunderstandings about you.

537
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,980
You two can just solve the misunderstanding.

538
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,860
How about this? I'll tear it for you.

539
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,380
You go out first.

540
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,820
I'll throw it away myself later.

541
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,780
Son of a bitch!

542
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,460
Let's meet in the delivery room of Palace Service.

543
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,380
The letter will go to Heaven in 30 days.

544
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,260
Yes.

545
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,460
You can leave.

546
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:18,860
Han lead disciples invite you here.

547
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,940
Do you remember about his address?

548
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,100
How?

549
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,420
Where can I run to?

550
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,020
Father.

551
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:30,620
No.

552
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,100
Father.

553
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,660
No.

554
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,180
Father.

555
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,380
Father.

556
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:57,900
Father.

557
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,940
Is it difficult for me these days?

558
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,340
Luyan, you are despicable and shameless.

559
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,580
You deceive others.

560
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,340
Luyan is not human.

561
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,100
Love Me If You Dare

562
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:32,240
Episode 25

563
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,100
Master, get up.

564
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,760
Master.

565
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,500
Master.

566
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,020
Why are you still sleeping?

567
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,020
The sun is setting. It's time to leave the bed.

568
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,220
Master.

569
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,420
Master.

570
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,740
Get up. The sun is setting.

571
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,820
How old are you? Why are you still sleeping?

572
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,820
Come.

573
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,340
Oh my god!

574
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,540
No, you...

575
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,940
Why are you sleeping?

576
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,220
You're like a big cat.

577
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,540
How did you do that?

578
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,660
What do you mean how?

579
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,900
Take a look.

580
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,860
Look.

581
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,900
Who did that?

582
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,660
I... I just passed by.

583
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,300
That's weird.

584
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,420
Here.

585
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,220
Give me one.

586
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,220
Take this.

587
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,340
We saw it written in the notice.

588
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,900
Those who didn't get in the city

589
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,700
will be sent back to the city within three days.

590
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,500
Yes.

591
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:03,100
The master is missing for a while.

592
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,620
We should find a way to get into the police station

593
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,020
and check the registration form.

594
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,580
By the way, where are the people from the north and the west?

595
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,180
I don't know.

596
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,540
They said there's a familiar here.

597
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,020
They left a message and ran away.

598
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,020
Ran away?

599
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,340
Move.

600
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,340
Move.

601
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,220
Move.

602
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,220
Move.

603
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,500
Move.

604
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,300
Move.

605
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,420
Who is he?

606
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,420
So arrogant.

607
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,620
What are you doing?

608
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,620
Bai's Mansion?

609
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,420
Is there a famous

610
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,420
powerful Bai's Mansion in India?

611
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,780
Bai's Mansion?

612
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,820
There's no other Bai's Mansion in India.

613
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:43,420
It's the Bai's Mansion of the police station director Bai.

614
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,380
Go.

615
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,420
Let me go.

616
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,420
Go.

617
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,820
We don't know Gu Beixi.

618
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,620
No.

619
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,420
Go.

620
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,220
Gu Beixi from Nanteng Village.

621
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:55,820
I've never heard of him.

622
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:57,420
He's your supervisor.

623
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,220
Let me in.

624
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,020
Are you going or not?

625
00:28:59,020 --> 00:28:59,420
Go.

626
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,220
Get out.

627
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:11,820
Open the door.

628
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,620
We're here to deliver the missing person's file.

629
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,820
You can't win.

630
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,820
Don't blame me for being a coward.

631
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,020
Gu Yuanru,

632
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,220
you're so attractive.

633
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,020
Your husband is not familiar with you.

634
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,220
Let's get down to business.

635
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,620
How can we get into Bai's Mansion?

636
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,420
I think

637
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,420
we should pretend to be the servants of Bai's Mansion

638
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,620
and get in.

639
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,820
Impossible.

640
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,820
Bai's Mansion even needs a sweeper's mother-in-law

641
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,020
to ask for the cleanliness of the Shen Family.

642
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,020
How can we outsiders

643
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,220
get in?

644
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,020
I mean, you...

645
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:53,020
What's the use of

646
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,020
your husband in Bai's Mansion?

647
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:54,620
You're so...

648
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,020
What's the use?

649
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,820
If we can't get in,

650
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,420
how can I let him

651
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,020
invite us in?

652
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,020
What does that mean?

653
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,220
It seems

654
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,220
it's time to find out some new tricks.

655
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,420
You mean...

656
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,420
No, no, no.

657
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,420
Sir,

658
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,420
they want to pretend to be the bandits

659
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:38,420
and kidnap the car team

660
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,420
on the way to the mansion.

661
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,420
Then they'll use that Miss Yu

662
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,420
to help the bandits

663
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,820
and play a hero to save the beauty.

664
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,820
Let that Director Bai owe them a favor

665
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,420
and invite them as guests to the mansion.

666
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,420
I got it.

667
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,420
Keep up with him.

668
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,420
Yes.

669
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,420
Sir,

670
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,420
I'll go protect the master too.

671
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,420
I'm worried about them.

672
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,420
Once Yu Deng Deng is in danger,

673
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,420
I'll be able to

674
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,420
get to him in time.

675
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,420
Now,

676
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,420
I need you to help me confirm something.

677
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,420
What is it?

678
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,420
Isn't this the butterfly

679
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,420
that attacked the master

680
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:15,420
in the Qingquan Town?

681
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,420
Feel the smell

682
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,420
of the butterfly.

683
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,420
Sir,

684
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,420
this is the butterfly

685
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,420
that Zhu Rong had.

686
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,420
Are you sure?

687
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,420
Yes.

688
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:33,420
I saw that butterfly

689
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,420
several times

690
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,420
3,000 years ago.

691
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:36,420
That's the smell

692
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,420
on it.

693
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,420
I thought it and Zhu Rong

694
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,420
were dead together.

695
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,420
I didn't expect

696
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:42,420
it to be alive now.

697
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,420
The two girls

698
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,420
from the Bai family

699
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,420
are the new concubines

700
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,420
that Director Bai has married.

701
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:47,420
The other one is the Miss of the Bai family,

702
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,420
Bai Shi Qi.

703
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,420
Bai Shi Qi?

704
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,420
Director Bai can't be born.

705
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,420
When the carriage arrives,

706
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,420
you two will go out

707
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,420
to rob.

708
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,420
Don't hurt anyone.

709
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,420
Leave the rest to me.

710
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,420
I'll go out

711
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,420
with your precious disciple

712
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,420
to work as a bandit.

713
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,420
Don't be too happy.

714
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,420
How can that be?

715
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,420
It's a fake play.

716
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,420
It's not a play.

717
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,420
It's a play.

718
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,420
It's a play.

719
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,420
It's a play.

720
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,420
It's a fake play.

721
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,420
You two have to shoot one by one

722
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,420
to make people happy.

723
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,420
This...

724
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,420
Don't worry.

725
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,420
The bullets just

726
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,420
came from your side.

727
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,420
They won't hurt anyone.

728
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,420
Fine.

729
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,420
Just shoot a few times.

730
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,420
We'll make it work.

731
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,420
I found you

732
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,420
a master who wants to die.

733
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,420
This time,

734
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,420
I can finally

735
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,420
trust you

736
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,420
with my master.

737
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,420
They're coming.

738
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,420
They're coming.

739
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,420
Don't move.

740
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,420
Don't move.

741
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,420
Don't move.

742
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,420
Step back.

743
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,420
Step back.

744
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,420
Get over there.

745
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,420
I'm telling you.

746
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,420
Shuangming Mountain

747
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,420
will be our territory from now on.

748
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,420
If you want to pass through here,

749
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,420
you have to leave your money.

750
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,420
Go and give them

751
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,420
all the money and money you have.

752
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,420
Yes, Miss.

753
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:18,420
Get down.

754
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,420
This warrior,

755
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,420
we've left all the money

756
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,420
we have.

757
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,420
Please do us a favor

758
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,420
and let us leave.

759
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,420
That's great.

760
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,420
But you've already

761
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,420
heard my voice.

762
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,420
To prevent you from reporting to the officials,

763
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,420
we still have to kill you all.

764
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,420
Yes.

765
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,420
Warrior,

766
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,420
there's a way to do it.

767
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,420
We've left all the money

768
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,420
and money.

769
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,420
Why do you have to do this?

770
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,420
Shi Qi,

771
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,420
don't hurt them.

772
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,420
Madam, don't be afraid.

773
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,420
My father is the director of the police station.

774
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,420
I'm not afraid of such a battle.

775
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,420
If you guys are being unreasonable,

776
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,420
just take the money and leave.

777
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,420
If you guys are not being unreasonable,

778
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,420
I'll kill you.

779
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,420
Little girl,

780
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,420
you're quite bold.

781
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,420
Today, I want to see

782
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,420
what you're capable of

783
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,420
and aren't afraid of me.

784
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,420
If you want to kill me,

785
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,420
I have a wish.

786
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,420
If you want to humiliate me,

787
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,420
I only have one death.

788
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,420
Okay.

789
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,420
Brother.

790
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,420
Don't move.

791
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,420
You see, did you humiliate her today

792
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,420
No.

793
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,420
We're here to take revenge today.

794
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,420
My master is waiting to come out.

795
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,420
Why are you talking to the little girl?

796
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,420
Then just kill her.

797
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,420
Wait a minute.

798
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,420
Even if you die,

799
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,420
let me die.

800
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,420
My father has attacked the Xunya Fortress many times.

801
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,420
You're here to take revenge.

802
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:56,420
No.

803
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,420
A scattered soldier

804
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,420
is only for the sake of the money.

805
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,420
Let's do it.

806
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,420
Who are you?

807
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,420
You're a hero.

808
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,420
You're blocking my way.

809
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,420
You dare to block the way and rob me in broad daylight.

810
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,420
It's a pity that you met me.

811
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,420
Today,

812
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,420
you'll be in your own luck.

813
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,420
Miss.

814
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:25,420
Boss.

815
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,420
This woman doesn't look easy.

816
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,420
Let me meet her.

817
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:29,420
Good man.

818
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,420
If you're capable,

819
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,420
just throw the gun away.

820
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,420
We're not that good.

821
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,420
We're not that good.

822
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,420
Let me meet her today.

823
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,420
I'll feed you.

824
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,420
Master, you're so strong.

825
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:02,420
You're acting too much.

826
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,420
You're so scary.

827
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,420
I'm so scared.

828
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:12,420
Please spare me.

829
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,420
I'm not a great man.

830
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,420
Do you dare to block the way and rob me?

831
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,420
No.

832
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,420
Do you know you're wrong?

833
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,420
I know.

834
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,420
Do you still think you're a bandit?

835
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,420
No.

836
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,420
What's going on?

837
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,420
Miss Yu and her friend are having an affair?

838
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,420
Thank you for saving us.

839
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,420
Thank you.

840
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,420
Thank you.

841
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,420
You're welcome.

842
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,420
May I know your name?

843
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,420
I'm Yu Deng Deng.

844
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,420
I'm a witness of the Qing Quan City.

845
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,420
I came to Yingdu City to find my relatives.

846
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,420
How can I help you when the road is uneven?

847
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,420
Please get in the car.

848
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,420
I'll escort you back to the city.

849
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:58,420
What about these two bandits?

850
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,420
They must be in danger.

851
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,420
I've tied them up.

852
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,420
I'll beat them up later

853
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,420
and help you get rid of them.

854
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,420
Miss, my father is the director of the police station.

855
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,420
Why don't you send them to the police station?

856
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,420
In case they do evil again and hurt others and yourself.

857
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,420
Good.

858
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,420
You're right.

859
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,420
Well said.

860
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,420
Miss Bai, please get in the car.

861
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,420
Okay.

862
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,420
Miss!

863
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,420
Miss!

864
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,420
Master, you're going to sell us?

865
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,420
It's a random change.

866
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,420
I didn't see the little white flower in the white house.

867
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,420
It's even with thorns.

868
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,420
Your master is angry.

869
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,420
Don't worry about us.

870
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,420
Let's go.

871
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,420
Miss!

872
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,420
It's a gunshot!

873
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:08,420
Miss!

874
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:29,860
If I can still be touched

875
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:34,820
I will use my voice if I miss you

876
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:43,300
The most beautiful scenery in life

877
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:49,300
It's all about you

878
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:53,300
When two hearts are so close

879
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,820
When the whole world is occupied by you

880
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,540
I will call you hard to find you

881
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:06,540
Until your memory

882
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:12,540
You are the only one

883
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:19,540
Walk into the scenery

884
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,060
This city is full of rain and rain

885
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,060
The distance is separated by love

886
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:31,060
I hide my heart

887
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:35,060
Make a decision for you

888
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:58,060
When two hearts are so close

889
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:02,060
When the whole world is occupied by you

890
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:07,060
I will call you hard to find you

891
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:12,060
Until your memory

892
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:18,060
You are the only one

893
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:25,060
Walk into the scenery

894
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:28,060
This city is full of rain and rain

895
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:32,060
The distance is separated by love

896
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:37,060
I hide my heart

897
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:41,060
Make a decision for you
