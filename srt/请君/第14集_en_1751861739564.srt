1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let go even if you leave me

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You ask you, it's not me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You ask you, it's not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You ask you, it's not me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You ask you, it's not me

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Translated by Hua Chenyu

8
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If between we have only lives left

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I hope it's you.

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You will take Yuan Dan

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
to see the nine states with me.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The day when I saw the peace and harmony between people.

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yuan Dan

15
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I love you.

16
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I love you.

18
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

19
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yuan Dan

20
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Master.

21
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Master.

22
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What's wrong with you?

23
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Why did you throw your Yuan Dan away?

24
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You will die.

25
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's useless.

26
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I called you here

27
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
to take Lu Yan away.

28
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
From now on,

29
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Lu Yan is your master.

30
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No, master.

31
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'll take you with me.

32
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I will save you.

33
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Master is coming.

34
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Go.

35
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Otherwise,

36
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
you will lose everything.

37
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
No, master.

38
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This

39
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
is for Lu Yan.

40
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll take the general away first.

41
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You have to wait for me to come back to save you.

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You have to wait for me to come back.

43
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
There is another kind of love called a man-woman love.

44
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
If you love the other person deeply enough,

45
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
you may also give your life for the other person.

46
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So,

47
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
this is the man-woman love of human.

48
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Those who are alive

49
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
can really die for the sake of their own.

50
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Lu Yan

51
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Lu Yan

52
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Lu Yan

53
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Lu Yan

54
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Lu Yan

55
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Lu Yan

56
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Lu Yan

57
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Lu Yan

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Lu Yan

59
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Lu Yan

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Lu Yan

61
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Lu Yan

62
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Lu Yan

63
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Lu Yan

64
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Lu Yan

65
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Lu Yan

66
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Lu Yan

67
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Lu Yan

68
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Lu Yan

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,280
When I woke up,

70
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,640
Yunxi was gone.

71
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,160
A'xing told me

72
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,480
she had found her own yuan pellet

73
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,680
and saved me.

74
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,840
General,

75
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,920
after Master gave you the yuan pellet,

76
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,160
I took you away

77
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,560
as my master.

78
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,360
When I came back,

79
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,000
I found Master's spirit stones had gone.

80
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,720
Only this piece of spirit jade is left.

81
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,840
Yunxi is the sacred daughter of the spirit clan.

82
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,240
She's a golden witch.

83
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,160
She's not like the others.

84
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,120
Can't we get her spirit stones back?

85
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,720
A way?

86
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,160
There's a legend in our spirit clan.

87
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,880
It says that as long as the person who has the yuan pellet

88
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,520
is sealed into a mountain of eternal life,

89
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,280
he can feed on the spirit stone

90
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,560
with the power of yuan pellet.

91
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,040
The spirit stone will be re-created after 3,000 years.

92
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,360
Maybe this way

93
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,600
can make Master come back to life.

94
00:07:59,200 --> 00:07:59,960
Really?

95
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,320
It's just a legend.

96
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,960
It's never been made.

97
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,320
I'll try everything

98
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,240
as long as there's a chance.

99
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,200
It's said that this method

100
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,400
can cause great damage to the person

101
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,440
who has the yuan pellet.

102
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,400
Even if you stay in the mountain for 3,000 years,

103
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,680
when you're released from the mountain,

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,360
your mood and yuan energy

105
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,640
will be affected.

106
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,960
You may become indifferent

107
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,760
and your yuan energy will be unstable.

108
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
As long as Yunxi can come back to life,

109
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,600
it's nothing.

110
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,280
The Saintess is really loyal.

111
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,080
She's a hero.

112
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,240
You want to find her and save her.

113
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,880
It's all in your hands.

114
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,880
If I were a man

115
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,400
and met a woman like her,

116
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,320
I would have to risk my life to save her.

117
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,040
So

118
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,440
the thing I ate before

119
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,000
is the Saintess' snacks

120
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,680
you've collected after 3,000 years?

121
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,280
That's hard to do.

122
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
She's a good person.

123
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,920
I'm not a bad person, right?

124
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,040
You can marry her.

125
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,240
You can marry her.

126
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,800
But can you let me live?

127
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,920
Just a little one.

128
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,400
My father has raised me for so many years.

129
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,440
You have to let him go back to life.

130
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,000
I went to the ghost town

131
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,440
to find a magic book.

132
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,880
There's a secret trick in it

133
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:52,720
that can let me know

134
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,600
everything that a spirit stone

135
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,960
has experienced from the beginning to the end.

136
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
I feel like

137
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,840
I'm about to find her.

138
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,640
I'm not afraid of anything.

139
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,320
What are you doing?

140
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,440
No way.

141
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,480
I just want to discuss with you.

142
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,520
If you don't want to discuss,

143
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,960
you don't have to do it now.

144
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,960
We can discuss it again.

145
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,920
I have to know

146
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,920
if you are her or not.

147
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,600
Is it her?

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,040
Who is she?

149
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,640
What are you talking about?

150
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,760
This is a beautiful fabric softener.

151
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,640
Don't be afraid.

152
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,200
This secret method will not hurt you.

153
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,960
It's good to attend to them something.

154
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,300
Old Yu Seize him Singh.

155
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,580
That's quite legislation.

156
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,160
Father, mother.

157
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,980
Don't go there that's a spiritual clan.

158
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,900
What is back business?

159
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,100
Don't go there

160
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,700
It's the same as Deng Deng's.

161
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,180
You left him alone in the mountain.

162
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,380
What's wrong with him?

163
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,340
What?

164
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,860
You want to take him home?

165
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,060
God took Deng Deng away.

166
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,940
Mom.

167
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,180
Maybe God gives us a chance.

168
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,860
Give the baby back to Jia Ling.

169
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,020
You always say that

170
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,940
the human and the spirit can't be separated.

171
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,140
Why can't he be our baby?

172
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,020
Since you like him,

173
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,140
take him back.

174
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,340
But you can't tell anyone about this.

175
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,900
Or he'll be in danger.

176
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,940
What...

177
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,140
What's going on?

178
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,860
Why are there two fish?

179
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,660
This is bad!

180
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,620
This is bad!

181
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,340
This is bad!

182
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:55,820
Sister,

183
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,940
I've just found you.

184
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,380
Don't come over.

185
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,060
What's the magic trick you've given me?

186
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,460
Kill me or kill me,

187
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,500
don't play this trick with me.

188
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,620
This is not a trick.

189
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,540
This is the memory of Yunxi's spirit stone in your body.

190
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,180
The real Yu Deng Deng of the Yu family

191
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:14,300
has been dead.

192
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,860
The Yu family adopted you.

193
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:19,060
It can cover your real body with the source.

194
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,060
That's why I've been treating you

195
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,580
as a human woman.

196
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:24,900
Deng Deng,

197
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,380
you are the painting of Yunxi's spirit stone.

198
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,500
The person I've been looking for

199
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:30,820
is you.

200
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,420
You're lying too much.

201
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,620
Let me tell you.

202
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,820
You're looking for

203
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,140
a high-ranking saintess.

204
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,660
I'm Yu Deng Deng,

205
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,060
a debtor and a debtor

206
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,140
who was almost killed by you.

207
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,660
You said we were one person.

208
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,580
What evidence do you have?

209
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,580
Who believes it?

210
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,020
Evidence?

211
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,220
Didn't you see the evidence just now?

212
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,220
You're a great person.

213
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,100
How could I know

214
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,380
that the things I saw just now

215
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,820
were not made up by you?

216
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:02,940
I know.

217
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,180
You want me to

218
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,380
give you the spirit stone

219
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,660
willingly, right?

220
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,260
You're too dramatic.

221
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,780
You dare not write a script like you.

222
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,180
Three thousand years ago,

223
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,180
you gave me the source.

224
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,220
I've been looking forward to

225
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,460
the day I can return it to you.

226
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:24,340
I, Yu Deng Deng,

227
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,820
was raised by my mother.

228
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,100
I'm a person

229
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:27,940
who is watched by the second master.

230
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,380
Why do I need your source?

231
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,180
Your source

232
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,460
is for the person you like.

233
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:37,820
You're the spirit stone of Yunxi.

234
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,900
Now,

235
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,340
you're Yunxi.

236
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,140
The person I like is you.

237
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,340
Stop joking.

238
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,740
Let me ask you.

239
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,020
I bought a jar of

240
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:48,660
Du Kang wine today.

241
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,260
I finished it

242
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,460
and went to a jar of Fen wine.

243
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,540
The jar is the same.

244
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,500
But

245
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:53,940
can the wine be the same?

246
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:55,900
Of course it's different.

247
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,300
Think about it.

248
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,740
Du Kang and Fen wine

249
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,060
are dead things.

250
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,940
You brought the spirit stone.

251
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,500
Stop it.

252
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,100
I don't want to listen.

253
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:05,860
Why don't I remember anything?

254
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,540
I'll tell you again.

255
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,020
I'm the master of Qingquan Village.

256
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,660
I'm beautiful like a flower.

257
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,180
I don't want to play with you.

258
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,740
I've finished your script.

259
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,900
Let's have a game.

260
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,580
I know.

261
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,860
It's hard for you to accept

262
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,060
all of this.

263
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,900
But it's okay.

264
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,260
I can wait.

265
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,980
The day you get back to normal,

266
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,860
you can go to your father

267
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,300
to ask for his permission.

268
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,860
But during this time,

269
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,100
I hope you can agree

270
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,780
that I'll continue to protect you

271
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,980
like before.

272
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,460
Stop joking.

273
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,500
Protect me secretly.

274
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,380
You're with me.

275
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,700
I'm not safe, okay?

276
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,460
You're so scary.

277
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,500
Don't you know?

278
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,900
You'll hide from the spirit stone.

279
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,020
Yeah.

280
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,700
Yes.

281
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,980
Do you want to ask the spirit stone?

282
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:09,380
Yes.

283
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,100
Good.

284
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:12,860
Go on.

285
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,300
Come on.

286
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,340
Wanna fight?

287
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,700
Work it to the end.

288
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,060
Frontline?

289
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,260
Yes.

290
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,340
I don't know what will happen later.

291
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,580
I have to stay with you and protect you.

292
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:29,780
No matter how bad it is,

293
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,100
it's not as bad as someone trying to kill me

294
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,140
and take my spiritual stone.

295
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,460
Don't you dare to make a move in front of me.

296
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,220
Otherwise,

297
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,780
my bullets won't be able to hit you.

298
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,220
You can also use the hairpin.

299
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:40,620
Give it back to you.

300
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,260
This hairpin belongs to Yunxi.

301
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,300
It has the power of the source.

302
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,580
Yunxi used this hairpin

303
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,660
to make the source of the source.

304
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,460
It can easily take my life.

305
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,260
If you think

306
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:54,540
I have threatened your life,

307
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:56,180
you can use this hairpin

308
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,020
to hurt me.

309
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,660
You gave me such an important thing

310
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,660
so easily at that time?

311
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,860
I was eager to protect your life.

312
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,740
Maybe

313
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,740
this is also the source of our relationship.

314
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,580
The thing of destiny

315
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,740
will eventually return to the hands of the destined one.

316
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,340
What... what destined one?

317
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,420
It's weird.

318
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,820
What nonsense are you talking about?

319
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
You don't believe me, do you?

320
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,660
Then I'll show you.

321
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:33,740
You...

322
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,660
You also know that

323
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,140
I will recover immediately after any injury.

324
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,620
Now you can believe me, right?

325
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:45,860
I'm not lying.

326
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,780
I'm not lying.

327
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,660
I'm not lying.

328
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:48,580
I'm not lying.

329
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,180
I'm not lying.

330
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,260
I'm not lying.

331
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,060
I'm not lying.

332
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,620
This hairpin

333
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,940
has another function.

334
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,500
When you call me with it,

335
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
I can hear you

336
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,380
and come to your side immediately.

337
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,300
So amazing!

338
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,260
This is better than

339
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,980
the foreign-invented foreign phone.

340
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,100
It doesn't even need a wire.

341
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,340
How much does it cost?

342
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,420
Don't think too much.

343
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,220
I'm not forgiving you.

344
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:18,340
I'm just thinking that

345
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:20,140
what I've been through

346
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,420
is really evil.

347
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,020
I can deal with people.

348
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,740
It's inevitable to suffer losses when I meet the spiritual clan.

349
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,900
Before I find my father,

350
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,820
I'll trust you for the time being.

351
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,860
If you dare to hurt me again,

352
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,180
I'll use this hairpin

353
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,780
to make you cry for ten thousand times.

354
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,060
So you agreed?

355
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,180
Don't worry.

356
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,860
I can promise you

357
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,340
that from now on,

358
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,620
I won't hurt you.

359
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,780
I'll protect you.

360
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,780
Anyway, my leg is on you.

361
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,220
I can't stop you.

362
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,620
But I just want to find my father.

363
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,740
I don't have time to listen to

364
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,020
the story of the sacred girl of the spiritual clan.

365
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,740
This is the real story of the previous year.

366
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,740
All the spiritual clans and hunters

367
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,100
want to get it.

368
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,620
I hope it can help you.

369
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,540
I'll take it.

370
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,740
I'll take it.

371
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,820
For the sake of your sincerity,

372
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,220
I'll take it for now.

373
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:20,900
You can follow me.

374
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:21,900
But

375
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,740
I have a condition.

376
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,500
What condition?

377
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,860
You can't be too close to me.

378
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,860
You can't live with me

379
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,900
under the same roof.

380
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,660
Otherwise, I'll be worried.

381
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:34,940
Okay.

382
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,300
I'll stay with you

383
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,340
half a mile away.

384
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,140
I'll never step into this area.

385
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,980
I want to see

386
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,660
what you're up to.

387
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,140
You're covered with blood.

388
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:48,940
Wipe it.

389
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,620
Let's go back to the rose shop and save them.

390
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,620
Young Master.

391
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,580
How's it going?

392
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,260
I'm useless.

393
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,220
Lu Yan's yuan energy is too strong.

394
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,060
They escaped.

395
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,860
I've told you.

396
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,260
With Lu Yan here,

397
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,020
you can't trap him.

398
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,260
Forget it.

399
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,620
Anyway, this time,

400
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,540
it's just to check his status.

401
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,780
I've set up traps in Yingdu City.

402
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,980
It depends on his fate.

403
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,300
Whether he's alive or not.

404
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,380
I just left some yuan energy

405
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,540
in the rose shop.

406
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,540
Lu Yan took him to the ghost market

407
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,380
to heal his wounds.

408
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,580
My yuan energy

409
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,140
has some strange fluctuations.

410
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,820
I found that

411
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,740
the smell of the yuan energy

412
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,020
is like a person.

413
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,220
Who?

414
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,500
Yunxi, the Saintess.

415
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,380
Really?

416
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,020
Absolutely.

417
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,540
If that's the case,

418
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,900
it makes sense.

419
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,220
I said Lu Yan

420
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,420
has been surrounded

421
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,660
by an ordinary human girl.

422
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,100
I see.

423
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,540
It seems

424
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,700
I have to test that girl first.

425
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,780
Where?

426
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,380
I'll check it later.

427
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,900
So stinks.

428
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,540
Fab culprit, it stinks so much!

429
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,300
If it hadn't been for my master

430
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,260
asking me to save you back,

431
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,260
You and Master Gu are still trapped in the ghost room.

432
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,060
Let go of me.

433
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,860
I'm so grateful.

434
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,660
Be good.

435
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,660
How do we deal with this little monster?

436
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,060
What do you think?

437
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,460
I'm afraid he's already killed a lot of people

438
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,860
by pointing to this black shop.

439
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,660
I think we should just kill him.

440
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
Don't talk nonsense.

441
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,660
I only stole money

442
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,060
and didn't kill anyone.

443
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,060
Sir,

444
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,060
I've investigated.

445
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,260
This is true.

446
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,860
Although Dai Dai is a bandit,

447
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,460
he didn't kill anyone.

448
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,460
And he's the only one

449
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,860
who's raising the small members of the back yard.

450
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:44,060
What's going on with you?

451
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:47,660
Tell me.

452
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,260
We used to live a good life.

453
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,860
But I don't know what happened.

454
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,460
Our parents disappeared one by one.

455
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,860
We later found out

456
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:04,260
that they all disappeared in India.

457
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:08,260
We thought we could use the money

458
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,260
to go to the police station in India

459
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,460
and ask someone to help us.

460
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:18,260
So we opened this black shop.

461
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,260
Since things are settled,

462
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,460
let's forget it.

463
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,660
We didn't hurt anyone anyway.

464
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,060
It looks pitiful.

465
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,060
Don't do this again.

466
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,860
Destroy the secret medicine in front of us.

467
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:01,660
Hurry.

468
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,660
We're going to India.

469
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,660
We can help you

470
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,460
find out about your parents.

471
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,660
Really?

472
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,660
Thank you.

473
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,260
Thank you.

474
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,260
Thank you.

475
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,060
Thank you.

476
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,660
Have a good trip, Sister Deng Deng.

477
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,060
Remember to send me a letter.

478
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,060
I know.

479
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,060
Thank you.

480
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:26,860
Thank you.

481
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,060
Thank you.

482
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:29,460
Go back.

483
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,260
Sister Deng Deng?

484
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,460
You changed the word so fast.

485
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,060
Master Gu, you're so careful.

486
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,860
It's okay.

487
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,260
Let's go.

488
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,460
Master,

489
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,060
they're just watching here.

490
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,660
They're not following us.

491
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,660
What do you mean?

492
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,460
Da Hai.

493
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,460
How many times do you think Lu Yan can believe?

494
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,260
I don't think he can believe a word.

495
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:55,860
I think so.

496
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,860
Did he say something to you?

497
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,260
Nothing.

498
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,460
Go.

499
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,460
Master.

500
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,260
Master Gu.

501
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,260
Do you think

502
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,660
something happened between them?

503
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,860
That liar.

504
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,860
Maybe he said something else.

505
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,060
You're right.

506
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,660
Go.

507
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,860
Master, when do we leave?

508
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,660
Wait a minute.

509
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:28,860
Okay.

510
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,460
We can go now.

511
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,960
Go and have a look.

512
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,260
It's too luxurious.

513
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:53,260
Gu Pei Xi.

514
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,460
You're lucky.

515
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,460
You're so poor in Hurry Up Market.

516
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,060
Why not follow me?

517
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,580
I can buy you anything.

518
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,180
Shut up.

519
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,260
Come on.

520
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,620
Master, she's getting up.

521
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,340
She used to be so Bisected there in our t Maisery.

522
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,780
Why does she come to eat instant noodles in a street stall?

523
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,700
She's there.

524
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,480
I guess we're about out of money.

525
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,380
Master,

526
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,640
will she enrage us

527
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,780
after i we see bath and soot?

528
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:33,320
Sergey!

529
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,420
their business.

530
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:36,700
Won't they make us pay?

531
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:37,900
Are you afraid?

532
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:38,900
No.

533
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,660
I'm not afraid.

534
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,900
We have to live our lives

535
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:43,860
and earn money.

536
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,740
No way.

537
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,820
Are you going to eat it or not?

538
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,700
If you don't, I'll eat it all.

539
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,420
Eat it.

540
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:52,780
Here, eat some.

541
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,260
You're still thin.

542
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,060
Eat more.

543
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,100
Sir,

544
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,620
are we going to keep this distance

545
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:07,620
from Yu Deng Deng?

546
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:10,780
I've made a promise to him.

547
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,620
Don't get too close to me.

548
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,740
And don't live under the same roof with me.

549
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,460
Otherwise, I'll be worried.

550
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:17,900
Okay.

551
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,180
I'll stay with you for half a mile.

552
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,980
I won't step into this range.

553
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,740
But you said

554
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,700
there's always someone

555
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,300
who wants to kill Yu Deng Deng in Qingquan Town.

556
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,700
We're so far away.

557
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,420
If someone poses a threat to him,

558
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:32,100
we can't get there in time.

559
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,180
I won't let anything happen to him again.

560
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,340
Never.

561
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,740
Deng Deng,

562
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,420
you're the painting of Yunxi Spirit Stone.

563
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,580
The person I've been looking for

564
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:54,940
is you.

565
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,180
Three thousand years ago,

566
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,180
you gave me the yuan-pellet.

567
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,020
I've been looking forward

568
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,300
to the day I can return it to you.

569
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,900
I'm Yu Deng Deng.

570
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,300
My mother gave birth to me.

571
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,540
The second master is watching over me.

572
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,300
I'm a human.

573
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,780
Why do I need your yuan-pellet?

574
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:11,940
Your yuan-pellet

575
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,220
is for the person you like.

576
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,580
You're the painting of Yunxi Spirit Stone.

577
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,620
Now,

578
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,060
you're Yunxi.

579
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,900
The person I like is you.

580
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,900
Saintess?

581
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:27,780
Me?

582
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,780
I'm the Saintess of the Spirit Tribe?

583
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,940
You scared me.

584
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,260
Master,

585
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,780
you've been absent-minded all day.

586
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,100
What are you thinking about?

587
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,180
Da Hai,

588
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,020
how's our relationship?

589
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,780
No problem.

590
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,740
Our relationship

591
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,260
is definitely

592
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,860
a relationship that can keep secrets.

593
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,180
I guess you're interested in me.

594
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,060
Tell me.

595
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,260
I like this the most.

596
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,740
Then you have to sit tight.

597
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,180
I'll go.

598
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:24,820
I'll go.

599
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,500
I'll go.

600
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,180
I'll go.

601
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:26,940
I'll go.

602
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,380
When we were in the cave,

603
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,140
Lu Yan told me that...

604
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,100
Stop laughing.

605
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:58,900
You don't believe it either?

606
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,380
No, no.

607
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,540
I don't believe it.

608
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,780
I don't want to be angry.

609
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,860
It's about

610
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,220
what you said just now.

611
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,780
You're not the only one in this world.

612
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,500
He's still a little bit of a heartbreaker.

613
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,060
Look.

614
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,220
The old village chief is a lazy man.

615
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,420
He doesn't look as good as you.

616
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,660
He doesn't look like a real man.

617
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,100
When he asked you to practice Tongzi Gong,

618
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,700
you said that, right?

619
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:20,380
No, no, no.

620
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:20,940
Don't worry.

621
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,740
I will tell the old man what you said.

622
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,980
It hurts, master. It hurts.

623
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,220
It hurts. It's falling. It's falling.

624
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,100
Give me some water.

625
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:31,800
I also think

626
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,460
that I look not

627
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,540
like the 선물 weeks of that tribe saint.

628
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,100
Master,

629
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,420
I think

630
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,220
Saint's daughter is like

631
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,620
the cloud in the sky that flips.

632
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:43,740
You are

633
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,660
the thick field around in the field area.

634
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,420
It means you are inferior to her.

635
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,460
Think about it.

636
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,300
The clouds are moving in the sky.

637
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,140
They must rain.

638
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,140
When it rains,

639
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,980
she絲 перекl jealous of the field.

640
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,500
No matter how thick your field is,

641
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,940
can grow a lot.

642
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,580
But,

643
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,060
if we really talk about it,

644
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,020
do you think the people want to live

645
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,580
because they hope for the clouds in the sky

646
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,580
or because they hope for the honest land

647
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,660
in their home?

648
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,300
Right?

649
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,660
It sounds reasonable.

650
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,300
The horse fart sounds good.

651
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,380
Look, Master.

652
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,740
You and Master always say I'm stupid.

653
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,100
What is this?

654
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,860
This is not water.

655
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,780
This is wisdom, Master.

656
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:23,980
You, Master.

657
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:25,500
You are the owner of the village.

658
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:26,500
You are the only one who can do this.

659
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,420
You are the Saintess, not the material.

660
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,220
But it's not right.

661
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,020
I'm different from others in many ways.

662
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:32,740
I'm strong.

663
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:33,500
Strong?

664
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,740
You are stronger than that.

665
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,100
My blood can fight against the spiritual clan.

666
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,420
That's a little strange.

667
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,020
But you don't know the magic

668
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,460
of flying and falling from the spiritual clan.

669
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:42,740
Right.

670
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,740
If I were the Saintess of the spiritual clan,

671
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,340
I would be better than Lu Yan.

672
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,660
Master, come on.

673
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,500
Sit down.

674
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,460
When you meet Master,

675
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,540
ask him.

676
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,740
You are just guessing.

677
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,940
It's a waste of your brain, right?

678
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,380
But you are right.

679
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,060
He said the Saintess was his ex-wife.

680
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,140
If you were the Saintess,

681
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,780
you would be better.

682
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,460
Don't talk nonsense.

683
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,060
Who would buy his account?

684
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,340
Look.

685
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,340
She just doesn't want to come in.

686
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,340
Interesting.

687
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:25,500
How could she know to keep her promise?

688
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,180
So annoying.

689
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,820
Okay, go back to sleep.

690
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,580
By the way,

691
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,500
about me...

692
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,540
You are worried about me?

693
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,580
Are you satisfied?

694
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,820
One, two, three, four.

695
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,100
Xiao'ai.

696
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,820
Peng Dahai.

697
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,740
Where is the confidential issue you promised us?

698
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,660
I said I would keep it secret,

699
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,540
I...

700
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,260
I just...

701
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,900
I accidentally said something and she heard it.

702
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,540
It's okay to listen to it.

703
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,780
But you're serious.

704
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,780
You're a saintess of the forest tribe.

705
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,540
I'm the emperor.

706
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,180
How about

707
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,060
I make you the queen?

708
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,340
Do you want to fight?

709
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,340
I didn't.

710
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,540
You can't fight.

711
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,540
I'm so nice to you.

712
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,460
When I find your old fish,

713
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,860
I'll sue you.

714
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,700
Go ahead.

715
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,580
Hurry up.

716
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,580
Sir.

717
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,460
It's so stuffy.

718
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,860
It's autumn.

719
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,860
How about we ride the horse?

720
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,060
If we change the horse,

721
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,860
she'll be worried that I'll catch up with her.

722
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,420
Just walk.

723
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:15,660
That's all?

724
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,300
Drink mine.

725
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,940
The cold Jasmine tea.

726
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,180
Cold tea?

727
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,740
I know you like tea.

728
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,980
Yesterday, I asked the shopkeeper to

729
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,220
soak you with cold water from the well.

730
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,540
It's good for you to feel warm.

731
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,060
Thank you.

732
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,060
Sir,

733
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,780
I think Nanfeng Village is better.

734
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,620
Gu Jiajou,

735
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,700
just call me sir.

736
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,540
What about mine?

737
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,540
You decide.

738
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,300
Okay.

739
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,420
I'll give you a good one.

740
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,060
It's so hot.

741
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,860
It would be great if it rains.

742
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,900
Hi there.

743
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,220
Give me the umbrella.

744
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:53,940
Okay.

745
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,260
Sir,

746
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,380
what kind of water is this?

747
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,220
It's raining.

748
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,220
Let's find a place to hide from the rain.

749
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,100
Where could we find a place to hide from the rain?

750
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,900
Where's the umbrella?

751
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,460
It's at the Rose Hotel.

752
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,420
Let's go first.

753
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,580
Let's find a place to hide.

754
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,660
Go.

755
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:16,700
Sir,

756
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,940
there's an umbrella.

757
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,420
Wait a minute.

758
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,580
Hold it?

759
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,780
Hit him first.

760
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,460
Everyone is吓 compris.

761
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,580
Sister...

762
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,500
Sister, let's come in.

763
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,220
You are cold.

764
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:04,220
I'm afraid that I'll be left alone in the world.

765
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:11,220
The most beautiful scenery in life.

766
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:15,220
Master, there are mountains nearby in this kind of rain.

767
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,220
If someone shows up, they'll be in danger.

768
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:21,220
You don't need to worry about their ability.

769
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,220
How about sending him a umbrella?

770
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,220
No, I can't be upset with him.

771
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,220
I'm not interested in him.

772
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,220
I have my own rules.

773
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,220
I can break them by myself.

774
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,220
Isn't that so funny?

775
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,220
Master, how about I call them over and fight with them?

776
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,220
No need.

777
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,220
He can't stand it.

778
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,220
