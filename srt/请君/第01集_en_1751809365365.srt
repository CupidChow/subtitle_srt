1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll never let go after you leave

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You are me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You ask you, you are me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You are me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You are me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You are me

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No burden, delicious pure and sour milk

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Remind you that the wonderful is about to begin

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Children's special cold medicine

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Three nine children's cold medicine

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Remind you that the wonderful is about to begin

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Three thousand years ago

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
The spiritual clan led by Saintess Yunxi

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The battle against the human clan

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Suddenly, the spirit of life was destroyed

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In the battle, Yunxi said that everyone dared to change

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Seal his desire to kill

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hope to exchange for peace

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Unexpectedly, but because of this, he was hated by the dragon

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Continue to take the spirit clan to fight everywhere

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
At the same time, the human royal prince Lu Yan led the army to fight

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
With Yunxi, I want to end the war

23
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
But the dragon tried to push the two into a deadlock

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Before Yunxi died

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Throw the yuan pellet to Lu Yan

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Lu Yan used the yuan pellet to destroy the dragon

27
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
End the battle of the human soul

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Complete Yunxi's wish

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Nine states return to peace

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But Lu Yan suddenly stood out from the world

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
End of the world

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Leave countless legends to the future

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,600
I'm fine. I have air.

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,280
Master, move aside.

35
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,280
My firecracker will explode if I touch it.

36
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,400
Wait.

37
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,600
Don't explode.

38
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
I'll do it.

39
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,000
The second master said

40
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,000
that we are the most popular in Mount Qingquan.

41
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,000
The wind and water are the most popular.

42
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,000
The wind and water are the most popular.

43
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,000
The wind and water are the most popular.

44
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,000
The wind and water are the most popular.

45
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,400
The wind and water are the most popular.

46
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,800
The mountain is not that bad.

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
If it explodes, it might collapse.

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,600
Everyone, search everywhere.

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,200
It's said that there was a big corrupt official in the previous dynasty.

50
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
He was corrupt and bribe.

51
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
He searched for the famous cake.

52
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,800
He was afraid that others would report him.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,600
So he hid all the gold and silver treasures here.

54
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,400
It's empty.

55
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,600
Master,

56
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,400
there's nothing but empty boxes.

57
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,600
That's why it's so hard to open.

58
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,200
Senpai.

59
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,000
Let me do it.

60
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,800
How hard can it be?

61
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,400
One, two, three.

62
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,800
Everyone, look.

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,800
It's nothing.

64
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,600
Open it.

65
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,600
It's empty.

66
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,000
It's empty.

67
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,000
It's empty.

68
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,800
Come and have a look.

69
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,800
The queue is quite long.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,200
It's poorer than us.

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It's all in vain.

72
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,600
It's all in vain.

73
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,400
Master.

74
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,000
Where's the money?

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,800
Hurry up.

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,200
Master.

77
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,800
What's wrong with you?

78
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,400
Let me go.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's strange.

80
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,600
Why is there such a big mural here?

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,600
The people on the portrait are so beautiful.

82
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,600
Why are they so beautiful

83
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,000
and painted in such a messy place?

84
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,200
Come on.

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,200
Come on.

86
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Yunxian.

87
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,600
You're not Yunxian.

88
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Master.

89
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,800
Come on.

90
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,600
Yunxi.

91
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You've been reborn

92
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
and returned to the world.

93
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,000
Master.

94
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,800
Master.

95
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,400
Come on.

96
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,000
Come on.

97
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Come on.

98
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You're married.

99
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,000
Why would I have such a dream?

100
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,400
No.

101
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
It's definitely not my problem.

102
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,000
It's all because of that mural.

103
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
It's all because the little man on the mural

104
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,200
is so beautiful.

105
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Don't be angry.

106
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,200
You know your identity, too, right?

107
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,600
You're so stingy.

108
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,600
You're so stingy.

109
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,600
What are you doing?

110
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,600
You're awake.

111
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,600
You're so stingy.

112
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,800
I'm removing the ashes for you.

113
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,000
What ashes?

114
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,400
I've told you

115
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,600
that cave is too dirty and dirty.

116
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,600
You insisted on breaking in.

117
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,400
But what happened?

118
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
You didn't get anything.

119
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,600
You almost lost your life.

120
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Don't chase me.

121
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
You know that?

122
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,200
I think

123
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,600
the coal mine will be destroyed

124
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,000
within three years

125
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,600
of our Qingquan Village.

126
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,600
Can you say something nice?

127
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,200
I've calculated for you.

128
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,600
You only have a few nice clothes left.

129
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,000
We're going to starve to death.

130
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Brother,

131
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,400
you're calculating every day.

132
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,200
If you can calculate it correctly,

133
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,400
I'll help you.

134
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,600
Look at the situation now.

135
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,600
In the past half a year,

136
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
our Qingquan Village has been destroyed

137
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,800
and the land is in ruins.

138
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,600
But

139
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,600
you don't have to worry.

140
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,000
I've calculated a shortcut for you.

141
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,200
What shortcut?

142
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,200
Go to a manor and get married.

143
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,600
Goodbye.

144
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
Come back.

145
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Think about it.

146
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,800
I was so anxious when I was ten years old.

147
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,200
I almost lost my life.

148
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,200
You told my dad

149
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,800
to get me a big rooster.

150
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,600
I got it and got the money.

151
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
But do you know how many years

152
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,600
I've been laughed at by the creditors?

153
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,000
It's ridiculous.

154
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,800
Now you even want me to marry a man.

155
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
The rich man who sells his daughter

156
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,400
has never sold twice.

157
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,000
Marrying a rich man

158
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,000
can eliminate bad luck

159
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,600
and make a fortune.

160
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,600
I can read and dance.

161
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,200
I need to get married and make money.

162
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
It's safe.

163
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,600
It's safe to make a fortune.

164
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
How about

165
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,400
getting a rich wife for you?

166
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You little girl.

167
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
I've calculated it.

168
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
I'm lucky.

169
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,600
I can't be too hard on you.

170
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
I've calculated it too.

171
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
I'm lucky.

172
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,800
I can't be too hard on you.

173
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
I can't be too hard on you.

174
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,600
But you can pay me back.

175
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,000
I can't be your mom.

176
00:12:45,000 --> 00:13:06,640
I'll be ум

177
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,280
I'll take her to the police station.

178
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:08,920
No.

179
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,640
If we lose the goods,

180
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,480
we'll be in trouble.

181
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,480
We can't die.

182
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,640
Then we can't starve to death.

183
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,400
There's no way out.

184
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,440
Isn't there the mother pig?

185
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,280
Boss,

186
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,280
it's bad, boss.

187
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,200
Boss,

188
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,560
the mother pig in the courtyard is in trouble.

189
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,200
What?

190
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,200
Boss,

191
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
boss.

192
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,640
Boss.

193
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,600
You have something to do?

194
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,440
Bad news.

195
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,480
The second son's uncle said

196
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,640
if we don't pay the money,

197
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,640
he'll be expelled.

198
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,280
Listen to me.

199
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,920
He's expelled.

200
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,120
My god.

201
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,400
Money, money, money.

202
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,040
You want money all morning.

203
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,280
Isn't it good news?

204
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,480
Boss,

205
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,480
I got it.

206
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,040
The black-eyed boy is pregnant.

207
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,880
Do you want to get him some candy?

208
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,640
A few more mouths.

209
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,040
A penny is a hero.

210
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,000
Wait.

211
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,680
Such a good day

212
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,040
has just begun.

213
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,280
Dahai,

214
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,000
go to my room and get those herbs.

215
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And smoke them.

216
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Wait.

217
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,320
Your mother died early.

218
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,480
I'm your stepmother.

219
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,840
I bought you

220
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,320
beautiful clothes and clothes

221
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,120
just to let you go out and be polite.

222
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,600
Fine.

223
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,440
You don't listen to me.

224
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
Dahai,

225
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,400
inform the mountain station.

226
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,640
If not, we'll dig a map

227
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,160
and cut the trees.

228
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,720
Let's see who's lucky

229
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,000
to live longer.

230
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Right?

231
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,920
A rich man

232
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,360
can get rid of bad luck

233
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,800
and get married.

234
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
Wait.

235
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Master.

236
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,040
Go down the mountain

237
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,440
and get the richest one.

238
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,440
Go.

239
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Master Lu,

240
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,240
I finally recommend

241
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,720
the best new products of our store.

242
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,680
They're super long,

243
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,240
comfortable and wide.

244
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,800
They're all high-quality.

245
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,400
If I didn't open my own shop,

246
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,280
I would have bought a bottle of wine

247
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,280
and made it myself.

248
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,920
Good things are good.

249
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,480
But I don't want

250
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,280
this kind of things.

251
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,320
Master Lu,

252
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,640
you've seen

253
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,880
all the sedan chairs in our shop.

254
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,080
You can't buy them all.

255
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,280
I'm not interested in them.

256
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,720
I just want to buy them.

257
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,800
I'm not interested in them.

258
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
I'm not interested in them.

259
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,800
I'm not interested in them.

260
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,200
You've seen all the sedan chairs.

261
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,960
If we can't get the new ones,

262
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,360
no one can get them.

263
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,720
Why don't you just tell me

264
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,840
what kind of sedan chairs you want?

265
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
Right.

266
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,160
To be honest,

267
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,480
I want the one

268
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,960
that can change the way

269
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,760
of acting in the store.

270
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,920
Get out of the way.

271
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,240
Get out of the way.

272
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,720
The

273
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:42,240
The

274
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,680
Master Lu,

275
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,080
I'll do this for you.

276
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,840
Help me with this matter.

277
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,400
Thank you.

278
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,960
Thank you for being the living Bodhisattva

279
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,960
and you're the benefactor of the Lu family.

280
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,160
Thank you.

281
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,560
Thank you.

282
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,000
What's wrong?

283
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,920
Once we start the opening ceremony

284
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:22,260
the

285
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,260
muyah

286
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:23,620
come

287
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:40,840
You are so Tot

288
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,920
Brother

289
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:46,920
Brother

290
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,900
Take an shed and move out

291
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,840
Later you come to ask me

292
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,000
What is the point of saying

293
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,360
Don't go

294
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,680
My dead friend

295
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Relinquishing marriage

296
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:06,820
I know this

297
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,600
Mother

298
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,480
What should i do

299
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,420
ныхvo

300
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:09,800
You say

301
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,200
I say

302
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,020
Don't die

303
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,700
I say

304
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,220
I say

305
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,020
Let me go

306
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,880
Then...

307
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,000
I'll call you Mr. in the future.

308
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,680
Mr.?

309
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,440
Xin,

310
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,800
after I woke up,

311
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,400
I found that there was no trace of Yunxi on Mount Qingquan.

312
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,480
Has she regained her spirit

313
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,920
and rewoken up?

314
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,080
Mr.,

315
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,840
we made a big mistake.

316
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,120
We lost our master.

317
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,320
It's all our fault.

318
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,480
We lost our master.

319
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,880
Mr.,

320
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,280
why is your clothes...

321
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,080
You said before

322
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,880
that after the seal is removed,

323
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,760
the energy will be very unstable.

324
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,040
It will be low and high.

325
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,280
Maybe it will change the appearance.

326
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,320
Maybe it will change the appearance of the clothes.

327
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,480
But it should be fine soon.

328
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,440
Xin,

329
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:09,920
how did you find that

330
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,520
Yunxi's spirit is gone?

331
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,360
Mr.,

332
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,720
for the past three thousand years,

333
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,960
you have been gathering the spirit of your master

334
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,440
with your yuan energy.

335
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,120
But twenty years ago,

336
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,200
I was hurt by a hunter passing by.

337
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,120
When I ran back,

338
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,640
I found that the place where the master's spirit was gathered

339
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,280
was gone.

340
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,000
Yunxi is not in this Mount Qingquan.

341
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,120
There are only a few ordinary spirits here.

342
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,480
Yes, Mr..

343
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,400
Our spirits have long fallen.

344
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,840
We dare not have a conflict with humans.

345
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,560
We can only live in the crowd.

346
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,720
Now most of the spirits have fled to Yingdu.

347
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,800
There are many spirits in the Mount Qingquan.

348
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,360
The fate of the spirits today

349
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,080
may be related to me.

350
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,360
Mr.,

351
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,000
you can't say that.

352
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,680
If the master didn't give you the yuan energy

353
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,200
and let Zhurong take it away,

354
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,200
the world

355
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,040
would have been in a mess.

356
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,400
Who is it?

357
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,640
Why is it so noisy?

358
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,920
Can you let me sleep quietly?

359
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,080
I wonder why General Yan called me here.

360
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,560
Three thousand years ago,

361
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,360
I placed a piece of jade on the lake surface of this mountain.

362
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,640
This piece of jade

363
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,560
has been in the water for more than twenty years.

364
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,560
It's been a long time since I last saw it.

365
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,360
I've been looking for it for a long time.

366
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,560
But I didn't find it.

367
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,120
I've been looking for it for a long time.

368
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,560
I've been looking for it for a long time.

369
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,320
The spirit jade suddenly disappeared more than twenty years ago.

370
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,200
You've been in Mount Qingquan for a long time.

371
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,160
Do you know what's inside it?

372
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,720
Twenty years ago?

373
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,080
Twenty years ago?

374
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,160
I remember it now.

375
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,000
The spirit jade

376
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,480
gathered the spirit stones of someone

377
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,240
and was taken away very quickly.

378
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,160
Taken away?

379
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,000
Did you see who took it away?

380
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,680
How can I know?

381
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,760
There are hundreds of spirits

382
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,440
passing by the Mount Qingquan every day.

383
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,520
How can everyone remember it?

384
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,280
I'm limited in power.

385
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,320
I can't protect the spirit jade.

386
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
Besides,

387
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,840
I don't want to have a dispute with humans.

388
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,840
You old...

389
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,040
Since you just said that hundreds of people

390
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,040
pass by the Mount Qingquan every day,

391
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,080
why do you only remember

392
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,880
the thing that the spirit jade was taken away?

393
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,160
Yes.

394
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,680
Why?

395
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,240
I remember it now.

396
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,480
That man

397
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,800
had a dagger.

398
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,560
There was a ashes on the dagger.

399
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,920
Let me show you.

400
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,480
This...

401
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,760
This is it.

402
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:56,840
A'xi.

403
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,680
Can you help me find some

404
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,320
historical records of the place of Mount Qingquan?

405
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,600
I have it at home.

406
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,560
I've already prepared it.

407
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,200
This is the historical record of the whole country.

408
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,680
But according to the ancient books,

409
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,040
it's been 3000 years.

410
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,320
The words are different.

411
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,600
Sir,

412
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,280
how about I read it for you?

413
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:17,880
No need.

414
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,640
I'll know when I'm lazy.

415
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,160
It's not an kaukui at all.

416
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,760
Sir.

417
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,520
Yes.

418
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,080
Being like this

419
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,800
won't attract others' attention.

420
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,160
I've got everything

421
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,600
in here.

422
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
Did you find

423
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,080
any clues?

424
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,520
Sir,

425
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,720
what's wrong?

426
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,120
Is it

427
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,320
the original power of the reverse?

428
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,200
I'm fine.

429
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,640
I just know that every time

430
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,960
something happens,

431
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,800
I'm just a little upset.

432
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,640
I haven't started the reverse.

433
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,280
You're a mortal.

434
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,040
You're carrying the original power of the Saintess.

435
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,160
You can't control the original power of your body.

436
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,800
You're so weak.

437
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,880
You might be unconscious.

438
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,040
I didn't expect that

439
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,800
you've been suffering

440
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,280
for so many years.

441
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,240
Compared to the fact that Yunxi saved me,

442
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,360
it's nothing.

443
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,560
The most important thing now

444
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,880
is to find Yunxi.

445
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,480
If I have to,

446
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,120
I'll seal the original power

447
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,000
and unlock it after I've recovered.

448
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,520
As long as I can find her,

449
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,960
I don't mind

450
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,520
any pain.

451
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,680
I just don't know

452
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,400
what she'll look like

453
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,280
when she meets her master.

454
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,440
Could it be

455
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,960
a man?

456
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,280
Or

457
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,640
an animal?

458
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,120
Whether she's reborn as a flower, grass or tree,

459
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,720
or a bird,

460
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,960
even a bee

461
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,160
or a snow,

462
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,720
I'll find her.

463
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,000
Master Yi.

464
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,880
Master Yi.

465
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:53,960
Open the door.

466
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,560
Get in.

467
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,360
Good. Good.

468
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,160
Open the door. Open the door.

469
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,960
Old man, open the door.

470
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,880
We're all civilized people.

471
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,400
We're noisy and humiliated.

472
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,360
You'll open the door sooner or later.

473
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,720
If you don't,

474
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,640
I'll smash you.

475
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,320
Father, I don't want to live in this village.

476
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,240
Son.

477
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,640
I had no choice

478
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,880
to do this today.

479
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:31,880
They

480
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,200
caught our evidence.

481
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,440
I had no choice.

482
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,800
Don't worry.

483
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,080
I don't believe it today.

484
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:44,360
Open the door.

485
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,960
Master,

486
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,800
have some tea first.

487
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,040
Boss,

488
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,760
you're not bad.

489
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,320
Is this the groom?

490
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,600
He does look good.

491
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,880
But is he

492
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,880
a little weak?

493
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,120
Master, he's a young man.

494
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,840
It's normal for skin to be soft.

495
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,240
He's crazy.

496
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,280
Stop it.

497
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,360
Let's go.

498
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,280
Let's go.

499
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:36,880
Let's go.

500
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:37,800
Mother.

501
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:38,840
Father.

502
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,520
Son.

503
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,360
Son.

504
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,640
Old man.

505
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,440
Father.

506
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,400
This house is nice.

507
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,760
What do you mean?

508
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,920
Nothing.

509
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,800
I heard that you're doing tobacco business.

510
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,200
Tobacco is a bad deal.

511
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,440
I advise you to stop it soon.

512
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,280
And

513
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,520
we'll be a family in the future.

514
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,480
When your son's dowry is over,

515
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,440
I'll come to marry you.

516
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:07,800
You.

517
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,080
That's good.

518
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,280
Come on.

519
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,840
Let's go.

520
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,160
Master Lu is so generous.

521
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,200
He's so generous.

522
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,800
He's been our master for half a year.

523
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,280
Master,

524
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,960
you're so generous.

525
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,880
You're so generous.

526
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,560
It's nothing.

527
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,640
People are

528
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,360
so generous.

529
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,640
Keep your voice down.

530
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,760
Count the money after you go back.

531
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,680
Give it to the people in the mountain.

532
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,880
Okay.

533
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,200
What's wrong?

534
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,480
Did you bring the stuff?

535
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,320
Yes.

536
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,040
Don't you think it's quiet today?

537
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,040
Yes.

538
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,280
Is the person behind you okay?

539
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,760
Yes.

540
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,160
He's fine.

541
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,480
Really?

542
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,680
Yes.

543
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,480
Why didn't he cry?

544
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,760
He cried all the way.

545
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,360
He's tired.

546
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,320
He's breathing heavily.

547
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,440
Yes.

548
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:32,880
Master.

549
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,360
No.

550
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,600
He's really fine.

551
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,080
Open it.

552
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,640
Okay, master.

553
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,360
No.

554
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,640
It's a wedding sedan chair.

555
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,320
Yes.

556
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,760
They said it's a wedding sedan chair.

557
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,240
You can open it yourself.

558
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,760
Or he'll suffocate.

559
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,840
You can open it yourself.

560
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,800
Open it.

561
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,360
Master.

562
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,120
I can't do it.

563
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
I really can't.

564
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:57,840
This...

565
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,240
Where is he?

566
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,200
Is he in the basement?

567
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,920
What's going on?

568
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,240
I'm so scared.

569
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,760
Why is he gone?

570
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,480
Who is he?

571
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,760
What's going on?

572
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,520
What's going on?

573
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,320
You're scaring me.

574
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,080
Who did this?

575
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,720
Who did this?

576
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:18,680
The Lu family lied to us.

577
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,320
They can't bully us.

578
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,360
Do you hear me?

579
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,280
Yes.

580
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,000
Okay.

581
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,080
Kill them.

582
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,520
Okay.

583
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,200
Wait.

584
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,560
Everyone is watching

585
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,480
the young master of the Lu family enter the sedan chair.

586
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,080
Only this woman

587
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,440
has touched the sedan chair on the way.

588
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,160
Now she's gone.

589
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,080
Only she can do this.

590
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:40,920
Qiniang.

591
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,680
You can't hide it anymore, can you?

592
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,240
You helped her steal it.

593
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,760
It's not my business.

594
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,080
It's not your business?

595
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,520
It's not your business.

596
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,680
Then whose business is it?

597
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,080
What's going on?

598
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:54,800
Tell us.

599
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,400
Tell us.

600
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,600
Tell us.

601
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,000
Will you tell us?

602
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,640
I don't know.

603
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,000
You won't tell us, right?

604
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,360
Okay.

605
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,600
Young Master Lu is delicate and tender.

606
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,040
I don't like him.

607
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,240
I heard your son

608
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,680
is in the school this year.

609
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,480
He must be 18 years old.

610
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,320
Please forgive me.

611
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,560
I mean

612
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,440
the sedan chair.

613
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,640
The sedan chair?

614
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,040
The sedan chair?

615
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:24,760
The sedan chair?

616
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,120
I heard it too.

617
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,280
It happened three or five years ago.

618
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
They said

619
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,880
a girl didn't want to get married.

620
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,680
Then they invited the wedding sedan chair

621
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,280
from Xinji sedan chair.

622
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,360
The girl was lost on the way.

623
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,120
Where did she go?

624
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,960
It's ridiculous.

625
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,720
Tell us.

626
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,320
They said

627
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,360
the sedan chair from Xinji sedan chair

628
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,360
is a magic.

629
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,840
It's the one in the big sunset.

630
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,200
The one with the big wall.

631
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,360
They said the girl

632
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,080
went into the sedan chair

633
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,880
and appeared in another sedan chair.

634
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,720
But she

635
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,640
appeared in the next town.

636
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,440
She ran away.

637
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,200
She was in the sedan chair

638
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,360
and appeared in another sedan chair.

639
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,480
She was lost on the way.

640
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
She can't be in the sedan chair.

641
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,280
Get out of the way.

642
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,840
Besides,

643
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,120
the Lu family has been hiding from the city.

644
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
They can't find her.

645
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,840
The sedan chair.

646
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,000
Look.

647
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,840
The sedan chair.

648
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,520
Look.

649
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,320
It's a stone.

650
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,040
What's this?

651
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,400
What's going on?

652
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,160
What's going on?

653
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,720
What's going on?

654
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,520
What's going on?

655
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,480
What's going on?

656
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,920
What's going on?

657
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,840
It's fine if she becomes beautiful.

658
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,160
Why is her family beautiful?

659
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:28,800
That's right.

660
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,320
Tell us.

661
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,040
Where is her family?

662
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,680
Tell us.

663
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,960
You're good at teaching people.

664
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,400
Da Hai.

665
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
Call some brothers.

666
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,680
I want to see

667
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,800

668
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,920

669
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,280

00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,040

00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,800
Move.

676
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,600
Move.

677
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,280
Move.

678
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
Move.

679
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:53,880
Move.

680
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,400
Move.

681
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,240
This way.

682
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:55,920
This way.

683
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:56,880
This way.

684
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,400
This way.

685
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:57,920
Go.

686
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,200
Brothers.

687
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,760
Go.

688
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,400
This way.

689
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,040
Go.

690
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,840
Go.

691
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:02,520
Go in.

692
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:03,520
Go in.

693
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,040
Open the door.

694
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,840
Open the door.

695
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:05,720
Open the door.

696
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,800
Open the door.

697
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,400
Open the door.

00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,640

Move.

701
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,960
Don't hide in there.

702
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,680
There must be something wrong with the door.

703
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,560
Boss only used one cent.

704
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,840
There must be something wrong with the door.

705
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,800
There must be something wrong with the door.

706
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,560
Call her out.

00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,240
I'll go and have a look.

Don't come over!

737
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,380
Doctor!

738
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,700
One doesn't know where he's going

739
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,700
I think nobody is safe

740
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,500
I didn't let you play

741
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:37,660
Everyone meddles me

742
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,660
I can't be left alone

743
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:40,600

748
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,180
Don't come

749
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,920
I want to go

750
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,660
Definitely

751
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,420
Everyone, you are such a dutiful man

752
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,340
let others else work

753
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,300
it's nothing

754
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,700
fast

755
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,500
Master

756
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,220
Master

757
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,900
Master, are you ok?

758
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:19,460
Master

759
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,300

760
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:20,840
what's wrong

761
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,740
Leave

762
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,740
to let them be friends, okay?

763
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,140
No.

764
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,380
The plan has changed.

765
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,380
This time,

766
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,700
I want to make up for it.

767
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,700
The most beautiful scenery

768
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,700
is all about you.

769
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,060
When two hearts are close together,

770
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:08,580
when the whole world is occupied by you,

771
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:13,340
I will call for you with all my heart

772
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:18,340
until I can remember you.

773
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:24,180
You are the only one

774
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:30,660
walking into the scenery.

775
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,900
This is the end of the world.

776
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,940
The fate is only love.

777
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,900
I hide my heart

778
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:47,060
and make a decision for you.

779
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:54,540
You are the only one

780
00:37:55,540 --> 00:38:00,500
walking into the scenery.

781
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,900
When two hearts are close together,

782
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,340
when the whole world is occupied by you,

783
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:20,020
I will call for you with all my heart

784
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,700
until I can remember you.

785
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,940
You are the only one

786
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:37,900
walking into the scenery.

787
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:41,620
This is the end of the world.

788
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,740
The fate is only love.

789
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:49,500
I hide my heart

790
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,500
and make a decision for you.
