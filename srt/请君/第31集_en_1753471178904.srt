1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let go even if you walk away from me

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You ask me, it's me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You ask me, it's me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You ask me, it's me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You ask me, it's me

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The King Of Blaze

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Episode 16

9
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Gui Du, are you okay?

10
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
General, don't blame me

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
General, these puppets are unbreakable

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You go, you go

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Go together

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You are really a brotherly love

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But Lu Yan, do you really know your good brother?

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Today I will show you the real face of this Wei Fu

17
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What's going on?

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Why is it so weird?

19
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What's the matter?

20
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Why is it so weird?

21
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why is it so weird?

22
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:27,000
What's this place?

23
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
This is Yu Village

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yu Village

25
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This is in the true memory of Gui Du

26
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Gui Du

27
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There must be someone who can move when the illusion comes out

28
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Black Cat

29
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Lu Yan, you are so eager to kill me

30
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Don't you want to see that good show?

31
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The mind of the troubled people, this trick has no effect on me

32
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Really? Not everyone is as strong as you

33
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Shut up

34
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Mother

35
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Stop killing people

36
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What's wrong?

37
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Gui Du, you dare not let people know that this village is Yu Village

38
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Among these women, there is a mother who raised Yu Deng Deng

39
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Mother

40
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Don't come over

41
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No

42
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
No

43
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
No

44
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No

45
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No

46
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
No

47
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No

48
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No

49
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
No

50
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No

51
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No

52
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Gui Du, you coward, you are always defending people

53
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You are always defending people

54
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
In the end, you are not only defending yourself, but also following my orders

55
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You can kill whoever you want

56
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You are a good weapon

57
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
A strong man

58
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's you

59
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's you

60
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You have ruined me

61
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Wasn't it you who did it?

62
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You killed mother and daughter

63
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Do you think your wife will forgive you?

64
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Will she forgive your general?

65
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It was her

66
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
She was the one who killed my mother

67
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
She was the one who killed my father

68
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,000
She was the one who killed my mother

69
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
She was the one who killed my father

70
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,000
She was the one who killed my father

71
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
She was the one who killed my father

72
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I

73
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You bastard

74
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I will kill her

75
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I will kill her to avenge you

76
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Gui Du deserves to die

77
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But if we kill her

78
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
She will only follow my orders

79
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I want to see her

80
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I want to see her

81
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Isn't it this scene?

82
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But she killed your mother

83
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You can't do it

84
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I will avenge you

85
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Gui Du

86
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
If I were you, I would have already died

87
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
How can I still be alive?

88
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Gui Du

89
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,440
I'll avenge 입

90
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Damn

91
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,180
Make Consort achive by myself and leave

92
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,740
from Inazuma City's Intelligence Department soon!

93
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,720
waar

94
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,380
Wipe out their hands and take back What you belong to

95
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,940
zero meaning

96
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,000
Wait

97
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,120
I'll go out now

98
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,440
to get back what belongs to the Ling Clan

99
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,000
and you.

100
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,280
You insist on making it

101
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,760
a good dream.

102
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,280
You're really not a good person.

103
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,360
General.

104
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm a sinner.

105
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,800
I'm a sinner.

106
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,480
Don't waste your fate

107
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,640
for me.

108
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,680
Don't move.

109
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,320
General.

110
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,360
I'm sorry.

111
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,840
I'm sorry for Miss Yu.

112
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,520
I hate the Ling Clan.

113
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,760
But I

114
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,000
became like the Ling Clan

115
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,000
and killed Miss Yu's family

116
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,520
and innocent people.

117
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,880
You were bewitched by Zhurong

118
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,720
and you were at fault.

119
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,400
If you really want to atone,

120
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,680
kill Zhurong with me

121
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,720
and avenge

122
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,000
these innocent people.

123
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,760
General.

124
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,640
General.

125
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,760
Don't blame me.

126
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,480
Zhurong won't give up.

127
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,680
He wants to keep Yuan Neng

128
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,000
and fight with him.

129
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,000
When did I leave you?

130
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,440
Three thousand years ago.

131
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,080
I won't do it now.

132
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,920
Thank you, General.

133
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,120
Come.

134
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,040
General,

135
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,640
Zhurong will lose

136
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,960
your strength.

137
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,280
If you keep doing this,

138
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,040
I'll drag you down.

139
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,640
If you delay the break,

140
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,760
you may never get out.

141
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,760
Don't worry.

142
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
I feel

143
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,240
I'll find the eye of the formation soon.

144
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,560
I'll find the eye of the formation soon.

145
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,760
I'll find the eye of the formation soon.

146
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,800
But I'm too familiar with this city.

147
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,640
There are no signs of eye of formation

148
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,360
along the way.

149
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,440
There are no signs of eye of formation.

150
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,040
But it's hard for us

151
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,400
to notice it.

152
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,920
Zhurong uses

153
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,240
Yu Deng Deng's Yuan Neng.

154
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,280
I used Soul Chasing Skill

155
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,640
in Yu Deng Deng's Yuan Neng.

156
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,080
This mark

157
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,080
has been integrated into Zhurong's Yuan Neng.

158
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,640
So,

159
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,000
the place where the power of formation

160
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,240
is always the eye of formation

161
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,880
is the place where the power of formation is.

162
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,160
Zhurong will also

163
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,520
reveal the corresponding one.

164
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,200
You're really a true general.

165
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,760
General Lu,

166
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,000
I've brought you good news.

167
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
Your woman

168
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,160
has also come back to the city.

169
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,120
I'll see

170
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,600
how much you can save today.

171
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,960
How's it going?

172
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,680
Almost done.

173
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,800
Deng Deng.

174
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,720
Deng Deng.

175
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,280
Deng Deng.

176
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,120
Let's go home.

177
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,520
Go.

178
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,640
Oh no.

179
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,560
Where is she?

180
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,920
Where is Deng Deng?

181
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,720
Deng Deng.

182
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,480
Where is Master?

183
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:34,280
Gu Bei Xi must have

184
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,240
taken her away.

185
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,280
Stop shouting.

186
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,080
This...

187
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,280
You go out and search.

188
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,600
We'll go to the city gate.

189
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,480
You wait here.

190
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,280
Go.

191
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,080
You must find her.

192
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,160
If you can't, don't come back.

193
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,840
General,

194
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,400
I'm too familiar with this place.

195
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,400
I did something

196
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,600
that can't be done.

197
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,320
Please allow me to find Miss Yu

198
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,880
and atone for my sin.

199
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:03,760
Okay.

200
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,680
I'll leave this matter to you.

201
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,360
Okay.

202
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
But you must remember

203
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,080
to be careful.

204
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:13,960
General,

205
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
please be careful.

206
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,440
Zhu Rong,

207
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,360
as long as you don't use the magic array,

208
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,440
I can find

209
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,640
where you are hiding.

210
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,440
My Conqueringember of Songs

211
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,280
Lu Yan,

212
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,880
you give me surprises.

213
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,600
I didn't expect

214
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,080
you, general Yan,

215
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,120
would play develop.

216
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,000
I want to help you

217
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,560
find Zhen Yan.

218
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,480
If you're so clever,

219
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,520
I'll pick a different pill

220
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,760
to give you.

221
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Then on your day off,

222
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,820
whenever someone lets you loose in my yell,

223
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,860
It's even more so if,

224
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,720
This useless thing can't even find a person

225
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,920
We are back

226
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,240
How about it? Where is the person?

227
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:42,020
The exit of the

228
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,240
You can come and see

229
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,120
What's wrong with this

230
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:49,960
Look

231
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,600
Zhu Rong wants to kill

232
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,240
Tell everyone to run

233
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:55,800
Quickly move

234
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,640
go go

235
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,960
Lu Yan, do you like the gift I gave you?

236
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,960
Now, you don't need me to kill you.

237
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,960
Those people of the Louyi Sect will die.

238
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,460
The longer you drag on, the more people you'll kill.

239
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,960
That's right.

240
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,960
If you want to break the formation, kill me first.

241
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,960
Ha Xin, the second master's foot is not good.

242
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:54,960
Take him away first.

243
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,960
You're lying.

244
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Who's foot is not good?

245
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
I'll go wherever you go.

246
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,960
Deng Deng is also my daughter.

247
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,960
Master.

248
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
My master and master are still inside.

249
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
I know.

250
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,960
Didn't the second master say that Deng Deng is also my daughter?

251
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,960
I know.

252
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
I know.

253
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
I know.

254
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
I know.

255
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,960
I know.

256
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,960
Didn't I say that Deng Deng is also my daughter?

257
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,960
I'll go save her, okay?

258
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
You can rest assured.

259
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Hurry up and take the second master to your house.

260
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,960
Let's go.

261
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,960
Master, my master and master are begging you.

262
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:26,960
Get up.

263
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Hurry up.

264
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Master.

265
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,960
Please go back.

266
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,960
I'll escort you.

267
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,960
Don't worry.

268
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:33,960
How many years have we been together?

269
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,960
Every time it's windy and windy,

270
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
isn't it all over?

271
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Isn't it all safe and sound?

272
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Master.

273
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,960
Let go of me.

274
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,960
Master.

275
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
Enterprise, waking up!

276
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
Please go to your room.

277
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:52,960
My father said I'm too 리들 Hawaiian.

278
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
How could you say so?

279
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:54,960
I am the main host.

280
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
How is it different from being the Week 2 spots man?

281
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,960
My father said my father's promotion for the temporary queen has been lifted.

282
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
Alright, alright...

283
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Forgive me.

284
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,960
See youy

285
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,960
2 days later

286
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,780
The princess

287
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,960
graduated fromной Arabic Academy

288
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,360
the strange place you said?

289
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,000
I've searched the nearby streets.

290
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,240
The formation is not there.

291
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,800
Did we find the wrong place?

292
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,720
Impossible.

293
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,560
The formation must be in the city.

294
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,800
But we haven't found it yet.

295
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:25,960
How about this?

296
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,080
We'll split up and search.

297
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,440
I'll go to the south, you go to the north.

298
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,360
Wait.

299
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,800
Do you feel that

300
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,320
ever since we came here,

301
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,240
it's getting hotter?

302
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,680
I'm not hot.

303
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,120
If you're hot,

304
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,200
take off your clothes.

305
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,320
Molt Dong is waiting for me.

306
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,640
I've been waiting for you.

307
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,160
asse Kyo

308
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,160
update

309
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,480
you

310
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,960
Wait.

311
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,480
I'll do this then.

312
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,480
Gu Beixi.

313
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,040
I'm your sister,

314
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,240
even you don't consider me a woman.

315
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,000
But you

316
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,240
can give me my horizons.

317
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,640
Gu Bei Xi! What are you doing?

318
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,440
Baobao...

319
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,040
No! Gu Bei Xi!

320
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,440
You're moving out again, aren't you?

321
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,240
Control yourself! What are you doing? What's wrong with you?

322
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,440
Baobao...

323
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,640
Baobao, you...

324
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,440
What's wrong with you?

325
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,440
Why am I you?

326
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,840
Why don't you ask me why I'm you?

327
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,040
What's wrong with me?

328
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,840
You were affected by the illusion.

329
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,240
You've had a little illusion.

330
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,640
You just got a little bit of a stroke.

331
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,440
But don't worry. I've already treated you.

332
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,640
Then, did I...?

333
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:56,040
Yes! You just promised me

334
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,240
that you'll give us a thousand grains of grain and 500 jin of pork every year.

335
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
I said no. You insisted on giving me.

336
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,440
You couldn't even stop me.

337
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,640
You want to make up with me again, right?

338
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,640
You've become smarter.

339
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,640
Let's get down to business.

340
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,040
Did you hear anything?

341
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,640
No.

342
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,240
There's a child on a horse, he out to take care.

343
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,400
Why wouldn't you come along?

344
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
taking good care of you.

345
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:36,800
Zhen Yan.

346
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,000
He's pointing my direction.

347
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,320
In the underground palace.

348
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,360
из Messiah,

349
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:14,020
don't herald the arrival of the

350
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,280
Jesus.

351
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,400
Who is she?

352
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
Let's go in.

353
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,400
Go.

354
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Thank you, brother.

355
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
You're welcome.

356
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
It's you.

357
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Yes.

358
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
General saved me.

359
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
I didn't die.

360
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
He saved you once.

361
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,400
I can kill you again.

362
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
I can kill you again.

363
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,400
Killing is a life.

364
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,400
You can take my life at any time.

365
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
But now you are in danger.

366
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,400
There are ghosts everywhere.

367
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
I'm familiar with this place.

368
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
I can take you away.

369
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
Nonsense.

370
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
Wait.

371
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,400
Do it.

372
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,400
Why?

373
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Why?

374
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,400
Why?

375
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,400
Why?

376
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
Wei Du's fault.

377
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,400
I can't prove it.

378
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
I just want you two to go with me.

379
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,400
After leaving the underground palace,

380
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
I'll kill Wei Du

381
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
and avenge your mother.

382
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
I don't need to tell you.

383
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,400
General saved me many times on the battlefield.

384
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
For the sake of you,

385
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,400
I've been living for 3,000 years.

386
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
I've made a huge mistake.

387
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,400
I was born to protect people.

388
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,400
But I'm guilty of killing.

389
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
I'm only a dreamer.

390
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,400
I have no regrets.

391
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
But

392
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,400
I have a kind heart.

393
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
I have a kind heart too.

394
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
You saved me, I saved you.

395
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,400
You are still fighting with Zhurong outside.

396
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,400
If you die,

397
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,400
it's meaningless

398
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,400
to him in the world.

399
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,400
You are a spider

400
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,400
can't escape from the spider web.

401
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Hu Beixi.

402
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
Move ahead.

403
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Miss Yu.

404
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Don't follow me!

405
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,840
Next time I see you,

406
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,560
I will kill you!

407
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,360
The

408
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,360
Zhao's came here before.

409
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,960
I've been here before.

410
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,400
The path is strange.

411
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,600
It's like Hao's house.

412
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,240
But it's not that deep.

413
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,640
The Ghost Bridge?

414
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,840
There are so many strange things here.

415
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,080
You've never seen the ancient books.

416
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,320
You should have heard the stories.

417
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,200
These are the people of the spirit clan.

418
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:24,960
Maybe

419
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,680
there's some kind of

420
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,240
mysterious magic formation here.

421
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,440
But we haven't

422
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,000
found the magic gate yet.

423
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,720
Didn't you have a sense of

424
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,560
the formation you had with the underground palace?

425
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,760
Try again.

426
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,160
You can say what you can.

427
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,920
I don't know what's going on.

428
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,520
Since I came in,

429
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,880
I don't feel anything.

430
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,720
What should we do?

431
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,280
We're famous.

432
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,080
We can't be trapped here

433
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,360
for a year and a half.

434
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,440
I think I should find something to eat.

435
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,320
Just in case.

436
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,880
But this place

437
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,880
is so empty.

438
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,640
I can't even see a rat or a bug.

439
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,720
A bug?

440
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,000
Right.

441
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,200
A bug.

442
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,960
A bug?

443
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,960
What bug?

444
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,480
Follow me.

445
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,160
Hurry.

446
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,400
What are you looking for?

447
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,520
A bug.

448
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,800
Why are you looking for a bug?

449
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,280
I'm so hungry.

450
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,080
Move aside.

451
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,480
There should be a place where it's dark.

452
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,200
Jingzhi, eat this.

453
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,280
I'm not eating it.

454
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,560
What are you talking about?

455
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,080
This firefly

456
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,080
is a spiritual flower

457
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:50,560
of the ancients.

458
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,520
It's very spiritual.

459
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,640
It can be attracted.

460
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,480
Good bug.

461
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,920
Can you tell me

462
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,680
where the eye of illusion is?

463
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,600
I beg you.

464
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,720
Take us to find it.

465
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Save us, okay?

466
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,320
I, Yu Deng Deng,

467
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,120
will help you tenfold.

468
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,400
I'll thank you here.

469
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,440
I'll thank you tenfold.

470
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,720
I'll thank you here.

471
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,520
Gui Xin.

472
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,240
Chong...

473
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,760
Brother Chong, thank you.

474
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,120
Why didn't it fly?

475
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,160
It should be here.

476
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,840
Thank you, Brother Chong.

477
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,360
I'm sorry.

478
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,800
I didn't know you were so beautiful.

479
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,760
I'm sorry.

480
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,640
I'm sorry.

481
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,560
I'm sorry.

482
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,560
I'm sorry.

483
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,360
I'm sorry.

484
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,440
I'm sorry.

485
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,520
I'm sorry.

486
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,680
I'm sorry.

487
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,520
I'm sorry.

488
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,400
I'm sorry.

489
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,640
I'm sorry.

490
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,640
I'm sorry.

491
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,040
I'm sorry.

492
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,080
I'm sorry.

493
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,080
I'm sorry.

494
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,080
I'm sorry.

495
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,080
I'm sorry.

496
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,080
I'm sorry.

497
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,080
I'm sorry.

498
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,080
I'm sorry.

499
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,080
I'm sorry.

500
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,080
I'm sorry.

501
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,080
I'm sorry.

502
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,080
I'm sorry.

503
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:20,080
I'm sorry.

504
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,080
I'm sorry.

505
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,080
I'm sorry.

506
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,080
I'm sorry.

507
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,080
I'm sorry.

508
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,080
I'm sorry.

509
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
I'm sorry.

510
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,080
I'm sorry.

511
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
I'm sorry.

512
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,080
I'm sorry.

513
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,080
I'm sorry.

514
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,080
I'm sorry.

515
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
I'm sorry.

516
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,080
I'm sorry.

517
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,080
I'm sorry.

518
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,080
I'm sorry.

519
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,080
I'm sorry.

520
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,080
I'm sorry.

521
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,080
I'm sorry.

522
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,080
I'm sorry.

523
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,840
Wow, what a miracle!

524
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,520
I feel a lot more delicious than before.

525
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,880
Mingxi!

526
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,880
How can he survive in such a big tree?

527
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,440
Don't come any closer.

528
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,320
He's absorbing the energy.

529
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
Why are you back?

530
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,000
What's wrong?

531
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,840
Don't worry.

532
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,440
The second brother is fine.

533
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,040
It's nothing. It's normal.

534
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,360
People are dying in front of us.

535
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,560
It's true.

536
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,440
The revolution was on the road.

537
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,360
Something happened to that guy.

538
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,440
The road was blocked.

539
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,960
Hurry up.

540
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,640
How about this?

541
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,200
Oli Mountain.

542
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:37,880
Big brother.

543
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,120
We have to save the villagers.

544
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,560
I can delay the time forever.

545
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,240
OK. OK.

546
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:41,800
Let go. Let go.

547
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:42,800
Come on.

548
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,400
This way.

549
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,840
Everyone, come here.

550
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,240
Come here. Let's go.

551
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,320
I understand.

552
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,240
Understand what?

553
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,360
The villagers in Bailuo Village

554
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,520
may have been absorbed by him.

555
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,440
The energy in his body.

556
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,960
That's why he looks so pale.

557
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,880
How can I be fine?

558
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,000
You have my blood on you.

559
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,120
It seems that Zhurong's

560
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,480
illusionary array of eyes

561
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,400
are built on this tree.

562
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,160
Yunxi.

563
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:26,800
Yunxi.

564
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,920
Yunxi.

565
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,040
Yunxi.

566
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,680
Yunxi.

567
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,200
No.

568
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:37,960
Yunxi.

569
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:38,960
No.

570
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,680
Help me.

571
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,960
Yunxi, help me.

572
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,600
Help me. No.

573
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:44,920
Help me.

574
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,480
Help me, Yunxi.

575
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:47,840
Deng Deng.

576
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:48,960
Help me.

577
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:49,800
Deng Deng.

578
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,840
Help me.

579
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,200
Deng Deng, what's wrong?

580
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,120
What's wrong with me?

581
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,080
Why am I holding him?

582
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,040
Why am I crying?

583
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
I'm so scared.

584
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,640
You were staring at him just now.

585
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,760
You couldn't wake him up.

586
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,120
It seems that you have a deep relationship with him.

587
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,160
I saw a woman's face just now.

588
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,240
A woman's face?

589
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,120
Why didn't I see it?

590
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,120
It seems that this is the same

591
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,120
magic that Zhu Rong

592
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,680
changed to confuse us.

593
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:36,360
That's right.

594
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Zhu Rong used this trick to deal with the poison.

595
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,240
We must break this array as soon as possible.

596
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,960
We can't let it harm more people.

597
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,080
The magic of the

598
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,300
magic of the

599
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,680
magic of the

600
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,680
magic of the

601
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,680
magic of the

602
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,680
magic of the

603
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,680
magic of the

604
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,680
magic of the

605
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,680
magic of the

606
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,680
magic of the

607
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,400
magic of the

608
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,960
magic of the

609
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,960
magic of the

610
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,960
magic of the

611
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,960
magic of the

612
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,960
magic of

613
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,960
the magic of

614
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,960
It's okay.

615
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,960
It's okay.

616
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,960
This is bad. We have to leave here quickly.

617
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,960
It's dangerous here.

618
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
Let's go.

619
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,960
It's that Wei Tuo.

620
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,960
This kid's bones are really tough.

621
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,960
He must have been dragged away by that ghost band

622
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,960
until the last moment.

623
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:37,960
Let's go.

624
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
Be careful!

625
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
It's really a ghost.

626
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,960
Catch them!

627
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:29,960
Kill them!

628
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,960
I'll leave these mortals to you.

629
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,960
Wait.

630
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,960
Go!

631
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,960
How could this be?

632
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,960
How could you play like this?

633
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,960
What is this?

634
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,960
Blood pressure.

635
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,960
The most important thing is tacit understanding.

636
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Hide!

637
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,960
Kill them!

638
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,960
Keep going.

639
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,960
I'm so strong.

640
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:38,960
You can be weak and strong.

641
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,960
I'll try again.

642
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,960
No.

643
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,960
If you fight with a master,

644
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,960
you'll easily die.

645
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,960
Blood pressure.

646
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,960
Try again.

647
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,960
No.

648
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,960
If I try again,

649
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,960
he won't be fooled.

650
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,960
Let me think of another way.

651
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,960
Silly kid.

652
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,960
Silly kid.

653
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,960
You're so lazy.

654
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,960
I told you

655
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,960
that you wouldn't learn anything from me.

656
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,960
Are you stupid now?

657
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,960
Dad.

658
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
Uncle Yu.

659
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,960
Why are you here?

660
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,960
If I hadn't come, you two would have died.

661
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,960
Girl,

662
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,960
it's better to come sooner than later.

663
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,960
Stretch out your hands.

664
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,960
Stretch out.

665
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,960
Hurry up.

666
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,960
One for each person.

667
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,960
East, west, south, north.

668
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,960
One for each person.

669
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
Leave the red pearl to dad.

670
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,960
One for each person.

671
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,960
East, west, south, north.

672
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:55,960
One for each person.

673
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,960
East, west, south, north.

674
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,960
One for each person.

675
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,960
East, west, south, north.

676
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,960
One for each person.

677
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,960
East, west, south, north.

678
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,960
One for each person.

679
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,960
East, west, south, north.

680
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:07,960
One for each person.

681
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,960
East, west, south, north.

682
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,960
One for each person.

683
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
East, west, south, north.

684
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,960
One for each person.

685
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,960
East, west, south, north.

686
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,960
One for each person.

687
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
East, west, south, north.

688
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
One for each person.

689
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,960
East, west, south, north.

690
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,960
One for each person.

691
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,960
Wei Du.

692
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,760
Love can be touched

693
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,840
Missing you will be heard

694
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:05,160
The most beautiful scenery in life

695
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:11,360
All about you

696
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,560
When two hearts are so close

697
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,840
When the whole world is occupied by you

698
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,640
I will call you hard to find you

699
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,680
Until your memory

700
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:34,760
You are the only one

701
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:41,400
Walk into the scenery

702
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,240
This city is full of rain and rain

703
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,800
Although separated from love

704
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,080
I find a lot of suits

705
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:56,440
Hello you do

706
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,240
I'm sorry.

707
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,240
I'm sorry.

708
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
I'm sorry.

709
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,240
I'm sorry.

710
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,240
I'm sorry.

711
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,240
I'm sorry.

712
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,240
I'm sorry.

713
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,240
I'm sorry.

714
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,240
I'm sorry.

715
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,240
I'm sorry.

716
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,240
I'm sorry.

717
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
I'm sorry.

718
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,240
I'm sorry.

719
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,240
I'm sorry.

720
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,240
I'm sorry.

721
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,240
I'm sorry.

722
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,240
I'm sorry.

723
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,240
I'm sorry.

724
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,240
I'm sorry.

725
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,240
I'm sorry.

726
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,240
I'm sorry.

727
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,240
I'm sorry.

728
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:38,240
I'm sorry.

729
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,240
I'm sorry.

730
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,240
I'm sorry.

731
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,240
I'm sorry.

732
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,240
I'm sorry.

733
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,240
I'm sorry.

734
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,240
I'm sorry.

735
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,240
I'm sorry.

736
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,240
I'm sorry.

737
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,240
I'm sorry.

738
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,240
I'm sorry.

739
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,240
I'm sorry.

740
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,240
I'm sorry.

741
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,240
I'm sorry.

742
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,240
I'm sorry.

743
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,240
I'm sorry.

744
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,240
I'm sorry.

745
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,240
I'm sorry.

746
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,240
I'm sorry.

747
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,240
I'm sorry.

748
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,240
I'm sorry.

749
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,240
I'm sorry.

750
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,240
I'm sorry.

751
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,240
I'm sorry.

752
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,240
I'm sorry.

753
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,240

I'm sorry.

757
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,240
I'm sorry.

758
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,240
I'm sorry.

759
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,240
I'm sorry.

760
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,240
I'm sorry.

761
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,240
I'm sorry.

762
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,240
I'm sorry.

763
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,240
I'm sorry.

764
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,240
I'm sorry.

765
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,240
I'm sorry.

766
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,240
I'm sorry.

767
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,240
I'm sorry.

768
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:18,240
I'm sorry.
