That spirit clan

61
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,350
sucked away his consciousness and essence

62
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:43,930
and poisoned him.

63
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,290

I've been so busy that I forgot to pick it up.

81

So wedding clothes and waist towels

82
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,950
sucked our essence

83

But why?

85
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,720
Just because they wore Mr. Bu's little ornaments,

86
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,870
they became monsters?

But I don't feel it at all.

97

This hairpin

98

344
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,020
It is special.

345
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:36,840
Mr. Bu, Mr. Bu, Mr. Bu.

346
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,730
Mr. Bu is so handsome. Mr. Bu.

347
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,700
Mr. Bu.

348
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,150
Mr. Bu. Welcomes to

349
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:44,790
my new products launch conference.

350
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,550
I...

351
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:52,180
I used to weave a robe

352
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,350
for the emperor in the weaving workshop in the capital.

353
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,750
But in the eyes of those laymen,

354
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,380
they only saw formats

355
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,650
and rules.

356
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,220
I've sworn ever since

357
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:07,270
that one day

358
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,140
I want the world to

359
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,970
marvel at the clothes I made.

360
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:15,240
You're lucky

361
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,150
to witness this miracle.

362
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,770
Mr. Bu, Mr. Bu, Mr. Bu.

363
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,030
What's wrong? What's wrong?

364
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,000
Mr. Bu, Mr. Bu.

365
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:36,420
Mr. Bu, Mr. Bu.

366
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:47,850
What's going on? What's wrong with Mr. Bu?

367
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,540
What's going on? It's scary, Yeah.

368
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,360
This is the spirit monster

369
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,870
who turned Dengdeng into this.

370
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,470
I'll let him have it.

371
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,770
Don't make trouble here.

372
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,340
He is a spirit clan.

373
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,780
Go, go, go.

374
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,860
Clear the field and let people get out of here.

375
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,900
Yeah, right.

376
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,880
Watch your steps.

377
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:50,890
Be safe.

378
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:51,680
Don't mess around, everyone.

379
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,190
Be safe.

380
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,100
Go out in an orderly manner.

381
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,260
Are you all right?

382
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,410
Come here.

383
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,680
Hurry. Move towards that side.

384
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,570
Calm.

385
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,980
Everybody calms down.

386
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,100
Mr. Ya.

387
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,670
Mr. Ya.

388
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:09,940
-Mr. Ya.
-Dengdeng.

389
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,050
Why are you here?

390
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,340
Mr. Bu invited me to photograph here.

391
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,470
I didn't expect...

392
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,180
He...

393
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,080
Let me walk you out of here.

394
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:16,590
Come on.

395
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:17,670
My camera.

396
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,590
Forget it under the circumstance.

397
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,660
-My camera.
-Mr. Ya.

398
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,050
Be careful. Careful.

399
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,090
Slowly. Take your pace.

400
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,060
Slowly.

401
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,790
When did it drop?

402
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,670
Why do you have it?

403
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,930
It protects you from dying.

404
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,560
Keep it.

405
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,620
Alright.

406
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,410
I promise I won't drop it again.

407
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:46,670
Are you alright?

408
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:05,070
Stay away from me.

409
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:06,140
Xin. Chang.

410
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,410
Stay away from me.

411
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,020
Stay away from me.

412
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,630
How come the chrysalis so tight?

413
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,870
Tear it down quickly!

414
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,480
We can't let go of the monster.

415
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,380
It is injured.

416
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,420
It won't go far.

417
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,970
Close your eyes.

418
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,610
Why would I?

419
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,880
You are so close to me.

420
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:45,570
You can see my wrinkles now.

421
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:47,890
The closer, the harder to tell. Alright?

422
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,980
What are you thinking about?

423
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:08,560
Nothing.

424
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,850
Are you taking advantage of me?

425
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,980
Why are you so close to me?

426
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,280
I'm not.

427
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,790
And I can't move, okay?

428
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,690
You are on purpose.

429
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,300
How come I am on purpose?

430
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,420
But I like it.

431
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,070
Alright. Stop it.

432
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,750
Try to figure out ways to get out.

433
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,820
But how can we?

434
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:35,650
I got it.

435
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:38,550
My dad used to talk nonsense while drinking.

436
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,500
He said I have a vigorous Eight Characters.

437
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:41,580
My blood can hurt

438
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:42,820
those weird creatures.

439
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,820
Since spiritual clan do exist,

440
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,950
his words may be true.

441
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,900
Use my blood.

442
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,110
Maybe we can make the dead horse move.

443
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,840
Have you heard them talking?

444
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,720
I think it is

445
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:54,690
blood.

446
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,810
Blood.

447
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,650
Can they be expelled by blood?

448
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,390
Gu Beixi, what do you want? Stay put.

449
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,340
Thanks to my black dog blood.

450
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,830
You killed the big black dog in Qingquan Stronghold?

451
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,000
That's my brother who has saved my life.

452
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:11,930
Don't bother.

453
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,530
The dog blood won't do anything to spirit clan.

454
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,860
Then what will do?

455
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,380
Just stay put.

456
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:18,650
Let me deal with it.

457
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,520
What are you doing?

458
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,630
You said you would deal with it.

459
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,130
What I mean is...

460
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,060
Alright. Stop it.

461
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:29,180
Turn around and close your eyes.

462
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:31,540
Hurry up.

463
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,060
It's so torturing

464
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,450
to be stuck with the two guys.

465
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,660
Chief Gu,

466
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,300
I don't want to be trapped with you either.

467
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,790
You are still there

468
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,630
-If Mr. Lu haven't saved you.
-True.

469
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:23,980
Say it.

470
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,100
What trick are you playing this time?

471
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,320
Is it so hard to say thank you?

472
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,110
Why should I thank him?

473
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,190
Haven't you seen that the monster

474
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,850
was afraid of him?

475
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,650
Call himself a spirit-hunter.

476
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,190
Do you believe it?

477
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,960
I do.

478
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,370
He is more brilliant than you.

479
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,660
I believe his every single word.

480
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,640
Listen, manner yourself

481
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,780
from now on.

482
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,370
Don't sow discord between me and my husband.

483
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,250
Alright. Alright.

484
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,730
If we can't catch the culprit,

485
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,380
she will die tonight.

486
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:58,920
What?

487
00:25:59,140 --> 00:25:59,940
What are you looking at?

488
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,020
You are pretty.

489
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,290
I know I'm beautiful.

490
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,820
I won't buy it.

491
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,710
I'm telling you. Five hundred silver dollars

492
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:09,970
for saving your life.

493
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,580
What an emergency now.

494
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,860
Forget about the money.

495
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:35,210
You did it, huh?

496
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,250
I will kill you.

497
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,000
Calm down.

498
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,260
Killing him directly

499
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,180
lets him off lightly.

500
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,560
You can destroy me.

501
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,870
But you can't destroy my taste

502
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,620
and pursuit.

503
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,070
Does your taste and pursuit

504
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,360
mean killing others?

505
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:53,480
Killing?

506
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,370
What do you mean?

507
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,880
Do I kill people

508
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:02,450
by helping them lose weight?

509
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,570
Make it clear.

510
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,870
What do you mean by losing weight?

511
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,300
Your clothes and belts.

512
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,350
Aren't they extracting people's essence?

513
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,920
Am I idle?

514
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,230
Every clothe and jewelry I made

515
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,860
contains my heart and hard work.

516
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,380
They carry my energy.

517
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,100
They do extract something,

518
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,750
but not essence.

519
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:47,380
They extract fat.

520
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,890
What are you doing with fat?

521
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:54,470
I don't want them at all.

522
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,090
I want beauty.

523
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,690
Those fat people

524
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,260
can't bring out the beauty of my clothes.

525
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,120
I'm doing them a favor by that.

526
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,550
Save the crap.

527
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,340
How can you prove your words?

528
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:15,250
You can check everything at any time.

529
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,900
I've sold so many clothes

530
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,620
without hurting anyone.

531
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,920
If I told lies,

532
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,960
it's easy for General Yan

533
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:33,800
to kill me.

534
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,170
We will confirm

535
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,570
your words one by one.

536
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:40,850
Come to get me

537
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,610
if I faked anything.

538
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:47,040
My shop,

539
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,360
silkworm estate

540
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,480
and everything I own are here.

541
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,270
I won't leave.

542
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,720
Xin. Chang.

543
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,140
Search around

544
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,480
to see if there is anything harmful.

545
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,190
-Okay.
-Okay.

546
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,550
Let me help.

547
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:08,670
Let's split.

548
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:19,850
Why did you show yourself

549
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,200
in front of those people?

550
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,470
I didn't want to.

551
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:29,820
But there was a flashlight

552
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,050
which made me dizzy.

553
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,880
Isn't it Mr. Ya's camera?

554
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,200
Camera.

555
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,940
It must be the camera.

556
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:22,730
Mr. Ya.

557
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,490
Let me walk you out of here. Come on.

558
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,910
My camera.

559
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,990
Forget it under the circumstance.

560
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,120
Girl. Careful.

561
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,790
He is not Mr. Ya.

562
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,200
He is a spirit clan who dresses as Mr. Ya.

563
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,700
Are you okay?

564
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,760
Have a pain in the chest.

565
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,050
I feel like dying,

566
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,250
like the last time.

569
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:05,470
Why not

570
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,500
go to search the photo studio?

571
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,300
Dengdeng.

572
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,010
Why are you looking at me like this?

573

[Presented by Ms. Yang of Pinghai Town]

574

[Gracious and Artless]

575
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,930
The spirit clan must have been

576
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,300
in the studio for a while.

577
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,130
Search carefully.

578
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,390
-Alright.
-Alright.

579
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,100
Sir,

580
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,370
you can check her situation

581
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,290
if you are worried.

582
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,390
No need.

583
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,900
Find the spirit clan

584
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,350
and deal with him soon.

585
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,960
You'll be alright.

586
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,230
Your hair will turn black

587
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,670
after we catch the monster. Don't be afraid.

588
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,710
Afraid?

589
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,540
I just didn't expect

590
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:42,920
that I would look so pretty

591
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,930
when I am old.

592
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,900
You are pretty.

593
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,320
Seriously.

594
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,650
You are very pretty.

595
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,780
I've known you since little.

596
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,290
You were like a boy.

597
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,380
A naughty bully.

598
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:01,470
You grow up

599
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,150
and finally become

600
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,130
a pretty girl.

601
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,960
The strength is too much.

602
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,200
I can't protect you by your side.

603
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,480
Though your hair turns white now,

604
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,660
you look fragile and beautiful.

605
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,300
I don't think there is any problem

606
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,110
with your white hair.

607
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,600
Who cares what do you think?

608
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,050
I just care about

609
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,760
Lu Yan's feeling

610
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,490
if I have to be ugly like this.

611
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,900
Why do you mention him all the time?

612
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,730
If you are afraid to be single,

613
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:36,510
divorce with him and marry me.

614
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,860
What?

615
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:47,160
Finally I know

616
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,320
what you are up to.

617
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,700
Finally. You know.

618
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,370
What do you think?

619
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,190
Since your father's time,

620
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:57,430
your family have been trying to annex our stronghold.

621
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,210
Now you

622
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,230
still have the shameful idea.

623
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,330
I'm telling you.

624
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:04,140
No way as long as I'm alive.

625
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,850
Go find yourself other methods.

626
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,440
Chief.

627
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:11,530
We've found something.

628
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,190
Come over here.

629
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,070
Alright.

630
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,340
We found it.

631
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,360
You...

632
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:21,760
Sir.

633
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,630
Check these

634
00:34:31,889 --> 00:34:33,520
photos of people from Beigou Stronghold.

635
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:36,080
Those poisoned old men are all here.

636
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,070
The same number.

637
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,840
Those are homeless beggars in the town.

638
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:42,100
Qingquan stronghold used to give them help.

639
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,420
So I recognize them.

640
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,300
But these kids

641
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,150
have gone missing over a month.

642
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,670
Sir, check this.

643
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,460
This is your wedding photo.

644
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,340
I got it.

645
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,389
It's said there is

646
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,380
a kind of spirit clan that can produce subtle and invisible toxin.

647
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,180
He must have released the toxin

648
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,580
when he took photos.

649
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,420
With the toxin,

650
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,820
he extracts energy from the poisoned

651
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,040
to himself.

652
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,950
It didn't hurt chief so bad

653
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,160
probably because of her special constitution.

654
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,480
Is it that powerful?

655
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:10,830
Human may don't understand.

656
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,700
But it doesn't mean the power of spiritclan is not exist.

657
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,550
Then why is he alright?

658
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:16,710
He didn't take me clearly.

659
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:19,570
Oh really? Only you, what a coincidence.

660
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:20,540
Shut up.

661
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:25,990
Then why would he do harm to Mr. Bu

662
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,260
when they are both spirit clan?

663
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,220
To stir trouble between us

664
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:32,810
and seize the chance to attack you.

665
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:36,570
You said

666
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,950
he dresses as Mr. Ya.

667
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,740
Then the real Mr. Ya...

668
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:44,210
Mr. Ya.

669
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,630
I'm afraid...

670
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,020
No way.

671
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,500
Let's find him right away.

672
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,970
Maybe we can save him.

673
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,900
Hurry. Let's go.

674
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:54,880
Hurry.

675
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,420
Dengdeng.

676
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,600
Are you alright?

677
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,420
Hurry.

678
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,620
Come on.

679
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,860
I'm alright.

680
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:07,210
You...

681
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,170
What's wrong?

682
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:16,590
I get older.

683
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:19,990
Dengdeng.

684
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,140
Do not worry.

685
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:22,670
I'll ask my guys to search right now.

686
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,400
I must find the spirit clan monster for you.

687
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,730
It's too late.

688
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,260
It takes at least two hours to go downhill.

689
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:30,470
But we can't stay here waiting for death.

690
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:39,120
Sir, our spy has sent a message.

691
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,020
The injured spirit clan

692
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,450
has run to the southern side of the town.

693
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,640
Be careful.

694
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,940
Don't follow me.

695
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,260
Search.

696
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,620
There is energy of the spirit clan in the front hall.

697
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,300
Mr. Lu asks me to protect you.

698
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,640
I don't need your protection.

699
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:10,300
The more people search, the more clues we can get.

700
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:11,260
Go to search.

701
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:18,190
Hurry. Go.

702
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:18,980
Alright.

703
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,320
You guys. Over here.

704
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:24,050
Hurry.

705
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,440
These...

706
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:35,880
These are...

707
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,770
By the size of skulls

708
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,220
and the length of shanks,

709
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,540
these must be some teenagers.

710
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,380
Those beggars.

711
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,290
Careful.

712
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:08,250
This is Mr. Ya's gown,

713
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,160
which my dad gave him

714
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,670
as a present at his fiftieth birthday.

715
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,780
I'm pretty sure.

716
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,960
It seems we have found

717
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,040
his base of killing people.

718
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,830
Finally we find the bastard's base.

719
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,510
There is no fluctuation of energy at all

720
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,050
in the neighborhood.

721
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:30,730
It seems he has left.

722
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,010
Sir, let's find him.

723
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,090
That's right.

724
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,410
We have to catch him.

725
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,690
I'm alright.

726
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,590
Let's have a rest here.

727
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:46,920
Xin. Come over here.

728
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,860
Dengdeng.

729
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:08,990
Dengdeng.

730
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,280
Why are you guys so nervous?

731
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:17,580
I may look terrible.

732
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,800
But I still have my strength

733
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:21,980
and can still use Kungfu.

734
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:23,700
I'm telling you,

735
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,620
later,

736
00:39:26,050 --> 00:39:28,160
I will catch the monster

737
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:32,290
and show you grasping fist.

738
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,850
Just check out.

739
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:39,810
Stop talking.

740
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,910
How can you make jokes at the circumstance?

741
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,550
Nonsense.

742
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,260
When did that happen?

743
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,380
Not long ago.

744
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,250
And you still pretend to be okay?

745
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,240
I suppose

746
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,040
those chiefs are quite dying like me.

747
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,020
Lu Yan.

748
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,390
You knew I would rot and die

749
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,050
from the beginning,

750
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,050
right?
