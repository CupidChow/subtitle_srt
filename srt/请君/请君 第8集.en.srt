1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,979
Sorry to keep you wait.

3
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,130
It's for you.

4
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,280
What is it?

5
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,039
Brown sugar glutinous rice cake.

6
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:49,039
I don't want it.

7
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,000
You don't have appetite now?

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,680
Alright. Then I'll just put it

9
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,880
in my arms

10
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,220
to keep it warm.

11
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,020
You can eat it when you want to.

12
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,400
Sir,

13
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,600
the full moon will disappear very soon.

14
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,160
Ying Dragon ashes have been used up.

15
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,490
This is our only chance.

16
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,880
Let's go somewhere else.

17
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,240
Alright. Where do you want to go?

18
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,400
That way.

19
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,560
Alright.

20
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,320
So many fireflies.

21
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,360
Why can we see them in the season?

22
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,460
Is this the surprise you prepared for me?

23
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,890
I have never seen

24
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,400
so many fireflies.

25
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,880
The elderly says

26
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,160
the place where fireflies occur in group

27
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,600
will be visited by gods.

28
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:22,960
It seems

29
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,120
god gives me the special gift

30
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,720
for praising me

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,640
to be a nice person.

32
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,320
Do you have any wish unrealized?

33
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,760
You have realized my wish.

34
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,260
Now my biggest wish

35
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,640
is that you can get

36
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,200
whatever you want.

37
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,040
Lu Yan. Come and make a wish.

38
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,480
Where are the fireflies?

39
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm sorry.

40
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,880
But I have to.

41
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,080
Lu Yan is not an ordinary people.

42
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,120
He is a spirit clansman.

43
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,720
I will marry him even if he is a spirit clansman.

44
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,000
I love the handsome way

45
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,960
you fighting those wild men.

46
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,160
I forgot to be afraid.

47
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,640
My eyes were fixed on you.

48
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,210
It's for you.

49
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,640
Protect you from the evil.

50
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,280
Wear it.

51
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,760
Trust me.

52
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,320
I won't let anyone hurt you

53
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,280
with my presence.

54
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,200
Lu Yan.

55
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,120
Why do you treat me so good?

56
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,800
You only know

57
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,040
my blood can beat spirit clan.

58
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,760
But I forgot my dad has also told me

59
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:55,960
that it can destroy all formations.

60
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,210
Bones of Ying Dragon

61
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,560
can be used that way.

62
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,320
It is also the reason

63
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,640
that you were willing to stay at Qingquan Stronghold.

64
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,800
So

65
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,440
What Gu Beixi said are all true.

66
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,080
I treat you so well.

67
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,000
Why do you want to kill me?

68
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,200
I can accept

69
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,880
even if you are a spirit clansman.

70
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,640
But you want me dead.

71
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,520
Why do you do that?

72
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,520
I give you the last chance.

73
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,200
Give me a reason

74
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Just say it.

75
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,560
I can believe you if you say so.

76
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,000
Say it!

77
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
Say something!

78
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,290
Why don't you say it?

79
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,640
Say it.

80
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,260
Since you won't say it,

81
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,760
I have no choice.

82
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,320
Leave Qingquan Town.

83
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,040
You and I will never meet each other again.

84
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,120
Sir.

85
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,720
How did that happen?

86
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,040
Master was transformed from a golden crow

87
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,240
and her blood can destroy formations.

88
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,170
But why Yu Dengdeng's blood can...

89
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,840
Could she be transformed

90
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,100
from master's spirit?

91
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,720
Could

92
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,920
she be Yun Xi?

93
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,160
Dengdeng.

94
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,880
Boss.

95
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,840
Boss.

96
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:44,600
Boss.

97
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,120
How come I was here? Where is Yu Dengdeng?

98
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,880
Is she alright?

99
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,040
She is alright. She is alright.

100
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,520
She brought us back.

101
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,680
Then what about the spirit clan?

102
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,720
Boss.

103
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,240
The master has told us

104
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,760
that we can't afford to offend the monster.

105
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,920
After all, it's about Qingquan Stronghold

106
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,040
and Yu Dengdeng.

107
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,400
None of our business.

108
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,960
Her business is mine.

109
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,240
Boss! Boss! Boss!

110
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,280
I'll go. I'll go.

111
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,880
How is she?

112
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,240
-Still refuse to eat?
-No eating.

113
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,360
She doesn't eat at all.

114
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,080
Whatever I say, she won't eat. What should we do?

115
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,400
What's your meaning of living?

116
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,930
You can't even make her eat.

117
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,420
I'll deliver it again.

118
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,200
Dengdeng.

119
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,720
Dengdeng.

120
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,480
What brings you here?

121
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,280
Where is Dengdeng?

122
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,040
Upstairs.

123
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,360
Since she came back yesterday, she refuses to see anyone.

124
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,560
She doesn't even eat.

125
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,400
Dengdeng is proud, you know it.

126
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,480
Do you think she will see you if you intrude?

127
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,440
Lu Yan. Again.

128
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,020
I shall teach him a lesson.

129
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,540
Boss.. Boss...

130
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,920
Every...everyone knows it.

131
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,600
Is it?

132
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,880
They say keep a bad thing in your house.

133
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,940
Isn't it bullying?

134
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,600
One came back, the other didn't.

135
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,400
This Lu guy

136
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,410
must have cheated on our Dengdeng.

137
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,840
It's not the case.

138
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,160
I'll kill him.

139
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,960
Don't. Don't. Don't.

140
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,120
Second-in-command.

141
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,520
Even knives and guns can't hurt him.

142
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,640
What can you do?

143
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,840
I... I'll get my weapon.

144
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,600
No. No. No.

145
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,680
You stay, too.

146
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,680
Who can guard Miss Yu if you don't?

147
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,520
Then what should we do?

148
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,880
Our leader is going to take care of this.

149
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,480
You guys take care of Miss Yu.

150
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,980
-See ya.
-I mean...

151
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,320
I...

152
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,160
Boss!

153
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,840
Boss!

154
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:38,010
Boss! I did a good thing for you.

155
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,940
What did you do?

156
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,560
I criticized Lu Yan

157
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,480
in front of Second-in-command.

158
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,420
Now he can't compete with you.

159
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,440
Save the useless.

160
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,440
We men just need to fight.

161
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,720
In Dengdeng's family,

162
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,320
Paralyzed Yu is father and Second-in-command the mother.

163
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Maybe his words can work

164
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,160
for the relationship thing.

165
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

166
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,360
It's your best opportunity now.

167
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,040
Let Yu Dengdeng forget Lu Yan soon.

168
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,770
Make her know

169
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,640
you are the one

170
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,400
who loves her the most in the world.

171
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,440
Seize the chance

172
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,210
and you can get Yu Dengdeng.

173
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,760
I can't think too far.

174
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,240
She is upset and doesn't eat and rest well.

175
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,280
I feel bitter.

176
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,660
My heart aches for her.

177
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:15,960
All I'm thinking about now

178
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,020
is I wish her happy.

179
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,930
Other things don't matter.

180
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,960
Boss. What you said

181
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,480
is so touching that ghosts and gods would cry.

182
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,600
If you can be smart like this

183
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,960
in front of Yu Dengdeng,

184
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,980
how could you end up like this?

185
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,560
Anyway. Seize the chance.

186
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,560
Seize the chance.

187
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,120
And then take the credit.

188
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,040
I'm good at taking the credit.

189
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,040
I've summarized.

190
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
I... I... I... I have summarized...

191
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:41,680
Hurry.

192
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:44,800
Get in.

193
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,860
Come over here.

194
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,480
Hurry.

195
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,480
May I ask

196
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,960
what you need me to do?

197
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,960
Our shop has given the protection fee

198
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,640
as your request this month.

199
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,600
It's not about money.

200
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,040
I heard your shop

201
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,320
has rented some sedans from Xin's Sedan Chair Company.

202
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,050
Is that true?

203
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,040
Yes.

204
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,480
For all these years,

205
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,400
anyone in our company who needs to

206
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,700
have a business travel or wedding

207
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,180
will rent sedan from them.

208
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,610
Return them.

209
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,040
And inform everyone you know.

210
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,560
Do not involve with people

211
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,900
from Xin's Sedan Chair Company anymore.

212
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,120
Or you have to leave Qingquan Town.

213
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,280
Yes. Yes. Yes.

214
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,480
Come back.

215
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,600
Find some drum singers

216
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,480
for me.

217
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,320
Sir.

218
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,440
Sir.

219
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,600
Do you have any thoughts

220
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,200
on what happened yesterday?

221
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,000
Only the blood of saintess

222
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,040
can destroy my spirit-extraction formation

223
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,200
in the world.

224
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:27,880
Maybe

225
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,050
we had a wrong judgement on the direction.

226
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,280
So Yu Dengdeng is probably

227
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,360
my master.

228
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,320
We have to

229
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,570
further confirm the guess.

230
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,360
Xin.

231
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,720
Research Yu Dengdeng

232
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,380
about her childhood stories.

233
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,320
If she really is the Golden Crow Saintess,

234
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,650
some clues will be left.

235
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,760
Chang.

236
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,200
Sir.

237
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,680
Find where is Paralyzed Yu.

238
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,840
I'll go now.

239
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,680
Shopkeeper. Something wrong.

240
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,599
Customers all come back and return our sedans.

241
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,520
They quit renting.

242
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,119
Even our loyal customer Mr. Meng

243
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,960
has sent people to return sedans.

244
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,599
Why?

245
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,010
Do the sedans have low quality?

246
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,880
Are they forced by Qingquan Stronghold?

247
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,540
No. It's Nanfeng Stronghold.

248
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,240
Nanfeng Stronghold?

249
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,140
Tell the customers

250
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,200
to rent our sedans as their wishes.

251
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,920
If Nanfeng Stronghold dares to make trouble again,

252
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,319
we will force them out.

253
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,840
Xin.

254
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,160
Business matters less.

255
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,000
Go to the front and comfort them.

256
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,640
Alright.

257
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,480
Sir,

258
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,600
why Nanfeng Stronghold picks on us

259
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,530
for our conflict with Yu Dengdeng?

260
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,500
What does Gu Beixi think he is?

261
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,580
I made mistakes first.

262
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,880
No more conflicts.

263
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,240
It's your turn.

264
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,120
Go research the woman by Lu Yan's side.

265
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,600
See who on earth she is.

266
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,160
Master.

267
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:31,960
Master.

268
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,840
Master. I put the dishes

269
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,080
in front of your door.

270
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,610
Don't forget to eat.

271
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,800
What can we do now?

272
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,080
Is she making no sound?

273
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:56,760
No.

274
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,080
Chief can't commit suicide, right?

275
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,600
Go away. Stop the nonsense.

276
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,080
Nonsense.

277
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:03,920
My master only kills her enemy

278
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,760
without hurting herself facing the trouble.

279
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,820
You don't know her.

280
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,680
She has come back over two days

281
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,200
and hasn't come out of her room.

282
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,840
I mean.

283
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,240
The guy

284
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,040
hasn't come back, right?

285
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,410
They had a fight.

286
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:16,840
I guess Aunt Lu

287
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,760
really pisses master off this time.

288
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,400
I've never seen master like this

289
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,200
when she fought with her father.

290
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,400
On his arrival,

291
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,120
I can tell his face is not kind.

292
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,200
He is a disaster which disappoints everyone.

293
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,360
A disaster. Truly.

294
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,280
Dahai,

295
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,360
then what on earth Aunt Lu

296
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,560
did to Chief?

297
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,320
Go away. Go away. Ask less.

298
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,000
-Second-in-command.
-I...I...mean...mean...

299
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,160
Second-in-command.

300
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,360
Second-in-command.

301
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,890
People from Yanhuo Stronghold ask to see you.

302
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,280
Why do they come here now?

303
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,530
Come on. Come on.

304
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,440
Dahai,

305
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,640
why not tryi to knock at the door again?

306
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,400
In case Chief has something wrong.

307
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
-Yeah. That's right.
-Right.

308
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,360
Right?

309
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,640
Go. Go. Go.

310
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,040
Chief. Chief.

311
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,320
She's out.

312
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,800
She's out. Chief.

313
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,200
Master.

314
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,400
Chief. Come on. Come on. Have some food.

315
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,560
Why are you gathering here in the early morning?

316
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,520
Nothing keeps you busy in the stronghold?

317
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,050
Can't you let me sleep well?

318
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,900
Master. You...you...

319
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,050
Are you alright?

320
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:14,960
Surely I am.

321
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,130
What can hurt me?

322
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,920
Pork liver. Spiced pork intestines. Rabbit heads.

323
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,980
What are you doing?

324
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,400
You don't live your life and set an altar for me, right?

325
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,160
How many times have I told you?

326
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Our Qingquan Stronghold hasn't achieved poverty alienation yet.

327
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,840
Even I can't live an extravagant life.

328
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,760
Yes. Yes. Yes.

329
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,640
Let's eat them together.

330
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,600
Only for this time.

331
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,560
-Let's eat it together. Eat it.
-Eat it together.

332
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,490
Come on. Come on.

333
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,240
That's mine. Mine.

334
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,520
My rabbit head. Rabbit head.

335
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,600
Everything alright in the stronghold

336
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,130
recently when I took a rest?

337
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:45,840
Yeah.

338
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,320
Nobody makes trouble here?

339
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,250
Absolutely not.

340
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,240
Nobody makes immoral fortune?

341
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,960
How can we do that? Right?

342
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,440
Come on. Let's check.

343
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,880
-Come on. Let's go.
-Come on.

344
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,280
Master, are you alright?

345
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,080
Alright?

346
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,600
What is that for?

347
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,000
I mean. We are afraid you get upset

348
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,440
seeing Gongbao Garden. So...so...

349
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,960
Then why are you choosing two beautiful women?

350
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,640
Why not hanging the picture of two beautiful men?

351
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,500
Men get in the way of your success.

352
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,800
This...This...This...

353
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,650
It's for you.

354
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,520
For me?

355
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,520
Protect you from the evil.

356
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,160
Wear it.

357
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,450
Hold on. Don't move.

358
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,600
Something wrong with the dress.

359
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,120
I'm sorry.

360
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,960
But I have to do it.

361
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,280
Master.

362
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,640
Chief.

363
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,240
Master, I'll arrange people

364
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,440
to renovate every place

365
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,160
where the guy has lived

366
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,840
and make it no signs

367
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,650
of him later. Will that be okay?

368
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,960
-Right. Right. Right.
-That's right. That's right.

369
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,490
Why are you guys so nervous?

370
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,160
Renovating the house

371
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,880
costs money which we live on.

372
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,640
I mean...We're afraid

373
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:16,840
you get mad because of an outsider.

374
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,570
It's not worthy if you get hurt.

375
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,940
-For him?
-Yeah. Yeah.

376
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,240
He is nothing to me.

377
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,440
He is less important than Big Black.

378
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,720
Getting upset for him

379
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,600
is not worthy.

380
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,680
Right. Not worthy.

381
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,000
That's right. It's not worthy.

382
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,130
The old saying goes,

383
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,680
the reason why the ship goes

384
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,680
and the horse runs is the tolerance.

385
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,160
What are these?

386
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,840
Those are left by Lu.

387
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,040
Some food and clothes.

388
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,440
Exquisite thi...things...

389
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,000
I'll ask people to burn these down.

390
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,680
Do not.

391
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,400
Sell them

392
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,140
and save the money.

393
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,800
I'll go down the mountain

394
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,130
and buy myself some fun.

395
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,960
That's right.

396
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:50,720
Also,

397
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,440
tear down

398
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,240
the stupid sedan of him.

399
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,240
Tear it. Tear it. Tear it.

400
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,400
We'll do it right now as long as it makes you happy.

401
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:56,960
We must tear it down.

402
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,640
Chief.

403
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,840
The Second-in-command wants you to come over.

404
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,300
He says he needs to see you.

405
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,040
It's time to go there.

406
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,640
Yanhuo Stronghold is a small stronghold,

407
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,240
behind eighteen mountains.

408
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,360
There are few people and little money.

409
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,220
Last year, their chieftain took over the farmland.

410
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,080
Then he was beaten by you.

411
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,400
Now that he's recovered, he's trying to flatter us.

412
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,360
They need to transport stones to expand their place.

413
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,240
They are passing through our place.

414
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,520
So they want to ask for permission.

415
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,280
No way.

416
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,480
Yanhuo Stronghold is

417
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,520
behind the hill of Nanfeng Stronghold.

418
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,600
If it can grow big,

419
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,880
Nanfeng Stronghold should be afraid of it.

420
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,600
If we do them a favor, we can also make some money from them.

421
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,730
Why don't you agree?

422
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
Yeah, why not?

423
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,480
There's nothing else.

424
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,810
But the name is not good.

425
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,250
Yanhuo Stronghold.

426
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,640
Anyone with this word fire in their name,

427
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,970
must be not good people.

428
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,560
Yes.

429
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,610
Master is right.

430
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,760
This word is disgusting.

431
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,880
I'm sick of hearing it.

432
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,000
Yes, disgusting.

433
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,130
Disgusting!

434
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,730
We're all sensible people.

435
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,820
Then it's settled.

436
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,040
And…

437
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,840
When I beat up their chieftain last year,

438
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,970
he called me a sissy.

439
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
I hate it when people call me a sissy.

440
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,840
It's never too late for a gentleman to take revenge.

441
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,360
Dahai.

442
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,440
Tomorrow, I'll gather a few dozen brothers.

443
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,320
Take down this stronghold

444
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,400
that doesn't even know how to name itself.

445
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:08,840
Good!

446
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,040
Chief, you can't do anything wrong!

447
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,820
I think you're doing this for the people.

448
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,680
Just think...

449
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,480
Yanhuo Stronghold is at the bottom of the mountain of Nanfeng Stronghold.

450
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,040
They're like fence-sitters going back and forth.

451
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,200
Maybe one day Gu Beixi

452
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,240
will incorporate them.

453
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,970
That won't be good for us in Qingquan Stronghold.

454
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:26,800
That's right.

455
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,480
Daqian.

456
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:28,680
Your old house...

457
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,520
It's at the foot of Yanhuo Stronghold.

458
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,680
I understand your fear.

459
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,080
Well.

460
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,000
I'll give you this opportunity.

461
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,040
As heroes,

462
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,960
Why are you afraid of

463
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,730
a small Yanhuo Stronghold?

464
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,800
That's right. Okay, why are we afraid of it?

465
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,860
I've been ordered.

466
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,280
Let's do what the Chief wants.

467
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,240
I'll get ready.

468
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,760
Okay, okay.

469
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,040
Let's go take down Yanhuo Stronghold.

470
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,000
Okay, let's do it.

471
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,280
I've been off for a few days.

472
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,520
I have a few things

473
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,400
need to clean up.

474
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,360
Today, in front of the Second-in-command,

475
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,820
let's settle it together.

476
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,850
The first one is that

477
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,600
our facilities are obsolete.

478
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,370
Erhei had advised me to replace it before.

479
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,140
I advised him to be frugal.

480
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,200
This time, we'll replace them all together.

481
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,660
I'll send someone to order a new batch later.

482
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,060
I've already made the design.

483
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,880
Just do it according to this.

484
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,810
Look carefully.

485
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,200
This person looks familiar... So familiar.

486
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,960
He looks like that Aunt Lu, doesn't he?

487
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,020
Isn't that Aunt Lu?

488
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,240
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

489
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,040
That's right, that's Aunt Lu.

490
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,840
Should I change or not?

491
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,560
Yes, must change.

492
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,640
Change... Change...

493
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,600
Change! Change! Change!

494
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,560
The second one.

495
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,000
The kitchenette was for that Lu Yan

496
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,440
prepared several meals.

497
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,330
Though it’s a bit extravagant,

498
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,400
after all, it was the chef's

499
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,120
hard-working research.

500
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,840
When New Year's Eve festivities,

501
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,300
We can still take out to eat

502
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,040
and cook.

503
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,400
Yes, yes, yes, yes

504
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,480
For good luck.

505
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,050
We need some good names.

506
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,360
I just gave them some random names.

507
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,620
So we can order more conveniently later.

508
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,480
What did you write?

509
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,760
I can't read. Read it quickly.

510
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,680
Cruel and unscrupulous package.

511
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,840
By hook or by crook package.

512
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,960
Black sheep package.

513
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,480
This is, worse than a beast package.

514
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,250
I see, Second-in-command.

515
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,210
My master has the heart to kill!

516
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,520
She hasn't let go yet.

517
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,240
What should we do?

518
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,170
What I just said.

519
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,320
It's all about the trivialities of our stronghold.

520
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,200
The third one

521
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,800
is a great event good for the country and the people.

522
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Nowadays, nine continents advocate new style.

523
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,330
But some of the new business

524
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,000
can't even rent a store.

525
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,400
Some old things

526
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,040
And old trades have taken over the location.

527
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,440
Our Qingquan Stronghold

528
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,680
is a good example of men, women and children

529
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,480
in these eighteen strongholds.

530
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,770
How can we just sit back and do nothing?

531
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,240
So what you are saying is…

532
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,240
For the sake of our stronghold,

533
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,340
it is the duty of a man to give up his own interest.

534
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,200
Good.

535
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,960
From now on, in the town,

536
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,040
the name of Xin's Sedan Chair Company will never appear again.

537
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,480
Okay, okay, okay.

538
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,620
-No more.
-No more.

539
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,320
That's right.

540
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,400
That's why our sedan chairs…

541
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,080
Shopkeeper.

542
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,410
There's another group of troublemakers.

543
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,280
Did she come personally?

544
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:01,840
No.

545
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,840
Take the money and get rid of them.

546
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,960
This is the third batch today.

547
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,520
After the Nanfeng Stronghold, Qingquan Stronghold is here again.

548
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,450
If this goes on, we'll go bankrupt.

549
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:09,920
As long as she's happy,

550
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,180
She can make as much trouble as she wants.

551
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,240
Sir.

552
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,320
Sir.

553
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,220
There's news of Paralyzed Yu.

554
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,480
Yingdu.

555
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,400
Sir.

556
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,160
Paralyzed Yu has not been back to Qingquan Stronghold

557
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,290
for several months.

558
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,560
He has no fixed place to live.

559
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,960
Our spies

560
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,090
found out where he was last.

561
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,170
It was in Yingdu.

562
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,650
But the exact location,

563
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,170
he can't say it clearly.

564
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,480
Yingdu is not very peaceful these days.

565
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,920
Yeah, it's weird.

566
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,600
A big spirit-hunter like this,

567
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,400
is secretive in his movement and trace.

568
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,080
So...

569
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,520
I also followed your instructions.

570
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,400
I went to keep an eye on another person.

571
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,120
Recently, the Second-in-command visited the tomb in the back of the mountain.

572
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,720
In addition to paying respect to the grave of Yu Dengdeng’s mother.

573
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,440
He also went to a small unnamed grave

574
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,300
Burning paper.

575
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,600
Child.

576
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,220
Twenty years have passed.

577
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,120
If you were alive.

578
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,610
You would have grown up to be a big girl.

579
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:09,560
Fortunately, your mother is there to take care of you.

580
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,120
You will not be alone.

581
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,570
I've already put your memorial tablet

582
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,920
in Yu's ancestral temple.

583
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,520
When the former chieftain returns,

584
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,160
tell Chief the truth.

585
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,450
And then she will put your story

586
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,000
in the family tree.

587
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:27,880
Sir.

588
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,840
Do you want me to go to Qingquan Stronghold to find out?

589
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
I'll go myself.

590
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,800
Dengdeng.

591
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,600
Uncle is here to see you.

592
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,080
Aunt Lu.

593
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,060
It's not appropriate to come uninvited.

594
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,400
Bone of Ying Dragon has been destroyed and the taboo has been broken.

595
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,920
Yu's ancestral temple is not a place that you want to break into,

596
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,520
then you can just barge into.

597
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,880
Why is the person on this throne

598
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,280
also called Yu Dengdeng.

599
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,800
Our Dengdeng is weak when young.

600
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,440
I've thought of ways to marry a big rooster.

601
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,640
Make a fake tablet to fool the King of Hell.

602
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,240
It's not surprising, right?

603
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,920
You're lying, aren't you?

604
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,160
You're the one lying! You're a big liar!

605
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,160
I know you're very good at what you do.

606
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,020
But you have to be conscientious.

607
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,690
Let me ask you one thing.

608
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,320
Where is the Golden Crow Bird

609
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
that former chieftain brought back

610
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,840
twenty years ago?

611
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,050
It was eaten.

612
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,360
Eaten?

613
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,640
You don't believe me?

614
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,980
I can't help it if you don't believe me, but it was eaten.

615
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,280
Second-in-command.

616
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,080
I'm here.

617
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,040
Where's Daqian?

618
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,040
Don't come in yet.

619
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,200
I'll see you later.

620
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,760
Daqian.

621
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,720
I'm Yu Dengdeng. Once I say something, I will not withdraw.

622
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,840
Even if you want a star in the sky,

623
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,360
I will pick it for you!

624
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,600
I treat you so well.

625
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,520
Why do you want to kill me?

626
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,720
I can accept

627
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,320
even if you are a spirit clansman.

628
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,080
But you want me dead.

629
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,760
Why do you do that?

630
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,240
I give you the last chance.

631
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,760
Give me a reason

632
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,760
Just say it.

633
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,800
I can believe you if you say so.

634
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,660
Since you won't say it,

635
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,640
I have no choice.

636
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,000
Leave Qingquan Town.

637
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,560
You and I will never meet each other again again

638
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,610
It's the spirit clan again.

639
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,240
Spiritual butterflies.

640
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,360
The spiritual butterfly's energy is too weak to be feared.

641
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,400
I've set up a boundary in Qingquan Stronghold.

642
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,640
They can't enter.

643
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,680
Now

644
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,600
Someone has already set eyes on Yu Dengdeng.

645
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,320
I am more and more curious to know that

646
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,760
is she Yun Xi or not?

647
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,520
Sir,

648
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,680
I know a place.

649
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,300
Maybe we can find a way.

650
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,000
Finally someone came to see the book.

651
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,200
Empty-handed! Shameless! Shameless!

652
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,260
Let me see which little bastard it is.

653
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,690
I have dim eyesight.

654
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,410
You look so familiar, little brother.

655
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,360
You're the one who was standing next to

656
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,800
saintess in that year.

657
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,200
Don’t cotton up with me. I'm here to find a book for someone.

658
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,080
For whom?

659
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,770
Mind your own business.

660
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,240
General Yan.

661
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,120
I smelled the energy on you just now.

662
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,160
It's his scent.

663
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,400
It seems to be true.

664
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,460
Since you're a noble ambassador.

665
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,720
Please allow me to extend my welcome.

666
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,300
Don't tell anyone about this.

667
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,040
When Zhu Rong was in charge of the spirit clan, he practiced tyranny.

668
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:34,080
General Yan killed him.

669
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,320
That's my idol!

670
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,680
All right, all right.

671
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,320
I'm here to find a book.

672
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,200
A book written by a spirit-hunter from the Tang Dynasty.

673
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,520
There is a lot of information about the spirit clan and spirit.

674
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,440
There are many records.

675
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,400
Do you know this?

676
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,520
Yes, I do.

677
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,560
Collection of Thousands of years’ Knowledge.

678
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,620
You know this book.

679
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,560
It incorporates a thousand years of history,

680
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,890
and the true meaning of the three worlds and the six riddles.

681
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
This is the book you are looking for.

682
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:59,940
Collection of Thousands of years’ Knowledge written by Long Yangzi.

683
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,840
It is no wonder that you are the man

684
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,280
who followed General Yan.

685
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,880
You are so discerning!

686
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,730
My admiration for General Yan and you,

687
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,600
is like

688
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,240
rain’s pouring down.

689
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,840
All right, all right.

690
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,720
Where is the book? I need it urgently.

691
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,980
You, you, you sit down.

692
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,960
I'll bring it to you.

693
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,960
Here you go. Here you go.

694
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,320
Take a good look.

695
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,720
General Yan, how are you doing?

696
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,040
Yes, yes, yes. No, no, no.

697
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:40,720
Thank you.

698
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,460
Where is the second half of this book?

699
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,840
It's the only one I've found.

700
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,080
I...

701
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,700
I have also studied it.

702
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,000
The second half of the book contains all the secrets of the world's

703
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,480
spirit clan and spirits.

704
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,260
I searched all over the world.

705
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,000
But I couldn't find the second half of the book.

706
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,600
Why is General Yan looking for it?

707
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,080
What do we want? You don't have to care.

708
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,240
And don't say anything.

709
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,000
If the world appears

710
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,240
rumors about General Yan,

711
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,500
I'll come back for you.

712
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,920
I'll take the book first.

713
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,320
I understand. I dare not.

714
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,610
Something big is going to happen. Something big is going to happen.

715
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,640
Pack bags.

716
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:40,960
Slip away.

717
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,720
Saintess may be coming back.

718
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,930
It's hard for us to settle here.

719
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,290
It's good for us to have saintess back.

720
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,540
Why should we hide?

721
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,560
The spirit that needs to be checked by General Yan himself,

722
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,120
must be only the saintess.

723
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:56,920
Back then, the saintess gave the energy core to General Yan.

724
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,600
How much strife did it cause?

725
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,920
Now that the saintess has reappeared.

726
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,120
I'm afraid that the storm will start again.

727
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,120
You and I should stay away from the world and keep safe.

728
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,650
I know the chieftain is very smart.

729
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,760
But I never thought he would be so smart

730
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,160
It's only been a few days.

731
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,680
A large part of the money in Xin's Sedan Chair Company

732
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,140
has been taken away by Qingquan Stronghold.

733
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,460
That's fine

734
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,820
I'll just take it as

735
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,410
a way to keep the water from flowing to the outside world, right?

736
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,280
Sir.

737
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,680
Have you found a way to determine

738
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,340
Yu Dengdeng being the master?

739
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,120
We must find the second half of the book.

740
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,680
Now there are spirit clans.

741
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,010
They're watching Yu Dengdeng in the dark.

742
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,440
I feel worried.

743
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:58,680
Sir!

744
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,280
You're protecting Yu Dengdeng.

745
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,210
Not only because

746
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,770
She might be the saintess of that year, right?

747
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,800
What else could it be?

748
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,720
I'm just asking.

749
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,720
If you put protecting Yu Dengdeng's safety

750
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,560
the priority,

751
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,600
then why don’t you

752
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,720
return the hair pin to her?
