1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let go even if I have to walk behind the scenes

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You ask you, it's not me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You ask you, it's not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You ask you, it's not me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You ask you, it's not me

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Episode 11

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Dad, I told you, it's a misunderstanding

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What misunderstanding?

10
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
He wants to kill you with money

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Living with such a person for a lifetime is dangerous

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It happens that everyone is here today

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Come on, write the divorce letter

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Come on

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Write divorce letter?

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Are you too much?

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You are too much, old Yu

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I, how do you let the child put this pen

19
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Old Yu, I and Deng Deng

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Stop, I'm talking to Deng Deng

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What are you talking about?

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I don't divorce

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes, second brother supports you

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
He has been protecting me all the way

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Otherwise, I don't know how many times I died

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Can you still see such a lively girl?

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
In theory, I was fooled by Zhu You again

28
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Is it that I was fooled by Zhu You

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Or do you have prejudice against him?

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How did he treat me?

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I can see it clearly

32
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I understand it in my heart

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You don't have to tell me

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Deng Deng, don't think that I don't know you

35
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Dad also told you

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This woman wants to be a great poet

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Can't be greedy for beauty

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Three-legged hamas can't find

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Two-legged men are everywhere

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Go back to Qingxuan Village, dad will find the best for you

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't care, I don't like it

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Moreover, when I married her

43
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I asked for a lot of dowry

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you want to repair it

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Then all those dowry have to be returned

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes, the owner is right

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Old Yu, the price of our new school

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's worth more than a hundred thousand silver dollars

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What are you playing?

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You pay it back, I'll see what you pay

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I pay

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You pay

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Pay

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What do you pay

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll calculate it

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If you say you want to repair it

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You calculate it

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Then this is our debt in Qingquan Village

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Debt

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
According to the daily interest

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
This interest is rolling

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Interest

63
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
How much money does this have?

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
More than 90,000 taels

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Can't be paid off all your life

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I help you pay

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You don't pay, you don't do this

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
What's your business?

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
OK, kneel down and you can't get through, right?

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
This repair book

71
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Must be written today

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Wait, let me tell you

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Between me and him

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You can only choose one

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The repair book must be written today

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Choose him

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Second father supports you

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Hurry up

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Of course you choose

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This kid is really good

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You write

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Write, listen to your father

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Come

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Come, write it

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Come over

86
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What are you doing

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Just repair it, what's the hurry

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No, you

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Look at you

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Look at the way this little man is kind

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Look at you

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Hold

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This good chair

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Let you disperse

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
what happened

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Why are you writing a repair book

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Didn't you read it?

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What to read

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I said, why are you so impulsive

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You didn't look at it carefully

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
This repair book is not a repair book

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's really in my heart

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I said, General Lu

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You take a good look

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This poem

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This book is useless

107
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Repairing books is fake

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
How about your husband and me

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Is it both talented and intelligent

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You are my second house for one day

111
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
My second house for life

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
There are thousands of men in this world

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I will eat you

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
OK, then I will accept it

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And force to accept

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You said you were going to stay here for a few days

117
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I decided

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I want to be with you

119
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I want to stay here for a few more days

120
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Not just because of the spirit

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Also because of those animals

122
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Master

123
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Have you finished the matter?

124
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The pharmacy is burning

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
But Chang'er was caught

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Come on, are you hungry?

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You are full

128
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's my turn

129
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Go and cut off the tail

130
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Yes

131
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Wait

132
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
They messed up the business

133
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Go and poison them

134
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Daohai is coming back

135
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Daohai is coming back

136
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
We are going back to Qingchuan Village

137
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Old friend

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I didn't hurt you this time

139
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yes

140
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The Lv family's ancestors are faking

141
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Is to cheat us

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Don't fart

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
But this peach wood sword is real

144
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Once the sword is out

145
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Then something is going to happen

146
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll go to do it

147
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll go to do it

148
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What are you going to do?

149
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I have food and wine

150
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm going to go to the autumn wind

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Wait, I won't let you drink

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You don't say I don't say

153
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Where does he know

154
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I go back

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Don't go crazy

156
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let the child save his heart

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I know

158
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Good good good

159
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Good

160
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Thank you thank you thank you

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Thank you all

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Thank you, brother

163
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
So many people

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So many delicious food

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Come here

166
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Hello sir

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
These spiritual tribes

168
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
In order to cover their identity

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Be a person

170
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I suffered a lot

171
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Either lost my life

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Or even my own body can't be preserved

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Think about it

174
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Really pitiful

175
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Just like Xiao Yitai

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
He loves Director Bai so much

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Dare not tell him his true identity

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Is it because they are different

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Different races

180
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Can't you love each other?

181
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
In fact, the spiritual tribe is the same as humans

182
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
All are born and raised

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Also know love and hate

184
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
He will know the pain when he is hurt

185
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You are good to him

186
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
He will also be grateful

187
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
They actually want to live a normal life

188
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
With lover

189
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Live a simple and happy life

190
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Lu Yan

191
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's help them

192
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I think

193
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What do you want to do

194
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I want to try the yuan energy you taught me before

195
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Sir

196
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Your wine

197
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Thank you

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Go

199
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Old man

200
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I have said everything I should say

201
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What are you doing here?

202
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Who is it?

203
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Who is it?

204
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What kind of person is this?

205
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What are you doing?

206
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Miss

207
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Are you okay?

208
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Are you okay?

209
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What is this?

210
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Catch him

211
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Catch him

212
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Dad

213
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Old man, don't go

214
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
What's wrong with you?

215
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Old man

216
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Old man, old man

217
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Old man

218
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Old man

219
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Come on

220
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Don't go

221
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
After you

222
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Don't go

223
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Old man

224
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Old man

225
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Old man

226
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Old man

227
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Old man

228
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Old man

229
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Old man

230
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Uncle

231
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Uncle

232
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Old man

233
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Old man

234
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Old man

235
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,160
What are you doing?

236
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,600
Chase them!

237
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,320
Yes!

238
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,560
Sir, don't be afraid.

239
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,080
I'm here.

240
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,040
Hurry up.

241
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,800
I've set up the trap.

242
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,840
They're safe now.

243
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,320
What happened to my father?

244
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,240
Why did he hurt people?

245
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,040
We need to find a reliable place

246
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,080
to hide.

247
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,480
It's convenient for us to save the old man.

248
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,080
My second sister said

249
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,480
that she would go to a shabby temple

250
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,280
when she came to India.

251
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,360
Let's go there.

252
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,520
Okay.

253
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:24,760
Wait.

254
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,600
The sea.

255
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,000
The sea hasn't been rescued yet.

256
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,080
Leave the sea to me.

257
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:28,760
You go first.

258
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:29,880
Okay.

259
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,120
I'll leave the sea to you.

260
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:31,920
Remember.

261
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,600
After you find the sea,

262
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,640
you must dress up and leave the city.

263
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,680
You must be careful.

264
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:35,520
Don't worry.

265
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,360
I'll leave it to you.

266
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,080
Let's go.

267
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,320
No way.

268
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,280
Your father is a peeled animal.

269
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,200
Give us a good taste.

270
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,320
Go down.

271
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,440
Go there and check.

272
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,080
Buid need!

273
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,760
Go there.

274
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,960
It's so crowded outside tonight.

275
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,240
Yeah.

276
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,160
Why is it so crowded?

277
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,960
What's wrong with him?

278
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,560
Ignore him.

279
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,360
Let's drink our own.

280
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,080
Come on.

281
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,720
Mr. Gu.

282
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,480
What are you doing here?

283
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,840
Director Bai ordered you to release Peng Danhai.

284
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,160
What?

285
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,400
You don't even listen to him?

286
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,280
Hurry up.

287
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,480
You don't even listen to him?

288
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:35,880
Hurry up.

289
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,000
Let him go.

290
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,640
Okay.

291
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,520
Wait.

292
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,200
What's going on?

293
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,760
Can't you see it?

294
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,280
Director Bai said he would release me.

295
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,640
Abduction?

296
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,360
It's fake?

297
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,280
Go.

298
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,840
You're blind.

299
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,160
Go.

300
00:16:59,160 --> 00:16:59,960
I'll let you hit me.

301
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,160
Come and have a look.

302
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,200
These people are here to report the case.

303
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,040
You'll get a reward.

304
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,840
But...

305
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,160
Mr. Gu.

306
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,360
I just came out.

307
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,000
And you're acting like this.

308
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,960
Director Lin.

309
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,760
You're so annoying.

310
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,640
I'm the one who's annoying.

311
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,840
No.

312
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,080
Who are you offending?

313
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,720
What do you mean?

314
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,040
It's us.

315
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,080
From now on,

316
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,040
let's play a game of

317
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,320
saying goodbye to each other.

318
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,560
Say goodbye to each other?

319
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,120
Who says goodbye?

320
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,320
Us.

321
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:48,800
Let's go.

322
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,600
Stop.

323
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:04,720
Stop.

324
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,440
Go.

325
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,600
Run.

326
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,560
Did anyone see him?

327
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,280
Stop.

328
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,600
Take him away.

329
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,640
Get out of here.

330
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,080
Get out.

331
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,240
I'm sorry.

332
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,200
You're so annoying.

333
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,080
Stop.

334
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,400
You're so annoying.

335
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,840
Get out.

336
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,960
Wait.

337
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,880
Take off the scarf.

338
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,960
I told you to take off the scarf.

339
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:40,680
Take it off.

340
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,600
Chuan.

341
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,120
Is that him?

342
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,320
Interesting.

343
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,920
Take off the scarf.

344
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,120
Take it off.

345
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,480
Hurry.

346
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,800
Hurry.

347
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,400
Brother Huan.

348
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,680
Miss Bai.

349
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,280
Miss Bai.

350
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,120
You don't know her?

351
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,320
She's my savior.

352
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,960
Brother Huan.

353
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Where are you going?

354
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,960
I'll take you there.

355
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,440
Miss Bai.

356
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,840
We can't do the job.

357
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,680
Yeah.

358
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
You can't do the job if you offend me.

359
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,160
Yes.

360
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,360
Let's go.

361
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,160
Let's go, Brother Huan.

362
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:31,960
Let's go.

363
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
Why are you here?

364
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:36,760
To help you.

365
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,280
Help me?

366
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,160
Gu Chuan.

367
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,720
Gu Chuan.

368
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,640
You are...

369
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,640
I'm...

370
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,480
Yu Dangdang's apprentice, Peng Da Hai.

371
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,640
Isn't Peng Da Hai a man?

372
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,400
No, Mrs. Gu.

373
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,440
I'm sorry to explain.

374
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,280
Simply speaking, I've been poisoned by the spirit.

375
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,240
I've become a man and a woman.

376
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,240
I'm a man and a woman.

377
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,720
Where are you going?

378
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,520
I'll take you there.

379
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,760
We'll go to the south of the city.

380
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
Can you drive?

381
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:10,800
I've never eaten pork.

382
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
I've never seen a pig run.

383
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,920
The driver drives our car every day.

384
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
I can see it.

385
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,400
Sit tight.

386
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,280
Sister.

387
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,160
That pig is not that rough.

388
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,280
I'm just kidding.

389
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,520
Stop talking, sister.

390
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
Sit tight.

391
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:54,620
Perhaps from this

392
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,320
Yu.

393
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,320
Father.

394
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,520
Old Yi.

395
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:06,520
Father.

396
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,520
Sir, those animals are all settled.

397
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,520
Let me see.

398
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,520
Come.

399
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,520
My father has a spirit worm in his body.

400
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
Father.

401
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,520
Father, are you okay?

402
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Old Yi.

403
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
Father.

404
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
Old Yi.

405
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
What happened?

406
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
Wait.

407
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
Did I scare you?

408
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,520
Master Yu.

409
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Do you remember how this spirit worm entered your body?

410
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,520
I only remember

411
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,520
I secretly walked to the banquet hall.

412
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,520
There were many delicious food.

413
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
I ate and drank.

414
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,520
Why am I here?

415
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
What happened?

416
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,520
Father, please help me take care of my father.

417
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
Go.

418
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,520
Ru Yan, come out.

419
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Old Yu.

420
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,520
How many times have I told you not to go?

421
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
You have to go.

422
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
You have to go.

423
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,520
Why did my father get a spirit worm?

424
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
I finally found him.

425
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
I thought this case would be solved.

426
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
I can take him back to Qingquan Village

427
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
and think about Qingfu.

428
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,520
It seems that the Chai'er Spirit Tribe didn't lie to us.

429
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,520
This worm king can control the host.

430
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,520
He was just at the banquet

431
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,520
and wanted to use the hand of Master Yu to silence him.

432
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,520
The banquet distracted the attention of others.

433
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:35,520
He used a knife to kill people and attacked them.

434
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,520
I can't let him get close to my father anymore.

435
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,520
As long as he doesn't get out of the house,

436
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,520
my father will be in danger for another day.

437
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,520
The spirits in the city will continue to suffer from this spirit worm.

438
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,520
We have to find him as soon as possible.

439
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,520
There are many people at the banquet today.

440
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,520
It shouldn't be difficult to get in.

441
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,520
He is wearing a windbreaker.

442
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,520
There is a strange sound when he walks.

443
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,520
I think the people who saw him

444
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,520
must have an impression on him.

445
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,520
We can go to Bai's Mansion to find out.

446
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,520
Maybe there will be clues.

447
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
We can find...

448
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
You really said Cao Cao.

449
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,520
But it's you that's suspicious.

450
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
Weird.

451
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,520
I'm so curious what it is.

452
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,520
What's that?

453
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,520
Want to know more?

454
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,520
Be prepared.

455
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,520
Chinese artistç

456
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,520
Everybody's here.

457
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,600
Song Quan'snet Student

458
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Look at him.

459
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
He looks like a crazy man.

460
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,600
Yes, yes, yes.

461
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,600
Could it be that he's infected

462
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,600
with some kind of plague?

463
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
Don't worry.

464
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,600
I'll find out the truth.

465
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,600
You used to say that.

466
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,600
Where's the spirit-ghost suspect you caught?

467
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,600
He's dead.

468
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,600
Dead?

469
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
What about Wu Zheng?

470
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,600
He's dead.

471
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
No, no, don't be angry.

472
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Don't be angry.

473
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
Be careful of the wound.

474
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
Be careful of the wound.

475
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
Give me three days.

476
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
Just three days.

477
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,600
I promise I'll catch the suspect.

478
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,600
For the people of Yingdu,

479
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,600
I hurt my arm.

480
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,600
But tonight,

481
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
all of them are here with their heads and faces.

482
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:56,600
If you let the superior know about this,

483
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,600
is it useful to catch a fish stall?

484
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,600
A man in a windbreaker

485
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,600
has a strange sound when walking.

486
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,600
One more.

487
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,600
It's that reporter.

488
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,600
Reporter?

489
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Do you know him?

490
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,600
I don't know.

491
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,600
But at the party,

492
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
I saw him in a weird way.

493
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
He disappeared without a trace.

494
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,600
And his body was quite strange.

495
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
So I remember.

496
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
But there are so many newspapers in the city.

497
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
If I look for it,

498
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,600
I'm afraid I'll find it for several days.

499
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
That's not necessary.

500
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,600
In the past, there was a party in our house.

501
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,600
It's common for these reporters to come to report.

502
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,600
So they need a certificate to enter.

503
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,600
And they need to register.

504
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,600
I'll go back and check the list of the party.

505
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
The old village head said

506
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,600
he had a strange sound when walking.

507
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
I thought it was strange.

508
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,600
But now I think

509
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,600
he might be pretending.

510
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Miss Bai,

511
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,600
if you find the reporter's report,

512
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
maybe this clue will be useful.

513
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
Okay.

514
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,600
I'll go find out.

515
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Wait for my news.

516
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Thank you, Miss Bai.

517
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
The house is on fire.

518
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Yes, it's here.

519
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
A reporter

520
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,600
can live in such a big house.

521
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,600
He asked our brothers in the village

522
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,600
to move in with him.

523
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Master, you're really a genius.

524
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,600
How did you find it?

525
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Thanks to Miss Bai.

526
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
But

527
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
it's okay that the bug bullied people.

528
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
It's not a big deal.

529
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
It's not a big deal to pick a host.

530
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
It's not a big deal to pick a host.

531
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,600
It's not a big deal to pick a host.

532
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
There are many bugs in the corner.

533
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
But there are few reporters in the village.

534
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,600
Let's go.

535
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Let's go.

536
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,600
I feel like

537
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,600
no one has lived here for a long time.

538
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
This bug king

539
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,600
usually hides as a reporter.

540
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
And reporters

541
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,600
will have a hint to wash the photos.

542
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
Let's go.

543
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
There are footprints.

544
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Let's go and have a look.

545
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
Let's go.

546
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
What's this?

547
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
I didn't expect

548
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,600
that they would come so soon.

549
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
You three,

550
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
surrender and call for the master.

551
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,600
Maybe our grandchild

552
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
can be beaten lightly.

553
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
Shut up.

554
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,600
Master,

555
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
where are the souls in the stone?

556
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,600
Catch.

557
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,600
I'm ready.

558
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
How?

559
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,600
I, Yu Deng Deng, have always been unruly.

560
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
The soft bone umbrella in our Qingquan Village

561
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
is not a cover.

562
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,600
The master is indeed useful and clever.

563
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,600
Let's go.

564
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,600
Excuse me.

565
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,600
Excuse me.

566
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,600
Excuse me.

567
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
Chicken-eater.

568
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,600
Chase after them.

569
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,600
Chase after them.

570
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,600
Excuse me.

571
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,600
Excuse me.

572
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,600
Excuse me.

573
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,600
Excuse me.

574
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
Excuse me.

575
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,600
Excuse me.

576
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,600
Excuse me.

577
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,600
Excuse me.

578
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Excuse me.

579
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
Don't run.

580
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,600
Don't run.

581
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
Hurry up.

582
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,600
Excuse me.

583
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Stop.

584
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,600
They just left in a hurry.

585
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
And now they're here to beat us up.

586
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,600
These useless guys.

587
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,600
What are they doing?

588
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,600
Stop.

589
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Stop.

590
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
Stop.

591
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,600
Director of Su Family.

592
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
Stop.

593
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,600
Shift to dieser Berg.

594
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
Hurry up.

595
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,600
"..to be D krijgenon."

596
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,600
centered.

597
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,600
No new Chinese cmARY.

598
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,600
No new Chinese cmARY.

599
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
Haicang,

600
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,600
why are we stolen?

601
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:21,400
The Party's

602
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,400
What are you doing here?

603
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
summer

604
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:33,880
Be careful

605
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,600
Very well.

606
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,520
Let's go.

607
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,200
Hai Ran.

608
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,480
what are you talking about?

609
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,520
Look at this.

610
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,800
This sword is indeed a degener trois ustedes.

611
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,040
This sword is the most special.

612
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,000
Stop spraying it with used wood here and there.

613
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,280
That's like a torture rod.

614
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,880
It is really a treasured sword!

615
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,160
It's even better to put it in the fire.

616
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,600
It will temperature others up then.

617
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,240
Nonsense.

618
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,960
The sword is a gem.

619
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:53,520
Old Yu!

620
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:54,600
Old Yu!

621
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,000
Uncle Yu!

622
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:55,840
Old Yu!

623
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,120
Uncle Yu!

624
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:57,960
Old Yu!

625
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,760
Shiya!

626
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,080
Shuren,

627
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,480
we're being attacked.

628
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,560
Isn't it too early

629
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,520
to celebrate with these things?

630
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,800
You don't understand.

631
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,840
When Lord Chong died,

632
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,040
my father's illness disappeared.

633
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,000
I feel

634
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,040
at ease now.

635
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:11,920
With his temperament,

636
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,880
he must be looking for wine in the yard.

637
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,120
Let's get him married

638
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,760
and get some fresh air.

639
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,880
You're finally back.

640
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,360
Father!

641
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,440
How is my father?

642
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,800
Is he in trouble again?

643
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,480
What trouble?

644
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,320
Look!

645
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,680
Uncle Yu!

646
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,440
Father!

647
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:26,720
Father!

648
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:27,320
Father!

649
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:27,720
Father!

650
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,360
Father!

651
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,400
How could this happen?

652
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,000
Why are there still

653
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,120
some spirits in my father's body?

654
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,160
The young reporter

655
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,120
died in front of us.

656
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
Isn't Lord Chong

657
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,120
controlling these spirits?

658
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,240
What should we do?

659
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,520
Old Yu!

660
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,560
Father!

661
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,920
How could this happen?

662
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,840
How could this happen?

663
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,480
Father!

664
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,160
Father!

665
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,080
Sir,

666
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,200
what are you thinking?

667
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,520
From the Ghost Division to the banquet,

668
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,560
someone always starts us off.

669
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,120
I always feel that behind Lord Chong,

670
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,360
there's a invisible hand

671
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,680
controlling everything.

672
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,320
Then who do you suspect?

673
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,840
For so many years,

674
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,760
there are many people who are in the Yuan能.

675
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,440
But there's only one person

676
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,440
who can do so much for the Ghost Division

677
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,920
and even risk his life.

678
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,080
You mean Zhu Rong?

679
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,280
She's hiding in the dark.

680
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,080
If we want to force her to show up,

681
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,080
we have to start with Lord Chong.

682
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,640
A Xin,

683
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,520
I'll go check on the reporter's death.

684
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,720
I'll leave Deng Deng and the old Yu

685
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,800
to you.

686
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,160
Yes, sir.

687
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,560
Xiao Yi Tai,

688
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,280
do you have anything to say?

689
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,160
Mr. Long,

690
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,600
I want...

691
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,680
I want to ask you to do me a favor.

692
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,480
I want to ask you to help me

693
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,560
with the investigation.

694
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,040
I want to ask you to help me

695
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,040
with the investigation.

696
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,040
I've been getting

697
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,440
weaker and weaker lately.

698
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,280
I want...

699
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,600
I want to ask you to take me to the city.

700
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,960
I want to fight with my master

701
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,520
for the last time.

702
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,240
If I want to die,

703
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,160
I want to die

704
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,040
by my master's side.

705
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,920
Please, Mr. Long.

706
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,480
All right.

707
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,760
I promise you.

708
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,240
Thank...

709
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,480
Thank you, Mr. Long.

710
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,080
Master.

711
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,560
Master.

712
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,480
Father.

713
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,640
Come on.

714
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:07,880
Master.

715
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:08,960
Father.

716
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:09,600
Master.

717
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,640
Father, what's wrong?

718
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,160
Master.

719
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,200
Calm down, father.

720
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,160
Father.

721
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:13,840
Master.

722
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:14,840
Let go.

723
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,000
Beixi.

724
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:16,640
Hurry.

725
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,760
Father, help him.

726
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,880
Master.

727
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,360
Father.

728
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,240
What should we do?

729
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,360
What's wrong with you?

730
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,320
I'll go find Mr. Long.

731
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,040
It's too late.

732
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,640
Uncle Yun.

733
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,040
Let me do it.

734
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,000
Help me press him.

735
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,240
Uncle Yun.

736
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,880
Master.

737
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:48,920
Brother.

738
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,480
Dengdeng.

739
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,480
Master.

740
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,680
Master.

741
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,520
Let it go, Dengdeng.

742
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,640
I'll try again.

743
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,560
I can do it.

744
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,480
Dengdeng.

745
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,920
Listen to me.

746
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,240
You can't eat it, Dengdeng.

747
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:28,880
Dengdeng.

748
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,040
Master.

749
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:33,920
Dengdeng.

750
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,920
You've tried your best.

751
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,800
Listen to me.

752
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
Stop it.

753
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,840
Don't persuade me.

754
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,160
Master.

755
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:41,840
You can't hold on anymore.

756
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:49,960
Dengdeng.

757
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,120
Get out.

758
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,360
Get out.

759
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,480
Get out.

760
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,000
Get out.

761
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,040
Dengdeng.

762
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,640
Listen to me.

763
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,560
You've tried your best, Dengdeng.

764
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:10,960
Father.

765
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Don't persuade me.

766
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,280
I was still young when my mother died.

767
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,760
I can't do anything.

768
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,320
I finally found my father.

769
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,440
I can't just watch him die.

770
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,280
But you've fallen down

771
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,480
because you failed to stand up.

772
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,160
How can I explain to him

773
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,200
when he wakes up?

774
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,040
Dengdeng.

775
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:54,840
The most beautiful scenery in life

776
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,800
is all about you

777
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,960
When two hearts are so close

778
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,440
When the whole world is occupied by you

779
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,280
I will call you with all my heart

780
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,960
I will make a decision for you

781
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,000
When two hearts are so close

782
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,560
When the whole world is occupied by you

783
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:20,320
I will call you with all my heart

784
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,800
Until your memory

785
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:31,120
You are my only

786
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,120
Father

787
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,840
This city is you and me

788
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:45,080
Why do I say this

789
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,920
I hit the road

790
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,960
and made a decision for you

791
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:18,220
Love.
