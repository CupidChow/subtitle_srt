2
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,280
Three thousand years ago,

3
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,440
led by its saintess Yun Xi

4
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,400
and its leader Zhu Rong,

5
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,240
the spirit clan waged a war against  the human race.

6
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:56,600
All of a sudden, the people were plunged into an abyss of misery.

7
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,360
During the war,

8
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,480
Yun Xi's heart was touched by all the living beings

9
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,040
and sealed her killing intent

10
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,760
in the hope of achieving peace.

11
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:08,240
Unexpectedly,

12
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,639
this caused her to be hated by Zhu Rong,

13
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,720
who continued leading the spirit clan in plundering everywhere.

14
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,120
Meanwhile,

15
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,720
Lu Yan, the prince of the human race, led troops in resisting strenuously.

16
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,480
He joined hands with Yun Xi trying to end the war.

17
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,720
However, Zhu Rong plotted to force them into a desperate situation.

18
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,800
Before death, Yun Xi

19
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,760
took out the energy core inside her body and gave it to Lu Yan.

20
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,520
Then Lu Yan killed Zhu Rong with the power of the energy core,

21
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,840
ended the war between the human race and the spirit clan,

22
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,280
and fulfilled Yun Xi's dying wish.

23
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,880
Peace returned to the nine continents,

24
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,079
but Lu Ran suddenly disappeared from the world,

25
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,800
leaving countless legends

26
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,400
to later generations.

27
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,040
It's all right. There's air here.

28
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,720
Master, all of you move to the side a bit.

29
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,800
The shell I am holding will explode upon being touched.

30
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:30,760
Wait a minute.

31
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:31,920
Don't blow it up.

32
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,120
Leave it to me.

33
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
According to our second-in-command,

34
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,280
our Qingquan Mountain has the best geomantic quality.

35
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,720
It lets wind through and nestles near water.

36
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,360
This mountain will be fine if we don't blast it.

37
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,120
If we blast it, it may collapse.

38
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,040
Everybody, go search around.

39
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,480
They all said that a top corrupt official from the previous dynasty

40
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
engaged in embezzlement and took bribes

41
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,720
and deliberately extorted the fruits of the people's toil.

42
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,080
He was afraid that others might snitch on him,

43
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,960
so he hid all his treasure

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
in this place.

45
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,880
It is empty.

46
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,040
Chief,

47
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,480
except this stack of empty boxes,

48
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,680
there's nothing else here.

49
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,839
Chief,

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
the lock couldn't be forced open.

51
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:21,680
You are so dumb.

52
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:22,440
Let me do it.

53
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,360
How hard can it be?

54
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,720
One, two, three.

55
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,240
Open it and have a look.

56
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,200
Only these few items.

57
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,000
Open it and have a look.

58
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,000
It's empty.

59
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,600
All of them are empty.

60
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,680
-All of them are empty.
-Yes.

61
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,360
We came here for nothing.

62
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,000
It looks so grand here,

63
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,400
but he's poorer than us.

64
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,200
It is a wild-goose chase.

65
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,880
It is a wild-goose chase.

66
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,720
Master.

67
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,280
Chief.

68
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,080
Chief.

69
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:53,040
Master. Master.

70
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,840
Chief.

71
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,960
This is strange.

72
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,720
How come there is such a large mural here?

73
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,720
The person in the mural is so good-looking.

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,360
Why is the painting of such a good-looking person

75
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,040
placed in such a dirty place?

76
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,720
Yun Xi.

77
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,480
You are not Yunxi?

78
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:43,960
Master.

79
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,440
Chief. Chief.

80
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,280
Chief.

81
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,680
Chief.

82
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,920
Chief.

83
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,320
Yun Xi,

84
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,840
have you transmigrated

85
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,440
and returned to the world?

86
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,960
Master.

87
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,800
-Master.
-Chief.

88
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,160
Got married?

89
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,160
How come I had such a dream?

90
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,440
No. I am sure that nothing is wrong with me,

91
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,920
It is all because of that mural.

92
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,200
It's all because that the person in the mural

93
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,440
was painted too beautifully.

94
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,600
Don't get angry.

95
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,360
You know your identity, right?

96
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,040
It is choking me. What are you doing?

97
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,000
You are awake?

98
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,240
So much smoke early in the morning.

99
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:19,480
I am doing this to dispel your bad luck.

100
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,240
What bad luck is there to be dispelled?

101
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,760
I have told you that

102
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,960
that cave is too ominous and evil.

103
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,040
However, you insisted on breaking in.

104
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,920
How did it turn out?

105
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,760
You got nothing

106
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:28,840
and almost died there.

107
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,000
Stop following me.

108
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,840
Do you think it's worthwhile?

109
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,480
As I see it,

110
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,960
in the next three years, our Qingquan Stronghold

111
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,400
will go from bad to worse

112
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,840
and will be unable to make ends meet.

113
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,720
Can't you say anything nice?

114
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,520
I have read your fortune.

115
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,000
All you have now are a few pieces of beautiful clothes.

116
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,320
We are all going to be starved.

117
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,200
Uncle,

118
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,840
you practice divination every day.

119
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,520
If you get it right once,

120
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
I'll admit you are really good.

121
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,560
Look at the current situation.

122
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,680
Over the past six months,

123
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,040
our Qingquan Stronghold

124
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,120
has kept failing in building roads and growing crops.

125
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,760
Nevertheless,

126
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
you don't have to worry,

127
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,120
I have found a bright short cut for you through divination.

128
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,240
What is it?

129
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,560
Marry a man to dispel the bad luck.

130
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,680
Excuse me.

131
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,760
Come back.

132
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,920
Think about it.

133
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,320
There was a famine when I was 10 years old.

134
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,200
I had a heart attack and almost kicked the bucket.

135
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,400
Back then, you told my dad

136
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,040
to make me marry a rooster.

137
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,040
I married it and accepted the betrothal gifts.

138
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:34,680
But do you know

139
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,880
how many years I have been laughed at

140
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,920
by the chieftains of the 18 mountain strongholds?

141
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,160
That is ridiculous enough, right?

142
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,080
Now you actually want me to marry a man.

143
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,560
Even the daughter of a trafficker

144
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,880
won't be sold twice.

145
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,640
Marrying a rich man

146
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,480
can not only dispel the bad luck,

147
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,120
but also get you dowry.

148
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,160
I am both brainy and brawny.

149
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,560
Why need I make money by getting married?

150
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,240
It's safe. It's safe to get the dowry.

151
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,600
Then why don't you

152
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,720
get married to a rich woman?

153
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,560
You naughty girl,

154
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,800
I have read my fortune.

155
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,120
I am destined to live without a wife and can't defy fate.

156
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,880
I also read my fortune.

157
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,120
I am destined to live without a husband and can't defy fate, either.

158
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,880
That is not true.

159
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,040
Chief, give it more thought.

160
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,800
Master. Master.

161
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,360
We are screwed. It's all over now.

162
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,160
What happened?

163
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,720
Our cart for grocery and grain shopping overturned

164
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,560
when passing the Baizhan Bend, you see.

165
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,520
What?

166
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,280
Well,

167
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,520
how about the goods? And the people?

168
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,200
Our people are fine.

169
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,120
It's only that the cart and goods rolled down into the valley.

170
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,720
Those are the grain rations that will feed us for half a month.

171
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,040
Our stronghold bought them on credit.

172
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,000
We are going from bad to worse and can't make ends meet.

173
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,880
This is very ill omen.

174
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,280
I will bring people to retrieve them.

175
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,080
No.

176
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:38,680
Baizhan Bend is a dangerous place.

177
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,800
It's fine to lose the goods.

178
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,840
We can't let you lose your life.

179
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,880
But we can't starve ourselves to death.

180
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,800
There is always a way out.

181
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,760
We still have the sow, right?

182
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,920
Chief.

183
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,600
Bad news, Chief.

184
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,600
Second-in-command,

185
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,080
the sow is having a obstructed labor in the backyard.

186
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,800
What?

187
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,720
Chief. Chief.

188
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,960
Second-in-command.

189
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,920
You also have something to say?

190
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,840
It's bad news.

191
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,920
The private school Xiao'er attends sent a message saying

192
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,160
they will expel him

193
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,080
if we still put off paying his tuition fee.

194
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,160
Oh, my gosh.

195
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,600
Money. Money. Money.

196
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,360
It's early in the morning and all of you came to ask for money.

197
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,320
Haven't you got any good news?

198
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,360
I got it.

199
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,760
Chief. I got it. I got it.

200
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,320
Our watchdog Black is pregnant.

201
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,920
Should we give it some brown sugar?

202
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,760
We got a few more mouths to feed.

203
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,160
Even a hero will be stumped when penniless.

204
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,200
Dengdeng,

205
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,520
this is just the beginning

206
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,200
of such "good" life.

207
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,400
Dahai,

208
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,120
go to my room to fetch the mugwort

209
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,080
and burn it here.

210
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,680
Dengdeng,

211
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,120
you mother died young.

212
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,120
I can be said to be a mother to you.

213
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,680
I spent all my savings

214
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,120
buying beautiful clothes for you

215
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,840
just for you to look more decent out here.

216
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,280
Fine.

217
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,080
You just keep refusing to heed my advice.

218
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,320
Dahai,

219
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,960
notify our people in the stronghold

220
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,400
to dig the the Kaolinite behind the statue of Guanyin

221
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,000
and gnaw at the bark if we have to.

222
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,440
Let's see who will be lucky enough

223
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
to stay alive in the coming years.

224
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,040
Marrying a rich man can not only

225
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,280
dispel the bad luck,

226
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,680
but also get you dowry.

227
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,680
Wait.

228
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,480
Master.

229
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,000
Go down the mountain

230
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,480
and pick the richest family.

231
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,240
Let's go.

232
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,640
Mr. Lu, the last one I will recommend to you

233
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,360
is the fabulous new product of our shop,

234
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,880
the ultra long and ultra wide cosiest sedan chair with large space.

235
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,320
The sponge inside it is as thick as five fingers stacked up.

236
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,040
If I were not the owner of the sedan chair shop,

237
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,880
I would buy one for myself.

238
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,640
It is good indeed,

239
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,600
but it is not the kind

240
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,640
I want.

241
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,800
Mr. Lu,

242
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,240
you have seen all the sedan chairs of our shop.

243
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,200
If we can't give you the sedan chair you want,

244
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,440
nobody else will be able to.

245
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,760
How about your telling us directly

246
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,960
what kind of sedan chair do you want exactly.

247
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,840
Right.

248
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,000
To be honest with you,

249
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,360
what I want is

250
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
your shop's legendary sedan chair

251
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,880
that can perform magic.

252
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,800
Get out of the way.

253
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,360
Stand clear. Stand clear.

254
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,720
Is everything all right?

255
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,400
What is going on?

256
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,440
Is anyone hurt?

257
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:10,920
Mr. Lu,

258
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,040
I will do this for you.

259
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,160
Just leave it

260
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,120
to me.

261
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,160
Thank you. Thank you.

262
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,080
You are like a living Bodhisattva.

263
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,120
You are the savior of our Lu family.

264
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,280
Thank you.

265
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,760
Thank you.

266
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,240
Chang,

267
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,520
ask everybody to go out.

268
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,720
Hurry.

269
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,080
Guys, ask all the customers to go out.

270
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,760
Dear customers, sorry.

271
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,800
Today our shop is closed.

272
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,960
Please come to visit our shop tomorrow, all right?

273
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,520
Sorry. We are very sorry.

274
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:05,359
Sorry.

275
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,280
We are sorry. We are sorry.

276
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,440
Please come tomorrow, everybody.

277
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,240
Hurry up.

278
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,000
General.

279
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,080
General. General.

280
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,080
Xin.

281
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,360
Chang.

282
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,600
No, you are my master.

283
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,560
You finally got out of the ancient tomb.

284
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,000
Your master

285
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,400
can only be Yun Xi.

286
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,480
Then…

287
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,560
Then I will call you sir from now on.

288
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,160
Sir?

289
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,040
Xin,

290
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,560
after I woke up, I didn't find

291
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,960
the traces of Yun Xi on Qingquan Mountain.

292
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,200
Has she gathered her spiritual sense

293
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,440
and transmigrated?

294
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,720
Sir,

295
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,440
we made a dreadful mistake.

296
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,920
We lost our master.

297
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,080
It's all our fault.

298
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,320
We lost our master.

299
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,440
Sir,

300
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,800
what happened

301
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,600
to your clothes?

302
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,560
You ever said that

303
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,160
after the seal is removed,

304
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,920
the energy would be very unstable

305
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,400
and its amount would fluctuate.

306
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,560
This might change my appearance

307
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,600
or the appearance of my clothes.

308
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,680
But things will be fine soon.

309
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,440
Xin,

310
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,080
how did you find out

311
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,720
Yun Xi's spiritual feather vanished?

312
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Sir, over the past 3,000  years,

313
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,480
you have been trying to keep master's spirit together with energy.

314
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,200
However, 20 years ago,

315
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,360
I was injured by a passing spirit-hunter.

316
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,160
When I fled back,

317
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,760
I found the spiritual feather carrying master's spirit

318
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,440
had disappeared.

319
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,960
Yun Xi is not in this Qingquan Town.

320
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,280
In this town,

321
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,240
there are only a few ordinary spirit folks.

322
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,680
That's right, sir.

323
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,480
Our spirit clan has been on the decline.

324
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,000
We dare not clash with the human race at all.

325
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,600
We can only live on in degradation among the crowd.

326
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:14,000
Now most of our spirit clan have fled to Yingdu.

327
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,080
It is rare for several people of our spirit clan

328
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,080
to be seen in Qingquan Town.

329
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,600
Maybe I am responsible for

330
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,880
the situation

331
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,320
the spirit clan is stuck in today.

332
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,280
Sir, you mustn't say this.

333
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,840
If my master hadn't given you her energy core back then

334
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
and let Zhu Rong seize it,

335
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,400
it would be unimaginable

336
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,280
what this world would be like.

337
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,040
Who is it?

338
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,320
Why is there so much noise?

339
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,800
Can't I sleep in peace?

340
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,800
Why did you summon me,

341
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,680
General Yan?

342
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,080
Three thousand years ago,

343
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,680
I placed a spiritual feather

344
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,680
on the lake in this mountain.

345
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,080
The spiritual feather

346
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,040
suddenly went missing about 20 years ago.

347
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,960
You have been living in Qingquan Mountain.

348
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,960
Do you have any idea why it is gone?

349
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,480
Twenty years ago.

350
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,880
Twenty years ago.

351
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,840
I remember it.

352
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:24,840
The spiritual feather

353
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,080
has collected

354
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,400
someone's spirits.

355
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,160
But it was taken away by someone.

356
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,240
Taken away?

357
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,960
Did you see who did it?

358
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,600
I have no idea.

359
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,680
Hundreds of people pass by

360
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,240
Qingquan Mountain everyday.

361
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,440
I can't remember everyone.

362
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,080
My energy is limited

363
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,280
and couldn't protect it.

364
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,520
Moreover,

365
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,200
I didn't want to

366
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,640
start a conflict with humans.

367
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:51,920
You old...

368
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
You just said there are

369
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,960
hundreds of people passing by.

370
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,200
How come you only remember

371
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,760
the feather being taken away?

372
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,880
Right. Why?

373
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,200
I remember now.

374
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,760
That person

375
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,040
was holding onto a dagger

376
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,800
with a emblem on it.

377
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,240
Let me show you.

378
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That's the one.

379
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,120
Xin,

380
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,840
could you find some written documentation

381
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,440
of Qingquan Town's history for me?

382
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,760
I have prepared them. They're at home.

383
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,480
These are histories of the country.

384
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,720
But it's been three thousand years

385
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,240
since ancient Shu.

386
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
We use different characters now.

387
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:41,720
Sir,

388
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,560
shall I read to you?

389
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,080
No need.

390
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
I'll just read.

391
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,760
Sir.

392
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:33,720
Yes.

393
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,560
You won't draw others' attention

394
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,200
dressed this way now.

395
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,480
I now know everything

396
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,840
that has happened here.

397
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,680
Then have you found

398
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,440
any clue just now?

399
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,120
Sir?

400
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,280
What's wrong?

401
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,800
Have you energy gone backwards?

402
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,720
I'm fine.

403
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,120
It just comes back to me

404
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,480
every so often.

405
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,280
I only feel a little uncomfortable for now.

406
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,040
It hasn't started going backwards.

407
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,880
Carrying the energy core

408
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,560
of the Saintess as a human

409
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,480
makes you unable to control your energy.

410
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,000
It's will be very painful

411
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,160
and even make you out of your mind.

412
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
I can't imagine

413
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,200
how painful you have been

414
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,640
in the ancient tomb.

415
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,520
It's nothing

416
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,560
compared to Yunxi's sacrifice.

417
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,640
What matter the most

418
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,160
is to find her.

419
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,720
I will seal my energy

420
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,240
and release it when I get better

421
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,240
if there is no choice.

422
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,000
Pain will be nothing

423
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,160
for me

424
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,080
as long as I can get her back.

425
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,280
I wonder what master

426
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,040
will look like if we

427
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,920
see her again.

428
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,000
Will she

429
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,280
be a man?

430
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,960
Or

431
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,360
an animal?

432
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,480
I will look for her

433
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,320
no matter what she turns to.

434
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,400
Whether she becomes a flower, grass, tree

435
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,720
or a golden crow.

436
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,720
Even if she's a cloud, or a breeze.

437
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,400
Time for marriage.

438
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,320
Chief Yu.

439
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,280
Chief Yu.

440
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,360
Open the door.

441
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,160
Let's shout.

442
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,960
Shush, shush.

443
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,680
Open the door. Open the door.

444
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,280
My father-in-law. Open the door.

445
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,920
We all have manners.

446
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,480
It's not polite to shout.

447
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:39,720
Sooner or later

448
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,800
you have to open the door.

449
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,000
If you don't,

450
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,760
I will break.

451
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,200
Dad.

452
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,640
I don't want to marry her.

453
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,640
Son.

454
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,160
I have no choice

455
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,320
on this.

456
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,360
They have

457
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,600
something on us.

458
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,800
I really have no choice.

459
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,960
Don't worry.

460
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,280
Today,

461
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,200
I will teach them a lesson.

462
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,480
Open the door.

463
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,520
Come on.

464
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,160
Come on. Master.

465
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,960
Take a sip of tea and have a rest first.

466
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,160
Chief.

467
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,120
The dowry is of great fortune.

468
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,400
You are the groom.

469
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,720
Nice face.

470
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,400
But your body

471
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,960
seems weak, doesn't it?

472
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,160
Master. He is a young master,

473
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,840
it's normal for him to be delicate.

474
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,600
I can't believe this.

475
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,440
Bring him into the sedan.

476
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:02,760
Dad.

477
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:03,680
Come on. Let's go.

478
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,280
Son.

479
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,040
Mom.

480
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,360
Dad.

481
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,840
Son. Son.

482
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,080
Father-in-law,

483
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:10,680
Dad.

484
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,600
You've got a good house.

485
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,560
You.

486
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,960
What do you mean?

487
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,160
Nothing.

488
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
I heard you're running

489
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,920
a raw opium business.

490
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,360
Raw opium is bad for people.

491
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,680
You'd better stop soon.

492
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,640
Also,

493
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,680
we are a family now.

494
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,720
I'll come back to take more money

495
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,760
after we've finished up the dowery.

496
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,560
You.

497
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,360
That's great.

498
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,280
Come on.

499
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,120
Go in there.

500
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,480
Master Lu is generous

501
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,440
to give us so much money.

502
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,880
We can live on it for a long time.

503
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,480
Master. It's so wise and brave

504
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,080
of you. We all rely on you.

505
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,680
It's no big deal.

506
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,720
Folks will call this

507
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,520
living off a man.

508
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,880
Everyone, keep a low profile.

509
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,040
Count the money and distribute them

510
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,000
to the poor villagers down the mountain.

511
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,360
Okay. Okay.

512
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:17,800
What's wrong?

513
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:19,560
Have you brought your weapons?

514
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:20,560
Of course.

515
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,280
Don't you think

516
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,240
it is extremely silent today?

517
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,400
Is it?

518
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
Everything alright in the back?

519
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,120
Yes.

520
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,760
Alright? Truly?

521
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
Truly.

522
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,680
Then how come the crying baby stopped?

523
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,080
He has been crying all the way.

524
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,680
He is tired.

525
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,360
He is taking a breath in here.

526
00:27:59,400 --> 00:27:59,880
Yes. Yes. Yes.

527
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,800
Master, something is wrong.

528
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,880
The man is quiet.

529
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,400
Check inside.

530
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,760
As you wish. Chief.

531
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,520
No way. No way.

532
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,840
It's a marriage sedan.

533
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,560
Yes.

534
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,000
Master, they say this is a marriage sedan.

535
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,480
Why not open it yourself?

536
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,960
Otherwise he may suffocate to death.

537
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,280
Yeah. Open it yourself.

538
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,120
Chief. It's not lucky to open it.

539
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,040
Really. Unlucky.

540
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:24,720
Go away.

541
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:25,320
It…

542
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,600
Where is he?

543
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,600
Oh my god.

544
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,400
What happened here?

545
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,640
Why is it this instead?

546
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,360
Why is he gone?

547
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:39,880
What's the matter?

548
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,720
So horrifying.

549
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,400
Who on earth did it?

550
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,920
Who did it? Who did it?

551
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
The Lu's dare to cheat us.

552
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,560
How dare they cheat Qingquan camp?

553
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,720
How dare they?

554
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,440
Guys. Go back and get the groom.

555
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,800
Go. Go.

556
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,600
Hold on.

557
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,880
We all watched the younger master of the Lu's

558
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,960
entering the sedan.

559
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,400
This wench is the only one

560
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,480
who has touched the sedan along the way.

561
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,200
I didn't.

562
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,360
Now the groom is missing.

563
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,640
It's her who played the trick.

564
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,040
Wedding wench, I don't think you can cover it anymore.

565
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,560
You helped

566
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,480
them to steal our groom.

567
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,000
I have nothing to do with this.

568
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,560
You have nothing to do with this?

569
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,880
If so, who on earth did it?

570
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,160
What's the matter? Tell the truth.

571
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,840
Tell the truth. Tell the truth.

572
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,120
Say it. Quickly.

573
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,440
Are you confessing or not?

574
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,240
I don't know.

575
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,400
You're not saying, are you.

576
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,680
Alright.

577
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,960
I'm not interested in that delicate

578
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,560
young master anyway.

579
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,160
I heard your son is going to college this year.

580
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,080
I suppose he has turned 18, right?

581
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,680
Forgive me. Chief.

582
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,880
I confess.

583
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,800
It is the sedan.

584
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,600
The sedan? What's wrong with the sedan?

585
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,200
The sedan.

586
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,520
I heard a tale.

587
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,280
It's three or five years ago.

588
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,560
The saying goes

589
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,200
that there was a girl who didn't want to get married.

590
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,120
So her family went to Xin's Sedan Chair Company

591
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,560
and rented the marriage sedan.

592
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,880
The girl went missing halfway.

593
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,560
Where did she go?

594
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,200
This is kind of absurd.

595
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,200
Fess up.

596
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,240
It is said.

597
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:17,560
It is said that the sedan is a magical one.

598
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,080
Something like the western magic trick

599
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,360
where they make a living person disappear.

600
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,680
It's said the girl

601
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,240
entered the sedan

602
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,040
and then came out from another one.

603
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,640
In a second, she appeared in a neighboring town.

604
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,440
She just disappeared.

605
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,280
She entered the sedan in public

606
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,840
and disappeared along the way.

607
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,560
You can't find trouble with her family either.

608
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,120
Moreover,

609
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,280
the Lu's have gone out of the town now.

610
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,440
You can't get them now.

611
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,240
Chief.

612
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,360
Chief. Check this out.

613
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,760
Chief, check this.

614
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,800
These are all stones.

615
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,840
Just a stone left here.

616
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,760
It's really werid.

617
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:50,840
What is going on?

618
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:51,840
What's the matter?

619
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,120
What's the matter?

620
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,200
The groom has escaped.

621
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,360
How come the dowry disappeared too?

622
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,120
Yeah.

623
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,680
Tell us. Where is the dowry?

624
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,200
Xin's Sedan Chair Company.

625
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,640
Dahai,

626
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,960
bring some men.

627
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,720
Let's see

628
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,640
who is playing

629
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,000
the trick on us.

630
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,440
Guys.

631
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,560
Let's go.

632
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,240
Go

633
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,880
Let's get even with him. Get even with him.

634
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:15,600
Let's go.

635
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,720
Go away. Go away. Go away.

636
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,360
Step aside.

637
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,560
There it is. Go away. Go away.

638
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,960
Master. There's the company.

639
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,880
It is here. The company. Let's go.

640
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,840
Guys. Let's go.

641
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,280
Go. Go. Go.

642
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:29,680
Come on. Come on. Get in.

643
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:30,880
Get in.

644
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,920
Open the door. Open the door.

645
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,560
Open the door. Open it.

646
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,520
Hurry up. Get out.

647
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,880
Get out. Do you hear us?

648
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,440
Go away.

649
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,320
Don't hide.

650
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,760
There's definitely something about this door.

651
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,840
Master only used 10% of her strength.

652
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,120
The door is weird.

653
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,760
It definitely is.

654
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,280
All of you, shout.

655
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,120
What should we shout?

656
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,400
Unethical Sedan Company. Return my husband.

657
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,360
Master. Are you serious?

658
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:07,480
Shout.

659
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,840
Unethical Sedan Company. Return my husband.

660
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,400
Unethical Sedan Company. Return my husband.

661
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,640
Unethical Sedan Company.

662
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,760
Louder.

663
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,440
Unethical Sedan Company. Return my husband.

664
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:20,240
Unethical Sedan Company. Return my husband.

665
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,840
What's happening?

666
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:24,840
Let's go take a look.

667
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,600
Come on.

668
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,720
Go away. Go away.

669
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,440
Don't move.

670
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:39,640
Stop running.

671
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,240
Hurry.

672
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,520
Go away.

673
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:54,880
Go away.

674
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,880
Go away.

675
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,480
Don't come close. Don't.

676
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,480
I'll shoot him dead if you come closer.

677
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,760
Stay away. Stay away.

678
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,640
Those bunch of bastards.

679
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,080
Master.

680
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,280
Take him away.Yes

681
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:28,880
Hurry up. Go.

682
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,600
Sir.

683
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,480
Sir.

684
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,280
Sir, are you alright?

685
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,680
Master. Master.

686
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,600
Are you alright? Master.

687
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,520
Master. Wake up. Wake up.

688
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,520
What's wrong?

689
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,080
Master, what's wrong?

690
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,040
She is not Yunxi.

691
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,360
The…The short man.

692
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,760
He seems to be the boss of the company.

693
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,160
I heard their company earns a lot.

694
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,120
What about asking for a double compensation?

695
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,600
No.

696
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,840
Plan changed.

697
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,680
This time,

698
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,080
I want to have the man.
