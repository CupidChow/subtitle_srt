[Episode 34]

27
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,190
The shadow of Dengdeng is fading.

28
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,390
I just checked

29
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,940
the vital energy, blood and veins in her body

30
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,450
and found that almost half of them has exhausted.

31
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:50,479
At this rate,

32
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,460
even with my energy,

33
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:54,160
she won't last more than a few days.

34
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,150
So quickly?

35
00:01:58,259 --> 00:01:58,900
Could it be...

36
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,080
Ma'am can only

37
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:02,950
wait and be swallowed by it?

Dahong.

39
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,280
I didn't expect

40
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,560
you're the only one who can talk with me now.

41
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:28,510
I've been in a trouble lately.

42
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,020
She came back to life.

43
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,710
I sealed her before.

44
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,900
She seemed to take revenge on me.

45
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,880
When I was in Ancient Shu,

46
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,670
I was shocked

47
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,070
by what Wei Du said.

48
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,700
But I didn't take it seriously.

49
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,750
I didn't expect

50
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,360
it was all true.

51
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,480
The words of the Wei Du

52
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,810
is fulfilled one by one.

53
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,050

60
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,240
Everything is so real.

61
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,050
I've never been so scared.

62
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,700
Every night, I dream that someone dies.

63
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,150
They will really die the next day.

64
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,530
I can't tell

65
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,570
whether I killed them

66
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,040
or that person did?

67
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,730
It's really horrible.

68
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,690
She's just killing people now.

69
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:40,900
I don't know

70
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,700
what else she would do.

71
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,190
I only know

72
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,040
this must be stopped.

73
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,560
We can't go on like this.

74
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,800
Since I am the Saintess,

75
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,100
I must protect my family,

76
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:59,020
humans and the spirit clan.

77
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,700

She hit me cross the air again today.

She might attack me soon.

You and Ma'am love each other.

I feel ashamed.

165

I'm just afraid

166

By doing so, make Dengdeng safe

171
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,720
in the future.

172
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,500
But...

173
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,940
But I'm afraid

174
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,940
what Ma'am wants is not safety.

175
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,620
If you are gone,

176
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,200
Ma'am will no longer be happy.

177
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,660
This matter

178
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,490
concerns the safety of the world.

179
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,810
It has been Yun Xi's belief as well as mine

180
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,150
for 3,000 years.

181
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,650
So either Dengdeng or I

182
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,830
must do it.

183
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,500
Xin.

184
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,770
I've made up my mind.

185
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,820
Say no more.

186
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:54,600
Sir,

187
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,250
I'll listen to you.

188
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,970
What are you thinking?

189
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,740
Nothing.

190
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,110
Yesterday,

191
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,520
I saw Bai Shiqi and Gu Beixi

192
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,630
meeting again after a long separation

193
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,330
at the foot of the mountain.

194
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,250
They smiled so happily.

195
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:35,700
I finally understand

196
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,120
there is a feeling.

197
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,350
That's getting back what he lost.

198
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,760
As for Gu Beixi.

199
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,360
I've known him for so many years.

200
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,140
Although he's stubborn,

201
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:47,770
I know

202
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,650
he has already fallen in love Miss Bai.

203
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,220
I believe they will be happy

204
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,020
in the future.

205
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,700
Dengdeng.

206
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,100
Let's get married.

207
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,620
What?

208
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,300
How do you know...

209
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,040
What can you hide from me?

210
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,360
Besides,

211
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,550
I know what you're thinking.

212
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,700
You eavesdropping thief!

213
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,480
I didn't.

214
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,310
Fine, you listened openly.

215
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,740
What am I thinking now?

216
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:38,990
Now?

217
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:41,820
Yes.

218
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,330
Miss me?

219
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,300
You've almost learned

220
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,200
my attitude which is not serious.

221
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:52,900
From now on,

222
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,790
you don't have to worry about others bullying you anymore.

223
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,210
With you around, no one dares to bully me.

224
00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,740
Without me,

225
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,170
no one can bully you.

226
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,720
Besides, General Yan is so powerful,

227
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,210
and has the energy core to protect yourself.

228
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,000
Who can bully you?

229
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,350
Dengdeng, you should know

230
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:13,520
in this world,

231
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,410
only you can hurt me.

232
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,250
So be careful

233
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,060
in the future.

234
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,960
Come to think of it,

235
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:26,680
I'm so capable!

236
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,360
Because General Yan is so brave and invincible.

237
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,090
But I can hurt you.

238
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,420
What's more,

239
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,630
what's wrong with you today?

240
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,820
You are so active today.

241
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,120
Did you have a fever?

242
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,950
Dengdeng.

243
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,660
You took me as your wife before.

244
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,400
I'll take you as my wife this time.

245
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,020
But this time I marry you

246
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,090
because I hope you can

247
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,840
be happy

248
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,100
and healthy later.

No matter what happens,

250
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,620
I don't want you to cry anymore.

251
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,570
Then don't give me a chance to cry.

252
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,250
Otherwise, I'll make fun of you.

Unfortunately,

258

it's too short.

259
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,990
The shorter it is,

00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,060
the more beautiful it is.

261
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,450
Why don't we remember today?

262
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,480
Okay.

263
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,510
Let me

264
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:47,160
take a good look at you.

And a pretty mouth.

You're indeed the one I like.

You're handsome everywhere.

This is...

The fragrance of them never dissipates.

After that, they lived together

342
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:08,950
ask for your permission.

343
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,090
What happened before didn't count.

344
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:11,980
This time,

345
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,630
we want to get married willingly.

346
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,130
We want a formal wedding.

347
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:18,120
Yu,

348
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:19,890
I think Lu Yan is good.

349
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,020
As long as he is good to Dengdeng,

350
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,060
we should give him a title.

351
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,760
Besides, Dengdeng made us so worried yesterday.

352
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,900
I think there may be some evil thing

353
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,040
in our village.

354
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,700
Marriage is good for bringing good luck.

355
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:34,860
I agree.

356
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,590
Let me pick the date for you.

357
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,720
Next month, OK?

358
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,060
No need. The day after tomorrow.

359
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,410
The day after tomorrow?

360
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:43,530
Is it so urgent?

361
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,020
Daughter.

362
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,130
Do you think it's like a deal with street vendors?

363
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,890
After paying, you can take your goods away.

364
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,440
Yes.

365
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:51,000
It's too hasty.

366
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,780
Dad, don't worry.

367
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,300
Lu Yan is the most decent and reliable man.

368
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,510
He won't treat me badly.

369
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,230
Really?

370
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,190
Why didn't he tell me

371
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:59,690
such a big thing?

372
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,570
I disagree.

373
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,460
I'm on your father's side about this.

374
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,550
It's so hasty.

375
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,470
Marriage is not a child's play.

376
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,170
Exactly.

377
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,910
Father.

378
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:12,920
Father.

379
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,980
Don't be angry, father.

380
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,260
I know

381
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,480
You pretend to be angry.

382
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,450
Actually,

383
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,160
you're happy.

384
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,110
Am I right?

385
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,250
My dengdeng!

386
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,380
What's so good about him?

387
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,910
He's old and unromantic.

388
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,820
Unlike your father,

389
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,870
I'm so handsome and sensible.

390
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,370
Father, when did you become so shallow?

391
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,350
You tricked my mother

392
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,060
with just two sheep.

393
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,080
Besides,

394
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,230
old wine is the best.

395
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:51,720
Lu Yan was the General of Ancient Shu 3,000 years ago.

396
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,830
Antique! It's very valuable.

397
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,340
How dare you!

398
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:58,710
Alright.

399
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:00,750
Father.

400
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,240
Uncle.

401
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,330
I'll tell you the truth.

402
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:13,220
Don't laugh at me.

403
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,840
I really like Lu Yan.

404
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,810
He really loves me.

405
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,150
I live as a chieftain every day.

406
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,070
I've been stuck in the chieftain.

407
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,110
Actually, I have imagined

408
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:44,650
one day, I would wear a red wedding dress

409
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,810
and be accepted by the hero in my heart.

410
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,490
Lu Yan was the hero of Ancient Shu

411
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,860
three thousand years ago.

412
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,850
Now,

413
00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:57,850
he's also the hero in my heart.

414
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,880
So,

415
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,160
sooner or later,

416
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,430
I would marry him.

417
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:12,600
You must be very beautiful in the wedding dress.

418
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,590
For seeing your daughter off and welcoming your son-in-law in,

419
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,700
they are totally different feelings.

420
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,180
My daughter grew up and now is getting married.

421
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,240
I know that it must happen,

422
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,090
I am reluctant to

423
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,460
leave you.

424
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,260
Enough, Yu.

425
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,040
Father.

426
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,460
Enough.

427
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,280
Marriage is a good thing.

428
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,200
Yes.

429
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,580
Besides,

430
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,230
can we control her temper?

431
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,050
No.

432
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,270
This is...

433
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,910
This is too hasty.

434
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,430
Okay, it's up to you.

435
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:02,900
You go back first.

436
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,770
I need to talk to him.

437
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,300
Come on. Go out with uncle.

438
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,190
Xin, come out.

439
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,410
Hurry up.

440
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,180
Sit down.

441
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,170
It was cloudy for three days.

442
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,390
It's not a good omen.

443
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,420
How did you know?

444
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,440
By divination?

445
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,500
No need.

446
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,660
Am I a freeloader?

447
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,170
Are you sure?

448
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,100
What is not a good omen?

449
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,830
I haven't seen you predict something for so many years.

450
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:05,540
It's okay.

451
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,730
Just get married.

452
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,890
You and Lu Yan still have a long time.

453
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,600
I'll buy you something.

454
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:16,280
Last time, the wedding was in turmoil.

455
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,690
This time, I will definitely

456
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,950
hold a perfect wedding for you.

457
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,220
Ma'am, we'll go down the mountain to buy something tomorrow.

458
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,010
Is there anything Xin needs to prepare?

459
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,670
You just need to help me

460
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:34,890
prepare Lu Yan tomorrow.

461
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,300
I'm going to give him a surprise.

462
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,760
Okay, Mr. Lu will be very happy if he knows.

463
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:46,530
Lu Yan always has a long face.

464
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,580
I wonder if this surprise will work on him.

465
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,500
Xin,

466
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,220
why do you look so sad?

467
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,760
Tomorrow, Lu Yan and I

468
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,760
will have a real wedding tomorrow.

469
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,700
What happened? Are you unhappy?

470
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,140
Of course not.

471
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,310
Ma'am, don't worry.

472
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,290
I will prepare the most beautiful bridal sedan in this world

473
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,470
for you and Mr. Lu.

474
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,760
Although Mr. Lu is not eloquent,

475
00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:18,540
he always cares about you.

476
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,340
If he knows you prepare a surprise for him,

477
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,910
he must be happy.

478
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,900
Xin.

479
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,100
Why are you so cheesy today?

480
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,410
Teach your lordship

481
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,210
some sweet and romantic words tomorrow.

482
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,520
Sure.

483
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,860
Have a seat.

484
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:07,160
Lu Yan.

485
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,550
Dengdeng told me just now

486
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,870
that you will hold a wedding

487
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,560
the day after tomorrow.

488
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,270
It's a hasty matter,

489
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,210
but don't worry.

490
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,190
I, Paralyzed Yu and her uncle

491
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,920
will definitely hold

492
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,710
a grand wedding.

493
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,230
Don't worry.

494
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,380
Lu Yan,

495
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,270
you know that

496
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,450
Dengdeng lost her mother when she was young.

497
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,630
Since she was young,

498
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,170
she has been around me

499
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,160
and never left me.

500
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,240
I never thought

501
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,340
she would leave me one day.

502
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,800
But ever since she met you,

503
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,940
she's been absent-minded.

504
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:10,880
The only thing she talks about every day is you.

505
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,080
To be honest,

506
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,030
I didn't like you

507
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,320
at the beginning.

508
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,110
I was afraid that you'll take her away

509
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,310
from me.

510
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,170
For so long,

511
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:37,070
I've been observing you silently.

512
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,620
I wanted to see

513
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,330

I, Paralyzed Yu have one more thing to tell you.

525
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,350
After a couple gets married,

526
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,000
quarrels are common.

527
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,290
Dengdeng has a bad temper sometimes.

528
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,030
I hope that you

529
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,420
