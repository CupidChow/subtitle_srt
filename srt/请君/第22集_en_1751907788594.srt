1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll never let you go after you leave

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You are me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You are me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You are me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'll never let you go after you leave

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You are me

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Episode 1

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What's wrong?

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What's wrong?

10
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
My father

11
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He's going to kill the spiritual clan in the execution ground today

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
When?

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Today

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
All the guards in my house were transferred

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll inform them

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Sir, what's wrong with you?

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Mr. Bai sent a letter

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Mr. Bai is going to kill all the spiritual clans in the execution ground

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What?

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Then I'll tell them

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
A Xin

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll go take a look

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You take care of Deng Deng and the others

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Sir, I'll go with you

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Don't worry

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'll take care of this

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't worry too much

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Be quiet

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Be quiet

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Be quiet

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Be quiet

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Be quiet

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Be quiet

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Be quiet

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Be quiet

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Be quiet

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Be quiet

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Be quiet

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Be quiet

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Be quiet

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Be quiet

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Be quiet

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Stop

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Stop

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't move

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Stop

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Stop

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You're being rude

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Stay right there

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't move

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I know

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
In the sentence

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I know

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What?

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Where is Deng Deng?

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The old housekeeper just went to bed

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The master is watching

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Go find Lu Yan

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I have something important to talk to him

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Are you talking about the execution ground?

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The master already went

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How did he know?

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The master doesn't dare to force people

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,680
I...

66
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,400
Nangang,

67
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,040
I'll go out and do something.

68
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,040
Take care of your father.

69
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,160
Gu Bei Xi.

70
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,000
Gu Bei Xi.

71
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,040
Gu Bei Xi.

72
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
What's going on?

73
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:33,920
It's private.

74
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,080
Private?

75
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,000
You're so flustered.

76
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,280
I knew you when you were in the open warehouse.

77
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,400
You want to hide it from me?

78
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,360
Tell me.

79
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,480
What's going on?

80
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:49,880
A Xin.

81
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,280
What's up?

82
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,080
Are you two hiding something from me?

83
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,120
What can we do?

84
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:03,600
Where's Lu Yan?

85
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,480
Where's Lu Yan? Why didn't you see him?

86
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,360
Sir, he...

87
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,560
Tell me.

88
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,680
Where's Lu Yan?

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,760
Sir.

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,720
What's wrong with him?

91
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,360
Shi Qi sent a message.

92
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,200
He said he was going to kill the spiritual clan at the execution ground.

93
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,280
He went to save him.

94
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,840
You let him go alone?

95
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,520
Sir, I stayed and took care of you.

96
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,120
He didn't have to do that.

97
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,760
I was about to save him.

98
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,680
But you found out.

99
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,160
Who told you to take care of me?

100
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,080
He's my man.

101
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,160
I'm going to go.

102
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,120
Don't meddle in the business of men.

103
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,560
Stay and take care of your father.

104
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,280
Leave the rest to me.

105
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,200
Gu Bei Xi.

106
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,080
You know the situation is dangerous.

107
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:40,760
With my personality,

108
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,200
you should know you won't just sit around and do nothing.

109
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,760
Besides, the spiritual clan is in danger.

110
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,640
At such a critical moment,

111
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,720
you let me wait at home?

112
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,080
Da Hai.

113
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,040
You're a bad guy.

114
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,720
Go to the execution ground.

115
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,120
Wait.

116
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,280
Your father has something to say to you.

117
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:58,480
Father.

118
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,360
I heard

119
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,680
you're going to the execution ground.

120
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,880
Father.

121
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,880
Don't stop me this time.

122
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,320
The spiritual clan is in danger.

123
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,880
I can't let Lu Yan go alone.

124
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,960
I promise you.

125
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,800
I'll come back safely.

126
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,040
You also promise me.

127
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,280
You must stop me.

128
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,160
I promise you.

129
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,040
I won't stop you.

130
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,680
I'm not like your mother.

131
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,640
Before your mother was killed,

132
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,280
I...

133
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,440
I didn't save your mother in time.

134
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,440
But you're different.

135
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,560
You've been smart and smart since you were a child.

136
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,680
I hope you can save her.

137
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,800
I can't leave a new brother

138
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,000
like I did before.

139
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,760
Look at you.

140
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,720
You're persuading me.

141
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,480
Why are you feeling uncomfortable?

142
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,160
It's my fault.

143
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,120
I remember

144
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,280
I feel

145
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,760
sorry for you two.

146
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,840
As a father,

147
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,560
my mother and I

148
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,400
have never complained about you.

149
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,000
We know

150
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,520
you're going to do something big.

151
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,040
Wait.

152
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,400
Promise me.

153
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,240
You must come back safely.

154
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,240
Okay.

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,880
I promise you.

156
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,760
I'll come back safely.

157
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,640
You also promise me.

158
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,640
You want to kill us.

159
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,120
We don't want to kill you.

160
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,720
We don't want to kill you.

161
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,320
We don't want to kill you.

162
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,640
We don't want to kill you.

163
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,400
Director.

164
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,520
It's noon.

165
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,680
Everything is ready.

166
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:15,960
Execute.

167
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,560
Execute.

168
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Execute.

169
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,040
Execute.

170
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,040
Execute.

171
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,360
I'm sorry.

172
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,280
Let us go.

173
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,280
I'm sorry.

174
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Shoot.

175
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
Let's go.

176
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,200
You dare to break in?

177
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
Shoot.

178
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
It's a monster.

179
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,760
Come on.

180
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:21,760
Come on.

181
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,760
Shoot.

182
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,240
You dare to break in?

183
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,360
You dare to break in?

184
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,500
I'm your enemy.

185
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,500
Whether you can

186
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,920
still and alive,

187
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,680
Go.

188
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,600
Monsters.

189
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,760
They are all monsters.

190
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,720
Kill them.

191
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,280
Use more firepower.

192
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,280
Kill them all.

193
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,520
Somebody...

194
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,080
Help.

195
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,400
even mosquitoes can't get in.

196
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,880
Master, what should we do now?

197
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,080
Break in.

198
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,040
How can we break in?

199
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,240
We're the enemy.

200
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,360
Break in again?

201
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,400
Are you crazy?

202
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,560
With our guns,

203
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,000
we can't even break in.

204
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,480
We can't even break in.

205
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,840
I'm the most experienced one.

206
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,480
Haven't you heard of this saying?

207
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,440
The sound of the east and the west.

208
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,000
The sound of the east and the west.

209
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:44,920
What's going on?

210
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,480
Hurry.

211
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,640
That way. Hurry.

212
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,520
Watch out.

213
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,200
You can't kill me, can you?

214
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,120
Come on.

215
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,960
Increase the firepower.

216
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,360
Kill him.

217
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,840
Hurry.

218
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,440
Hurry.

219
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,640
Take the bullets.

220
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,400
Oh, no.

221
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,520
We're going to be caught.

222
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,400
I can't bear to let the kids run away.

223
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,600
I don't believe it.

224
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,400
I'll go distract the firepower.

225
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,280
Let's go over the wall.

226
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:55,800
Okay.

227
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,640
Let's split up.

228
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,400
What the hell is this?

229
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,920
We can't even kill them.

230
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,240
I didn't want to hurt you.

231
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,520
Xiaolong.

232
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,800
Xiaolong, run.

233
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,920
Run?

234
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,480
Come back.

235
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,200
Don't think about running away this time.

236
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,680
You don't think that after killing me,

237
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,920
the spirits in the spirit tribe will disappear, right?

238
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,360
What do you mean?

239
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,160
Actually, you've always been very clear.

240
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,360
The only way to reduce the spirits in their body

241
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,400
is to release all the primordial energy in your body.

242
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,160
Sacrifice yourself.

243
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,280
Sacrifice yourself.

244
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,800
Sacrifice yourself.

245
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,920
Sacrifice yourself.

246
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,960
Sacrifice yourself.

247
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,080
Sacrifice yourself.

248
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,080
Sacrifice yourself.

249
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
Sacrifice yourself.

250
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Sacrifice yourself.

251
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,840
I'm curious.

252
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,080
Today, did you choose to continue to protect Yu Deng Deng

253
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,640
or save these poor spirits?

254
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,240
General Yan.

255
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,760
I hope you like the gift I've prepared for you.

256
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Deng Deng.

257
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,800
I'm sorry.

258
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,320
Deng Deng.

259
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Xiaolong.

260
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,720
I've been gathering for you.

261
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,920
Yi University...

262
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,280
Junior Brother...

263
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,120
Zhao Yunlanja

264
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,860
Why would you kill yourself if you don't love me?

265
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,520
One piece of cassette tape processes memories

266
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,740
into some kind of comic book drama.

267
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,340
Directed by微光

268
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,220
One piece of cassette tape processes memories

269
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,820
But I'm afraid I'm going to break my promise today.

270
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,700
Ru Yan!

271
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,700
Sir!

272
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,220
Sir!

273
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,220
Ru Yan!

274
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,220
Sir!

275
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,220
Sir!

276
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,220
Ru Yan!

277
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,220
Wake up!

278
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,220
Sir!

279
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:21,220
You've grown stronger, haven't you?

280
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,220
Whoever told you not to cough,

281
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,220
you should cough yourself!

282
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,220
You're not a man!

283
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,220
You're a man!

284
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,220
You're a man!

285
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,220
You're a man!

286
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,220
You're a man!

287
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,220
If you don't cough,

288
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,220
you'll come on your own!

289
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,220
Deng Deng,

290
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,220
I'm sorry.

291
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,220
What sorry?

292
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,220
Don't talk about these kind of dirty words!

293
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,220
I'm telling you,

294
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,220
you're mine!

295
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,220
You don't have my approval!

296
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,220
No one is allowed to let you die!

297
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,220
Did you hear me?

298
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,220
Promise me,

299
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,220
from now on,

300
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,220
you must

301
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:53,220
live well.

302
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,220
If I don't promise,

303
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:55,860
I won't agree.

304
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,660
Why should I agree?

305
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:08,300
Sir.

306
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,260
Sir.

307
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,340
Lu Yan.

308
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,260
Lu Yan.

309
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:13,620
Sir.

310
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,580
General Yuan.

311
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,500
Wake up.

312
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,140
Wake up.

313
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,700
Don't be afraid.

314
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,340
I'll give you the Yuan energy.

315
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:26,180
You'll be fine after you get the Yuan energy.

316
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,380
Hold on.

317
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,300
Hold on.

318
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,180
A'Qing, help me!

319
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:50,660
No.

320
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,060
Lu Yan.

321
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,300
Didn't you say you'd protect me forever?

322
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,580
Didn't you say you'd be with me forever?

323
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,060
You can't just keep quiet.

324
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,820
Wake up.

325
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,220
A'Qing.

326
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,940
A'Qing.

327
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,620
Sir, don't do this.

328
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,180
You'll die.

329
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,380
You'll die.

330
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,100
Sir.

331
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,140
Move!

332
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,940
All of you, move!

333
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,420
Lu Yan.

334
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,620
You'll die one day.

335
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,660
You'll die.

336
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,820
You'll die.

337
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,900
You'll die.

338
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,380
You'll be my husband one day.

339
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,140
You'll be my husband forever.

340
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,820
You're mine.

341
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,500
Even God can't take it from me.

342
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,260
I didn't let you die three thousand years ago.

343
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,820
Now I won't let you die either.

344
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,900
The wind blows.

345
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,140
The rain falls when I'm with you.

346
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,660
The rain falls.

347
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,660
The rain falls.

348
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:38,020
I'm a meteor.

349
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,100
I'm like a flower with a lily.

350
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,700
But I'm a ghost.

351
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,300
Yuan Dan.

352
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,140
You're the one.

353
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,340
If you're really mine three thousand years ago,

354
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:58,420
I'll ask you to listen to me again.

355
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,180
Please help me, Lu Yan.

356
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,100
Save him.

357
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,940
He's been waiting for me for three thousand years.

358
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:11,260
He's lonely.

359
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,340
He finally found me.

360
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,700
I can't let him leave me like this.

361
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,100
I want to be with him.

362
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,100
You're like a yearning.

363
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:27,100
Can you help me again?

364
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,020
I finally waited for him.

365
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,220
We still have a lot of things to do together.

366
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,540
We'll have a lot of children.

367
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,820
We'll watch them grow up together.

368
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,020
Do a lot of things.

369
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,620
Please.

370
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,740
Please help us.

371
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,020
Help us grow older together.

372
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,900
I'm not your only one.

373
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,900
Time is so short.

374
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,660
We still have such a long way to go.

375
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,980
Can you help us grow up together?

376
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,540
We'll go�

377
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,380
after we die?

378
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,660
Oh, my, my, my, my 해주세요

379
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,920
St 봬、St 봬!

380
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,540
This is St. Cloud's stall!

381
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,560
St. Cloud! St. Cloud!

382
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,960
St. Cloud! St. Cloud!

383
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,660
St. Cloud!

384
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,020
St. Cloud!

385
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,580
Please don't die!

386
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,300
St. Cloud!

387
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,620
Please don't die!

388
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,540
Take care of yourself, Sister.

389
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,380
General Bai!

390
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,380
General Bai is awake!

391
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,380
Great!

392
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,380
You're awake.

393
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,380
You're finally awake.

394
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,380
This is great.

395
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,380
Tell me what to do.

396
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:41,380
You owe the head of the Yu family another life.

397
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,380
I think you'll never be able to pay off your debt in this life.

398
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,380
If you can't pay off your debt in this life,

399
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:49,380
then in the next life,

400
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,380
in the next life...

401
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,380
Sir, you're finally awake.

402
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,380
You're finally awake.

403
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,380
Master, I didn't think you'd have these two tricks.

404
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:02,380
You... you should have given these two tricks to me.

405
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:05,380
You don't have this talent.

406
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,380
I'm telling you,

407
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:09,380
in the future, the head of the Yu family will be watching you.

408
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,380
No one dares to bully you.

409
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,380
Okay.

410
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:16,380
Let's go.

411
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,380
Let's go home.

412
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,380
What?

413
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,380
You're not used to it?

414
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,380
Let's go.

415
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,380
Thank you, Young Lady!

416
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,380
Thank you, Young Master!

417
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,380
Hurry.

418
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,380
Thank you, Young Master!

419
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,380
Thank you, Young Master!

420
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,380
Okay, okay.

421
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,380
Don't be so polite.

422
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,380
Thank you, Young Master!

423
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,380
Thank you, Young Master!

424
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,380
Thank you, Young Master!

425
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,380
Thank you, Young Master!

426
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,380
Thank you, Young Master!

427
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,380
Look at you.

428
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,380
No one want to be your help.

429
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:40,380
No one want to join!

430
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,380
She only ate after Poppin.

431
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,380
Thank you, General Yan.

432
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,380
Thank you, General Yan.

433
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,380
You're all recovered.

434
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,380
Yes, we're all recovered.

435
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,380
Father.

436
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,380
My daughter.

437
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,380
You're recovered.

438
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,380
I'm fine.

439
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,380
I'm like a cow now.

440
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,380
It's okay.

441
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,380
I'll go and get you some water.

442
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,380
It's okay.

443
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,380
We're worried about you.

444
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,380
You're all recovered.

445
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,380
So we're celebrating.

446
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,380
We drank less.

447
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,380
Yes.

448
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,380
You scared me.

449
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,380
It's okay.

450
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,380
Congratulations, General Yan.

451
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,380
Young lady.

452
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,380
We've waited for you for 3,000 years.

453
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,380
We've waited for you for 3,000 years.

454
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,380
Someone has made the decision for us.

455
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,380
Yes.

456
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,380
You can finally live a peaceful life.

457
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,380
Thank you, young lady.

458
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:46,380
This is the only carrot I have for you.

459
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,380
Thank you, little rabbit.

460
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:52,380
I'll treasure this gift of yours.

461
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,380
And thank you, General Yan.

462
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,380
Thank you, General Yan.

463
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:59,380
Thank you for killing the King of Chong.

464
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,380
Let us be reborn and reborn.

465
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,380
Thank you, General Yan.

466
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,380
Since everyone is safe,

467
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,380
let's leave the capital.

468
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,380
Leave the capital?

469
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,380
Where are we going?

470
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,380
You can go to Qingquan Town.

471
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,380
Or you can come to my village.

472
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:19,380
Sure.

473
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,380
Let's go.

474
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,380
There's food and drinks.

475
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:22,380
There are many people.

476
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:23,380
It's lively.

477
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,380
Let's go back and pack up.

478
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,380
Let's leave now.

479
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,380
Okay.

480
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,380
Be careful on the way.

481
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,380
Goodbye.

482
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,380
Goodbye.

483
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,380
Goodbye.

484
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,380
Goodbye.

485
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,380
Let me see.

486
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,380
Sit here.

487
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,380
Let me see.

488
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,380
Are you okay?

489
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,380
I'm fine.

490
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,380
Your daughter is so good.

491
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,380
How could she be okay?

492
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,380
Lu Yan,

493
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,380
we've known each other for so long.

494
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,380
I think you're quite good today.

495
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,380
Thank you.

496
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,380
My daughter.

497
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,380
Let me tell you.

498
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,380
Lu Yan is so good today.

499
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,380
He went to the execution ground alone.

500
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:59,380
When he was fighting against the King of Chong,

501
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,380
he beat him to the ground three times.

502
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:04,380
He saved the whole tribe.

503
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,380
Isn't he great?

504
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,380
He's great.

505
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,380
Lu Yan,

506
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,380
how are you?

507
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,380
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

508
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,380
I'm fine.

509
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,380
I'll be fine after a few days of rest.

510
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,380
Really?

511
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,380
Yes.

512
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,380
I'll have to ask the village head myself.

513
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,380
Let me see.

514
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,380
His pulse is weak.

515
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,380
His energy loss is very big.

516
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,380
He can't recover for a few days.

517
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:35,380
He has to accompany me personally.

518
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,380
At least a month.

519
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,380
At least a month.

520
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,380
If that's the case,

521
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,380
a month is not enough.

522
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,380
Yes.

523
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:48,380
It takes at least one year, two years, ten years.

524
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,380
No, master.

525
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,380
If that's the case,

526
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,380
I'll kill him.

527
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,380
It's better to be alive.

528
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,380
He can't leave me anyway.

529
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,380
Okay, dad.

530
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,380
Since you've recovered,

531
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,380
let's not suffer in this shabby temple.

532
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,380
Let's set off tomorrow

533
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:06,380
to find a good place

534
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,380
for Lu Yan to recuperate.

535
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,380
Mr. Gu.

536
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:14,380
Cui Zhu.

537
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,380
Cui Zhu?

538
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,380
Why are you here?

539
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,380
My lady wants to see you.

540
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,380
Why are you standing there?

541
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,380
Go.

542
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,380
Go.

543
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:34,380
Come.

544
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,380
Let's eat.

545
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,380
Come.

546
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,380
You're hungry.

547
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,380
Shi Qi.

548
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,380
Thank you for reporting to us.

549
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,380
Don't mention it.

550
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,380
I'm worried about such a big thing.

551
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,380
But I can't do anything about it.

552
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:58,380
I'm relieved to see you're safe.

553
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,380
Why can't you do anything about it?

554
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,380
If you didn't report to us,

555
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,380
those spirits would be in trouble.

556
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:06,380
And

557
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,380
I'm sorry for getting you into trouble.

558
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,380
Don't worry.

559
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,380
We'll be fine.

560
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,380
You're the ones

561
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,380
who attacked the police and robbed the prison.

562
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,380
We won't let you off easily.

563
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,380
So,

564
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:28,380
you're leaving soon, right?

565
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,380
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

566
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:39,380
I know this is not a place you'll stay for long.

567
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,380
And

568
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,380
your heart is not here.

569
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,380
We'll say goodbye sooner or later.

570
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:51,380
Take care of yourself when you get back.

571
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,380
Take care of your health.

572
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,380
And take good care of Miss Yu.

573
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,380
And

574
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,380
we've been through so much together.

575
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,380
We're friends now.

576
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,380
Don't forget me.

577
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,380
Of course I won't.

578
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,380
I used to think you were a noble lady.

579
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,380
You couldn't lift your shoulders.

580
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,380
Through this time,

581
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,380
you risked your life to send us out of the city

582
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,380
and told us the news.

583
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,380
You're different from other girls.

584
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,380
I'm happy to know you

585
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,380
and be your friend.

586
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:42,380
I'm happy too.

587
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,380
I've been through a lot with you

588
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,380
that I didn't dare to think about before.

589
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,380
I feel lucky.

590
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,380
And this is the happiest time of my life.

591
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,380
You really

592
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,380
see me as your friend.

593
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,380
I have no regrets.

594
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,380
What do you mean?

595
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,380
We'll meet again

596
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:10,380
no matter what.

597
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:14,380
Really?

598
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:18,380
After this,

599
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,380
I'll take you to our village

600
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:23,380
to experience the life of the village.

601
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,380
It's much better than in your city.

602
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,380
Drinking, eating,

603
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,380
and having fun.

604
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,380
Okay.

605
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,380
It's a deal.

606
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,380
I'll wait for you.

607
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,380
My lady.

608
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,380
My lady.

609
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,380
We should go back.

610
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,380
Gu Peixin.

611
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,380
Take care.

612
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,380
Take care.

613
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,380
Gu Zhai Zhuo.

614
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,380
You said you'd take me to eat meat.

615
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,380
Don't break your promise.

616
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,380
Let's go.

617
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,380
Gu Zhai Zhuo

618
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,380
Don't wait for me.

619
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,380
Yu Deng Deng.

620
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,380
I like you.

621
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:14,380
I really like you.

622
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,380
But I've decided to let go.

623
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,380
I've never seen you.

624
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:30,380
You care so much about someone.

625
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,380
You're so beautiful.

626
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,380
You're so beautiful.

627
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,380
You're so beautiful.

628
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,380
You're so beautiful.

629
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:41,380
You're so beautiful.

630
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,380
You're so beautiful.

631
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,380
You're so beautiful.

632
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,380
You're so beautiful.

633
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,380
You're so beautiful.

634
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:51,380
You're so beautiful.

635
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,380
You're so beautiful.

636
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:55,380
You're so beautiful.

637
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,380
You're so beautiful.

638
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,380
You're so beautiful.

639
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,380
You're so beautiful.

640
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:03,380
You're so beautiful.

641
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,380
You're so beautiful.

642
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:07,380
You're so beautiful.

643
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,380
You're so beautiful.

644
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,380
You're so beautiful.

645
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:13,380
You're so beautiful.

646
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,380
You're so beautiful.

647
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,380
You're so beautiful.

648
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,380
You're so beautiful.

649
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:21,380
You're so beautiful.

650
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,380
You're so beautiful.

651
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,380
You're so beautiful.

652
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,380
You're so beautiful.

653
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,380
You're so beautiful.

654
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,380
You're so beautiful.

655
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,380
You're so beautiful.

656
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,380
You're so beautiful.

657
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:43,380
Mam, then can we...

658
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,380
I can't drink any more.

659
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:47,380
I want to be with you...

660
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,380
... forever and ever.

661
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,380
Brother.

662
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,380
I'd rather die...

663
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:55,380
... than die.

664
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,380
I will protect you.

665
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:02,780
Because protecting you

666
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,380
has become a habit of mine.

667
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,380
I will protect you.

668
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,380
I will protect you.

669
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:31,380
The scenery that I walked into

670
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,380
is just a dream,

671
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,560
a

672
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,380
four-leaf clover,

673
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,380
a faraway love.

674
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:44,380
How lucky I am

675
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:48,380
to have made the decision for you.

676
00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:00,380
The two stars are so close

677
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,380
when the whole world is occupied by you.

678
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:09,380
I will call out your name with all my heart

679
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,380
until the memories of you.

680
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,380
I will protect you.

681
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,380
I will protect you.

682
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:19,380
I will protect you.

683
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:21,380
I will protect you.

684
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:23,380
I will protect you.

685
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,180
I will protect you.

686
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,380
I will protect you.

687
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,580
I will protect you.

688
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,180
Who eggs egg yolk?

689
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,380
There will never be ND.

690
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,380
No, no, no.

691
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,380
You and your wicked nature.

692
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,380
It's not like how it's always been.

693
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:46,380
If one Ewes is hurt,

694
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,380
what they are looking for is

695
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,380
your pure and innocent self!

696
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:51,380
Currently

697
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:55,380
I'll make a decision for you
