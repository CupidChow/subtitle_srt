This is the formation of Zhu Rong.

It makes you in an illusion,

54

and addicted to the illusion of the past.

55
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:23,900
So all this time,

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,630
it's not that you could't get out.

57

I thought Saintess was the hope to revive our spirit clan.

120
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,220
For this reason, I was willing to

121
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:10,400
fight in the dirtiest

122
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,690
and the most filthy mud pit.

123
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,230
I climbed towards her step by step.

124
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:16,930
But when I stopped kneeling

125
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,970
and began to stand side by side with her,

126
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,050
I finally found that

127
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,290
the Saintess I once admired

128
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,210
was a selfish,

129
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,410
weak and feeble coward.

130
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,690
By then,

131
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,400
my horizon was naturally broadened.

132
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:37,450
And I found that I didn't need her.

133
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,490
Both of us have alternative choices.

You don't need to understand.

You just need to guard this place for me

00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:16,850
Second-in-command is back.

350
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,610
Yes.

351
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,320
How is it?

352
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,780
I'm asking you. How did it go?

353
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:25,210
The result is not good.

354
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,380
What do you mean?

355
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,380
Not only Baile Village,

356
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,860
the villages around the Ancient Shu City

357
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,010
all have missing people.

358
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,410
The villagers who are not missing

359
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,050
gradually became

360
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:36,210
like the people in Baile Village.

361
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,380
They have no emotions and facial expressions.

362
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:40,170
From five miles to ten miles,

363
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:41,280
this strange disease's infection area

364
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,170
is getting bigger.

365
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,650
I'm so mad.

366
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,880
I used to be a spirit-hunter and a hunter.

367
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,370
But the strange things

368
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,510
I met these days

369
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,410
are much more than the ones I've met for decades.

370
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,450
It looks like

371
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:56,560
we can't stay here for long.

372
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,530
How about this?

373
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,820
Pack up tonight

374
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,910
and go back to Qingquan Stronghold tomorrow morning.

375
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:02,870
Senior Master. Senior Master.

376
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:03,970
If we don't take Concubine Lu together,

377
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:05,490
your daughter won't agree.

378
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,000
Then tie her back.

379
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:07,840
That's...

380
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:08,570
Senior Master.

381
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,810
Go talk to him.

382
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,640
No way.

383
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:24,520
No way.

384
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:28,810
Everything here

385
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:31,330
is all fake?

386
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:35,930
It must be Zhu Rong.

387
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:37,530
It must be him.

388
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,340
He must have been confusing me.

389
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,450
This...

390
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,330
Aren't they the people

391
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,970
who had been thrown here?

392
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,230
The Dust-proof Bead has been taken out of the underground palace.

393
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,330
Why would it absorb their energy?

394
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,040
Do you really think

395
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,630
you will die without the Dust-proof Bead?

396
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,380
Do you really think

397
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:10,270
you can't leave here

398
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,780
because of the Dust-proof Bead?

399
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,330
I don't believe it.

400
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,940
Who else could it be?

401
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,290
Who else could it be?

402
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,410
What is real?

403
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:35,760
And what is fake?

404
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,570
What have I been doing

405
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,080
during the past 3,000 years?

406
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,750
What have I done?

407
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,730
I have a bad headache.

408
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,940
Am I dying again?

409
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:03,740
Help!

410
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,330
I can't take it anymore. I'm not feeling well.

411
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,090
Stop yelling.

412
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:08,600
Your father has arranged everything.

413
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,260
He knows you're fine.

414
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,130
Even if you cried hoarsely,

415
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:13,750
no one would let you out.

416
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,960
Chieftain Gu,

417
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,560
please pity me.

418
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,180
I don't dare to offend your father.

419
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,760
You have no idea.

420
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:42,120
Our ancestors have a skill.

421
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:43,810
Massage.

422
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,890
Do you want to try?

423
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:45,890
Thank you.

424
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,670
No need.

425
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,210
I'll buy you a drink.

426
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,500
No, thanks.

427
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,810
What's wrong with you today?

428
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,570
You're invincible. It's so hard to convince you.

429
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,280
Tell me.

430
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,290
How can you let me out?

431
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,620
I have other things to ask for your help.

432
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,140
What's that?

433
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,380
To tie your father up

434
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,930
and let you go out to find Lu Yan?

435
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,000
You're indeed my brother.

436
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:17,710
Thanks.

437
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,410
I can let you out,

438
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,010
but I have one condition.

439
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,650
Take me with you.

440
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:24,600
No.

441
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,430
It's going to be dangerous.

442
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,670
You stay here

443
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,780
and take good care of my father and uncle.

444
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:30,850
I don't agree.

445
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,240
Bai Shiqi died.

446
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:35,830
I can't let anything bad happen to you.

447
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,870
Miss Bai, she...

448
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,070
We couldn't find her.

449
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,500
She was killed by the spirit clan

450
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,270
who escaped from the Yingdu City.

451
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:48,960
How could this happen?

452
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,570
The people of Xiongya Stronghold took Shiqi away.

453
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,550
After I saved Shiqi,

454
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,310
I asked her to wait for me in the Taiping Village.

455
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,950
But it's all my fault.

456
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:07,750
She trusted me so much.

457
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,130
Am I really worthy of her trust?

458
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,620
I was wrong too.

459
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,570
Those spirit beings had resentment

460
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,730
because they were homeless.

461
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,410
That's why all of these happened.

462
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,890
After Bai Shiqi died, I was thinking

463
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:30,080
what kind of people the spirit beings are.

464
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,900
You are one of the members of the spirit clan.

465
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,060
So are Xin and Daidai.

466
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,450
But you are all good people.

467
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,560
But those who killed others are also spirit beings.

468
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,590
They can easily turn against each other

469
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,130
and kill innocent people.

470
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
I think

471
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,560
both humans and the spirit clan,

472
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:53,440
everyone has their own difficulties.

473
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,830
But difficulties can't be the reasons for evil.

474
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,150
You should live up to your conscience.

475
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:02,730
Although others think we are not decent,

476
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,630
if what I did

477
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,070
didn't do harm to the people and my conscience,

478
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,400
then I think we are not that bad.

479
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,250
As long as we can protect the weak, punish the evil and praise the good,

480
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,480
both the spirit beings and humans

481
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:18,180
are worthy of admiration.

482
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,540
So take me to have a look.

483
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,910
I'd like to see this place which is related to the spirit clan.

484
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,820
I want to figure it out myself.

485
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,530
Shiqi

486
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,590
is waiting for us to avenge her.

487
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,240
Besides,

488
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,230
I'm a lucky guy.

489
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:40,650
I'm also good at wheeling around and hitting back.

490
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:41,760
I won't die.

491
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:43,840
You need me.

492
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,490
Wait.

493
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:58,200
What's wrong?

494
00:28:58,650 --> 00:28:59,930
The Tongyangxi has been murmuring something

495
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:01,850
after being awake.

496
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:02,930
She said there was a house.

497
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,670
Let's go and ask her.

498
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:05,370
Let's go.

499
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:10,840
Mei.

500
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:15,250
Mei.

501
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,200
What does the house look like?

502
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:21,610
There are vines

503
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,490
and a tree.

504
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,080
A tree?

505
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:28,850
I...

506
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,010
I can't remember.

507
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,880
I almost died in that house.

508
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:35,610
There seems to be something in that house.

509
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,090
It eats humans.

510
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,080
It eats humans.

511
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,560
Tree can eat humans?

512
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,540
Was there a spirit being in the underground palace?

513
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,410
But why was he in the underground palace?

514
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,650
Let's go find Lu Yan

515
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,050
and tell him the news.

516
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,180
We ran all the way.

517
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:47,340
Those spirit beings have been chasing us.

518
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,280
They've reached the entrance of the underground palace.

519
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,040
We don't know
