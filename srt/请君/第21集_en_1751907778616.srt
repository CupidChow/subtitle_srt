1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let go even if you go far away

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You are me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You are me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You are me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You are me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You are me

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Episode 2

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Wait, listen to me

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You have tried your best

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Er Dian, don't persuade me

11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I was still young when my mother left

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I can't do anything

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I finally found my father

14
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I can't just watch him die

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But you have fallen before your father

16
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
How can I explain to him when he wakes up?

17
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Wait

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It seems to work

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Wait

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Wait

21
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Lao Yu

22
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I just don't understand

23
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I can help others

24
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I can save others

25
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But why can't I save my father?

26
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Wait

27
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The spiritual clan is different from people

28
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
We can only find the way to root

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Don't blame yourself

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm not a spiritual clan

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm a spiritual clan

32
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Don't blame yourself

33
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What if my father can't wait?

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I will lose him

35
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Er Dian, don't comfort me

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I have tried my best

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I know it very well

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I have learned the martial arts since I was a child

39
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I am smart and brave

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I thought I was fearless

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But I'm not afraid

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You are the one who favors me

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The brothers in the village are watching

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I just found out how incompetent I am

45
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Who says you are incompetent?

46
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Girl

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Our village is poor

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
When the girls can't afford food

49
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You can't bear to eat it for others

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You work hard for your brothers

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You are the last one to come back

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Who says you are incompetent?

53
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
How can I be so good?

54
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Silly girl

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Our Deng Deng is the best

56
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You have to remember what your father said

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Guan Guan is sad

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Guan Guan is bitter

59
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It's hard to walk

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can't walk

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I have to go

62
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Mother

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Father

64
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Mother

65
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Mother

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
How is the girl?

67
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
How is the girl?

68
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Not good

69
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Come on, put it on

70
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What's wrong with your leg?

71
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm fine

72
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'm on the medicine

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What's fine?

74
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
If you don't treat it, it will be useless

75
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Go

76
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Go

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Hurry up

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Guan Guan

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm here

80
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm fine

81
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay

82
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's all my fault

83
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Since your mother died

84
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I am a big old man

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I have to take care of you

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I let you get this chest disease

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Now I have a panic

88
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I can't get you anything delicious

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I can't get any medicine

90
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You are really bitter

91
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Tan'er

92
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Girl

93
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You are awake

94
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You are awake

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Father

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Where did you come from?

97
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You went down the mountain

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I heard from Benxi

99
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
These two days

100
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The snowstorm

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The rabbit didn't pick up one

102
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
How did you run down the mountain?

103
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Don't listen to Benxi

104
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
That kid is timid

105
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Even if the ice six falls

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Can scare the wife

107
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Who is dad

108
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm strong

109
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Dad

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Didn't you say

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Guan Guan is sad

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Guan Guan is sad

113
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes

114
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's hard to walk

115
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I can't walk

116
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Dad

117
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What's wrong with your leg?

118
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Don't move

119
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Don't move

120
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's okay

121
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Dad

122
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
This bone is hard

123
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Don't worry

124
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Dad

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If I get better

126
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Don't call me anymore

127
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Bailong's little stuff

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Pencil and bow

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Little thing

130
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm so bored

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
it is good

132
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
When my daughter is better

133
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Dad will take you hunting

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Go to the rabbit

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Go

136
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
One word is certain

137
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
One word is certain

138
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Sleep

139
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Guan Guan is sad

140
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Guan Guan is sad

141
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's hard to walk

142
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I can't walk

143
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Guan Guan is sad

144
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Guan Guan is sad

145
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's hard to walk

146
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's hard to walk

147
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
It's hard to walk

148
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I will not let anything happen to you

149
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
We have to go up the mountain together

150
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I will not let anything happen to you

151
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Cry if you want to

152
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Who cried

153
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's boring

154
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Not my boss's style

155
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Wait

156
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Don't be strong in front of me

157
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Can you hug me

158
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Lu Yan

159
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm really scared

160
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I have never seen my dad like this

161
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm so scared

162
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm afraid we two will

163
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
No chance to do a lot of things together

164
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm afraid I will watch him seriously

165
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Just tortured by bugs

166
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I can't recover myself

167
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm also afraid I can't find him easily

168
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Will lose him soon

169
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Don't be afraid

170
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm here

171
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I will always be with you

172
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
By the way

173
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What did you do today

174
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I found something

175
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What is this

176
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Journal of the young reporter

177
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Today's news

178
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I have to go to the hospital

179
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I saw the old debtor didn't get better

180
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Just remembered that we missed one point

181
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Maybe the young reporter is not the king of the jungle

182
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Or not exactly the king of the jungle

183
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
This young reporter usually likes to put his thoughts

184
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
All on the notebook

185
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But why

186
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It was gone a month ago

187
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
And this notebook is also covered with a layer of dust

188
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
People's habits are hard to change

189
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So the young reporter is on the path of the king of the jungle

190
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
He is not the king of the jungle at all

191
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But the king of the jungle controlled him

192
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Not only is it controlled

193
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
And this king of the jungle is in his body

194
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
When we killed the young reporter

195
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
He ran away without our notice

196
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If the young reporter is really possessed by the king of the jungle

197
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
After the bug comes out

198
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
There must be some traces on the body

199
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Now the body is in the hands of the small captain

200
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
He should be sent to the parking lot outside the city gate

201
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
We will go to him now

202
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Wait

203
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I have been there

204
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I went to check the body of the young reporter

205
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
There is a half fist hole in the young reporter's chest

206
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
That wound is not left by ordinary gunshot

207
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The wound is surrounded by blood stains

208
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's not clear

209
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Now it seems to be a trace of the king of the jungle

210
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
This king of the jungle is really vicious

211
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
The young reporter is also pitiful

212
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The king of the jungle covered his skin

213
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Do evil things

214
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
In the end, he died in peace

215
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I took a picture of him in the dark city today

216
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I knew his strength

217
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It's easy to take him down

218
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
But I didn't expect him to increase in a moment

219
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Can in such a short time

220
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Let your power be so far behind

221
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I think it's related to the body of the dragonfly

222
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
So to speak

223
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
This king of the jungle is not just spreading the dragonfly

224
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
He also spread the dragonfly to make the dragonfly trade

225
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And also use these insects to absorb other people's spiritual power

226
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And then absorb it back

227
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What a empty-handed white wolf

228
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But he got so much money

229
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
And hang on a dark and empty net all day long

230
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
He doesn't care about the color of the wine and meat

231
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
What is he after?

232
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
The trade of dragonflies is rich

233
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
People like the Chang'er Tribe

234
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Of course, they are willing to buy and sell for this evil business

235
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
It seems that the king of the jungle

236
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Just used this point of their greed for money

237
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
To achieve the real purpose behind him

238
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yuan Neng

239
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
That's right

240
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Dangerous and cunning

241
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I don't know if there are any black hands behind this bastard

242
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
If there are

243
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Then this person must have messed up this world

244
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
We have to get him out

245
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Since the king of the jungle is still alive

246
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Then the old village head and other tribes

247
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
There will be hope

248
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
This bastard is seriously injured

249
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It shouldn't be too far away

250
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
This can't be delayed

251
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Let's go to India City tomorrow to find him

252
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
it is good

253
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Then let's go back and see the old village head first

254
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Lu Yan

255
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Thank you for doing so much for me

256
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Should be

257
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Let's go

258
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You are here, Director Bai

259
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Director Bai

260
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Master

261
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I gave you a letter

262
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Did you receive it, Master?

263
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Received

264
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
This cafe is where we first met

265
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Someone gave me a letter

266
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Let me meet here

267
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I guess it's you

268
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Now the city is so close

269
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
How do you get into the city?

270
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I don't know

271
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I just know

272
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I just know

273
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Now the city is so close

274
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
How do you get into the city?

275
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
and

276
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
How to recover

277
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Someone gave me some yuan

278
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
So I have to keep my human form

279
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
But my body is still very weak

280
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm afraid I can't hold on for long

281
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Since you are not in good health

282
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Why don't you find a place to rest?

283
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Now the city is so close

284
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
At this time

285
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Is the end of the world

286
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
No matter how risky it is

287
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I will come to see you one last time

288
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I miss you

289
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Master

290
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But have you thought about it?

291
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I am the police chief

292
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Police chief

293
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Now the whole city is searching for the forest tribe

294
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
You come to see me alone

295
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Aren't you afraid?

296
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I just want to see you

297
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I can't care about anything else

298
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Even if you want to be punished

299
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I don't blame you

300
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I have no regrets

301
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I said

302
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I want to protect you in this life

303
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Today

304
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I won't break my promise

305
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You go

306
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
In the future

307
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Master can't protect you

308
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I know

309
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I also know

310
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
After this farewell

311
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm afraid I will meet you in the future

312
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Maybe see you again

313
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I just hope that in the future

314
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Can make me an ordinary person

315
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Can be with you

316
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Be a decent

317
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Be a happy couple

318
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm leaving, master

319
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
No matter who you are

320
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Or

321
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
My feelings for you are like water

322
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Never be watered down

323
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
But you have to know

324
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Now Yingdu City

325
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
It's too dangerous

326
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
After you leave

327
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Be sure to pay attention to your own safety

328
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Know

329
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Master

330
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Catch him

331
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Catch that little forest group

332
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Run pretty fast

333
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Give me a split chase

334
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Meet in Longhu Town later

335
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes

336
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
go

337
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Now my men are catching the forest group

338
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Hurry up

339
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
What's wrong with you

340
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Why don't you knock on the door

341
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Master Wei

342
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
This is the new dessert in our store

343
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Specially for you and your wife

344
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'll put it on the table for you

345
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
No need

346
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Nothing about you

347
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Go down

348
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Ok

349
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm outside the door

350
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You can call me anytime

351
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
What's wrong with you

352
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
What's this

353
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It's a magic

354
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What

355
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Are you ok

356
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
What's wrong with you

357
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It's my fault

358
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
It's my fault

359
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Get up

360
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
It's my fault

361
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
It's my fault

362
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Take your time

363
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Take your time

364
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What are you doing

365
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Hurry up

366
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Go

367
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Go

368
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Go

369
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Go

370
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Go

371
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Just let him run away like this

372
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
It's my fault

373
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
It's my fault

374
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Hurry up

375
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Go

376
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Hurry up

377
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Go

378
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Where are you

379
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Xia Zhuo

380
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Don't move

381
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Where is the monster

382
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Zhuo is

383
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I look like a monster

384
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Senior

385
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
What are you doing here

386
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
We are here to catch the forest group

387
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Catch the forest group

388
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Then why are you standing here

389
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Go after them

390
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Yes

391
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
What are you doing here

392
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Go

393
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Go

394
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Little friend, why are you here

395
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Don't be afraid

396
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Hurry up

397
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Hurry up

398
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Little friend

399
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Listen to sister

400
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
My surname is Bai

401
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Shi Qi

402
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Dad

403
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It's so late

404
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
What are you doing

405
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I heard that the coffee in this cafe is very delicious

406
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I want to buy some coffee

407
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
I'll give you a taste

408
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
But it seems to be catching the forest group

409
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Isn't it

410
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I didn't dare to go in

411
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
So you didn't see anything

412
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
What did you see

413
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
But it seems that a cat ran over

414
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Over there

415
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
OK

416
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It's not peaceful in the city now

417
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
It's so late

418
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Don't walk around

419
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Go back with me

420
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Go

421
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Kid

422
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Where is your parents in the middle of the night

423
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Where did you pick up this cat

424
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
This is my cat

425
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
No, this is my person

426
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'll suffocate to death

427
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
What are you doing

428
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Sister Dengdeng, here

429
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Sister

430
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Kid

431
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
You said it was a sister named Bai who saved you

432
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Then she was caught by the police

433
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
She left

434
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Then you brought this cat back alone

435
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
No, it was Sanhua Cat who brought me back

436
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Sister Bai said she would take me to a safe place

437
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I didn't believe it

438
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Because she looks like she's dying

439
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
But I didn't expect her to come all the way here

440
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Sister Bai said if I arrived

441
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Must give it to a sister with a headband

442
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
By the way

443
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
She also said that beside that sister

444
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
There is a brother who looks like Jun Lang

445
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
The rest are not allowed

446
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
No

447
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Little brother

448
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Sister Bai said that brother who looks like Jun Lang is me

449
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
You got the wrong person

450
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Don't interrupt

451
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It seems that it should be Miss Bai

452
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
When I was picking up the little girl

453
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Was hit by Director Bai

454
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Director Bai still thinks about the old days

455
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Let her go

456
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Anyway

457
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
As long as the cat is fine

458
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
The man has already burned the incense

459
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Kid

460
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
What did you do again

461
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Why did the police catch you

462
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I don't know either

463
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Those police are catching us one after another

464
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
He is our tribe

465
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
My mother protected me

466
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I just escaped

467
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
what

468
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Catch all the tribes

469
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Director Bai is going to go to the dark

470
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Drive all the tribes into killing

471
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
What about your parents

472
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
I

473
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
My parents

474
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
They were all killed

475
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
killing

476
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Why should they kill the innocent

477
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Other neighboring tribes

478
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Just pulled away by a steel chain

479
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,000
But they said that my parents resisted the arrest

480
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
To be executed on the spot

481
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Resist arrest

482
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
How to resist

483
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Did you see

484
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
I was hiding in the back window

485
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
They put on my father's handcuffs

486
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
My parents are like crazy

487
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Want to bite

488
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I've never seen my parents like that

489
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
They are usually honest

490
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Even the chicken and duck dare not kill themselves

491
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
When the police killed your parents

492
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Are there any other people next to you

493
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I remember

494
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
My parents were angry at that time

495
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
He dismissed other police

496
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
When they left

497
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
My parents didn't resist anymore

498
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Instead, kneel down to beg him

499
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
But they stopped moving in a while

500
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Where is your home

501
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Nan Cheng's Eagle-footed Tiger

502
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The first tiger in the corner is my home

503
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You're leaving

504
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Okay, don't cry

505
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Don't cry

506
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's okay

507
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Don't cry

508
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm leaving

509
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Thank you brother

510
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Get up quickly

511
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Get up quickly

512
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Okay, okay

513
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
It's Chong Wang

514
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I went to check his parents' bodies

515
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Found their dead bodies

516
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Very similar to the dead spirits of the dead

517
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Close to transparent

518
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It was originally made of dry material

519
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
It seems that our guess is correct

520
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Chong Wang found a new host

521
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
And this time

522
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
It is likely to be inherited from the police

523
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
To arrest the spirits

524
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Police

525
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
What does he want to do

526
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Oh no

527
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
He wants to use the identity of the police

528
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Justly arrest the spirits

529
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Xi Yuan

530
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,000
It's really too much

531
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Not delaying the wedding

532
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
One move is two

533
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
This person has become smart

534
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Report, report

535
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
A monster was caught by the police

536
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
A monster was caught by the police

537
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
One more

538
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
There are monsters in the palace

539
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
The monster of the golden ear is longer than the head

540
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Where are the monsters

541
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
The head was caught by a little ghost

542
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
County governor

543
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
What do you want me to do today

544
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You are really good

545
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I can't sleep even if I wake up

546
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
The chief of police married a monster

547
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
You said you don't want this old face

548
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I don't want

549
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I don't want

550
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
I don't want

551
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
County governor

552
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I really don't know

553
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I was blinded by that monster

554
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I now

555
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
I can't wait

556
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I can't wait to break his bones

557
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Throw it on the street

558
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Don't know

559
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
You said

560
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Yesterday here

561
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
What did you see

562
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I

563
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I saw the chief of police

564
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
And the little old man

565
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Secretly meet in the room

566
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Then the monster suddenly appeared

567
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
When the police arrived

568
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Director Bai threatened them

569
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Don't let them catch monsters

570
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Blood-sucking

571
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
When did i do this

572
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
First, hide the monster

573
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Then let him go

574
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I see the police dinner

575
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
You are late

576
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
County governor

577
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Give me another chance

578
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
I must beat those monsters

579
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Now the monsters in India

580
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Almost caught

581
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I'll take them back to the execution ground

582
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Give me another chance

583
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I must give you an explanation

584
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Give me an explanation

585
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Ajin

586
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
I have already put the fish on the table

587
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
If they run away again

588
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
You have to think about it

589
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
How can you give you

590
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Top and bottom of the family

591
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Dozens of people

592
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,000
An explanation

593
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
Yes

594
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yes

595
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Chief

596
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Look, he has eaten

597
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,000
He has eaten

598
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
He ate

599
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I'm scared

600
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I'll take it back

601
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
What's the matter

602
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I have a brother who is a police officer

603
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
You

604
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
That chief Bai found a master to ask

605
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Said this tribe

606
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Can't eat garlic

607
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
As long as you eat garlic

608
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,000
These tribesmen

609
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Will become the original look

610
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
When they were on a tour in the west city today

611
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Garlic is used to make a tribeman

612
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
The original shape was presented on the spot

613
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Really

614
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
go

615
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Don't move

616
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Let go

617
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Let go

618
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
I don't want to see

619
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Take away

620
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Take away

621
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Miss

622
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Where are they going

623
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
The people in our house have handed in an emergency mission

624
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,000
All out

625
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Miss

626
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Master specifically ordered

627
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It's chaotic outside today

628
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Don't go anywhere

629
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Don't go out of the house

630
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Emergency mission

631
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
What happened

632
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I heard that there are monsters in the city

633
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Master Zheng Wu wants to take someone

634
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
They are executed on the execution ground

635
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Do you need so many people to be executed?

636
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
The people in the house are sent out

637
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I don't know

638
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
Miss, don't go out

639
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
gone

640
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Miss Miss Miss Don't go out

641
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Master

642
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Master

643
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I don't have enough energy to put in

644
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Go get the scattered spirits back

645
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I've been waiting for this meal for too long

646
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Master, today the execution ground is all together

647
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It's a good time to kill the spirits

648
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Move fast

649
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Yes

650
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Lu Yan

651
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Wait for my nine tribes to run

652
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I'll send you on the road

653
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
I'm going

654
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I'm going

655
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Your father was tortured by this bug for two days

656
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Finally, I'm back

657
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
But when is it the end

658
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Hurry up

659
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000

660
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000

665
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
stop

666
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
It's over there

667
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Hurry up

668
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
It's okay

669
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Hurry up

670
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000

671
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000

672
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
What's the pain

673
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Hurry up

674
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000

Go

Hurry up

681
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000

682
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000

683
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,000

Hurry up

690
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Go

691
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Director, the monsters are here

692
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
All right

693
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Take the bullets to the hall

694
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Run

695
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Hurry up

696
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Seventeenth

697
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Gu Bei Xi

698
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Seventeenth, why are you here

699
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Open the shadow

700
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
No, where are Miss Yu and the others

701
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Deng Deng is taking care of his father in the shabby temple

702
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,000
I think the old man is a little bit good

703
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I bought him some wine and chicken

704
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,000
What's the matter?

705
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
What's the matter?

706
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
My father

707
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
He is going to kill the spirits in the execution ground today

708
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
When

709
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Just today

710
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,000
All the guards in my house were transferred

711
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I'll inform Deng Deng and the others

712
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Wait a minute

713
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Are you going to the execution ground?

714
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I'll send you there

715
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,000
You listen

716
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Hurry home

717
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
This is dangerous

718
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Can't get you in

719
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
But you

720
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Do not worry

721
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,000
We will be fine

722
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
And your father doesn't want you to be in trouble

723
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Right

724
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Then you must come back safely

725
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Sir, what's wrong with you

726
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Bai Chi Qi sent a letter

727
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Director Bai is going to execute all the spirits in the execution ground

728
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
If you say

729
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
Love can be touched

730
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Miss you will have voice

731
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,000
The most beautiful scenery in life

732
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
All about you

733
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
When two hearts are so close

734
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,000
When the whole world is occupied by you

735
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I will call you with all my heart

736
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Until your memory

737
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You are my only

738
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:50,000
The scenery that I walk into

739
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Only the rain falls

740
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
The distance is only love

741
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
I hide my heart

742
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Make a decision for you

743
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I will call you with all my heart

744
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Until your memory

745
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,000

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,000
The scenery that I walk into

747
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Only the rain falls

748
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,000
The distance is only love

749
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I hide my heart

750
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Make a decision for you

751
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I will call you with all my heart

752
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:00,000

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:07,000
You are my only

00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Only the rain falls

756
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
The distance is only love

757
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
I hide my heart

758
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Make a decision for you
