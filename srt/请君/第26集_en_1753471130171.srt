4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll never let go after you leave

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You are me

6
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You are me

7
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You are me

8
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You are me

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You are me

Episode 16

12
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
My head hurts so much.

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
My head hurts so much.

14
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What's wrong?

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Why does my head hurt so much?

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Wei Du, it's getting late.

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I want to go home and rest early.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
General, it's still early.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Why don't you have another drink?

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Wei Du, let's go tomorrow.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Okay, I'll take you home and rest.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No, you can tell me how to go home.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Okay.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Guards!

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
General, take the general home and rest.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yes.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'll go home first.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Okay.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Guards!

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Guards!

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Guards!

32
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Guards!

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Guards!

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Guards!

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's too painful.

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Deng Deng, are you alright?

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You are here.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I heard you had a headache.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Are you okay?

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm fine.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,920
will be a problem.

42
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,120
General.

43
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,360
General Yan went to Miss Yu's room.

44
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,480
What?

45
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,120
Why did he say that?

46
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,600
Because he lied.

47
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,520
My father clearly left a mark

48
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,280
and said he went to the underground palace.

49
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
But when he got there,

50
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,680
he didn't even check it.

51
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,400
He denied it without even looking at it.

52
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,600
It's a bit strange, isn't it?

53
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,000
And

54
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,520
there are two jade rings in front of his yard.

55
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,320
Those are Dan Dong jade rings.

56
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,120
They were cultivated by the Ming family

57
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,640
for the past decades.

58
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,520
They are very expensive.

59
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,880
You can't buy them outside.

60
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,320
My father spent a lot of effort

61
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,920
to get two jade rings for my mother.

62
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,520
Isn't it more strange

63
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,720
that he got them?

64
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,240
You have a point.

65
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,200
But I've been with Wei Du for more than ten years.

66
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,880
He is a good man.

67
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,120
Maybe he has some hidden secrets

68
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,320
that are hard to tell us.

69
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,880
You haven't seen him for three thousand years.

70
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,120
People will change.

71
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,120
You should be careful.

72
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,440
I know.

73
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,680
I'll give you more yuan energy.

74
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,040
So you can sleep better.

75
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,960
How can I just give you yuan energy?

76
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,320
I'll punish you for the master's bed.

77
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,040
Why punish me?

78
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,160
Of course I'll punish you.

79
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,760
Punish you for only caring about your brother

80
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,840
and forgetting about your wife.

81
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,480
Will you do it?

82
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,920
I'll do it.

83
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:35,400
Brothers are the first class.

84
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,920
Women are the second class.

85
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,320
To repay me,

86
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,800
help me to make the bed tomorrow morning.

87
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,920
Okay.

88
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,920
After you get up tomorrow morning,

89
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,480
I'll come to your room

90
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,400
and help you make the bed.

91
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,760
Oh,

92
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,000
it's so troublesome to run around.

93
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,600
How about

94
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,760
staying here?

95
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,440
Stay here?

96
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,640
Okay.

97
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,600
We'll sleep together.

98
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,040
Don't regret it.

99
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,760
What's there to regret?

100
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,640
General.

101
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,600
You're in the wrong room.

102
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,880
Please let me take you back to have a rest.

103
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,760
Your general didn't go to the wrong room.

104
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,360
He slept here today.

105
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,400
General.

106
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,840
I arranged your room

107
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,560
according to your old hobby.

108
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,600
I designed it specially.

109
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,240
Don't you want to have a look?

110
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,320
General, you don't have to...

111
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,360
Okay, I know.

112
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,760
I'll go back to my room.

113
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,240
I'll leave now.

114
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,600
I'll go back first.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,120
We'll meet again.

116
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,000
Forget it. I'm just kidding.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,240
I'll spare you this time.

118
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,240
Go back to your room.

119
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,880
I'll go now.

120
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,360
By the way,

121
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,880
people here are very sensitive to the Spirit Tribe.

122
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,960
You have to be careful these days.

123
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,000
Don't use your primordial energy

124
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,240
when I'm not here.

125
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,040
I'll go back to my room.

126
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,200
I'll go back to my room.

127
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,200
I'll go back to my room.

128
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
I'll go back to my room.

129
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,600
I know. Don't worry.

130
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
You should also be careful.

131
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,320
Don't sleep too much at night.

132
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,200
Wei Du, you're so good.

133
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,920
I want to see

134
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,960
what you're up to.

135
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,240
Brother Li was injured by Ghost Man Teng.

136
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,560
His wound is broken.

137
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,800
The doctors in the city said he couldn't be treated.

138
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,080
I'm afraid

139
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,400
only his arm can be saved.

140
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,440
General,

141
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,720
you have the Spirit Tribe's yuan pellet.

142
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,520
It's said that it can heal the bones.

143
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,360
Please save him.

144
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,400
Young Master,

145
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,560
what are you going to do?

146
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,760
General Fu.

147
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,040
General Yan,

148
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,360
Garlicuo,

149
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,760
Your Majesty,

150
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:54,520
May Madam Lu

151
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,560
have some teapot.

152
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,400
It'sCHUCKLE?

153
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,360
General,

154
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,800
with this ability,

155
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,520
why can't we drive away the spirit clan?

156
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,640
This is the sacred thing of the spirit clan.

157
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,440
How can it be used to kill the spirit clan?

158
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,640
You're right.

159
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,560
Wei Du,

160
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,040
how's the whereabouts of the Beecheng Bead?

161
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,680
Your Highness,

162
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,120
I've ordered people to search the whole city

163
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,240
for the whereabouts of the Beecheng Bead.

164
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,640
I believe we'll get news soon.

165
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,960
Then I'll take my leave.

166
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,240
Miss Yu, where are you going?

167
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,360
It's time for lunch.

168
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,120
I'm not hungry. I have something to do.

169
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,120
Miss Yu, are you looking for General Yan?

170
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,520
General Yan was invited to a meeting

171
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,240
by General Wei this morning.

172
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,000
How about this?

173
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,920
You go to another place with me.

174
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,360
Okay, go ahead.

175
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,240
Give this to me.

176
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,120
I'll help you get it.

177
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,240
What's the time?

178
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,440
You're still playing this?

179
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,600
It's boring.

180
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,240
Miss Yu.

181
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,640
Relax.

182
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
How about

183
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,080
I teach you a new trick today?

184
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,720
What new trick?

185
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,880
What's this?

186
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:26,720
What's this?

187
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,600
I've never seen this before.

188
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,400
Never?

189
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
What a mess.

190
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,360
What's this?

191
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,360
Come on.

192
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,240
Let's play.

193
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:37,920
Come on.

194
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Come on.

195
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,280
Buy a gift.

196
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,760
Good.

197
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,240
Who dares to bet with me?

198
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,880
I'll do it.

199
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,840
Miss Yu, what are you betting on?

200
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,440
Whoever loses,

201
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,760
take off your clothes.

202
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,520
Okay.

203
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,440
This...

204
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,680
Here it comes.

205
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,360
What?

206
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,640
You don't dare?

207
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,280
How about this?

208
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,760
I lose.

209
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,040
I'll take off my clothes.

210
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,960
If you lose,

211
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
you'll take off your shirt.

212
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,240
Okay.

213
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,480
Okay.

214
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,080
I'll do it.

215
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,680
I bet big.

216
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,200
Big.

217
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:18,880
Big.

218
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,880
Small.

219
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,400
Big.

220
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,000
Buy a gift.

221
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,080
Big.

222
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,600
I bet big.

223
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,760
Take off your clothes.

224
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,440
Take off your clothes.

225
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,240
Here it comes.

226
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,560
Here it comes.

227
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,040
Master.

228
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,000
A Xin and I went to the bathhouse to wash the grass.

229
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,080
We lost a guard.

230
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,000
I saw they all had dragon prints.

231
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,040
Master.

232
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,040
We found something.

233
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,800
Come on.

234
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,680
Master.

235
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,840
I went to the dance hall to check.

236
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,640
Yes.

237
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,240
Every soldier has dragon prints.

238
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,520
Everyone has?

239
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,040
Yes.

240
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,880
Everyone has.

241
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,120
But we don't know

242
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,840
who killed my mother.

243
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,040
I checked the Weidu.

244
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,200
She was very clean.

245
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,160
I don't know where my father is now.

246
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,240
Did he find

247
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,440
the dragon prints on them?

248
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:17,880
Master.

249
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,640
I'm back.

250
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,520
A Xin.

251
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,200
How is it?

252
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,680
Did you find any clues?

253
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,640
I've searched the whole place.

254
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,600
I didn't find the mark

255
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,400
the old man left.

256
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,600
You didn't find any mark?

257
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,000
No.

258
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,600
The damn Weidu

259
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,000
is lying to me.

260
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,520
If my father left,

261
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,200
it means he's done with it.

262
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,120
According to his habit,

263
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,920
if he's done with it,

264
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,520
he'll go to the bathhouse to have fun.

265
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:43,960
But now,

266
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,600
there's no news about him

267
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,040
around the bathhouse.

268
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,440
It means

269
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,480
he's still in the city.

270
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,880
Still in the city?

271
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,000
Why did Weidu lie to us?

272
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,000
Hum.

273
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,520
He wants me to stay away from Lu Yan

274
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,640
and play tricks with me.

275
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,120
Then I'll test his power.

276
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,600
Where's your General Wei?

277
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,280
Oh.

278
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,960
General Weidu went out.

279
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,200
I heard

280
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,440
that all the soldiers of the Shu Army are good at martial arts.

281
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,560
Why don't we have a match?

282
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,440
Miss Yu.

283
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
You're good at swordplay.

284
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,560
General Wei is in the mansion.

285
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:41,720
Why don't we have a match?

286
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,200
Miss Yu.

287
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,480
You're the General's guest.

288
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,040
What?

289
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,200
Are you afraid of General Wei?

290
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,920
Miss Yu.

291
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:53,840
What?

292
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,400
You dare not to fight?

293
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,920
Swordplay is not my cup of tea.

294
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,120
It's just a match.

295
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,120
Is there any secret

296
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,720
hidden in General Wei's moves?

297
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,840
Are you afraid that I'll learn it?

298
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,240
General Wei is good at martial arts.

299
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,040
If you're not the spiritual clan,

300
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,720
what are you doing?

301
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,960
I...

302
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,560
General.

303
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,320
Wait.

304
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,120
General, I...

305
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,040
I'm fine.

306
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,760
I'm pretending.

307
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,440
I know you're pretending.

308
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,440
What do you know?

309
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,120
You know that

310
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,680
you're with Wei Du every day.

311
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,960
You don't care about me at all.

312
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,000
Seriously,

313
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,120
don't you think that Wei Du is suspicious?

314
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,840
You're with him every day.

315
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,520
Don't you think he's suspicious?

316
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,440
I'm not.

317
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,160
I'm not.

318
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,760
I'm not.

319
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:15,440
I'm not.

320
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,040
I'm not.

321
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,600
I'm not.

322
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,280
I'm not.

323
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:17,840
I'm not.

324
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,440
I'm not.

325
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,160
I'm not.

326
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,840
I'm not.

327
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,640
I'm not.

328
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,120
You're not.

329
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
Wei Du and I

330
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,640
had a close relationship in the battlefield.

331
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,160
We're best friends.

332
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,320
I trust him.

333
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,240
Great.

334
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,400
You trust him?

335
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,120
So you don't trust me?

336
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,360
Lu Yan, let me ask you.

337
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,320
Between him and me,

338
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,400
who do you choose?

339
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,360
Wait.

340
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,440
Don't mess around!

341
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,400
Who's messing around?

342
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,440
How did I mess around?

343
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,520
I'm messing around?

344
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:48,040
Lu Yan, you're so bad-tempered.

345
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,160
Now that you have him,

346
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
You don't believe me?

347
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,760
I don't believe you.

348
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,960
But there must be some misunderstanding between you.

349
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,760
He's not a scheming person.

350
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,560
There's no misunderstanding.

351
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
Listen,

352
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,960
it's a pity that this Wei Du doesn't play the role of a palace servant.

353
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,360
I will never let you repeat the same mistake.

354
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,960
The Palace Maid of the Palace of the Deceased

355
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,760
Zhurong.

356
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,960
Zhurong.

357
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,560
Zhurong, come out.

358
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,560
Are you satisfied with the reunion

359
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,360
I arranged for you?

360
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,160
You brought them here to find the Beecheng Pearl?

361
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,360
You want General Lu to come back

362
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,360
to complete the great cause of Shu in your heart.

363
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,160
As for how I brought it here,

364
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,160
why do you care?

365
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:18,960
General.

366
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,960
Come in.

367
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,560
But you know that Beecheng Pearl is...

368
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,960
So what?

369
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,560
You're worried that General Yan

370
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,960
will abandon you

371
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,160
for that woman.

372
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,160
General is generous and sincere.

373
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,960
How could he do that?

374
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,360
Very good.

375
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,160
Bring me the fish lantern.

376
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,360
I'll give you the fish lantern.

377
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,160
We'll take what we need.

378
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,960
It's a clear deal.

379
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
All the people in Wushu City

380
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,960
are still the fish lanterns.

381
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,760
The lighter the better.

382
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,160
I believe General Wei

383
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,360
will have his own judgment.

384
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,360
General,

385
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,960
we found the Beecheng Pearl.

386
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,560
It's in the enemy's palace.

387
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,160
The fish lantern is very dangerous.

388
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,760
If you want to come in,

389
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,560
you have to release the living thing

390
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,960
to distract him.

391
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,360
Master,

392
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,360
I didn't expect this ancient tree to be so rich.

393
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,960
So many pearls.

394
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,560
Which one is the Beecheng Pearl?

395
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,760
The Beecheng Pearl is a rare treasure.

396
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,160
After the king of Shu State

397
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,160
hid the Beecheng Pearl and other treasures

398
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,760
in the holy land of Shu State.

399
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,360
Do you think they're weird today?

400
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,160
Yesterday, they played with us

401
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,560
and soaked in the soup.

402
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,160
Today, they dare not look at us.

403
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,160
General Wei is too great.

404
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,360
He scared them into this.

405
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
I think so.

406
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,360
Could it be that General Wei

407
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,160
is too close to you and Lu Yan?

408
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,360
He's trying to get rid of us.

409
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,360
If so,

410
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
General Wei

411
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,360
could have spent

412
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,960
several rounds in the book.

413
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
He's great.

414
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,960
I'm not a vegetarian.

415
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,360
Brother Gao,

416
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,360
yesterday, the 556

417
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,560
was really amazing.

418
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,160
Let's play it again.

419
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,160
What do you think?

420
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,160
Miss Lv,

421
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,960
I think we're busy with training every day.

422
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,960
They don't have time to play with you.

423
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:43,960
I'm sorry.

424
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,560
If you can't hold it in,

425
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,960
I'll have someone from the city

426
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,560
find you some men

427
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,960
to have a good time with you.

428
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
General Wei,

429
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,160
it sounds like

430
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,960
a good thing.

431
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,560
I just want to remind you

432
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,560
not to ruin the atmosphere in our army.

433
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
I just want to remind you...

434
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,160
Brother,

435
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,960
let's go find the Beecheng Pearl.

436
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,160
Gui Du.

437
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,760
Yes.

438
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,160
How far is it from the treasure house?

439
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,960
It's coming.

440
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,560
Let's go.

441
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
Yes.

442
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,560
Hurry up.

443
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,760
Hurry up.

444
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,760
Yes.

445
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
General.

446
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,760
You're here?

447
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Yes.

448
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,760
You're here?

449
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,760
Yes.

450
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,760
Ah.

451
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,760
Ah.

452
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,760
Ah.

453
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,760
Ah.

454
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
Ah.

455
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
Ah.

456
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,760
Ah.

457
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,760
Ah.

458
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,760
Be quiet.

459
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:14,660
This is the Cardinal Hall of the Goddess Hall.

460
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,480
Please all come close to the F continuity Pool

461
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,140
which audiences carrots

462
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,960
show respect for the she adaptation league

463
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,200
4km

464
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:58,940
General

465
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:48,000
Where's LI

466
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,120
Go.

467
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,600
So,

468
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,800
do you think you've bowed to your parents?

469
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,480
What do you think?

470
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,200
Since you bowed to your parents,

471
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,560
it's a fair game.

472
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,040
I'll see who will fight with me in the future.

473
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,440
I'll go with you.

474
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,400
General Wei,

475
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
since you've washed your hands,

476
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,520
and your ancestors have lost,

477
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,400
can you take us in?

478
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,240
I'll go in with you.

479
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,880
You and Brother Peng

480
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:32,640
can wait here for now.

481
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,000
Why?

482
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,360
Inside is

483
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,600
the treasure room of the royal family of Shu.

484
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,880
Only the royal family of Shu

485
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,240
is qualified to enter.

486
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:41,480
You and Brother Peng

487
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,760
are foreigners after all.

488
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,320
It's not convenient for you to enter.

489
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,920
I'll leave the soldiers with you.

490
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,040
You can wait here

491
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,360
in peace.

492
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:50,840
It won't be dangerous.

493
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,640
General Wei,

494
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,800
you're not a member of the royal family, are you?

495
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,440
Lu Yan and I have already

496
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,920
married and married.

497
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,400
How can you enter instead?

498
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,800
I'm a foreigner now.

499
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,280
Wait.

500
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,720
Wait for me here.

501
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,760
I'll be back soon.

502
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,840
Okay.

503
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,760
I'll listen to you.

504
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,080
Come back soon.

505
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:12,720
Don't worry.

506
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,200
General, please.

507
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,520
I'll go check on it.

508
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,360
General,

509
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,880
to take over our land

510
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,520
and kill our people.

511
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,880
The people are not happy about

512
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,960
what the Spirit Clan has done.

513
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,560
Fortunately,

514
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,240
the former king and the latter general

515
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,280
fought against the enemy on the battlefield.

516
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,800
They sacrificed tens of thousands of people

517
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,760
to defend the Spirit Clan

518
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,480
from the enemy.

519
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:06,840
Unfortunately,

520
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,280
the result was a loss.

521
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,640
They failed to

522
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,120
kill the people.

523
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:18,960
General,

524
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,400
the treasure room is ahead.

525
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,360
General, please.

526
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,320
General,

527
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:43,880
please be careful.

528
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,320
Are you sure, Sir Jin?

529
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:49,920
General,

530
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,960
is the thing

531
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,040
you were looking for

532
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,880
here?

533
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,640
and bring it back.

534
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,640
It's a treasure.

535
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,160
I represent the tens of thousands of soldiers

536
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
from three thousand years ago.

537
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,280
I hope you can hold the sword again

538
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,880
and take the nine spirits away from here.

539
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,000
I'm not here for the Dragon Sword.

540
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,600
Where is the Jade Pillar?

541
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,240
General,

542
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
you're so smart.

543
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,760
You let me lead the way when I entered the underground palace.

544
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,000
I'm sure you knew

545
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,160
that I had been to the underground palace many times

546
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,120
and was very familiar with it.

547
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,240
Since that's the case,

548
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,240
I don't need to hide it.

549
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,200
The Jade Pillar is indeed hidden in the underground palace.

550
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,640
You took the sword

551
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,360
and led us to kill the spirits.

552
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,720
I'll give you the Jade Pillar.

553
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,320
The gap between humans and spirits has been cleared.

554
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,800
I have no intention of killing the spirits with the sword.

555
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,680
General,

556
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,360
have you forgotten the will of the late king

557
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,160
to drive away the spirits?

558
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,960
Have you forgotten that the late king

559
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,880
had left the Dragon Soul

560
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,360
on you

561
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,880
and said something to you?

562
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,680
General Zhuo.

563
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,960
Did I say something wrong?

564
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,960
Do your parents owe me any sooner

565
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:53,840
or later?

566
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,600
Why should they do this to me?

567
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:01,880
I...

568
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,320
I found theontol mark

569
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,640
on the floor

570
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,560
Back then,

571
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,080
I and my brothers

572
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,840
thought you saved the Holy Daughter of the Spirit Tribe

573
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,120
and died in the secret forest.

574
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,980
So we left the same Dragon Soul

575
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,960
on our own.

576
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,440
We did it to remember

577
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,480
the mission of the Spirit Tribe

578
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,360
of the Shu soldiers.

579
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,520
The mission of the Shu soldiers

580
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,920
was never to kill the whole Spirit Tribe.

581
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,160
It was to protect the people

582
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,560
and live a peaceful life.

583
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,360
The Spirit Tribe is immortal.

584
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,720
How can the world be peaceful?

585
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,400
General,

586
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,440
we were weak back then.

587
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,880
We couldn't kill the Spirit Tribe.

588
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,560
But now you have the yuan pellet

589
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,280
and the energy source of the Spirit Tribe.

590
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,760
This is the best chance

591
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,920
for us to kill the Spirit Tribe.

592
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,960
It's been 3,000 years.

593
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,360
The world of humans and the Spirit Tribe

594
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,920
has been integrated into one.

595
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,880
It's closely related.

596
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,080
It can't be separated.

597
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,400
It's impossible for any party

598
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,520
to kill the other party.

599
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,800
Moreover,

600
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,160
Yu Deng Deng has the same peace

601
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,480
and belief as Yun Xi.

602
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,760
I believe he can make a wise choice.

603
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,400
I also believe

604
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,520
he can lead humans and the Spirit Tribe

605
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,200
to continue living in peace.

606
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,200
The people of the Spirit Tribe.

607
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,680
How can we trust him?

608
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,680
General,

609
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,080
we can't give up on our cause.

610
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:40,680
Enough!

611
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,320
Let's not talk about the yuan pellet anymore.

612
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,400
Give me the ice pearl.

613
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,000
I knew you would make such a choice.

614
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,800
But

615
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,080
you're willing to return the pellet.

616
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,400
But Yu Deng Deng

617
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
may not be able to live

618
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,280
until that time.

619
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,520
What do you mean?

620
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,520
3,000 years ago,

621
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,840
you were bewitched by that woman

622
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,040
and almost lost your life.

623
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,960
This time, I will never let you

624
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,960
repeat the same mistake.

625
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,200
What are you going to do to her?

626
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,960
It's not me who is going to do anything to her.

627
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,120
It's her.

628
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,720
What is she going to do to her?

629
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:32,920
She?

630
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,920
Zhu Rong?

631
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,200
Wei Du,

632
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,760
in order to hold me back,

633
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,200
you're willing to work with Zhu Rong.

634
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,320
As long as I can kill that woman who bewitched you,

635
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,080
I can also

636
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,080
work with Zhu Rong.

637
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,440
General,

638
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,920
please take this sword.

639
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,920
Wei Du, Wei Du.

640
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,520
This underground palace is very evil.

641
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,640
The secret passage is dangerous.

642
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,960
I've been searching for a hundred years.

643
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,480
There are still many places I haven't been to.

644
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,080
Besides,

645
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,280
this underground palace can be used to control the spirit of the spiritual clan.

646
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,360
No matter how powerful you are,

647
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,200
it's hard to find Yu Deng Deng

648
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,080
in this underground palace.

649
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,080
General,

650
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:34,560
don't go.

651
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,600
Come on.

652
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,840
Wei Du,

653
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,360
you are forcing me

654
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,600
to become someone like Zhu Rong.

655
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,560
You tried to make everyone

656
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,120
request me to value my treasures,

657
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,760
and live a better life.

658
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,600
Nonsense!

659
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,560
You're not our general.

660
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,640
She won't abandon us!

661
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,760
You're no longer the general we were after!

662
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,160
I told you.

663
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,800
Yu Deng Deng...

664
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,400
He might not live.

665
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,600
You underestimated him.

666
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,000
He's a debtor.

667
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,360
Yu Deng Deng just sent a message.

668
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,200
The Beecheng Pearl is here.

669
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,000
What?

670
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:32,840
Wei Du.

671
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,960
Thanks.

672
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,520
Hey!

673
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,080
Now you've lost Count.

674
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,720
Bastard.

675
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,880
The Beecheng Pearl.

676
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,240
How is it?

677
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,640
Don't blame me,

678
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,800
but I've items.

679
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,120
Even if they're this big...

680
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,320
someone would take them Freddy's...

681
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,680
That's right.

682
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,280
Captain.

683
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,680
People went into they house the other night.

684
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,720
She must be at the train station waiting to meet weather (*un her April 14. Very heart-wrenching.

685
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,280
It tastes good.

686
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,800
I'm like a man,

687
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,760
it's such a balls.

688
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,920
Fine, fine, I'll try to get you some.

689
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,640
Here, I got the rest.

690
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,160
Do you think that is way too difficult?

691
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,880
How long have you not brushed your teeth?

692
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,200
Why is your saliva so smelly?

693
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,080
Is it smelly?

694
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,640
Man.

695
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,200
It's not smelly, Master. Smell it.

696
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,600
It's disgusting.

697
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,960
It's not my favorite.

698
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,560
I...

699
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,080
Master, it's not smelly at all.

700
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,400
But it smells like...

701
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,600
like...

702
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,320
the smell of a dead man.

703
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,320
Stop talking nonsense.

704
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,280
This is a treasure of the underground palace.

705
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,440
How can it smell like a dead man?

706
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,720
Don't scare me.

707
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,120
Unless it's not just a treasure.

708
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,080
Is it because General Wei

709
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,120
really envies you and Lu Yinan?

710
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,280
He wants to trap us here.

711
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,160
He wants to kill us.

712
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,800
Anyway, let's run away first.

713
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,440
Run in the direction of Lu Yinan.

714
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,280
Okay. Let's be careful.

715
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,640
Good.

716
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,520
You're so tired.

717
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,200
Take a break.

718
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,400
Your back is sore.

719
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,400
Thank you.

720
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,200
Sit for a while.

721
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,040
Take a rest.

722
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,200
It's a waste to run.

723
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,880
It's a waste of energy.

724
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,560
Let's go.

725
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,160
Why are you two running?

726
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,240
I'm hungry.

727
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,640
I thought there was a toilet over there.

728
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,520
Yes.

729
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,240
Master.

730
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,400
They were supposed to go there.

731
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,920
Why can't we

732
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,520
go around?

733
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,520
There must be something wrong with this place.

734
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,520
Uncle Jiu.

735
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,520
We were tricked by that Wei Du.

736
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,480
Did he really plan to

737
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,480
trap us here?

738
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,200
We have to find another way out.

739
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,240
Right.

740
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,640
I still have this.

741
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,280
Soldiers, are you tired?

742
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,440
Come on.

743
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,520
Let's bet.

744
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,520
I taught you yesterday.

745
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,560
It's simple.

746
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,480
Big or small.

747
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,400
Come on.

748
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,280
Come on.

749
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:36,840
Let's bet.

750
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,760
Small.

751
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,520
Come on.

752
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,360
Let's bet.

753
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,040
Come on.

754
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,320
You're out.

755
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:42,560
Look.

756
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,400
This is fun.

757
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,120
Come on.

758
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,800
Come on.

759
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,760
Let's bet.

760
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,440
Come on.

761
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:46,920
Come on.

762
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,640
Teach me.

763
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,880
Big.

764
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:49,880
Big.

765
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,800
Big.

766
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,880
Big.

767
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,800
It's okay.

768
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,840
This time it must be big.

769
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,760
Big.

770
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,760
Big.

771
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,760
Big.

772
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,040
Big.

773
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,040
Big.

774
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,760
Come on.

775
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,520
Come on.

776
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:01,920
Come on.

777
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,960
Come on.

778
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,600
This time it must be big.

779
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,800
This time it must be big.

780
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,720
Big.

781
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,440
Come on.

782
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,280
Big.

783
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,080
Big.

784
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,520
Big.

785
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,320
Big.

786
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,560
This time it must be big.

787
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,240
Yeah.

788
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,520
This is a bet.

789
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,840
Come on.

790
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,600
There's no way out?

791
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,600
I'm tired.

792
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,440
Let's go.

793
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,080
Let's go.

794
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,120
Go back.

795
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,120
I'm so tired.

796
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,520
What should I do?

797
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:38,840
Go.

798
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
Go again?

799
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,760
Slow down.

800
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,600
Slow down.

801
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,240
Slow down.

802
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,200
Slow down.

803
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:46,680
Hurry up.

804
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,440
Slow down.

805
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
I'm back.

806
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,280
I'm tired.

807
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:57,920
I'm tired.

808
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,840
Let's take a break.

809
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,040
Dad.

810
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:02,960
Uncle Li.

811
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,800
Do you think this is a treasure house?

812
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,440
Or a maze?

813
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,280
This place is so scary.

814
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,040
Don't you think

815
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,520
all the soldiers are not afraid?

816
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,440
Speaking of these soldiers,

817
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,840
I feel strange.

818
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,640
Before,

819
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,200
they had played with me, right?

820
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,360
Why do I feel like

821
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,040
I don't know them at all today?

822
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,640
Yeah.

823
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,680
That's what I'm talking about.

824
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:27,920
They played with us before.

825
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,160
They were playing with the shovels.

826
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,000
Look at them today.

827
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,920
They pretend not to know us at all.

828
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,920
Really.

829
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,120
It's weird.

830
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,480
The people in the capital can't be trusted.

831
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,640
Big.

832
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,760
Take a break and leave.

833
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,040
Find Lu Yan as soon as possible.

834
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,440
Leave this place.

835
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:48,760
Go.

836
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,760
Isn't this the mark left by Master?

837
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,600
Yes.

838
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,280
It's my father's mark.

839
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,200
He left it here.

840
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,800
There's no other way.

841
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,760
What's this place?

842
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,440
Let's go in and have a look.

843
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,200
Don't, Master.

844
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,280
There's no other way out.

845
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,080
Master.

846
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,800
This...

847
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,560
Be careful.

848
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,080
Master.

849
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,680
It's too dark.

850
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,280
Is there anything dirty?

851
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,040
Don't talk nonsense.

852
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,600
Don't be afraid.

853
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,440
I'm here.

854
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,040
Find the firecracker first.

855
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,560
What?

856
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,240
It's too dark.

857
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,440
What are you doing to me?

858
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,800
Firecracker.

859
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,560
Come out.

860
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,040
Go, Master.

861
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,080
Don't be afraid.

862
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:23,720
This is...

863
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:24,560
Calm down.

864
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,160
What's going on?

865
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,720
Let's see what's going on.

866
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,040
Big Sea.

867
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,840
There's something wrong with these clothes.

868
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,560
What do you mean?

869
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,200
Come here.

870
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,680
Master.

871
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,440
Come here.

872
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:40,800
Look.

873
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,000
There's a mark left.

874
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,440
It's from the firecracker.

875
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,400
It's the mark left by the firecracker.

876
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,680
It's the mark left by the firecracker.

877
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,040
It's the mark left by the firecracker.

878
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,480
It's the mark left by the firecracker.

879
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,440
I don't know

880
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,920
which era these clothes are from.

881
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,720
These.

882
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,080
These.

883
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,160
These are from the recent years.

884
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,480
Master.

885
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,400
And these two.

886
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,720
Look.

887
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,560
Aren't these the clothes

888
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,600
that the people in the Bailu Village wear?

889
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,720
Look.

890
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,880
Do you think they are

891
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,360
friends of the fool Master?

892
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,800
In fact, they are not Master.

893
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,360
They are just like the underground workers.

894
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,880
But the Commandant said

895
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,160
that the underground workers

896
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,560
have a long way to go.

897
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,480
It's impossible for ordinary people to get in.

898
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,720
So

899
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,720
there must be other problems in here.

900
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,760
Maybe my father

901
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,360
discovered something strange in it

902
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,920
and took the risk to come down.

903
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,200
These people.

904
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,880
They died here.

905
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,920
There's no place for them to pay their respects.

906
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,560
How pitiful.

907
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:49,800
It's a good thing that they died here.

908
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,480
It's too early to be worried.

909
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,040
Rest in peace.

910
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,080
Master.

911
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,520
Firecracker.

912
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,720
Master.

913
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,840
I'm in a dark place.

914
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,320
Firecracker.

915
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,920
Firecracker took me out.

916
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,040
Is this the Firecracker that the fool said?

917
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:26,200
If love can be touched

918
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,280
then the necklace will have a sound

919
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,640
The most beautiful scenery in life

920
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,760
is all about you

921
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,040
When two stars are close together

922
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,320
When the whole world is occupied by you

923
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,080
I will call for you with all my strength

924
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:03,120
until I can remember you

925
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,960
You are the only one

926
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:15,960
walking into the scenery

927
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,720
The rain falls and the leaves fall

928
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,800
The clouds separate the love

929
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:27,560
I hide in my heart

930
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,960
and make a decision for you

931
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,480
When two stars are close together

932
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,960
When the whole world is occupied by you

933
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,880
I will call for you with all my strength

934
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:05,720
until I can remember you

935
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:11,960
You are the only one

936
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,720
walking into the scenery

937
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,040
The rain falls and the leaves fall

938
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:23,000
The clouds separate the love

939
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,880
I hide in my heart

940
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:31,760
and make a decision for you
