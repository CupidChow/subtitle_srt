164
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,270
Because when they're dancing,

they will have their fingers crossed,

It's your wedding tomorrow.

258
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,020
You can't stay up late.

259

Otherwise, you won't look pretty.

260

00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:58,960

268
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,730
you get drunk easily, so don't drink too much.

269
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,640
Here.

270
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,110

272
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:24,060

273
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,860
Yes, what's wrong with you?

274
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,760
Nothing.

275
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,460

How are you doing?

278
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,860
Is it because you don't like the things

279
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,020
we bought for you?

280
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,850
Here, let's drink another bowl.

281
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,150

282
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:39,900
No, we can't drink anymore.

283
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,210

284
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,580

285
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,470

286
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,670
Nothing.

287
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,690
I just don't want to leave you two.

288
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,120
Look at you.

289
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,480
I'm getting married tomorrow.

290
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,290
Uncle,

291
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,400
my father...

292
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,550
Please take care of him.

293
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,210
He's hot-tempered.

294
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,160
He likes drinking and making trouble.

295
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,910
Take good care of him, please.

296
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,650
Besides,

297
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,910
you should also take care of yourself.

298
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,220
You never listen to me.

299
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,680
Lu Yan gave us so many betrothal gifts.

300
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,690
In the future,

301
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,240
it'll be enough for Qingquan Stronghold to spend for years.

302
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,490
The new year's coming,

303
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,990
you should also buy some clothes for yourselves.

304
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,010
Can you promise this?

305
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,660
My girl.

306
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,290
What are you talking about?

307
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:37,610
It sounds like you're not coming back.

308
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:39,860
Isn't Lu Yan going to live at our home?

309
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:40,670
Also,

310
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:42,440
the clothes he bought for me

311
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,770
are so ugly.

312
00:16:43,830 --> 00:16:45,780
In the future, you'd better buy clothes for me in person.

313
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,200
Nonsense!

314
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,320
From the day we set up the stronghold,

315
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,840
all your clothes were bought by me.

316
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,650
Aren't you dressed well now?

317
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
What do you think?

318
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,400
So ugly.

319
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,370
Our kid is a little weird.

320
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,230
Enough.

321
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,430
Why are you crying?

322
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,320
I know you might have concerns about your marriage.

323
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,390
Don't think too much.

324
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,780
You can never leave this stronghold.

325
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,140
Everyone in the stronghold

326
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,200
is counting on you.

327
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,730
You are our chieftain.

328
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,270
Yes, that's right.

329
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,119
I know.

330
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:18,720
Uncle. Father.

331
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,510
As long as

332
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,160
I can lean on someone else,

333
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:24,359
it will be difficult for me to make decisions.

334
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:25,910
In the future,

335
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:28,940
I still have to rely on you for many years.

336
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:32,750
My girl,

337
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,490
I know you better than anyone else does.

338
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,260
Do you want to tell me something?

339
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,150
You don't want to get married, do you?

340
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:42,960
Tell me.

341
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,300
I'll tell Lu Yan to break off the engagement.

342
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,240
If you regret it, I'll tell him for you.

343
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:47,890
I'll tell him.

344
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,270
I'll go.

345
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,100
I'll talk to him.

346
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:49,890
I'll go.

347
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,690
Enough. Stop arguing.

348
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:53,990
What are you talking about?

349
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:57,280
Your daughter has a good taste.

350
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,390
I won't change my mind.

351
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,620
To be honest,

352
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,370
I brought Lu Yan up the mountain

353
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,610
because I liked his appearance.

354
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,920
But then,

355
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:11,040
I went down the mountain and experienced so many things with him.

356
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:12,630
I fall in love with

357
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,320
Lu Yan

358
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,040
step by step.

359
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,980
He's always silent.

360
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,950
That's just his cover.

361
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,180
In fact, he's the most courageous

362
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,530
and kindest person I've ever met.

363
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,190
Three thousand years ago,

364
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,310
he was the general of the Ancient Shu.

365
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,780
What he bore in his mind

366
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,710
was all about his people and country.

367
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:43,460
If one has a high position,

368
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,050
he will definitely have a lot of burden.

369
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,720
People call him General Yan.

370
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:50,680
Later,

371
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,650
he sacrificed his life for the ancient Shu.

372
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,800
So,

373
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,580
he is

374
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,960
a righteous man.

375
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,830
Later, Yun Xi died for him.

376
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,680
He went down the mountain and took off his military uniform,

377
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:11,900
and stayed with her for 3,000 years.

378
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,960
During our journey,

379
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:18,110
he also protected me silently

380
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,430
and risked his life to save me.

381
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,900
So,

382
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:25,670
he's a loving and great person.

383
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,540
It's rare to meet

384
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,200
in thousands of years.

385
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,140
I'm afraid I can't meet another one

386
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,680
in my life.

387
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,140
So,

388
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,750
no matter what he does wrong in the future,

389
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,670
don't blame him.

390
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,370
Okay.

391
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,710
I thought

392
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,080
you're always so naive.

393
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,220
But it looks that you've grown up.

394
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,140
I'll be relieved

395
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,520
of your marriage with Lu Yan.

396
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,150
I can rest in peace when I die.

397
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,460
Don't say these unlucky words.

398
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,680
Dengdeng, I've talked to Lu Yan.

399
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,290
Although he didn't say much,

400
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,830
I can feel from his eyes

401
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,620
he really loves you.

402
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,330
You can trust him forever.

403
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,250
If he bullies you in the future,

404
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,980
your father and uncle

405
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,340
won't let him go.

406
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,590
Yes.

407
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,190
Okay.

408
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,850
Wipe your urine like tears quickly.

409
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,860
You also cried before

410
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:37,990
when Dengdeng's away.

411
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:38,730
Stop it.

412
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,580
Enough.

413
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,000
How can you laugh at me?

414
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,510
Let's stop crying.

415
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,790
Let's have another drink.

416
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:44,890
Okay.

417
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,510
Let's talk about something happy.

418
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:47,750
Come on.

419
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,220
Cheers.

420
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,560
Cheers.

421
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,970
Why are you here?

422
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:35,420
Our wedding is tomorrow.

423
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,430
The bride and groom

424
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:38,970
can't meet each other at the previous night.

425
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:41,480
You're drunk.

426
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,890
Go get some rest.

427
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,980
I'm not drunk.

428
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,140
Lu Yan.

429
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,740
I'm so happy.

430
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,960
I haven't been so happy for years.

431
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,090
When we got married for the first time,

432
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,990
you were unwilling.

433
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,760
I was ingenuous.

434
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,480
We didn't know

435
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,880
how it feels to love someone.

436
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:13,800
At that time, I was totally wrong.

437
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,340
I thought I could make you love me

438
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,320
by tying you up.

439
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,150
Lu Yan.

440
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,600
Tell me.

441
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:30,160
Did I do something wrong from the very beginning?

442
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,030
I really want

443
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,550
to be with you forever.

444
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,520
I want to travel to every corner of the world with you.

445
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,990
We haven't

446
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,990
travelled around the country together.

447
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,820
In the future,

448
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,940
there will be many opportunities

449
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:10,950
for us to go on trips

450
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,910
together.

451
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,660
Lu Yan,

452
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:25,090
Can you promise me

453
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,290
to live for yourself this time?

454
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,930
Three thousand years ago, you did everything for the Ancient Shu.

455
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,880
Now, 3,000 years later,

456
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,560
it's for me.

457
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,950
This time,

458
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,930
I hope you can live for yourself only.

459
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,870
Why am I so nagging now?

460
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,450
Since I met you,

461
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:03,550
I'm no longer the person

462
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,720
who can afford to let go.

463
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,040
Tell me,

464
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,650
have I been controlled by you?

465
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,890
If you hadn't met me,

466
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,030
maybe

467
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,790
you would still be that

468
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,080
kind,

469
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,520

and happy Yu Dengdeng.

Without you,

472
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,130
I'm not complete.

473
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:55,490
No.

Whose daughter is getting married?

It's yours.

Why are you crying again?

486
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,880
when did you see me cry?

487
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,170
Your father's eyes were red, too.

488
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,590
What happened?

our Dengdeng has married a demon.

493
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,240
Right. Lu Yan is so handsome.

494
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,300
He can be considered as

495

a handsome demon.

496
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,690
That's right.

497
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:29,830
He is a demon.

498
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,690

Let me see you again.

503
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:47,950
I'm old and ugly.

504
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,140
What's there to see?

505
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,550
My uncle has a small nose and small eyes.

506
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,010
I didn't expect you to be so handsome.

What's the use?

508

It's just an lonely old man.

It's a big day for you.

510

Look at you.

511
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,590
All right.
