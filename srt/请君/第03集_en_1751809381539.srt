1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll never let go after the storm

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You ask, it's not me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You ask, it's not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You ask, it's not me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You ask, it's not me

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The Love by Hypnotic

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Episode 1

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Lu Yi Niang, can you tell me something?

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Who are you?

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm the boss of a school in town.

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Where do you live?

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Qingliu, No. 2, Xinji School.

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Why didn't I hear about you before?

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I just came back from my hometown.

16
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm usually taken care of by the shopkeeper.

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Where is your hometown?

18
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Chuan County.

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Who is the county magistrate now?

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Li Feng Yue.

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
How many people are there in your family?

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
How many siblings do you have?

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
My parents passed away.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I have three siblings at home.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
One older brother above, one younger brother below.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Since you still care about it,

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
why did you choose us?

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Since you are a man, you should live with us.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Mr. Lu, I also want to confess to you.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Our Deng Deng has never been a mother.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Her father and I didn't take good care of her.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
She is a little rough.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It was her fault to bring you here.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I apologize on her behalf.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Please forgive me.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No. 2, you think too much.

37
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Since I chose to stay, I have no intention of hate.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's good.

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Our Deng Deng is simple-minded and dedicated to people.

40
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I am a person from the past.

41
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I can see that she likes you very much.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Although our village is poor,

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
she has never missed a bite.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
She is the pearl on our palm.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If anyone dares to harm her,

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I will never let her go.

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You don't like that Ying Long Gu?

48
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
She is very good.

49
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't you want her?

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You scared me.

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Deng Deng, listen to my advice.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Lu is too complicated.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's dangerous to bring her in here.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Mr. Lu, you are the one who should be brought in.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You are the one who is not good at it.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You think too much.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I have already sent someone to ask.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It's the boss of Xing Ji.

59
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Parents, siblings, no name, no surname.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I have never heard of anyone with the surname Lu.

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You are just being ignorant.

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Ignorant?

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Besides, I want to marry Lu Yan.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I am not her brother or sister.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You have asked a lot.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What else did you ask?

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Is her brother or sister as good-looking as her?

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You have a good figure.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
She is not an ordinary person.

70
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Don't worry, father.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We are not afraid of her.

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
We can just get her back.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Even if she is the boss,

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
the people of our village are afraid of her.

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
She is our golden bowl.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I have to keep her well.

77
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Wipe your saliva.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Golden bowl.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You are trying to get her face

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
and her body, right?

81
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's right.

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I like her money and her face.

83
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I also like her body.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't be addicted to beauty.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You have been famous for your beauty.

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Which king died on this?

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
King?

88
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Brother, I didn't expect

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
you have such a high expectation for me.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Don't worry.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I will not disappoint you.

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't say that I praise you.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Why do I like her?

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I am a little thief.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
How dare you send me to look for a job?

96
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Wait.

97
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
One day,

98
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I will let you know

99
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
how I am.

100
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I will let you know

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
how I am.

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I will let you know

103
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
how I am.

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I will let you know

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
how I am.

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Brother.

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You are

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
a friend of Lu Yi Niang.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's so late.

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You are studying by yourself?

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I am bored by myself.

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
How about

113
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I help you?

114
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I can do it.

115
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You are so righteous.

116
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
We are family now.

117
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I like to ask about

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
the temperature and humidity.

119
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I heard that our old village head

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
is a hunter.

121
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Is there anything new?

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Tell me.

123
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Let me go back

124
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
and have a chat with my friends.

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Let me help you.

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I heard this

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
when the old village head was drunk.

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You know our big boss

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
is Yu Deng Deng.

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
He was not

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
three years old.

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He got a strange disease

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
and he was out of breath.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Our old village head

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
was praying to the Buddha.

137
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
The next day,

138
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
a big red disease in the deep mountains

139
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
caught a

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
life-saving god bird.

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
God bird?

142
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I heard that

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
this god bird

144
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
is a female.

145
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I think it can speak

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
when it grows up.

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
And then?

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
And then?

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It ate it.

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I cooked it for a bowl of soup

151
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
and gave it to the boss.

152
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It was enough.

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
It was strong.

154
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It was all because of the god bird.

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You know that god bird is not sick.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You ate it.

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Where are you going?

158
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's going to rain.

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Let's go.

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The day when Yunxi's spirit stone

161
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
is turned into gold

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and gold plated.

163
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Sir,

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
you can't break the original power.

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If the original power is back to normal,

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
your body will not be able to take it.

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The female village head

168
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
may not be right.

169
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Even if the spirit stone

170
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
is caught by them,

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
it's not a mountain or a forest.

172
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The mortal body

173
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
can't absorb the fusion.

174
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We have other chances.

175
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You are right.

176
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
If the spirit stone is not broken,

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
there is still a chance to get it back.

178
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Yes.

179
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Our urgent task

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
is to make sure

181
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
that there is no trace of the owner

182
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
on it.

183
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'll use the original power again.

184
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The original power of Yunxi

185
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
is not available to the human body.

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll find it.

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes.

188
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll go and find it.

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yunxi has

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
a special power.

191
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll go and find it.

192
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Do you have any idea

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
what Yunxi's original power is?

194
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The spirit stone of Yunxi

195
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
must have a trace of it.

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
If the spirit stone is still there,

197
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
we can take it out

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
when Yu Deng Deng is still alive.

199
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
That's great.

200
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Yu Deng Deng is asleep.

201
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
It's easy now.

202
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Sir,

203
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'll go outside and check the wind.

204
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay.

205
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Who is it?

206
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Lu Yan?

207
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Why did you

208
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
come to my room in the middle of the night?

209
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You wanted to kill your husband?

210
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Your wife?

211
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You're thinking too much.

212
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm not.

213
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm not.

214
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm not.

215
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm not.

216
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm not.

217
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm not.

218
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm not.

219
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm not.

220
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm not.

221
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm not.

222
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'm not.

223
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm not.

224
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I'm not.

225
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm not.

226
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Then you're thinking...

227
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You're underestimating me!

228
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You're really thinking too much.

229
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I saw you looking serious every morning.

230
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I didn't realize

231
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
you would do something like that.

232
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Now that you're here,

233
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
you can kiss me first.

234
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,800
Get out.

235
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,240
No.

236
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,360
Why should I?

237
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,120
You sent me here.

238
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,440
You only allowed the officials to set the fire,

239
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,760
not the people to light the lamps.

240
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,400
It's not time to kill her yet.

241
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,680
Yu Dangdang,

242
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,280
you're my master.

243
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,280
Let her go.

244
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The spirit of Yunxi is indeed in your body.

245
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,760
Sir, did you find it out?

246
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,240
The spirit of Yunxi is indeed completely scattered.

247
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,880
It's not the spirit of Yunxi.

248
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,280
It's the spirit of Yunxi.

249
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,240
It's the spirit of Yunxi.

250
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
It's the spirit of Yunxi.

251
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,640
The spirit of Yunxi is indeed completely scattered.

252
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,160
That's great.

253
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,640
Our spirit clan is the foundation of spirit.

254
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,000
As long as the spirit of spirit is still here,

255
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,800
the master will have a chance to transform.

256
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,960
Sir, how about we take out

257
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,720
the spirit of the master now?

258
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,320
The spirit of Yunxi is already

259
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,480
completely combined with Yu Dangdang's body.

260
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,280
We can only use our yuan energy to forcefully dig it out.

261
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,160
When the time comes tomorrow,

262
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,280
I'll do it myself.

263
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:54,960
Right.

264
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,800
It's best to find another place to put it.

265
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,000
The pain of the spirit of spirit is even more severe

266
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,120
than the pain of the Jin Valley Village.

267
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,920
The spirit clan in the Jin Valley can't stand it.

268
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,920
Digging out the spirit of spirit

269
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,360
will probably be as painful as this.

270
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,200
If we dig out the spirit of spirit here,

271
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,120
the human woman's home

272
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,160
won't make any noise

273
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,000
and it will cause unnecessary trouble.

274
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,000
Xin,

275
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,920
you go down the mountain in advance tonight

276
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,200
and prepare for me.

277
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,640
Tomorrow, I will find a way

278
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,440
to lure Yu Dangdang out of the mountain.

279
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,200
Okay, sir.

280
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,320
Senior,

281
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,320
let's go.

282
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,920
Alright, stop playing.

283
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,640
Here, eat this.

284
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,200
It's good for your stomach.

285
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,680
Here.

286
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,560
What a dream!

287
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,640
It's just a dream.

288
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,600
Wait.

289
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,560
Why does my neck hurt so much?

290
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,320
I just had a dream.

291
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,920
Why did I have a rash?

292
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,600
You had a rash?

293
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,160
Let me see.

294
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,360
Let me see.

295
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,360
Where does it hurt? Here?

296
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,000
Master, I know.

297
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,680
You must have been

298
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,960
looking down for too long.

299
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,640
Is this your daily rhythm?

300
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,800
You're so mean.

301
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,040
You're like a god.

302
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,080
What do you know?

303
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,920
This is Mrs. Lu.

304
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,680
Why do you like her so much?

305
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,720
There are so many

306
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,520
rich men in our town.

307
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,080
You're so spoiled.

308
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,120
She doesn't like you.

309
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,000
It's so hard for you.

310
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,880
She's different from those

311
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,640
common people.

312
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,240
Besides,

313
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,440
who says I'm always spoiling her?

314
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,840
Who says she doesn't like me?

315
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,600
Sit down.

316
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,600
Let me tell you a secret.

317
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,200
Last night,

318
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,880
she came to me secretly.

319
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Oh my god!

320
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,760
Really?

321
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,080
Right?

322
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,520
I like this.

323
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,640
Last night,

324
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,280
Mrs. Lu came to me

325
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,080
secretly in the middle of the night.

326
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,040
She even touched my bed.

327
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,720
Oh my god!

328
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,600
She's so bold!

329
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,120
And then?

330
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,640
And then,

331
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,720
she just

332
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,880
tried to kill me.

333
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,680
After a fight,

334
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,480
I just

335
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,680
pressed her down like this.

336
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,480
And then,

337
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,480
I was so close to her.

338
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:38,880
Then she

339
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
slowly

340
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,240
slowly

341
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,600
got close to me.

342
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,800
I just...

343
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,120
I just fell asleep.

344
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,680
That's all?

345
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,520
Yes.

346
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,320
I...

347
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,520
I've memorized the words.

348
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,760
Just listen to these.

349
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,640
Master.

350
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,160
You...

351
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,280
Are you...

352
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,400
not good at this?

353
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,640
How can you say that?

354
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,360
I'm too sleepy, okay?

355
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,480
Don't be nervous.

356
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,000
Master, Mrs. Lu is here.

357
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,920
Big Sea, Big Sea.

358
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,080
Let's see how I'm doing.

359
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,920
Is the dark circle heavy?

360
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:19,880
No.

361
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,640
It's good.

362
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,480
I'm sorry.

363
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,160
I'm sorry.

364
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,920
I'm sorry.

365
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:26,880
I'm sorry.

366
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,840
I'm sorry.

367
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,640
I'm sorry.

368
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
I'm sorry.

369
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,320
You're here.

370
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,600
Don't you want to sleep more?

371
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,240
I just want to ask.

372
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,720
The wedding is the day after tomorrow.

373
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,840
Why haven't you

374
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,600
come to the wedding?

375
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,080
I wanted to.

376
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,360
But I'm a little tight recently.

377
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,640
I'm not rich enough.

378
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:54,520
We have some money

379
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
to lend you.

380
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,240
You're a family now.

381
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
You're so rich.

382
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,440
You're so rich.

383
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,960
You're right.

384
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,920
You're rich.

385
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,680
You don't want to

386
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,760
spend our money.

387
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,720
If you think

388
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,080
it's not worth it,

389
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,160
I understand.

390
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,000
No, no, no.

391
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,040
It's worth it.

392
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,400
How can it be not worth it for you?

393
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,760
The clothes are old.

394
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,440
It's time to buy some new ones.

395
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,440
Let's go.

396
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,040
Let's go down the mountain and buy some new ones.

397
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,760
New ones?

398
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,280
It's gone.

399
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,440
It's too much to talk about love.

400
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,120
Sir, look at this vase.

401
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,040
It's so beautiful.

402
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,000
You have a house

403
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,960
with a hundred pairs.

404
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
I'll take them all.

405
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,920
Thank you, sir.

406
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,600
Sir,

407
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,280
you can't even afford

408
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,640
such a good deal.

409
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,960
You can't even pay the rent.

410
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,560
What's wrong, Chief?

411
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,280
No.

412
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,080
I'm in charge of the house.

413
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,880
He's in charge of the beauty.

414
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,040
As long as he's happy.

415
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,040
Sir, look at this.

416
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:13,640
Why don't you just give him a few?

417
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:14,640
Right.

418
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,280
It turns out that Chief

419
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,880
is used to spending money

420
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,960
on things that are borrowed.

421
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,080
You're really a great eye-catcher.

422
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,800
Don't worry.

423
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,920
I'm the owner of the big debt in Qingquan.

424
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,640
I have a way to support you.

425
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,560
Buy whatever you want.

426
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,800
Buy whatever you want.

427
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,000
Okay.

428
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:35,600
Da Hai.

429
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,760
Did you get the wedding invitation for Uncle Ya?

430
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,040
It's here.

431
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,200
Wait for me.

432
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,560
Tell him

433
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,120
not to buy more expensive things.

434
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,480
I understand.

435
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,440
Wait.

436
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,040
Uncle Ya.

437
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,120
Don't.

438
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,440
Don't.

439
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,200
Uncle Ya.

440
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,960
Let me help you.

441
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:56,960
Let me help you.

442
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,360
Where should I put this?

443
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:59,200
Thank you.

444
00:17:59,200 --> 00:17:59,800
Here.

445
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,600
Okay.

446
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,080
Uncle Ya, sit down.

447
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,640
Chief Yu,

448
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,520
why do you come here today?

449
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,760
I'm here to deliver something.

450
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,720
No need.

451
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,680
Last time, you sent me the goods.

452
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,240
I haven't finished them yet.

453
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,920
This time,

454
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,000
it's not for delivery.

455
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,680
It's a wedding invitation.

456
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,600
I'm going to get married.

457
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,360
It's a big wedding.

458
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,680
Congratulations, Chief Yu.

459
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,520
Congratulations, Chief Yu.

460
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,320
Uncle Ya.

461
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,800
Don't be polite to me.

462
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,160
You should call me Deng Deng.

463
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,880
When I was young,

464
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,160
I often came to your photo studio

465
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,640
and took pictures with my father.

466
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,720
In front of you,

467
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,880
I was still the yellow-haired girl.

468
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,840
You called me Chief Yu.

469
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,160
Isn't that a joke?

470
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,160
Good girl.

471
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,080
You're still so sharp-tongued.

472
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,720
Where's your father?

473
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,560
He hasn't come back yet.

474
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,280
No.

475
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,960
I asked someone to burn a letter

476
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,120
and tell him about the wedding.

477
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,080
I don't know if he can come back.

478
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,680
He will definitely come back.

479
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,760
Your father is so worried about you.

480
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:07,760
Yes.

481
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,480
If he doesn't come back,

482
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,840
I won't recognize him as my father.

483
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,880
By the way, Uncle Ya,

484
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,200
you must come.

485
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,000
And remember to bring your camera.

486
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,840
I have to take a good picture and keep it.

487
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,000
Okay.

488
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,280
I will take a good picture for you.

489
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,800
Okay.

490
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,600
Stop.

491
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,320
Don't fall.

492
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,320
So crazy.

493
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,720
Lu Yan, I want to switch with you.

494
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,920
I'll be your little...

495
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:00,880
Thank you.

496
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,360
Sir.

497
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:18,520
It's time.

498
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,600
According to your order,

499
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,240
after Yu Deng Deng enters the forest,

500
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,360
the Ghost-beating Wall will disperse with the rest.

501
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,240
I'll go and keep an eye on the others.

502
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,880
You two are the only ones left.

503
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,000
It's convenient for you to do it.

504
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,080
Okay.

505
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,160
Master,

506
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,800
it's too foggy.

507
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,600
Why don't we find a place to rest?

508
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,360
Brother Hai.

509
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,360
Brother Hai.

510
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,680
The sedan chair of Chief and Lu Yu Deng is missing.

511
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,680
Missing?

512
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,320
Missing?

513
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:02,960
It's here.

514
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,040
Hurry up and find it.

515
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,680
Find it.

516
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,280
Master.

517
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,120
Chief.

518
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,920
Master.

519
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,080
Chief.

520
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,200
Brother.

521
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,440
You've been walking for so long.

522
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,680
Why haven't you arrived yet?

523
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,480
Brother.

524
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,080
What's going on?

525
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,080
Where is he?

526
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,080
Da Hai.

527
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
Da Hai.

528
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,720
That's weird.

529
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,120
What is this place?

530
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,360
Madam Lu.

531
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,360
Da Hai.

532
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,800
Why did it disperse?

533
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,280
Could it be...

534
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,560
Madam Lu.

535
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,600
My...

536
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,320
Why does my heart hurt so much?

537
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,560
It's like I'm dying.

538
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:06,520
Where are Peng Nan Hai and the others?

539
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,920
They haven't arrived yet.

540
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,240
They're waiting for you.

541
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,520
They're waiting for me.

542
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,480
They're waiting for me.

543
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,680
They're waiting for me.

544
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
They're waiting for me.

545
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,680
They're waiting for me.

546
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,680
They're waiting for me.

547
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
They're waiting for me.

548
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
They're waiting for me.

549
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,000
They must be waiting.

550
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,040
They must be waiting.

551
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,080
You should understand now.

552
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:41,160
You don't have to be wrong,

553
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,160
Angel.

554
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,320
It seems bad.

555
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,360
The three Kingdoms are far away.

556
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,800
I don't think I got it right.

557
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,600
What is this?

558
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,200
Wild people?

559
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,000
They're not human at all.

560
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,800
Your dagger is useless.

561
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,840
Didn't you say that the man was in the sedan chair?

562
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,320
Who knows why they

563
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,720
changed their positions?

564
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,400
But that master didn't fool us.

565
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,720
These wild people are quite fierce.

566
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,640
Useless.

567
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,400
If Deng Deng is killed by those wild people,

568
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,080
I won't spare you.

569
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,400
Will they eat us?

570
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,400
It's possible that they eat you.

571
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,760
You and me at this time?

572
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,960
You're a beggar if you eat me.

573
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,960
Boss, if you eat it, it will be exposed.

574
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,640
When?

575
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,600
And you're going to teach these?

576
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,120
You go first.

577
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,160
I'll deal with them.

578
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,560
I...

579
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:16,600
Who?

580
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,840
Who shot?

581
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:20,880
Did you see it?

582
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,280
Maybe it's someone who has many problems.

583
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,600
Boss, you're so strong.

584
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,000
Boss, let's withdraw.

585
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,120
If the fish village finds out that we're playing,

586
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,720
there will be no more game.

587
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,400
That's good.

588
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,120
Anyway, those wild people are dead.

589
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,240
Deng Deng shouldn't be in danger.

590
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,520
Go.

591
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,800
Go, go, go.

592
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,480
Go, go, go.

593
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,960
What's going on?

594
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,320
Aren't they all dead?

595
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,160
This...

596
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,280
There's another spiritual seat?

597
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,480
He's gone.

598
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,000
Such a chAL exists again.

599
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:04,480
The Double Astronomy in Bailu Mountain

600
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,740
was presented by the chief of Ye's clan

601
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,320
to Legis and objective of Clansman's T Silk Mist Congratulations.

602
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,240
Is everyone under attack to watch him?

603
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,200
Certainly not.

604
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,500
Uncle, Mom,

605
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:37,800
drag in this

606
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,800
That is勢,

607
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,760
holding onto Heaven and Earth.

608
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,680
It will be dashing to skill.

609
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,960
Then you die.

610
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,160
Let's move.

611
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:54,000
First?

612
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
What's wrong with him?

613
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,100
Brother Peng seems fine.

614
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,820
Are you okay, Master?

615
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:12,380
The pulse is always in the right place.

616
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,580
It's rare.

617
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,140
The male pulse is always in the right place.

618
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,260
The female pulse is always in the right place.

619
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:18,780
The male pulse is always in the right place.

620
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,540
The pulse is always in the right place.

621
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,740
Always in the right place?

622
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,260
It's enough that he's fine.

623
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,780
You guys go back now.

624
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,180
Goodbye.

625
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:32,700
Come on, Doctor.

626
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,540
I'll send you home.

627
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:35,660
Let's go.

628
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:36,860
Let's go.

629
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:37,740
Let's go.

630
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,620
It's okay.

631
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,780
Have a good rest.

632
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,620
Don't be too hard on him.

633
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,700
He's fine.

634
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,340
Hai,

635
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,780
what's going on?

636
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,340
Why are you suddenly dizzy?

637
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,620
Master!

638
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,500
Master!

639
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,220
Master!

640
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,020
Master!

641
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:50,740
Master!

642
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:51,740
Master!

643
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,500
Master!

644
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,180
Master!

645
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,020
Master!

646
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:55,820
Master!

647
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:56,580
Master!

648
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,660
The wound is quite deep.

649
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,380
I'll apply some medicine for you.

650
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,060
Don't move.

651
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,740
Wait.

652
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,220
You go apply the medicine he applied.

653
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:06,780
I'll do it.

654
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,860
It's nothing.

655
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:09,420
It's okay.

656
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:10,980
I'll do it.

657
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,340
Master, it's okay.

658
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:13,820
So

659
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:15,580
the spirit clan is the leader.

660
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,340
Did he come for you

661
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,020
or for the spirit of my master

662
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,820
in this body?

663
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,500
These spirits

664
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,260
came for Yunxi today.

665
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,460
Did someone else know

666
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,420
that the master was re-invited?

667
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:30,180
I didn't tell anyone.

668
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,500
Why did the spirit clan

669
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,700
disappear?

670
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,020
Stop looking.

671
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,380
How could this be

672
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,780
recorded in the human book?

673
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:43,980
Master,

674
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,620
these are not ordinary books.

675
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,580
These are the ancient books

676
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,900
that the hunter wrote.

677
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,420
The author is Yu Houdao.

678
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,620
Yu Houdao?

679
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,260
Could he be

680
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,580
the ancestor of Yu Deng Deng?

681
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,500
This...

682
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,180
This is the ancient book

683
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,020
that the hunter wrote.

684
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,460
Master,

685
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,500
I found it.

686
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,460
Look.

687
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,380
500 years ago,

688
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,260
a hunter

689
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,780
ate the spirit food of the spirit clan

690
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:10,060
and caused the spirit clan to be furious.

691
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,220
The spirit clan forced to take out the spirit food,

692
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,820
but the food was scattered.

693
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,540
The reason is

694
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,620
the spirit aura between the heaven and the earth gradually diluted.

695
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,460
And the spirit food of the spirit clan

696
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,900
was taken out in vain

697
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,220
like a candle in the wind.

698
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,820
Unless...

699
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,740
The full moon night,

700
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,500
the spirit bone was taken out.

701
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,020
That's right.

702
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,180
The book also says

703
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,420
the full moon night

704
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,500
is the most powerful.

705
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,940
And the ashes of the ancient spirit clan

706
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,980
were turned into the spirit array.

707
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,700
It's a sure thing.

708
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,580
If the body is dead,

709
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,860
the spirit food will be scattered.

710
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,660
It seems that before the full moon night,

711
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,740
we must keep Yu Deng Deng safe.

712
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:49,940
It's okay.

713
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,060
Be strong.

714
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,700
Do you know

715
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,020
what kind of hero

716
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,740
the owner of this village was?

717
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,100
Four sides of the square,

718
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,420
dozens of wild people,

719
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:09,940
and the

720
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,620
long teeth.

721
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,580
He punched me

722
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,700
and slapped me.

723
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,780
He made them fall asleep.

724
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,500
You must practice hard.

725
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,860
He's injured and he's still so noisy.

726
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,380
You are talking about Yu Deng Deng.

727
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,140
I'll find a way to shut him up.

728
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:26,780
No need.

729
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,220
Let him go.

730
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,500
It's not long.

731
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,700
But sir,

732
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,620
the full moon night is so powerful.

733
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,700
It's not rare to set up a spirit array.

734
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:35,820
But

735
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,300
in this world,

736
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,220
it's rare to see the spirit clan for hundreds of years.

737
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,140
Where should we find

738
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,340
the ashes of the ancient spirit clan?

739
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,140
In the Jasi Hall,

740
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,820
there is the Yilong Valley.

741
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,060
There are many good things in it.

742
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,300
I'll show you.

743
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,780
The Jasi Hall

744
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:45,860
You mean

745
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,420
the forbidden barrier of the Jasi Hall

746
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,820
was made by the Yilong Valley?

747
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:50,180
Yes.

748
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,380
Could it be that the Jasi Hall

749
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,940
has hidden some secret

750
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,540
that used the power of the Yilong Valley

751
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,620
to make this barrier?

752
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,820
Is the barrier so powerful

753
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,100
that even you can't break it?

754
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,780
It may be hard.

755
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,140
But I don't want to

756
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,380
cause other people's alarm.

757
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,020
Sir, I'll go back first.

758
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:20,260
Don't you know the etiquette of knocking the door?

759
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,900
Enter your own door.

760
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,100
No need to knock the door.

761
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,260
What's the matter?

762
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,860
You've been working hard in the war.

763
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:30,860
How about

764
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,780
I massage you in the bedroom?

765
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,660
No need. No need.

766
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,380
Forget it.

767
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,020
Look what I brought you.

768
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,620
Why did you bring this?

769
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,700
Your favorite.

770
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,620
When did I say

771
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,780
I like this?

772
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,500
Stop pretending.

773
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,660
When you saw the porcelain bowl,

774
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,780
you didn't blink.

775
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,980
That time in my room,

776
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,340
when you saw the porcelain bowl,

777
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,740
you wanted to swallow it.

778
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,020
You're wrong.

779
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,940
Stop making excuses.

780
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,260
I wanted to buy

781
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,380
the second-class porcelain bowl for you.

782
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:02,860
But their porcelain bowl is sold out.

783
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,780
So,

784
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,300
I cooked it myself

785
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,260
and made it for you.

786
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,340
Try it.

787
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,700
I'm not interested in this.

788
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,900
You're so selfish.

789
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,580
You haven't tasted it.

790
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,820
How can you be not interested?

791
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,900
No matter how delicious your favorite was,

792
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,380
where can I buy it for you?

793
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,500
Try it.

794
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,060
Maybe you'll like it more.

795
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,940
It's better than the one you used to eat.

796
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:22,500
Come on.

797
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,660
I don't want to eat it.

798
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,060
Have a bite.

799
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,580
You don't want to eat it?

800
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:29,820
Fine.

801
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,540
If you don't want to eat it,

802
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,380
I'll just stay here.

803
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,780
Anyway, I'm good at cooking.

804
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,540
As long as I can see you like this,

805
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,300
I'll be more energetic

806
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,740
and even stay here for a night.

807
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,660
Eat it.

808
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,780
I've tasted it.

809
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,020
How is it?

810
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,260
Is it sweet?

811
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,540
This is the best red sugar

812
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,140
I've stolen from the second-class kitchen.

813
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,260
Do you like it?

814
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,100
It's okay.

815
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,340
It's okay.

816
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,580
You can die if you say you like it.

817
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,860
It's okay.

818
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,860
Next time you say it's okay,

819
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,220
I'll take it as a like.

820
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,660
Let me ask you.

821
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,860
Do you like me?

822
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,740
You came here today

823
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,940
just to ask this?

824
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,580
Actually,

825
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,940
I want to thank you for saving me.

826
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,740
Didn't I say

827
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,100
you don't have to thank me?

828
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,500
It's the wild man who was shot by the hunter.

829
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,140
You can't say that.

830
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,420
It was so dangerous.

831
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,740
You didn't leave me.

832
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,660
We are

833
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,340
a couple who have experienced life and death.

834
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,620
You looked so beautiful

835
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,260
when you were fighting the wild man.

836
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:45,620
I forgot to be afraid.

837
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,700
I just looked at you.

838
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,060
You called me first.

839
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,060
Thank you.

840
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,380
What's the relationship between us?

841
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,580
If you have any questions in the future,

842
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,420
just ask me.

843
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,820
I'll help you.

844
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,780
I'll do anything for you.

845
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,460
I don't have any questions.

846
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,420
I just have one thing

847
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,820
to ask you.

848
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,220
Ask.

849
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,100
What's the secret

850
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,540
in the Yu's temple?

851
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,380
Why is it so dark?

852
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,780
There's no secret.

853
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,140
I've been there so many times.

854
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,220
There's nothing special.

855
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,420
I've been there for a long time.

856
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,140
Can you show me around?

857
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,300
No.

858
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,660
The Yu's temple

859
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,900
can only be entered

860
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,140
when the important festival

861
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,460
of the ancestral deity is celebrated.

862
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,740
And only the Yu family can enter.

863
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,820
Important festival?

864
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,740
We have to wait until the mid-autumn festival.

865
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,980
It seems that we can only find another way.

866
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:42,980
By the way,

867
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,820
after we get married tomorrow,

868
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,140
you'll be a member of the Yu family.

869
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,220
The next morning,

870
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,940
I can take you to the ancestral deity.

871
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:52,940
You go first.

872
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,860
I'll deal with them.

873
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,060
I'm sorry.

874
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:22,940
I'm sorry.

875
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,860
I'm sorry.

876
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,860
I'm sorry.

877
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,860
I'm sorry.

878
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,860
I'm sorry.

879
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,860
I'm sorry.

880
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,860
I'm sorry.

881
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,860
I'm sorry.

882
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,860
I'm sorry.

883
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,860
I'm sorry.

884
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,860
I'm sorry.

885
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,860
I'm sorry.

886
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,860
I'm sorry.

887
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,860
I'm sorry.

888
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,860
I'm sorry.

889
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,860
I'm sorry.

890
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,860
I'm sorry.

891
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,860
I'm sorry.

892
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,860
I'm sorry.

893
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,860
I'm sorry.

894
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,860
I'm sorry.

895
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,860
I'm sorry.

896
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,860
I'm sorry.

897
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,860
I'm sorry.

898
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,860
I'm sorry.

899
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,860
I'm sorry.

900
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,860
I'm sorry.

901
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,860
I'm sorry.

902
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,860
I'm sorry.

903
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,860
I'm sorry.

904
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,860
I'm sorry.

905
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,860
I'm sorry.

906
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,860
I'm sorry.

907
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,860
I'm sorry.

908
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,860
I'm sorry.

909
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,860
I'm sorry.

910
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,860
I'm sorry.

911
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,860
I'm sorry.

912
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,860
I'm sorry.

913
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,860
I'm sorry.

914
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,860
I'm sorry.

915
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,860
I'm sorry.

916
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,860
I'm sorry.

917
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,860
I'm sorry.

918
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,860
I'm sorry.

919
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,860
I'm sorry.

920
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,860
I'm sorry.

921
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,860
I'm sorry.

922
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,860
I'm sorry.

923
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,860
I'm sorry.

924
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,860
I'm sorry.

925
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,860
I'm sorry.

926
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,860
I'm sorry.

927
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,860
I'm sorry.

928
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,860
I'm sorry.

929
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,860
I'm sorry.

930
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,860
I'm sorry.

931
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,860
I'm sorry.

932
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,860
I'm sorry.

933
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,860
I'm sorry.

934
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,860
I'm sorry.

935
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,860
I'm sorry.

936
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,860
I'm sorry.

937
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,860
I'm sorry.

938
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,860
I'm sorry.

939
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,860
I'm sorry.

940
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,860
I'm sorry.

941
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,860
I'm sorry.

942
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,860
I'm sorry.

943
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,860
I'm sorry.

944
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,860
I'm sorry.

945
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,860
I'm sorry.

946
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,860
I'm sorry.

947
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,860
I'm sorry.

948
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,860
I'm sorry.

949
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:37,860
I'm sorry.

950
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,860
I'm sorry.

951
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,860
I'm sorry.

952
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,860
I'm sorry.

953
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:41,860
I'm sorry.

954
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:42,860
I'm sorry.

955
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,860

I'm sorry.

961
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:52,860
When two hearts are so close

962
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:56,860
When the whole world is occupied by you

963
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,860
I will call your name with all my heart

964
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,860
Until your memory

965
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:12,860
You are the only one for me

966
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:19,860
The scenery of my own

967
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,860
This city is you and me

968
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,860
We are separated by love

969
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:30,860
I avoid my happiness

970
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,860
The decision I made for you

971
