1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220
Fish on Field

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll never let go after you leave

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You are me

4
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You are me

5
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You are me

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You are me

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You are me

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You are me

9
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You are me

10
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Episode 1

11
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
How about this?

12
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
When we get back to Qingquan,

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'll make you a house like this

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
so you can live a peaceful life

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
with flowers and plants

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay, thank you

17
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
How can you just say thank you?

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
How about...

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
What do you want?

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Forget it, I won't force you

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm just kidding

22
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll tell you my discovery

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Actually, I have a discovery too

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
My discovery is...

25
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Be careful of your ears

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Write it in my hand

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We think the same

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You really have the same feelings

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Tomorrow, you can tell me by a letter

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll find a way to open a channel

31
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and let you leave

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If that's the case,

33
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
it's too scary

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
When I think about it,

35
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
you and Weidu are going to face this

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm really worried

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's okay, but you must go

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Find a safe place to get rid of the spirit bugs

39
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You have to know that

40
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
only when you're fine,

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I can be safe

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I know

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
But you have to be careful too

44
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No matter what decision you make,

45
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll support you

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Please

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,760
You're welcome.

48
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,640
Don't disturb the people.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,680
If it's convenient,

50
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,440
ask them where they are.

51
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,600
Yes.

52
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,000
Boss.

53
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,280
The village is strange.

54
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,200
The villagers look so happy.

55
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,000
I told you to find a place to sleep.

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,120
Who told you to pay attention to their expression?

57
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,760
No.

58
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,560
They said the village chief ordered

59
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,520
not to allow outsiders.

60
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:15,960
They won't say anything.

61
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,040
But I found an empty house.

62
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,720
We can spend the night there.

63
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,800
Let's go.

64
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,720
What's going on?

65
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,600
Something strange happened to the family.

66
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,560
They had a good birthday party yesterday.

67
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
But they went to worship outside.

68
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,280
They haven't come back yet.

69
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,720
They lost their family.

70
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,040
They don't want to find someone.

71
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,080
Why are they here?

72
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,960
That's right.

73
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,520
The villagers said

74
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,880
the family was taken away by

75
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,240
some god in the mountains.

76
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,920
The poor people

77
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,520
are lucky to have no firecrackers.

78
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,800
They can have a god in the mountains.

79
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,120
God bless.

80
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,120
I've said it before.

81
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,240
The family is prosperous.

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,520
The family is prosperous.

83
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,960
They will be lucky.

84
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,720
I'm so lucky.

85
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,360
Are you crazy?

86
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,800
It's strange.

87
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,040
They all look like wood.

88
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:26,840
Right?

89
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,560
They look like wood.

90
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,080
They don't know it at all.

91
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,040
I wonder

92
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,720
if the village chief has been here before.

93
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,040
Let's take a rest today.

94
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,320
We'll find a chance

95
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,840
to ask around in other villages tomorrow.

96
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,040
Yes.

97
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,320
Go.

98
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,040
Let's go.

99
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,960
Are you here to find someone?

100
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,320
After those nobles

101
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,680
helped me recover,

102
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,960
they mentioned

103
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,200
the thing called Bichen Bead.

104
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,600
They went to the mountain.

105
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,680
If they really went in,

106
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,720
they would have been there for three or five days.

107
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,920
It's really them.

108
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
I don't remember

109
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,680
what they are.

110
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,000
But I feel

111
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,200
it's a very dangerous place.

112
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,440
Those nobles saved me.

113
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,400
The missing Zhang's wife,

114
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,560
the one named Mei,

115
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
are also my benefactors.

116
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,800
You are their friend.

117
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,960
Please

118
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,880
save them.

119
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,080
Don't thank me in a hurry.

120
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,440
They are important to me.

121
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,000
Take me to the place

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,440
you mentioned tomorrow morning.

123
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,080
Wang Lishan.

124
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,520
Send more men

125
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,440
to inquire about it tomorrow.

126
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,680
See if there's any clue.

127
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,280
Yes.

128
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,640
Hold on.

129
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,320
Yu Dengdeng.

130
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,360
Where are you now?

131
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,600
Lu Yan!

132
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,560
Come out!

133
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,640
Lu Yan!

134
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:00,840
You until…

135
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:01,840
Dad!

136
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,320
Come out.

137
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,080
Dad!

138
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,640
Dad!

139
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,520
Why didn't you stay?

140
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,560
He isn't here.

141
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,360
I heard that

142
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,120
Lu Yan was there.

143
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,080
He slipped into your room.

144
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,760
Isn't that true?

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,600
Did you see him?

146
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,200
I know the truth.

147
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,040
Dad, dad, dad.

148
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,920
It's a misunderstanding.

149
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,520
Dad,

150
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,520
it's all for the Commandant.

151
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,880
For the Commandant?

152
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,120
Are you asleep?

153
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:21,840
No.

154
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,720
How could I be asleep?

155
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,080
No.

156
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,960
Of course not.

157
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,880
You're lying, aren't you?

158
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,640
I'm asleep.

159
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,440
You're asleep?

160
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,160
You didn't do anything.

161
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,280
You didn't do anything.

162
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,440
We're just discussing the countermeasures.

163
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,000
I'll give you a hard time.

164
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,320
You're already so excited in the morning.

165
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,400
Aren't you hungry?

166
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,160
Let's eat.

167
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,400
Dad,

168
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,600
you can't eat.

169
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,400
What's wrong?

170
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,320
There's something wrong with the food.

171
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,720
It stinks.

172
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,840
Then go and eat.

173
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,440
You can hold it for a while.

174
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,400
We have to leave here as soon as possible.

175
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,040
Lu Yan will figure out a way

176
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,160
to send us out.

177
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,160
But before that,

178
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,240
I need you guys

179
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,520
to help me check a few things.

180
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,080
What?

181
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,120
The sea.

182
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,920
Do you remember the last time?

183
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,640
It's there.

184
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,880
At the same place.

185
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,280
What's the hole?

186
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,480
At our comet's cave,

187
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,680
it's always been around here

188
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,000
whenever someone disappears.

189
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,840
I remember there's

190
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,000
one hole.

191
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,840
Did Zhi Hao come to find us again?

192
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,680
No.

193
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,440
He at the same place

194
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,040
Over a few months.

195
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,400
It's been months.

196
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,960
It can't disappear so quickly.

197
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:14,920
Everyone, get out of the way.

198
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,880
Look for it again.

199
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,920
Yes.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:27,600
Guys,

201
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,440
where are you going?

202
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,080
Let's play dice.

203
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,040
Dice?

204
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,240
What's dice?

205
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,600
If they don't remember how to play dice,

206
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,600
you can talk to them about the underground palace.

207
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,840
Do you have anything else?

208
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,600
You forgot?

209
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,240
We played it in the underground palace that day.

210
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,520
When the dragon stone fell,

211
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,200
we fought with the generals

212
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,640
and escaped, right?

213
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,080
What are you talking about?

214
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,160
The underground palace

215
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,000
is a place where we can enter if we want to.

216
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:53,960
By the way,

217
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,560
I remember you hurt your leg at that time.

218
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,360
Are you okay now?

219
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,960
Are you okay, bro?

220
00:10:59,360 --> 00:10:59,880
I'm fine.

221
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,360
I'm bleeding.

222
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,880
You're hurt?

223
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,760
Let me see.

224
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:05,920
Let me see.

225
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,520
What are you doing?

226
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,000
Let's go.

227
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:11,600
Let's go.

228
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,160
My goodness.

229
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,920
Is it really a monster?

230
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,440
Come on, girl.

231
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,120
Take a look.

232
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:22,960
Take a look.

233
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,960
What kind of weapon

234
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,240
do you want to buy?

235
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,080
I want to buy a sword.

236
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:41,960
I want to buy a sword.

237
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
I want to buy a sword.

238
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,000
The sword of the Zhejiang Palace

239
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,280
is placed in a wooden box.

240
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,200
It's a green sword.

241
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,520
I've already bought it.

242
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
I want this sword.

243
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,440
Bro,

244
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,160
this sword is our treasure.

245
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,800
It's a five-pillar sword.

246
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,360
If you want to buy it,

247
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,920
I have other swords here.

248
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,880
You said

249
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,080
you saw a family

250
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,080
with a grandson.

251
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,760
You were so happy.

252
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,520
You were so happy.

253
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,760
Now you can go there again

254
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,720
and see if they are still happy.

255
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,760
You'd better ask for the child's name

256
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,200
and see if what you heard

257
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,280
is exactly the same.

258
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,480
It's my honor.

259
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,160
Come on.

260
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,480
Come on.

261
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,000
Come inside.

262
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,880
You are...

263
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,760
Don't be afraid.

264
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,920
My master is a kind man.

265
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,480
I heard that your grandson is happy today.

266
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,560
So I came here to send you a gift.

267
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,200
My gift.

268
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,000
Who is your master?

269
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,280
Her name is Yu Deng Deng.

270
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,800
She is the future queen of our city.

271
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,080
This is the full moon gift

272
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,000
prepared by my master.

273
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm honored.

274
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:49,560
Come on.

275
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,640
You are too kind.

276
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:52,800
Please have a seat.

277
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,640
No, no, no.

278
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,520
You are all family.

279
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm going to live there instead.

280
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,160
By the way,

281
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,280
my master asked

282
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,240
if your grandson's name was taken.

283
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,080
If so,

284
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,160
tell me.

285
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,880
I'll tell my master

286
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,960
to tell you later.

287
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,560
Take it. Take it.

288
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,400
It's a word of the word.

289
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,480
Liu Jin.

290
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,040
Dad,

291
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,080
have you thought about

292
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,080
the name of the little treasure?

293
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,400
Yes.

294
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,240
Take a word of the word.

295
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,680
Liu Jin.

296
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,040
This is the full moon gift made by my master.

297
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,480
Please enjoy it.

298
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,800
Don't dislike it.

299
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,600
I'm honored.

300
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,640
I'll take it for her.

301
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,280
Okay.

302
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,760
Go ahead. Go ahead.

303
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,600
My goodness.

304
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,680
See you.

305
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,680
See you.

306
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,400
See you.

307
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,320
Come on.

308
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,280
Lu Yan.

309
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,000
I asked everyone to investigate in the city.

310
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,560
It proves that our guess is true.

311
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,560
People in this ancient city

312
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,360
do the same thing every day.

313
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,280
They forget everything the next day.

314
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,320
They don't remember the things sold in the store.

315
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,440
They don't remember they were hurt.

316
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,960
They don't remember they named their grandchildren.

317
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,520
The food here,

318
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,640
the people here,

319
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,480
are they all illusions?

320
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,760
But everyone of them is alive.

321
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,200
I'll listen to you.

322
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,120
We're ready to leave.

323
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,120
Be careful.

324
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:26,960
General.

325
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,040
After the ceremony tomorrow,

326
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,360
I'll give the Beecheng Pearl to you.

327
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,840
You can use it to treat Miss Yu.

328
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,080
Before that,

329
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,040
you should put it in the underground palace

330
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,360
to make it better.

331
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,320
Don't worry.

332
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,720
I asked you to take the Beecheng Pearl out

333
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,640
because I'm afraid it's not enough.

334
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,720
If you can't release enough energy

335
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,600
when the ceremony tomorrow,

336
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,920
it will cause the soldiers in the city

337
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,160
to get old and sick.

338
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,520
It will cause chaos.

339
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,560
It will be troublesome.

340
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,760
You're right.

341
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,080
Please check it.

342
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,480
Okay.

343
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,040
General, how is it?

344
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,440
It's good.

345
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,640
The energy of the Beecheng Pearl is full.

346
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,160
There won't be any problem

347
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,720
with the ceremony tomorrow.

348
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,680
Great.

349
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,200
After the ceremony tomorrow,

350
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,560
I'll be the king of the Berserk.

351
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,840
I'm afraid it's not so convenient

352
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,160
to go out at that time.

353
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,640
So today,

354
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,600
I want to take Deng Deng around.

355
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,800
You should withdraw all the guards around him.

356
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,160
With me around,

357
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,680
he won't be in trouble.

358
00:15:59,160 --> 00:15:59,840
Okay.

359
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,760
Quick, Rod Dean.

360
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,000
Hurry, that way!

361
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,240
Take care.

362
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:43,080
恐 olhar

363
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,720
After this we go to prepare the Royal Medication

364
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,400
yes

365
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:48,960
Always hurry

366
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,240
What is this class ah

367
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,160
You can go ahead now

368
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,120
On the 그렇죠

369
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,280
Come, catch this Vermillion Pearl

370
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,360
After anything goes wrong

371
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,320
You can take out yourical body

372
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,160
Yes, she's dead.

373
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,120
Nice one.

374
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:39,960
Congratulations on acquiring the

375
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,000
and was scared.

376
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,520
When you go out,

377
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,760
find someone to help him.

378
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,920
Maybe you can help him.

379
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,280
Okay, I got it.

380
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,000
You should get rid of your problem as soon as possible.

381
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,360
Don't be soft-hearted.

382
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,680
I know

383
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,480
it's cruel to tell Wei Du the truth.

384
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,080
But

385
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,080
it's even more cruel

386
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,440
to let him live in lies forever.

387
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,000
I got it.

388
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,040
Don't worry.

389
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,400
And

390
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,760
if I can't go out in time,

391
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,920
don't wait for me.

392
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,320
Go back to Qingquan Village first.

393
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,560
I'll go to you.

394
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,560
Okay, don't worry about me.

395
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,920
Just do your thing.

396
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,440
Okay, let's go.

397
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:26,840
Let's go.

398
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,240
Let's go.

399
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,480
Sir, take care.

400
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,840
Let's go.

401
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,480
It's so crowded.

402
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,320
It's 5pm.

403
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,720
Good, good good good.

404
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,160
Hurry up.

405
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,840
Hurry up.

406
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,920
Who's in there?

407
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,920
Gu Bei Xi!

408
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:18,920
There's someone in there.

409
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,920
Is that Gu Bei Xi?

410
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,920
I'm in there!

411
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
Yu Deng Deng?

412
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,920
Deng Deng! Is that you?

413
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,920
It's me, Gu Bei Xi!

414
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
Deng Deng!

415
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Gu Bei Gu! We're all in there!

416
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,920
Where are you?

417
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,920
I'm in the mountains!

418
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,920
It's probably a place far away.

419
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
There's a mountain in there.

420
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:45,920
Can you see it?

421
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,920
Hurry and help us!

422
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Okay!

423
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
Don't worry!

424
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,920
I'll stand up and save you right now!

425
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,920
You push back!

426
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,920
Okay!

427
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Push!

428
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
Push!

429
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:06,920
Push!

430
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
Push!

431
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,920
Who built this sword?

432
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,920
Most of the soldiers in the manor are from the Iron Generals of Duanbi.

433
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,920
General always uses his sword.

434
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,920
He challenged Susan's suggestion to build a sword.

435
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,920
He put unquote power on her words and became one of Milan's many heroes.

436
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,920
In fact,oration would be his personal Jewish heroism.

437
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,920
But the full full moon Johns have entered my mind.

438
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,920
It's a purposeful intention.

439
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
I see something strange in experiment today.

440
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,920
Let's get back to topic.

441
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
Yes!

442
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,920
I'm a military engineer.

443
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,920
What kind of iron machine do you want to use?

444
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,920
Zhao Xu.

445
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,920
You know me?

446
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,920
I think you look familiar.

447
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,920
I also know that you are good at iron.

448
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,920
The arrow you made was made by the military.

449
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,920
You are the best at iron horse palm.

450
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
But the general you know

451
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,920
can't see the value of this thing.

452
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
How do you know this?

453
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,920
You told me.

454
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,920
When?

455
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Three thousand years ago.

456
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,920
Are all the people here illusions?

457
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,920
Be careful, stone.

458
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,920
Are you okay?

459
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,920
I'm fine.

460
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,920
Thank you, brother.

461
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,920
Why are you here?

462
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
Yes.

463
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
You went to save Bai Shiqi.

464
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
How is she?

465
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
Let's not talk about this.

466
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,920
Who is she?

467
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,920
She is Xiao Mei from the next village.

468
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,920
We saved her from inside.

469
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,920
She must have been scared inside.

470
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,920
That's why she is so stupid.

471
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,920
Da Hai, clean up.

472
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
Take Xiao Mei home safely.

473
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
Okay.

474
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,920
Please ask a doctor to check her.

475
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,920
Let's go.

476
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,920
Be careful.

477
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,920
General.

478
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,920
General, bad news.

479
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,920
What happened?

480
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
Miss Yu is missing.

481
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,920
Don't panic.

482
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,920
Everyone is missing.

483
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,920
What?

484
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,920
General is gone?

485
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,920
General.

486
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,920
General.

487
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,920
General.

488
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,920
General.

489
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,920
General.

490
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,920
You didn't leave?

491
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
When did I say I was leaving?

492
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,920
Then...

493
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,920
Miss Yu and the others...

494
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,920
She has nothing to do with this.

495
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,920
She left because of you.

496
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,920
General.

497
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
Tomorrow,

498
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,920
will the ceremony be held in the same way?

499
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,920
Yes.

500
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,920
General.

501
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Is it normal to hold a ceremony in the same way?

502
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,920
Everything is the same.

503
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Okay.

504
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
If you stay here,

505
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,920
the others can leave.

506
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,920
This horse is yours.

507
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,920
Yes.

508
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,920
This horse is so ugly.

509
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,920
Kill it.

510
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,920
I'll give you a better horse.

511
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,920
General.

512
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
I was in a hurry.

513
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,920
You can punish me.

514
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
You don't even listen to my order?

515
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,920
Yes.

516
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,920
What is this place?

517
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,920
This is a good place.

518
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,920
Let's stay here.

519
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,920
I've changed the back room.

520
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,920
I'll ask them to bring the smoke to us later.

521
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,920
You're thoughtful.

522
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,920
I'll introduce you a good place.

523
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,920
There's a widow in the mountains.

524
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,920
She's so beautiful.

525
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,920
You can stay here.

526
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,920
What's wrong?

527
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,920
General.

528
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,920
General.

529
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
General.

530
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,920
Don't scare me.

531
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,920
It's troublesome.

532
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
Wait.

533
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,920
After all these days,

534
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,920
my energy is drained.

535
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,920
I'll do it.

536
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,920
Wei Du.

537
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,920
General.

538
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,920
How's it going?

539
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
I've sent people

540
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,920
to search the city.

541
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,920
Zhu Rong is cunning

542
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,920
and has the power of the soul.

543
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,920
He's good at

544
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,920
disguising himself as a man.

545
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,920
I haven't heard from him yet.

546
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,920
Zhu Rong won't leave so easily.

547
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,920
He didn't show up

548
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,920
after the attack.

549
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,920
I think he's planning something.

550
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,920
Are you worried

551
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,920
he'll make trouble at the ceremony?

552
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,920
I'll send more people

553
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,920
to search the city.

554
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,920
Zhu Rong,

555
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,920
can you enter and exit the underground palace?

556
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,920
I let him in.

557
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,920
But the guards are strict.

558
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,920
It's complicated.

559
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,920
If he's hiding there,

560
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,920
he won't be scared.

561
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,920
Send more people to check.

562
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,920
Yes.

563
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,920
Forget it.

564
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,920
I'll check it myself.

565
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,920
Yes.

566
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Does he know

567
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,920
I didn't let the people of the village

568
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,920
go?

569
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,920
It's coming out.

570
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,920
Kill this bastard.

571
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,920
What's going on?

572
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,920
Is this the same as the mirror?

573
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,920
It's good.

574
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,920
Two disasters happened at once.

575
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,920
It's very easy.

576
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,920
It needs rest.

577
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,920
Master, don't worry.

578
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,920
I'm here.

579
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,920
Don't worry.

580
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,920
I'll go make the tonic for Master.

581
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,920
The bug is gone.

582
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,920
Will it leave a mark?

583
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,920
It will.

584
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
It affects

585
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,920
his physical strength and yuan energy.

586
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,920
We need to stay here with him.

587
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,920
Let's go.

588
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,920
Don't kill yourself here.

589
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,920
How can we treat you with such a big wound?

590
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,920
What if the mosquito bites my master?

591
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,920
Let's go.

592
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,920
Master Luo.

593
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,920
Master Luo.

594
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,920
Stupid.

595
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,920
Where can I find you the tonic?

596
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,920
If you're really worried about him,

597
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,920
get well soon.

598
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,920
Go find your tonic yourself.

599
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,920
Don't come here.

600
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,920
Don't come here.

601
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,920
Come.

602
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,920
Yu.

603
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,920
Yu.

604
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,920
What are you doing?

605
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,920
You're not right.

606
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,920
Let's go.

607
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,920
Let's go.

608
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,920
The village people didn't give him treatment.

609
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,920
It was Sun Xiu who came to Chun Town

610
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,920
a few miles away.

611
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,920
He asked the doctor to give him the medicine.

612
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,920
He's sober now.

613
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,920
But look, he keeps talking nonsense.

614
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,920
Look at him.

615
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,920
He lost two of his three souls.

616
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,920
What did he see in the underground palace?

617
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,920
He was so scared.

618
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,920
Miss.

619
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,920
Don't come here.

620
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,920
Don't be afraid.

621
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,920
What did you see

622
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,920
in the underground palace?

623
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
Uncle.

624
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,920
I'm going to be eaten.

625
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,920
I'm going to be eaten.

626
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,920
Don't go.

627
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,920
Don't go.

628
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,920
Help.

629
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,920
Open your eyes.

630
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,920
Open your eyes.

631
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,920
General.

632
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,920
Today it's time to call you the emperor.

633
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,920
Let me help you change.

634
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,920
Put it down.

635
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,920
I can see you

636
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,920
on the day you rise to the throne.

637
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,320
If you're not at ease,

638
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,160
how will you change the situation?

639
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,320
What does it have to do with you?

640
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,280
You're right, Your Majesty.

641
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,160
I'm just like you.

642
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,440
I've always wanted to protect my people.

643
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,280
I've never changed.

644
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,320
Your Majesty,

645
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,640
I have a question.

646
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,400
You like Miss Yu

647
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,920
and you want to save her life.

648
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,720
Why

649
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,000
did you let her go

650
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,400
and stop taking care of her?

651
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,280
She's not from the Gu Shu.

652
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,320
So she has nothing to do with

653
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,320
what happened in the city.

654
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,240
Now,

655
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,000
there's only you, me,

656
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,040
and us

657
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,040
left in this city.

658
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,080
But you gave up on Miss Yu.

659
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,640
I wonder if she'll be regretful.

660
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,920
If Zhu Rong catches her

661
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,960
and uses her,

662
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,200
it'll be a big trouble for us.

663
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,800
How about...

664
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,080
You want to kill her?

665
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,240
It's up to you, Your Majesty.

666
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,000
We can't leave this city.

667
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,920
If we fail,

668
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,520
you have to do it yourself.

669
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,600
But I think

670
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,960
if Your Majesty is willing to die,

671
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,560
I'm afraid you can't do it.

672
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,560
Wei Du,

673
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
you weren't like this 3000 years ago.

674
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,000
At that time,

675
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,840
you couldn't even touch

676
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,120
the woman and child who came from the Fulu.

677
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:10,880
I was wrong.

678
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,240
Time flies.

679
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,400
My heart is hard.

680
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,840
How did you get through

681
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,160
these 3000 years?

682
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,360
It's like a midnight dream,

683
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,600
I have a bad cold.

684
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,240
I had a hard time

685
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,320
in the beginning.

686
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:42,880
But later,

687
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,400
I finally remember

688
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,960
it was only one year

689
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,200
when my wound nieced.

690
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,680
I remember I wasn't so serious ever then.

691
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,600
Maybe I finally

692
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
Is it worth it?

693
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
Yes.

694
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,600
Aren't you standing right in front of me?

695
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,600
It's time.

696
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,600
Let's go.

697
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,600
Let's go.

698
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,600
General Meng Li,

699
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,600
the court is here.

700
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,600
General Meng Li,

701
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,600
the court is here.

702
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
General Meng Li,

703
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,600
the court is here.

704
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,600
General Meng Li,

705
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,600
the court is here.

706
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,600
General Meng Li,

707
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,600
the court is here.

708
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
General Meng Li,

709
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,600
the court is here.

710
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,600
General Meng Li,

711
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,600
the court is here.

712
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,600
General Meng Li,

713
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
the court is here.

714
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,600
General Meng Li,

715
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,600
the court is here.

716
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
General Meng Li,

717
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,600
the court is here.

718
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,600
The court is here.

719
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
General Meng Li,

720
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,600
the court is here.

721
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,600
Drop all your weapons!

722
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
General Meng Li,

723
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,600
who are all well?

724
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,600
Who is with me?

725
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,600
Heavingarkan.

726
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
I'm here.

727
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,600
King of생מם

728
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
Great Lments.

729
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
You are awake

730
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
and scared.

731
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,600
General Meng Li.

732
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,600
This morning,

733
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
there was an earthquake

734
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
and an Liang05 great city,

735
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,000
We are all Shus

736
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,240
The world has changed

737
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,240
We are worried about the change

738
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,520
We dare to use the Black Moth

739
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,600
to tell the emperor

740
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,760
to respect the emperor

741
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,800
and restore the He Shan of the Shus

742
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,800
Respect the emperor

743
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,240
and restore the He Shan of the Shus

744
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,400
All right, get up

745
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,320
Get up

746
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,040
Wei Du

747
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,760
Can you give me the Black Moth now?

748
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,320
Yes

749
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,320
You once said

750
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,600
the people in the city

751
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,680
are all from the ancient people

752
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,520
And this Black Moth

753
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,800
is the life-saving thing for everyone, right?

754
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,400
Yes

755
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
Why do you

756
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,600
mention this?

757
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,720
No

758
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,200
Your Majesty

759
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,360
Don't panic

760
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,720
This Black Moth is fake

761
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,240
The real Black Moth

762
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,200
I've already taken it away

763
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,240
What?

764
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,160
What?

765
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,360
Your Majesty

766
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,240
How can you give the lives of the people

767
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,840
to a person from the Ling family?

768
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,520
Do you know

769
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,280
if we leave the Black Moth

770
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,800
we will die?

771
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,880
Do you really think

772
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,480
you will die without the Black Moth?

773
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,680
Do you really think

774
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,560
you can't leave here

775
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,080
because of the Black Moth?

776
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,880
What do you mean?

777
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,320
When we were all old

778
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,320
the Black Moth saved us

779
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,320
and helped us recover our original appearance

780
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,240
Except for him

781
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,760
in the city

782
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,200
there is no other power

783
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,800
I ordered you to kill your love horse yesterday

784
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,600
Why is he still here today?

785
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,800
Three thousand years ago

786
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,880
there was a single-armed blacksmith in this city

787
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,600
We all asked him to repair weapons

788
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,240
Although thousands of years have passed

789
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,280
his appearance hasn't changed at all

790
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,160
Even his clothes

791
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,080
the furniture in the house

792
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,720
hasn't changed at all

793
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,760
Don't you think it's strange?

794
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:47,760
This

795
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,160
This is nothing strange

796
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,200
Not only this single-armed blacksmith

797
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,600
but also the weather in this city

798
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:56,400
and the things that happen every day

799
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,200
live in the people here

800
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,600
Nothing

801
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,560
changes with time

802
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,880
Although they look fresh

803
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,960
they

804
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,200
just repeat their past

805
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,560
day after day

806
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,640
The name of the blacksmith is Liu Jin

807
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,800
This sword is our treasure

808
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,800
No

809
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,760
No

810
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,760
This is nothing strange

811
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,720
Stop talking

812
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,240
Stop talking

813
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,360
only

814
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,360
in this ancient square

815
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,080
there are no other living people

816
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:39,680
besides us

817
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,140
What else is there

818
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:56,200
I will use my voice

819
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,200
The most beautiful scenery in life

820
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,200
All about you

821
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,200
When two hearts are close together

822
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,200
When the whole world is occupied by you

823
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,200
I will call for you with all my heart

824
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,200
Until your memories

825
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:33,200
You are the only one for me

826
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:40,200
The scenery we walk into

827
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,200
This long voice, the night falls

828
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,200
The clouds are separated by love

829
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,200
I hide my heart

830
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,200
And make a decision for you

831
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,200
When two hearts are close together

832
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,200
When the whole world is occupied by you

833
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,200
I will call for you with all my heart

834
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Until your memories

835
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:40,200
You are the only one for me

836
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:46,200
The scenery we walk into

837
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:50,200
This long voice, the night falls

838
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
The clouds are separated by love

839
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,200
I hide my heart

840
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,200
And make a decision for you

841
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:21,200
The scenery we walk into

842
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,200
This long voice, the night falls

843
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,200
The clouds are separated by love
