1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let go even if you leave me

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You ask you, it's not me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You ask you, it's not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You ask you, it's not me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You ask you, it's not me

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What is this?

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
There is another kind of love called a man and a woman love

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
If you love the other person deeply enough

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It is also possible to give life to the other person

11
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You mean the living can die for them

12
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Why is the love of a man and a woman so powerful?

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
This is a very difficult thing to explain

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Only those who have experienced it can understand

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't think so

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I don't think so

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Then General Yan has experienced the love of a man and a woman

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Why not?

20
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't you want to try it?

21
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's go eat something

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Please enjoy

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What is this?

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
This is called a bar

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
A snack made of glutinous rice

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
These are all from the cooking method of humans

27
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is made of grain

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But why do you have to take so many steps

29
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Make the grain look like this before eating?

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Not only the bar

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
All the pancakes and buns we saw all the way

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Are made of grain

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I thought the land of Jiuzhou was really extraordinary

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Can grow so many strange things

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It turns out that these are all made of the most basic grain

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's so hard just for the fruit

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Why is it so troublesome?

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
People are sweet

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Not only to eat full, but also to eat well

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Eat well to be happy

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
To feel happy

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Happy

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What is happiness?

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You'll know when you taste it

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
This is the new bar, very hot

46
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sorry, I don't know how to use it yet

47
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You just got familiar with the human world

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
How can you learn everything at once?

49
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Come and try it

50
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This taste is really different from the rice grains on the ground

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
This is the happiness of food

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I just learned now that

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
In the human world

54
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,160
A real human can have this

55
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This is exactly what I'm talking about

56
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This is the one

57
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Is thattti

58
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,080
Now I know

59
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,760
there are so many different tastes in the world.

60
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,280
Actually, I think

61
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,720
the spiritual world

62
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,040
shouldn't only be killed.

63
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,200
The life in Jiuzhou

64
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,840
is actually very rich and colorful.

65
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,800
But because of the war,

66
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,920
many things will never be seen.

67
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,520
I'm really sorry.

68
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,000
We just want to survive.

69
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,560
The number of spiritual people

70
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,080
is far below human.

71
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,360
Jiuzhou is so big.

72
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,600
Why do you think

73
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,280
only killing and robbing

74
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,680
can feed the spiritual people?

75
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,080
Because the spiritual people think

76
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,520
although Jiuzhou is big,

77
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,480
it lacks resources

78
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,880
and it is not easy to grow.

79
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,440
So only by robbing more food

80
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,960
can the spiritual people survive.

81
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,200
Humans have the ability to

82
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,600
keep food alive.

83
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,800
I believe the spiritual people can learn it.

84
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,160
In the future,

85
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,120
please give me your guidance.

86
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,520
I believe

87
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,800
as long as the spiritual people

88
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,440
have the way to survive,

89
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,600
the day when people are peaceful

90
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,280
will come.

91
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,600
I will do my best

92
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
to help you

93
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,200
to make the peace

94
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,520
between humans and the spiritual people.

95
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:01,920
In the future,

96
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,960
you don't have to call me General.

97
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,560
Just call me by my name.

98
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,480
Just call me Lu Yan.

99
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,000
Then you can call me Yunxi.

100
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,760
Okay, Yunxi.

101
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,520
Lu Yan.

102
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
In Shu,

103
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,200
friends are called by their names.

104
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
From now on,

105
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,120
we are friends.

106
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Friends?

107
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,720
Since we are friends,

108
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,120
I will feed you.

109
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
It's late.

110
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
I'll send you back.

111
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,920
Today's trip is very profitable.

112
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,720
Can you come tomorrow?

113
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,720
Hurry up. It's raining.

114
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,920
Didn't I tell you not to use your yuan energy?

115
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,520
I didn't mean to.

116
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,320
The spirit tribe!

117
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,720
Help!

118
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,520
The spirit tribe is here!

119
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,720
Someone is here!

120
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,920
Someone is here!

121
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,120
Someone is here!

122
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,320
Someone is here!

123
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,720
Someone is here!

124
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,720
If the frost

125
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,720
can be dried

126
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,320
in a day,

127
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,720
then we can go to the next place.

128
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,520
Let's go this way.

129
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:50,320
Okay.

130
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,720
You're a general,

131
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,120
why do you need to run?

132
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,920
Your identity is special.

133
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:01,920
If someone finds you,

134
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,120
it will be more troublesome.

135
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,720
Besides,

136
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,320
even if I'm a general,

137
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,920
I can't use the general's identity

138
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:08,920
to repress them.

139
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,200
When the real world is occupied by you

140
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,920
I will use the gift to protect you

141
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,440
Actually, I'm quite happy

142
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,120
This is the first time I was chased by humans

143
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,520
Instead, I find it very interesting

144
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,280
You are the one I'm for you

145
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,200
There is no one in front

146
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,480
He must be around here

147
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,960
Everyone, look carefully

148
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:32,320
My son was killed for the spiritual clan

149
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,880
I must avenge today

150
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,720
This city has left itself

151
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,760
The distance between us and love

152
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,880
If one day

153
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,640
The energy is not used to harm people

154
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,920
But to save people

155
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,000
That would be great

156
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,800
Weapons are not good or bad

157
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,720
The point is to use weapons

158
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,360
If the human spirit can reach consensus

159
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,080
The stop may not be far

160
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,400
This city has left itself

161
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,720
The distance between us and love

162
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,880
I have a lot of heart

163
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,120
I made the decision for you

164
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,640
You are still alone

165
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,640
You are wandering in the land

166
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,320
Why are you here alone?

167
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,760
Stand here

168
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,360
I feel a little bit closer to my hometown

169
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,040
What is your hometown like?

170
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,040
At that moment,

171
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,080
it was almost no light.

172
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,480
It was my hometown.

173
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,160
Let me show you.

174
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:33,040
Since I was born,

175
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,680
my hometown has been like this.

176
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,920
But my father told me

177
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,560
that my hometown

178
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,000
was the same as yours.

179
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,120
It was as beautiful and rich as yours.

180
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,200
Later, resources began to run out.

181
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:53,920
People began to be selfish.

182
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,000
The tribe started a war.

183
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,120
In the war,

184
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,480
the resources were exhausted.

185
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,840
Some died.

186
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:04,960
Some became

187
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,480
what you see now.

188
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,240
They were as thin as firewood.

189
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,080
How did you come here?

190
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,960
The sun guided us to come here.

191
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,400
I thought

192
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,680
there were no more living things here.

193
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,520
But I didn't expect

194
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,440
that it would cause you war and harm.

195
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,040
I'm sorry.

196
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,960
Lu Yan.

197
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,440
When your tribe

198
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,000
learns the importance of human life

199
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,160
and the way to survive,

200
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,520
we can live in peace.

201
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,880
Don't worry.

202
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,600
I'll help you.

203
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,600
I hope that day

204
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,760
can come sooner.

205
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,040
The End

206
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,160
Where are you taking me?

207
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,280
Wait.

208
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,360
We'll be there soon.

209
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:34,960
Are we there?

210
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,760
Be careful.

211
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,520
Can I open my eyes now?

212
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,320
Wait a second.

213
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,520
All right.

214
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
The End

215
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,400
I saw your hometown

216
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,280
was so bright.

217
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,560
So I prepared this place

218
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,440
and added some flowers and grass.

219
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,080
I hope it can bring you

220
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,320
different feelings.

221
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,760
I hope you'll like it.

222
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,480
How do you know

223
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,080
I like flowers and grass?

224
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,480
The End

225
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
By then,

226
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,920
we can sit here

227
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,840
and watch the sun rise and set,

228
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,600
listen to the wind and rain,

229
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,480
watch the seasons change,

230
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,080
and live a carefree life.

231
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,280
By the way,

232
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
this is for you.

233
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,720
The new hairpin.

234
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,440
Lu Yan.

235
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Thank you.

236
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,880
Your heart beats so fast.

237
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,720
As fast as mine.

238
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,080
It feels so strange.

239
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,560
Is it because of

240
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,720
the so-called friendship?

241
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,400
The future is so beautiful.

242
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,360
Is that the same for you?

243
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,440
My heart is so heavy.

244
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,280
Right.

245
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,440
I'm sure I'll love you.

246
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,760
When there's no war

247
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,000
between us,

248
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,000
I'll live in this house.

249
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,680
By then,

250
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,560
you can teach me how to make a hairpin.

251
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,680
How about that?

252
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,560
Okay, let me read about it.

253
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,520
General.

254
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,560
General,

255
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,600
I'll go find him.

256
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,080
Wei Du.

257
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,760
Why have you become so strange these days?

258
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,600
Has something happened?

259
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,720
I'm strange?

260
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,320
You're the one who's strange, right, General?

261
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,560
How do you say that?

262
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,280
I'm not strange.

263
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,360
How do you say that?

264
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,080
You...

265
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,840
Are you controlled by the Yuan clan girls?

266
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,520
I've been

267
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
saying this for days.

268
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:11,920
General,

269
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,680
how many of us

270
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,360
were killed by the Ling clan on the battlefield?

271
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,520
Who did you kill

272
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,720
with this wound?

273
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,120
We have no respect for the Heavens.

274
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,840
How can you be so kind to the Ling clan girls?

275
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,480
And you even made her this room?

276
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,800
Aren't you afraid that she's a spy?

277
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,520
Wei Du,

278
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,360
I will never take risks with the safety of the people.

279
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,520
I believe in my own judgment.

280
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,280
Yunxi is different from other Ling clans.

281
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:39,840
Maybe Yunxi

282
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,840
is a chance for the peace and harmony

283
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,520
between humans and the Ling clan.

284
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,280
Peace and harmony?

285
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,280
How can the peace of both clans be easy?

286
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,000
In my opinion,

287
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,800
let's treat her as a hostage

288
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,520
and negotiate with Zhu Ruo.

289
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
What if they withdraw?

290
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,120
No.

291
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,120
If I do that,

292
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,000
I'll be a betrayer.

293
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,120
What kind of friendship do you have with the Ling clan?

294
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:05,960
Wei Du!

295
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,920
I was reckless.

296
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,440
Please punish me, General.

297
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,400
All right.

298
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,760
You've been with me for so long.

299
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,120
You know who I am.

300
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,920
I need your trust.

301
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,120
I trust you.

302
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,640
I've never doubted you.

303
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,080
I'm worried that you'll be...

304
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:41,640
All right.

305
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,200
I know.

306
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,680
I'll do as you say.

307
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,480
If you don't punish me,

308
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,920
I'll take the 20-militia-long stick back.

309
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,640
You'd better be careful.

310
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:56,640
Take care.

311
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,280
I'll leave now.

312
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,560
It seems that this is a difficult battle.

313
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,160
I was too simple.

314
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,240
I've been in Shu for a while.

315
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,320
I thought

316
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,760
I've learned the way of life of humans.

317
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,280
It's not too late to go back and teach my clan.

318
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,520
But the most important thing now

319
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,320
is that I have to stop the war

320
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,720
and express my sincerity.

321
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
You're a good fighter.

322
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,840
You won't agree so easily.

323
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,240
Although I'm a fighter,

324
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,080
I believe that my clan

325
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,320
would rather live a stable life.

326
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,040
I can convince them.

327
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,760
You want to go back alone?

328
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,600
If you go back alone,

329
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,200
I'll do harm to you.

330
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:53,840
How about this?

331
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,640
To show your sincerity,

332
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,160
I'll go back with you.

333
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,640
Your clan will believe you.

334
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,440
Lu Yan.

335
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,760
You're so nice.

336
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,120
This hairpin

337
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,040
is made by ancient gods.

338
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,920
It can be printed with my power.

339
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,280
You can feel our peace

340
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,440
even if we're far away.

341
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
So magical.

342
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,480
You're going with me.

343
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,040
It's dangerous.

344
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,680
And it'll make your clan

345
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,200
misunderstand you and protect the forest clan.

346
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,840
I don't want you to be in a dilemma.

347
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,360
Don't worry.

348
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,440
I'm the sacred daughter of the forest clan.

349
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,160
I'll do it.

350
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,640
I'll protect the forest clan.

351
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,640
I'll protect the forest clan.

352
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,600
I'll protect the forest clan.

353
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,400
I'll do it.

354
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,840
Lu Yan.

355
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,380
Wait for me.

356
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,840
Important business for you tonight.

357
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:06,240
I am at your service.

358
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,640
Hold on to it.

359
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,360
Even if you're far away from each other,

360
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,680
you can sense our security.

361
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:20,820
General.

362
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,120
Send my order.

363
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,680
Get ready for the battle.

364
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,680
Don't move.

365
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,160
Keep a close watch.

366
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,560
Yes.

367
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,440
General Wei, what did General say?

368
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,360
Don't move.

369
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,320
Don't move?

370
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:37,960
Why?

371
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,360
We don't have time to wait.

372
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,000
General, are you still waiting for the news of the Holy Lady of the Spirit Tribe?

373
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,200
Don't talk about General.

374
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,760
Well,

375
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,480
at this time,

376
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,160
General still believes in the Holy Lady of the Spirit Tribe.

377
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,240
Since she left,

378
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,840
have you heard any news?

379
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,880
General shouldn't have let her go.

380
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,080
With the Holy Lady of the Spirit Tribe,

381
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,480
we can't let her go.

382
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,160
Shut up.

383
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,480
How can you doubt

384
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,880
General's decision?

385
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,600
You can't obey the military order.

386
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,520
You should be executed.

387
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,160
Guards.

388
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,520
General Wei.

389
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:02,920
General Wei.

390
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,480
There's no one here.

391
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,520
General.

392
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,680
We won't dare to go again.

393
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,480
General.

394
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,320
Stop.

395
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,400
General.

396
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,280
General.

397
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,280
General.

398
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,880
General, sorry for disturbing you.

399
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,040
Please punish us.

400
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,840
It's okay.

401
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,600
The enemy is at the front.

402
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,320
The generals should work together to deal with the enemy.

403
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,040
I'll remember your crimes

404
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,960
and I'll talk about it later.

405
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,160
You may leave.

406
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,040
Thank you for your kindness.

407
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:30,920
Let's go.

408
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,200
General.

409
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,160
Have some food.

410
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,600
No, thanks.

411
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,880
General.

412
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:54,640
I think

413
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,760
it's too risky

414
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,080
to go deep into the territory of the Spirit Tribe.

415
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,960
Is this news accurate?

416
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
Will the Holy Lady of the Spirit Tribe

417
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,680
really pass through here?

418
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,720
There's something wrong with the hairpin.

419
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,520
I knew something must have happened to Yunxi.

420
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
And now

421
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,880
the Spirit Tribe's army is temporarily delayed to attack the capital.

422
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,600
I always feel

423
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,120
they're waiting for something.

424
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:20,760
Here they are.

425
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,080
The Holy Lady of the Spirit Tribe

426
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,120
is not willing to hurt us.

427
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,440
The leader

428
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,800
asked us to use poison to deal with her.

429
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,120
The Holy Lady of the Spirit Tribe

430
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
betrayed the Spirit Tribe first

431
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,600
and helped those despicable humans to speak.

432
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,880
If the Holy Lady of the Spirit Tribe

433
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,760
hadn't stopped us,

434
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,000
we would have taken the place long ago.

435
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,360
But the Holy Lady of the Spirit Tribe

436
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,760
is holding the yuan pellet of our tribe.

437
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,240
If she abandones us,

438
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,880
what will happen to the Spirit Tribe?

439
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:40,720
The leader said

440
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,320
she has found a way to become stronger.

441
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,560
Maybe in the future,

442
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,800
she won't need the Holy Lady anymore.

443
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:45,840
Shoot.

444
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:46,760
Shoot.

445
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:47,840
Shoot.

446
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,000
Shoot.

447
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,600
Shoot.

448
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,200
Shoot.

449
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,800
Shoot.

450
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,600
Shoot.

451
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,560
Shoot.

452
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,280
General.

453
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
I'm asking you!

454
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Mingxi!

455
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,800
Mingxi!

456
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
Lu Yan.

457
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:12,800
Why are you here?

458
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,800
The hairpin is flickering.

459
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
I know something must have happened to you.

460
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
So I sent people to look for it.

461
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,800
As long as you're in danger,

462
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,800
no matter how far we are from each other,

463
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,800
I will always be by your side.

464
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Hurry! This way!

465
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
General, let's go.

466
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,800
They're coming after us.

467
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Let's go!

468
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,800
Yes.

469
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
Come on.

470
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
Kill them!

471
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
Let's go!

472
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,800
Let's go!

473
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,800
Let's go!

474
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
General!

475
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,800
General!

476
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,800
General!

477
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
More and more tribes are coming after us.

478
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
This is a territory of the tribe.

479
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
You can't defeat them.

480
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,800
Why don't you let me go back?

481
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,800
No.

482
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Zhu Rong is a traitor to you.

483
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:48,800
You'll only die if you go back.

484
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,800
But I can't get you into trouble.

485
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,800
What do you mean by that?

486
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,800
I told you.

487
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,800
As long as you're in danger,

488
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,800
I'll always be by your side.

489
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,800
I won't watch you die.

490
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
General, you go first.

491
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,800
I'll lead them away.

492
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,800
You don't have to.

493
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
We'll split up and meet at the floating trade center.

494
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,800
Yes.

495
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Let's go!

496
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Watch out!

497
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,800
Go!

498
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
Brothers, let's go!

499
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,800
Go!

500
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
You're hurt.

501
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,800
I'm fine.

502
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
General Yan,

503
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,800
our leader said

504
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,800
as long as you hand over our daughter,

505
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,800
we'll spare your life.

506
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
Zhu Rong is a traitor.

507
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,800
Yun Xi will no longer be his weapon.

508
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,800
If you don't want to see them die,

509
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,800
I advise you to give up your resistance.

510
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
General.

511
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,800
Wei Du.

512
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
General,

513
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,800
you're the only one we have now.

514
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
Order them.

515
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
We'd rather die than surrender!

516
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
We'd rather die than surrender!

517
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
Good.

518
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
We'd rather die than surrender!

519
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
Wait!

520
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
My fellow soldiers,

521
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
I don't want to hurt you.

522
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
I'll spare your life.

523
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,800
If you let them go,

524
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,800
I won't let you

525
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:54,800
suffer the consequences of Zhu Rong's treason.

526
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
The Saintess was poisoned.

527
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,800
Her blood can't touch the formation

528
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
and can't suppress us.

529
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,800
While she's not fully recovered,

530
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,800
catch her back.

531
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Can you protect the Saintess?

532
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,800
Can you protect your own people?

533
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,800
No!

534
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
Kill all the spiritual groups!

535
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
Wei Du!

536
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
No!

537
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
Why did you kill them?

538
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
Did you forget how you promised me?

539
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
General,

540
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,800
how many people died in their hands?

541
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Stop!

542
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
Stop!

543
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
Saintess,

544
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,800
you let them kill us?

545
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
Don't worry!

546
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
No!

547
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,800
No!

548
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:04,800
Jiao Yan!

549
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,800
The spiritual groups!

550
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,800
Kill them!

551
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,800
Kill them!

552
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,800
Kill them!

553
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,800
Luo Yan.

554
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
Luo Yan, hang in there.

555
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,800
I'll save you.

556
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,800
Luo Yan.

557
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
Luo Yan.

558
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,800
Luo Yan.

559
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,800
Hang in there.

560
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
Luo Yan.

561
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,800
Luo Yan.

562
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,800
Wake up.

563
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:30,800
Luo Yan.

564
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
Xiao Ni.

565
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,800
Luo Yan.

566
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Luo Yan.

567
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,800
Hang in there.

568
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,800
Luo Yan.

569
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,800
Wake up.

570
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,800
Luo Yan.

571
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
You killed the general.

572
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,800
You killed the general.

573
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
I'm going to kill you!

574
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
All the spiritual groups should die!

575
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
Luo Yan.

576
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,800
Wake up.

577
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
Luo Yan.

578
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Don't sleep.

579
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
Open your eyes and look at me.

580
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Luo Yan.

581
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
You can't leave me alone.

582
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Tell me,

583
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
you want me to kill him?

584
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
What do you want?

585
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
You want me to kill him?

586
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,240
We have to see the day when the people will be in the palace.

587
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:21,400
Lu Yan, don't sleep.

588
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,600
Wake up.

589
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,360
Lu Yan, wake up.

590
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,200
Don't sleep anymore, okay?

591
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,000
Wake up. Wake up.

592
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,720
Hurry up.

593
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,400
Hurry up and wake up.

594
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,160
Wake up.

595
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,720
Wake up, Lu Yan.

596
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,400
Lu Yan.

597
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,400
Lu Yan.

598
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,800
Lu Yan!

599
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,000
Yang Dan.

600
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,800
Since you don't like it,

601
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:18,640
then,

602
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,040
I will...

603
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,120
You taught me

604
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,480
what it's like to love in legit form.

605
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,400
The days we spent with you,

606
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,080
I always felt like I Young.

607
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,160
I already have no regrets.

608
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,800
I hope it's you.

609
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,800
You will take Yuan Dan

610
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,800
to see the Nine Beads.

611
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
You will take me to see the day

612
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,800
when people lived peacefully.

613
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,800
I'm sorry.

614
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:28,800
It's hard to say.

615
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:50,800
The most beautiful scenery in the sky

616
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,800
is all about you.

617
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,800
When two hearts are so close

618
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,800
when the whole world is occupied by you

619
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,800
I will call you to find you

620
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,800
until your memory

621
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,800
You are the only one

622
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,800
walking into the scenery

623
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,800
This is a rain of tears

624
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,800
the distance is too far to reach

625
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,800
I have made a decision

626
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,800
for you

627
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,800
A month later

628
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,800
When two hearts are so close

629
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,800
when the whole world is occupied by you

630
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,800
How lucky I am

631
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,800
To make this decision for you
