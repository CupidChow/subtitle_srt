00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,070
Darling, what’s going on?

175
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,140
I know

176
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,590
you treat them sincerely.

177
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,680
But...

178
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,990
As you never drank before, don’t take a long pull.

179
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,870
It runs from your mouth.

180
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,860
Look at you.

181
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,230
Let me wipe it off.

182
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,040
Thank you all for your coming.

183
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,970
Thank you very much.

184
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:03,990
You must drink.

185
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,340
You know

186
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,740
Lu Yan and I

187
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,850
have been through life and death.

188
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,270
From now on, we’re family.

189
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,030
He can stand for me in Qingquan Stronghold.

190
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,100
We’re in the wind, right?

191
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,510
We are in the same boat,

192
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:21,640
so we need to help each other.

193
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,290
Please do not be hard on my darling.

194
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,150
Come on, fill it up.

195
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,980
Come on.

196
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:27,750
Bottoms up.

197
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:28,150
Bottoms up.

198
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:28,850
Bottoms up.

199
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,620
Fill it up.

200
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,700
Come on. To all of you.

201
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,280
To all of you.

202
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,270
Okay. Okay.

203
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,980
Come on, I’ll drink first.

204
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,810
Cheers. Cheers.

205
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,760
Come on, fill it up.

206
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,250
To all chiefs.

207
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,530
Great.

208
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,060
Master, I’ll do it.

209
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,050
To all of you.

210
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:54,110
Enough.

211
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,350
It’s my turn.

212
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,300
Cool.

213
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,430
You really hold your liquor.

214
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,460
I’ve drunk too much.

215
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:00,970
Master, I’m as high as a kite.

216
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,120
Are you blind drunk?

217
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,710
I’ve drunk more than you,

218
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,950
but I’m as good as new.

219
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,540
Okay. Adjust yourself now.

220
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,510
Come back later.

221
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:09,160
Okay.

222
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,530
We can’t lose face.

223
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,930
Go and have some hangover soup.

224
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,400
Chief,

225
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,260
I’ll drink with you.

226
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,210
Sir. Cheers.

227
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,340
I’ll drink with you.

228
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:20,350
Fill it up.

229
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,230
Sir.

230
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,750
If Yu Dengdeng keeps on drinking like this,

231
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,300
she’ll be smashed for 3 days and nights.

232
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,960
Is there any damage

233
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,260
for her spirit?

234
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,660
Drink it.

235
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,690
Come on, come on. Bottoms up. Bottoms up.

236
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,340
All right, stop drinking.

237
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,500
What’s up?

238
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,950
As Miss Yu can’t drink,

239
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:37,730
then I’ll toast.

240
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,830
To the bridegroom.

241
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:39,690
Right.

242
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,809
To the bridegroom.

243
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,990
Sorry, Mr. Lu never drinks.

244
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,440
What? No respect for me?

245
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,810
He really doesn’t know how to drink.

246
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,080
I’m the Chief here.

247
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,160
Don’t bully him.

248
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,260
I’ll drink for him. Come on.

249
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:49,990
Great.

250
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,580
So frank you are.

251
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,700
Come on, come on.

252
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,010
Sir.

253
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,630
What a high tolerance for liquor.

254
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:58,490
So cool.

255
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,240
Come on, fill it up for the groom.

256
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:01,380
Come on.

257
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,300
See?

258
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,670
No liquor now.

259
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,430
Did I take it too hard?

260
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,090
How about

261
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,090
sending the couple to the bridal chamber?

262
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,540
Let’s play tricks on them, shall we?

263
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,340
Good idea.

264
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,660
Okay.

265
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,690
Wow.

266
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,670
Let’s do it.

267
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,470
Yes, let’s play tricks on them.

268
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,000
Anyone there?

269
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,600
Anyone there?

270
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,450
Big Black.

271
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:01,730
Big Black.

272
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,510
Big Black, come here.

273
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,390
Do me a favor.

274
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,060
Deliver this to my bros.

275
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:08,060
Guide them here.

276
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,530
If you make it, I’ll take you to the back of the mountain to catch pheasants.

277
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,460
Everyone.

278
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,440
It’s too late.

279
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,470
It’s time for them to rest.

280
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,600
You too should go back to bed.

281
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,470
Go away.

282
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,170
According to the rule,

283
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,710
the heroic husband is not allowed to enter the main house.

284
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:29,480
That’s why I had this room

285
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,340
carefully decorated.

286
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,480
Are you satisfied?

287
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,160
I don’t care about that.

288
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:36,210
Whatever.

289
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,260
You need to get some rest.

290
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,300
Yes, rest.

291
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,220
You’re right.

292
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,790
Each moment of joy on the wedding night

293
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,020
is more precious than gold.

294
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,850
You’ve already drunk too much.

295
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,080
What are you doing?

296
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:18,030
Just end today’s show.

297
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,890
[Double Happiness]

298
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,860
Let me hear it. Let me hear it.

299
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,880
[Double Happiness]

300
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,870
What are you doing?

301
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:27,770
Don’t go too far.

302
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,510
That’s enough.

303
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,660
If I don’t pretend to have sex with you,

304
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:43,710
those people outside will look down on me.

305
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,130
If they look down on me,

306
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,280
they will look down on Qingquan Stronghold.

307
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,630
Then,

308
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:51,850
they will bully, oppress and take over us.

309
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,580
Once they have such a mind,

310
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,700
they can do anything bad.

311
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:58,950
Get up.

312
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,310
It’s okay.

313
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,740
They’ve gone.

314
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,560
No need to shake it.

315
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,760
Have you ever had any wishes?

316
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,350
To marry you.

317
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:19,940
That doesn’t count.

318
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,850
Let me think.

319
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,830
It’s rare to see snow in Sichuan.

320
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,960
But one year,

321
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,760
it snowed heavily.

322
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,030
My mother and I were making a snowman,

323
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,860
waiting for my father to come home for the New Year.

324
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,640
That’s the only and the last memory

325
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,620
I have of my mother.

326
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,480
As you mentioned wish,

327
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,160
I hope I could go back to the past

328
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,460
to see what she looked like again.

329
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,710
There are so many regrets in this world.

330
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,360
Unless you could invert your fate.

331
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,270
Yes.

332
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,410
Invert my fate.

333
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,440
Lu Yan,

334
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:05,660
cheers.

335
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,740
Wan,

336
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,550
they’ve already finished the ceremony.

337
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,760
Do you think our boss

338
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,620
felt so angry

339
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,960
that he went back first?

340
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,470
I don’t think so.

341
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,750
Why is his gun left in the courtyard?

342
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,750
He must have been hidden somewhere by someone

343
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,340
from Qingquan Stronghold.

344
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,710
Where did they hide him?

345
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,760
Wan, look at that dog.

346
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,580
Hold it.

347

Do you think an ordinary person can do that?

It is reasonable to say that

the spirit-hunter is also a human

690
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,750
I’ve come to see you.

691
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,050
[Master's Court]

692
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,540
Lu Yan, I’m here to see you.

693
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,000
There are so many good things in the stronghold,

694
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,430
but he was unwilling to sell them for money

695
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,720
and asked me to marry a second husband to make money.

696
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:29,700
He is actually using them alone now.

697
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:36,270
Jade vase.

698
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,530
[Double Happiness]

699
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,340
Mahogany table and chairs

700
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,660
Gilded flowerpot.

701
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,270
What’s up, Chief?

702
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,200
I’m here…

703
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,320
Chief,

704
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,810
you don’t have to greet me in such a polite way

705
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,110
even if you want to say something to me.

706
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,290
Actually, it’s nothing.

707
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,870
I just came to see

708
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,000
if you accommodate to

709
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:04,990
your first day of marriage.

710
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,730
You’ve been sitting for so long.

711
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:08,140
Are your legs a little sore?

712
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,270
Let me give you a massage.

713
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,780
Golden pancakes from Hongding Restaurant.

714
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,090
Peach Blossom Soup from Yifu Garden.

715
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:20,360
I didn’t buy them even during the Spring Festival.

716
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:26,570
I’ll do it for you.

717
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,600
I don’t want this. I want some water.

718
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,320
Here you are.

719
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,760
Did you sleep well last night?

720
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,000
If you have any requests, just make them.

721
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,530
We’re a family now.

722
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,670
Since we are a family,

723
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,800
we should trust each other and be honest.

724
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,400
It is improper for you

725
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,630
to hide your identity from me.

726
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,130
I knew you aren’t an ordinary man

727
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,800
but a great martial artist

728
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:55,040
when I first saw you.

729
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,020
Okay, okay.

730
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,090
That’s enough. That’s enough.

731
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,990
What do you mean by “enough”?

732
00:29:58,030 --> 00:29:59,260
That’s definitely not enough.

733
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,180
Seriously,

734
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,190
I indeed

735
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,470
admire you deeply.

736
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,540
When it comes to catching the monster of the spirit clan,

737
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,130
my father said that

738
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,300
if you don’t practice for a day, your skills will be a bit rusty;

739
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:11,500
if you don’t practice for three days, you’ll become an amateur.

740
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:12,730
How about

741
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,170
taking the opportunity

742
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,360
to do practice?

743
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,410
Isn’t your father a spirit-hunter?

744
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,380
You can ask him to come back and help you.

745
00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:22,310
My father

746
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,960
is always bragging.

747
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,190
However,

748
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,980
you are a real martial artist.

749
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,240
Furthermore,

750
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,770
you have such great skills,

751
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,810
how can you stay in the house?

752
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,740
You should come out

753
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,680
to benefit more people.

754
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,780
If I help you catch the monster,

755
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,210
who will serve tea to your elders,

756
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,780
unite your brothers,

757
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,160
and wait on Big Red?

758
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,660
Against all expectations,

759
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,750
you are so narrow-minded

760
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:49,530
and unforgiving.

761
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,900
You are waiting for me here.

762
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,910
I'll do it. Of course, I'll do these things.

763
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,220
I’ll do everything.

764
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,370
Do you think it is okay?

765
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:57,940
It isn’t proper, is it?

766
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,030
Yes, it is.

767
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:00,310
Today is far removed from the past.

768
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,060
The most important thing in Qingquan Stronghold

769
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:03,590
is the fact that everyone is equal.

770
00:31:03,670 --> 00:31:04,550
As long as you help me

771
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,720
deal with the monsters,

772
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:06,910
you can enjoy

773
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:08,210
your lavish meal

774
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,970
in Qingquan Stronghold forever.

775
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,190
Do you think it is okay?

776
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,330
This is very good.

[Double Happiness]

778
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,460
Very good.

779
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,580
Well,

780
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:16,940
Mr. Lu,

781
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,350
when

782
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,710
are you going to set off?

783
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,160
What do you mean by “set off”?

784
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,390
What I just said is that

785
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:27,810
your suggestion is very good.

786
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,120
I do not promise

787
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:30,460
to help you catch the monsters.

788
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:32,420
I advise you

789
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,650
not to interfere in this matter.

790
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,220
[Double Happiness]

791
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
Nothing happens

792
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,070
in Qingquan Stronghold now, right?

793
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,680
You just send those monsters

794
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,230
back to their respective strongholds.

795
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:41,900
They have no leader now

796
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,720
and won’t pose any threat to you guys.

797
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,860
Isn’t it good?

798
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:48,740
You’re deliberately fooling me.

799
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,280
I’m not fooling you.

800
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,660
I'm just thinking for you.

801
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,390
Why do you care about the disputes outside?

802
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,020
If you were involved in them, you might hurt yourself.

803
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,140
Harming others to benefit yourself

804
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,370
is not your style.

805
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,910
Lu Yan,

806
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,110
this is a serious incident

807
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,170
that involves a lot of people.

808
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,630
They are not from Qingquan Stronghold,

809
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,590
but

810
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,200
they are all human beings.

811
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,760
If you drive them off the mountain now,

812
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:07,730
who can guarantee that

813
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,260
the strange thing will not happen again?

814
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,140
What if those innocent people

815
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,090
got hurt?

816
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,710
Are you really so insensitive?

817
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,440
So?

818
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,300
I thought that your manner is cold,

819
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,320
but your heart is warm.

820
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,410
I didn’t expect you to be like this.

821
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,040
Forget it.

822
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:30,320
I don’t see eye to eye with you.

823
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:31,480
I just made a vain attempt.

824
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:33,950
Wait a minute.

825
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,740
What are you doing?

826
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,980
I’ve changed my mind.

827
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:44,380
I can accompany you down the mountain

828
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,850
to find the monsters of the spirit clan.

829
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:47,970
Really?

830
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:49,520
Yes.

831
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:50,850
Come on.

832
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,810
Take off your clothes.

833
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:52,920
What?

834
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:56,720
I underestimated him.

835
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,340
Master,

836
00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:02,650
you’ve sacrificed too much for us.

837
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:08,060
Don’t you like to wait on my family?

838
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,090
Why have you suddenly changed your mind?

839
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:12,900
Let’s go down the mountain

840
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,240
to catch those monsters first.

841
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:15,740
We could consummate then.

842
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,430
No, take off your clothes now.

843
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,080
Yu Dengdeng.

844
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:19,960
Hold back your anger.

845
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:21,310
I will sacrifice everything

846
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,770
for the stronghold.

847
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,190
It's just taking off my clothes.

848
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:26,990
OK.

849
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,060
I’ll do it.

850
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,990
Hey, turn away.

851
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,840
Fine.

852
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:39,850
You can watch me.

853
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:40,630
Watch as you please.

854
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:41,710
You will be a fool

855
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,290
if you don't look at me when I'm naked.

856
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,100
It’s so difficult to strip off them.

857
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,460
What’s this dress made of?

858
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,670
Why can't I untie it?

859
00:33:59,170 --> 00:33:59,930
Let me help you.

860
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:01,660
