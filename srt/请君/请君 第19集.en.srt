29
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:43,720
You know

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,710
your daughter's temperament.

31
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,380
Do you think I would be able to stop her?

32
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,710
And the other thing I dare not to mention is

33
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,650
that the Hybrid almost

34
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,250
killed your daughter.

It was not true.

What's the matter with you?

44
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,860
I asked Lu Yan to investigate the missing persons case.

45

Why did you get involved?

It is the spirit worm's doing.

You know about the spirit worms?

49

Of course I do.

And they're coming after me.

52
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,410
Chief Bai has identified Peng Dahai

as the murderer of the missing members of the Spirit Clan.

54

Now he is detained at the police station.

55

No. Lu Yan.

Sit down.

75

Let me tell you.

76
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,200
Three month ago,

77
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,350
the spirit clan came to me for help.

78
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,530
They told me some members went missing.

79
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,190
I didn't pay attention at first,

80
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,390
but later I found that

81
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,630
more members of the clan went missing

82
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,440
at the Mysterious Market

83
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,840
and in Ying Du.

84
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,250
How many of them?

85
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,079
It would be more than a hundred.

86
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:17,480
One day I found a spirit being

87
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,440
who was devoured

88
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,030
by the spirit worms.

89
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,720
His body

90
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,030
was very week then,

91
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,329
and was almost transparent.

92
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,810
I used all I've learned to keep his energy from expiring,

93
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,030
but failed.

94
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,230
There is something in your body

95
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,980
that is devouring your energy.

96
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,840
I am not capable of helping you.

102
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
I discovered that

103
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,160
those missing members of the spirit clan,

104
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,450
were not kidnapped,

105
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:17,110
but devoured by the spirit worms.

106
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,890
So you went to the tavern

107
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,350
to investigate.

108
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,200
After I went there,

109
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,540
I discovered that the owner of

110
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,270
Changle Tavern was the one who sold those spirit worms.

111
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,610
But he alone could never

112
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,320
be capable of breeding the worms.

113
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,520
So after I learned how to buy them,

114
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,670
I tracked them down

115
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:37,440
by following the clues.

00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:32,670
We find that he is involved

690
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,270
in dealing the spirit worms.

691
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,770
He is also connected with

692
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,690
the missing persons case in the city.

693
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:39,030
Very interesting.

694
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,050
Not a rabbit. Not a donkey either.

695
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,730
Nice teeth.

696
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:47,290
- Don't move. - Great.

697
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,090
I admire you.

698
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,410
You made a great contribution this time.

699
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,830
Well, yes. Chief Bai.

700
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,910
It's your daughter's birthday today.

701
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,220
And you've solved the case.

702
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,410
This is

703
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:59,640
icing on the cake.

704
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,480
The cherry on top.

705
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,560
And my apprentice, Peng Dahai,

706
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,710
could you please...

707
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,480
Release him?

708
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,910
No need to hurry.

709
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,620
You see.

710
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,200
I need evidence.

711
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:12,680
Right?

712
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,770
Where is his confession?

713
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:14,960
We've caught him.

714
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,710
We won't worry about the confession.

715
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,760
Well,

716
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:20,250
he is caught by you.

717
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,100
What if you just grabbed a random guy on the street?

718
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,500
It's not that I don't believe you.

719
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,350
But I don't have any evidence.

720
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,000
And the county magistrate is in there.

721
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,690
When I report to him later,

722
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,760
I won't be able to answer him,

723
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,010
if he asks me questions.

724
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,150
It's gonna be a joke.

725
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:34,610
Of course we will have the evidence.

726
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,940
Since this long-ear spirit creature is a criminal,

727
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,120
we must interrogate him

728
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,450
to make him talk.

729
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,540
We brought him here,

730
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,800
hoping you can provide us with a place

731
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,830
to conduct the interrogation.

732
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,000
So we can

733
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,530
get to the bottom of this case.

734
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,370
Exactly.

735
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,190
Chief Bai, you've been worried

736
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:52,940
about the case for days.

737
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,960
Now we managed to find a witness.

738
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,820
We must investigate thoroughly.

739
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,100
We caught him,

740
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,770
so our interrogation is appropriate.

741
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,830
You can rest assured

742
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,590
that we will try to send you the witness and the evidence to you

743
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:05,670
before the birthday party is over.

744
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,750
You will look great

745
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,570
in front of the county magistrate

746
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,540
and your guests.

747
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,950
I got it.

748
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,970
It's just a place to interrogate the criminal.

749
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,710
Bai Mansion is huge.

750
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,650
Pick any place you like. Do your work.

751
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,080
Also, I will get your apprentice,

752
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,860
Peng Dahai, out of the jail right now.

753
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,490
We will serve him great food and wine.

754
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,490
Don't worry.

755
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,790
As long as you give me the evidence,

756
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:27,050
I get the county magistrate's approval,

757
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,700
and the criminal is put into the prison van,

758
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:32,630
I will send back your apprentice untouched.

759
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,160
Chief Bai,

760
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,140
are you for real

761
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,840
this time?

762
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,580
Chief.

763
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,400
You are funny.

764
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,770
Did I ever break my promise?

765
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,440
-Chief -In our line of work, we...

766
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,570
Chief, almost all the guests are here.

767
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,700
The county magistrate is seated.

768
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,470
We are waiting for you to host the party.

769
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,560
Heroine, I will go now.

770
00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:51,560
You listen to her, okay?

771
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,670
Give her anything she asks for, okay?

772
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:54,480
Okay, Chief.

773
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,620
See you later.

774
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,530
A couple of days ago,

775
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,990
I couldn't use my awesome tools.

776
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,910
It was such a waste.

777
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,490
I didn't expect

778
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,330
to catch you, a big fish.

779
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,100
It's your bad luck.

780
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,310
Now talk.

781
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:28,760
Who ordered you

782
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,860
to sell the spirit worms?

783
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:34,090
What... What fish and worms?

784
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,450
I don't understand.

785
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,910
You catch a good person in public,

786
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,740
do you even respect the law?

787
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:42,570
Acting tough?

788
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,030
Fine.

789
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:46,460
I want to see

790
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,860
which is tougher?

791
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,300
My chilly-water soaked whip? Or you?

792
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,020
Are you gonna talk or not?

793
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,030
Talk.

794
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,890
Are you gonna talk or not?

795
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,160
I am just a hard-working man

796
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,400
who manages a drug store.

797
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,360
What spirit worms?

798
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,909
I... I've never heard of it, really.

799
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,270
Still don't wanna talk?

800
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:11,409
Fine.

801
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,719
You made me do this.

802
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:15,460
Gu Beixi.

803
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,739
Coming!

804
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,139
Those long ears...

805
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,120
No wonder you asked me

806
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,719
to get this from Chief Bai.

807
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,969
It's gonna be a great show.

808
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:30,170
What are you doing?

809
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,219
You... Don't do anything crazy.

810
00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:34,380
Don't you have good ears?

811
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,150
For your good ears...

812
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,290
Talk.

813
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:45,739
Still don't wanna talk?

814
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,679
Gu Beixi.

815
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,070
Coming.

816
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,210
Here.

817
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:56,380
Are you gonna talk? Are you gonna talk?

818
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:59,030
Are you gonna talk? Are you gonna talk?

819
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:03,750
Are you gonna talk? Are you gonna talk?

820
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,890
Talk! Now!

821
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:06,770
Talk!

822
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:08,380
Talk!

823
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,200
I will talk.

824
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,290
- Talk. - I'll talk.

825
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:11,960
Stop.

826
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:14,950
Talk.

827
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:17,740
I...

828
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,700
I've heard that someone is selling spirit worms

829
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,250
in the Mysterious Market.

830
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,670
But... This has nothing to do with me.

831
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,380
My business is legal.

832
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:26,420
You...

833
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:28,940
Did you catch the wrong guy?

834
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,640
Sir,

835
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,090
that drug store was completed ruined by the fire,

836
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,820
and we don't have any evidence.

837
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,850
Did we really catch the wrong guy?

838
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,240
Not the wrong guy, for sure.

839
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:40,580
Also,

840
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,710
it's not true that we don't have any evidence.

841

like angelica sinensis, paeonia lactiflora, ligusticum wallichii and such

are put on the higher shelves.

00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:22,130
such as tetrapanax papyriferus, folium mori and such.

862
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,100
[Ginger]

863
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,480
This arrangement is efficient

864
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,270
for fetching and weighing the drugs.

865
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,410
Besides the chest of drawers,

866
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,930
it's hard to find other spaces

867
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:31,260
to store large amount of the spirit worms.

868
00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:32,660
When I was in the drug store,

869
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,220
I found that the lighter crude drugs

870
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,120
were put on the lowest shelves, so I conclude that

871
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,190
someone had switched the drawers.

872
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,380
Something that can't be seen by others

873
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,790
must be put on the highest shelves,

874
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,810
which made it hard to find the worms.

875
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,530
No wonder I like you.

876
00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:54,180
That's so impressive.

877
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,290
The evidence is here.

878
00:36:58,510 --> 00:37:00,040
Do you still want to deny it?

879
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,950
I just sell the sprite worms

880
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,440
with the help of several kids.

881
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,290
People can buy them,

882
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,560
why can't I sell them?

883
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,650
Who made you do this?

884
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,830
I...

885
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,210
I just want to be rich.

886
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,580
I don't need to take orders from anyone.

887
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,950
The fire in the drug store

888
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,230
has proved that my speculation is right.

889
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:29,450
The selling of the spirit worms is not operated by you only.

890
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,760
Even if you don't talk,

891
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,440
the person behind you

892
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,070
won't protect you necessarily.

893
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,000
Why making your life so miserable?

894
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,910
Besides,

895
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,360
it must feel terrible

896
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,730
having a spirit worm inside your body.

897
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,610
If you tell us the truth,

898
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,460
I can save your life.

899
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,660
You...

900
00:37:57,690 --> 00:37:59,020
You can't save me.

901
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,130
Worm...the King of worms.

902
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:10,470
It's... It's the Kind of worms.

903
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:13,120
King of worms. What Kind of worms?

904
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:14,800
Keep talking.

905
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,210
He is our superior.

906
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,500
I only know that

907
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,370
he can control all the worms

908
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,860
as long as the distance is short enough.

909
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,780
He ask the host to go east,

910
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,990
and the host dare not go west.

911
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,780
He is like the owner of the worms,

912
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,820
so we call him the King of worms.

913
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,850
A worm is put inside of me.

914
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,470
I don't have my freewill.

915
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,750
Where can we find him?

916
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:41,730
I...

917
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:43,470
I have no idea.

918
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,030
Several days ago, a subordinate died.

919
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,130
I heard that

920
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,110
he broke the no-business-with-humans rule

921
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,210
and got killed by the King of worms.

922
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,160
Sellers like us

923
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,170
only do

924
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,910
the leg works.

925
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,410
We want to avoid

926
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,270
that kind of scary person.

927
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,990
We just do our job and make the money.

928
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,080
Where do the spirit worms come from?

929
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,670
Do they appear out of thin air?

930
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,000
You do business with the King of worms,

931
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,730
how come you have never met him?

932
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,010
Whether you've met him or not,

933
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,380
think carefully.

934
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,030
Lo... Lord.

935
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,030
Lord, please.

936
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,520
I did see him before.

937
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:25,960
But I don't the answers to your questions.

938
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:28,770
Sometimes he only shows up for the delivery.

939
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:30,190
He only wears a trench coat

940
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,110
when he comes.

941
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,110
I can't... I can't see his face.

942
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,840
Only... I only know

943
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:39,260
there are some strange noises when he walks.

944
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:41,030
It's very strange.

945
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,580
Anything else...

946
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,370
I really don't know anything else.

947
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,620
I think he has told us almost everything.

948
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:00,880
How about we send him to Chief Bai,

949
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,380
and let the police deal with him?

950
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,150
Sir,

951
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,530
how do you know the spirit worm

952
00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:08,860
is inside that long-ear spirit creature?

953
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,980
When I caught him,

954
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,480
I saw his neck twitching.

955
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,910
The symptom

956
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,570
is the same as the animals'

957
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,300
when they are sick.

958
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,890
The worm not only takes away one's strength,

959
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,220
but it also takes control of his behavior.

960
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:24,360
Let's meet him again

961
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:25,430
after we save Dahai.

962
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,290
We can't let him hurt more people.

963
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,150
Okay.

964
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:30,560
I don't think this thing is that... Dad.

965
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,380
Uncle.

966
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,200
Dengdeng,

967
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,630
let me take a look.

968
00:40:34,810 --> 00:40:35,940
You've lost weight.

969
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:37,710
You are so dramatic.

970
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,300
I've got weight, in one day.

971
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,230
That's right. You've lost weight.

972
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,020
I have good news.

973
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,030
What good news?

974
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,250
We caught a long-ear spirit creature.

975
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,300
We will send him to Chief Bai later.

976
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,460
And we can take Daihai to have a good meal,

977
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:51,060
after he is relased.

978
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,110
Get rid of the bad luck.

979
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,370
And then we'll go back to Qingquan Stronghold.

980
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:55,180
My father hasn't been back

981
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,400
to the stronghold for a long time.

982
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,800
It's time for you to go back and rest.

983
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,200
And we can finally have our family reunion.

984
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,190
Whatever you like.

985
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:01,910
Dengdeng,

986
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,410
you go back to Qingquan Stronghold first.

987
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,010
I will stay here for another few days.

988
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,960
I will go find you in the stronghold

989
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,580
after I finish the investigation.

990
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,590
Find her?

991
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,120
Qingquan Stronghold

992
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,670
is not a place you can visit whenever you like.

993
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,720
What are you doing? He can go back...

994
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,650
Shut your mouth.

995
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,340
What did we just talked about?

996
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,350
From now on, you can forget

997
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,920
what had happened between you and Dengdeng.

998
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,960
You can pretend nothing has happened.

999
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,920
If you ever make her upset,

1000
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:25,480
or lay a finger on her again,

1001
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,830
I will kick your ass.

1002
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,390
Dad.

1003
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:29,530
I have told you already.

1004
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:30,400
It was a misunderstanding.

1005
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,770
- Why are you... - What misunderstanding?

1006
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:33,180
He was trying to kill you.

1007
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,000
How dangerous it would be

1008
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,200
to live with someone like this, for the rest of your life?

1009
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,440
Everyone is here today.

1010
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,080
Here.

1011
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:40,210
You write the divorce letter now.

1012

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,400
♫How lucky I am♫

1030
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,470
♫The decision I made for you♫

1031
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:20,360
♫When two hearts are so close to each other♫

1032
00:43:20,910 --> 00:43:23,910
♫When the whole world is occupied by you♫

1033
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:28,930
♫I'll call out your name so hard♫

1034
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:33,730
♫Until you respond♫

1035
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:40,230
♫You're the only♫

1036
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:46,060
♫Scenery I've walked into♫

1037
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:50,460
♫In this encountering, feel the four seasons♫

1038
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:53,550
♫Fate is carved into love♫

1039
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:58,850
♫How lucky I am♫

1040
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,990
♫The decision I made for you♫
