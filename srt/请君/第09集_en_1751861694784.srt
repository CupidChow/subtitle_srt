1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll never let go after the storm

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You are me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You are me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You are me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You are me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You are me

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Episode 16

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Sir, have you found out that Yu Deng Deng is the master's method?

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I have to find the second half.

10
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Now there are spirits who are secretly trying to scare Yu Deng Deng.

11
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I can't rest assured.

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Since the safety of Yu Deng Deng is the first,

13
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
why don't you return the previous hairpin to him?

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Look at it.

15
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The second half of the Jinquan family has sold out.

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Sold out.

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The silk handkerchief, the silk jacket,

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
the jade wallet, the ink paper,

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and the money.

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
All of them are sold out.

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Slow down.

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
One by one.

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
One by one.

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't grab it.

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The silk handkerchief.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The silk jacket.

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The jade wallet.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The silk jacket.

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The silk jacket.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The silk jacket.

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
One yuan.

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
One yuan.

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Come on.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You can't buy a jade wallet for one yuan.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You can't buy a silk jacket.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Look at it.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Boss,

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
our stuff is really not bad.

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The eyes meet for three days.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Master, are you praising me or scolding me?

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I can think of this trick.

42
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
That's the idea of the owner of the house.

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm responsible for the small show and small action.

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
When did you get along with him?

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Well,

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
he can't be with us in this matter.

48
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll treat him as my brother.

49
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Besides, he cares about you a lot.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He's happy to drink tea with you every day.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He's afraid you'll get depressed.

52
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Now, he's scolding that person.

53
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It's so heart-wrenching.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Heart-wrenching.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
No, no, no.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's so heart-wrenching.

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,820
You're talking like a

58
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,000
husband and wife.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm not.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm Song Jiang.

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Who's Wu Da? Who's Pan Jinlian?

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm not.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Who's Xi Men Qing?

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No, it hurts.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm not.

66
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Look at this.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
This is good.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
One yuan.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You can't buy a jade wallet.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You can't buy a silk jacket.

71
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
One yuan.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
One yuan for the dragon.

73
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Come and buy it.

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Come and have a look.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Good.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Good.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Good.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Good.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Good.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Good.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Good.

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Good.

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Come on.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
One by one.

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
One by one.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
One by one.

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Don't grab it.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't grab it.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Sir.

90
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Sir.

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
On the day of the New Year,

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
the white snake will be the first to come out.

93
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Everyone.

94
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Everyone.

95
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Listen to me.

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Listen to me.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
There's a chance for one by one.

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Everyone has no chance to grab it.

99
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay?

100
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Come on.

101
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll do it first.

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll do it first.

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Sir.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
This is the new medicine made by our pharmacy.

105
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:42,120
It's good for blood circulation and

106
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,120
Sir.

107
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
The foundation of a man's strength is to be strong and strong.

108
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
Qingquan Village has so many heroes and good men.

109
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,120
You must try our Hu Gu wine.

110
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,120
Come on.

111
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,120
Smell it.

112
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
Sir.

113
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
Go and get some.

114
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
Okay.

115
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
I'll send you the medicine right away.

116
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,120
I'm doing this all for you.

117
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
Whether you can make it or not,

118
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,120
it's up to you.

119
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,120
Good.

120
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
Good.

121
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
Good.

122
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
You can count this as ten.

123
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,120
Okay.

124
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
one, two, three, four!

125
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,120
Focus.

126
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,120
Okay.

127
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,120
Keep going.

128
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,120
Share your food with others.

129
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
Okay?

130
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,120
Despite being less popular

131
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
and are more popular,

132
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,120
leave a message to others.

133
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
Also,

134
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,120
hope to give strong feedback to doctors and make them Panda II.

135
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,120
Okay?

136
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,120
Uhm.

137
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,120
Yes.

138
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
A little punishment on your organism.

139
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Get wider.

140
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,120
I believe.

141
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
See you next time.

142
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,120
Anything else.

143
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
Bye.

144
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
Bye.

145
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
Bye.

146
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,120
Okay.

147
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Alright.

148
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
There.

149
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,800
Master,

150
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,960
the man said

151
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,160
he went to the west to fetch Guo Guo.

152
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,040
He should be here soon.

153
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,560
Why do you want to fetch Guo Guo?

154
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,240
Didn't you say so yesterday?

155
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,400
I'm the boss,

156
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,320
the big brother.

157
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,160
Boss Wu,

158
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,200
why did you invite

159
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,600
your big boss here?

160
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,320
I don't deserve it.

161
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,680
Boss Yu,

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,880
I'm here to give you a gift.

163
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,120
Boss Wu,

164
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,920
you're being too polite.

165
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,360
We don't know how to appreciate art.

166
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,000
We don't have money to appreciate it.

167
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,280
Boss Yu,

168
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,880
let's not talk about art today.

169
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,120
Let's talk about life.

170
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,000
I heard that your second wife

171
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,280
ran away some time ago.

172
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,920
Now there's a new maid

173
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,080
in the village.

174
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:22,960
Well,

175
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,560
there's a young man

176
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,520
who's just been established in our theater.

177
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,760
He can be the candidate for military service.

178
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,880
His name is Lu.

179
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,000
He's a man.

180
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,440
Boss Yu.

181
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,600
His name is Lu, too.

182
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,600
How can he be?

183
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,640
From now on,

184
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,920
his name is Yu.

185
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,640
If you want to touch him,

186
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,840
he can be anything.

187
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:46,880
Go, go, go.

188
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,040
He can be anything.

189
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,280
Our boss

190
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,920
is not interested in that guy.

191
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:51,920
Let's go.

192
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,240
No.

193
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:52,720
Let's go.

194
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,240
Let's go.

195
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,840
Slow down.

196
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,440
Who said I'm not interested?

197
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,080
Sit down.

198
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,040
Let's talk.

199
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,920
Do you know how to skate?

200
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,380
I'm in charge of skateboarding,

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,800
so I have things to do.

202
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,840
So first,

203
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,600
I'll start.

204
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,880
Boss, listen up.

205
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,600
Six-hundred-thousand-dry-sugar-candy.

206
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,440
They're here to play.

207
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,040
We're here to play.

208
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:40,840
Boss, you said it.

209
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,640
Let's go. Let's go.

210
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,720
It's busy downstairs.

211
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,520
Let's go, brother.

212
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
Let's go to the tea house downstairs.

213
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,440
Let's go.

214
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,200
Master, what's wrong?

215
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,240
I'm worried. It's okay.

216
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,840
Again.

217
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,440
Don't worry.

218
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
Boss, you're drunk.

219
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,600
I'll buy you a bottle.

220
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,440
Boss, listen up.

221
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,840
Eight-thousand-dry-sugar-candy.

222
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,880
Two ten-thousand-dry-sugar-candys.

223
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Boss lost again.

224
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,240
Two ten-thousand-dry-sugar-candys.

225
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,240
Boss lost again.

226
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,520
I don't believe it.

227
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,520
Again.

228
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,960
Six-hundred-thousand-dry-sugar-candys.

229
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,120
Six-hundred-thousand-dry-sugar-candys.

230
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Boss has admitted it.

231
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,640
Why did I lose again?

232
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,440
Brother, why are you so nervous?

233
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,120
We're all family from now on.

234
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:17,920
Look.

235
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,200
Six-hundred-thousand-dry-sugar-candys.

236
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,920
Boss Yu and I

237
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,000
had a great time.

238
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,440
Who's your family?

239
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,240
Go, go, go.

240
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,640
This...

241
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,240
Go.

242
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,280
Brothers.

243
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,000
Come on.

244
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,280
It's not easy to come to town.

245
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
Let's go downstairs

246
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,440
to eat some snacks.

247
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:31,920
Come on, come on.

248
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,480
Let's go.

249
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,120
Let's go.

250
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:34,480
I'm hungry.

251
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:34,960
Hurry.

252
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,240
Go.

253
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,760
Brother,

254
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,080
just go with me.

255
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,800
Go, go, go.

256
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,120
I'll wait for us to finish eating.

257
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,280
They've finished chatting, haven't they?

258
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,280
Again.

259
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,840
I don't believe it.

260
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,880
Come on.

261
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,760
Five-hundred-thousand-dry-sugar-candys.

262
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,200
Six-hundred-thousand-dry-sugar-candys.

263
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,600
Boss Yu has lost again.

264
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,160
Not bad.

265
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,200
Buy some for Boss.

266
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:19,800
Come on.

267
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,600
I'll buy some for Boss.

268
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,680
I don't believe it.

269
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,560
You're so generous.

270
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,400
I don't believe it.

271
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,320
I don't believe it.

272
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,000
Why?

273
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,600
Why?

274
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,120
Why?

275
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:27,680
Why?

276
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,560
Why?

277
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,200
Come on.

278
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,000
Again.

279
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,480
Come on.

280
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,920
Five hands.

281
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,280
Six, six, six.

282
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,680
Ten full feet.

283
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,920
You lost.

284
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,600
Pour the wine.

285
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,120
You're a good drinker.

286
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,040
It's so refreshing.

287
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,280
Life is refreshing.

288
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,680
If others are in pain,

289
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,120
I'm in pain.

290
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,400
If I'm in pain,

291
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,080
others will be happy.

292
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,080
So I

293
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:06,280
want to be happy.

294
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,520
That's right.

295
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,040
For those little people,

296
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,840
it's sad to be a man.

297
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,800
Life is like a play.

298
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,080
I'd rather see the happiness in front of me.

299
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,360
Gosh.

300
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,120
It's so refreshing.

301
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,640
I'd like to live in it.

302
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:36,160
I...

303
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,180
I'm

304
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,280
watching a...

305
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,520
Islamist.

306
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,400
That I know.

307
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,760
With high feet.

308
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,280
Coming up.

309
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,240
Great.

310
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:48,880
Great.

311
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,200
Great.

312
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,200
Great.

313
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,440
And hands ideas.

314
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,240
Great.

315
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,560
With…

316
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,960
I have a story too.

317
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,000
I can share it with you as a material.

318
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,400
It's about a big rabbit that used to be very strong and powerful.

319
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,440
Everyone was using it.

320
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,800
It also thought it was very powerful.

321
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,240
One day, it went out to eat grass.

322
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,120
It met another one that looked very good.

323
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,640
It was a mysterious white rabbit.

324
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,040
It fell in love with it at once.

325
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,480
It took it back.

326
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,640
It thought that from now on,

327
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,960
they could eat together,

328
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,920
play together,

329
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,760
and sleep together.

330
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,040
It thought that as long as it had that big rabbit,

331
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,880
it would be happier than having a box of gold.

332
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,920
What do you think of this story?

333
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,960
There's no drama or conflict.

334
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,400
Don't worry.

335
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,640
There's a conflict.

336
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,520
One day,

337
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:56,200
when the big rabbit was still dreaming,

338
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,680
it came to its side,

339
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,480
pulled its skin,

340
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,280
tore its flesh,

341
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,320
and took out its heart.

342
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,480
At that time, the big rabbit found out

343
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,360
that it was deceived.

344
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,000
So it ran to ask for help.

345
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,480
So it ran to ask for help.

346
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,680
Aren't we friends?

347
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,480
Why did you kill me?

348
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,720
Why did you do that?

349
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,320
What happened next?

350
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,240
What happened?

351
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,040
After the rabbit

352
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,840
took off its skin,

353
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,640
it took out its flesh.

354
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,720
That's a wolf.

355
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,080
How was it?

356
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,560
Were you scared?

357
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,560
Was it a conflict?

358
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,440
Yes.

359
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,240
Come on.

360
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,680
Good story.

361
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,240
Come on.

362
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,040
Pour it.

363
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,680
Like a never-ending mystery.

364
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,680
But I'm still searching.

365
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Although the story is good,

366
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,520
the wolf

367
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,880
hurt people.

368
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,640
He lied to people.

369
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,400
It's not good.

370
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,560
The wolf eats meat.

371
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,840
The rabbit eats grass.

372
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,400
It's a perfect match.

373
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,920
But the big rabbit

374
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,200
hates the wolf the most.

375
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,120
It hates itself more.

376
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,520
It's so shameless.

377
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,920
It's such a big wolf's tail.

378
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,280
It didn't even notice.

379
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,600
It was stolen by itself.

380
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,040
It's so humiliating.

381
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,680
I know.

382
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,920
I know.

383
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,200
You don't know.

384
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,520
It's okay.

385
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,160
I can do it.

386
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,040
Don't touch me.

387
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,560
I can drink it.

388
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:10,600
I...

389
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,600
I'll take a break.

390
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,600
I can drink it.

391
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,360
Go on.

392
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,680
Boss.

393
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,040
Boss.

394
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:27,680
Boss.

395
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,920
nell govern the hygiene and hygiene's of guests.

396
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,480
Have you been drunk?

397
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,400
No.

398
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,000
No.

399
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
What did you do?

400
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,080
Nothing.

401
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,120
No?

402
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,160
Then tell me,

403
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,720
you want me to strangle you?

404
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,480
Wait.

405
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,800
Wait.

406
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,480
Wait.

407
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,600
Wake up.

408
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,760
Wait.

409
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,000
What's that noise?

410
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,320
It's so noisy.

411
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,160
One more step.

412
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,960
Wait.

413
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,680
Give it to me.

414
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,520
Look at you.

415
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,520
Look at you now.

416
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,800
Is it worth it for a man?

417
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,720
It's daytime.

418
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,800
If I'm late,

419
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,560
you'll be taken advantage of.

420
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,760
You're not a worry at all.

421
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,200
It's so noisy.

422
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,680
Twenty steps.

423
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,440
Five monks.

424
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,320
Five

425
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,200
Move. Move.

426
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,640
Move. Move.

427
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,080
Get up. Get up.

428
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,000
Get up. Get up.

429
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,720
I'll take it.

430
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,680
Don't follow me.

431
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,120
My god.

432
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,240
What are you looking at?

433
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,720
What are you looking at?

434
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,560
People in Nanzhong Village

435
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,560
are much better than us.

436
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,160
Besides, Chief Gu isn't a big hooligan.

437
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,240
Let's just follow them.

438
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:24,680
Okay.

439
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,200
Let's go.

440
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,520
Go.

441
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,880
Go.

442
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,080
How inexperienced the gentlemen are.

443
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,600
How can Miss Jiang be so awesome now?

444
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,240
Let's see the two- Croatia set.

445
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,660
YuanIf you want to save me,

446
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:43,700
then I zones out the last

447
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,920
I thought the Until I was깻

448
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,420
in front of you

449
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,300
But I'm turning around

450
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,520
Because I did no move

451
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,960
There's really no good thing.

452
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,440
You just found out?

453
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,760
Silly.

454
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,720
Linzi.

455
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,360
What's going on?

456
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,080
Why is it suddenly like this?

457
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,040
Boss.

458
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,080
What's going on?

459
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:47,840
I don't know.

460
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,200
It's suddenly so foggy.

461
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,440
Bloodthirsty.

462
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,440
They're in front.

463
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,240
Let's go.

464
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,200
Be careful.

465
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,120
Go.

466
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,320
Be careful.

467
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,080
Mr. Lin.

468
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:23,960
Look.

469
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,520
They're under magic.

470
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,560
Go save Gu Beixi and the others.

471
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,760
I'll protect Yudeng Deng.

472
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,440
Okay.

473
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,080
It's you.

474
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,520
Why are you here?

475
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,360
Where are the others?

476
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,440
Don't worry.

477
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,520
They're fine.

478
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,880
They're just under some little magic.

479
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,480
A Xin has already gone to protect them.

480
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,440
You saved me once.

481
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,760
I spared your life.

482
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:36,680
As for life,

483
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,120
we're even now.

484
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,240
I've already told you.

485
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,160
I don't want to see you.

486
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,160
Don't you understand?

487
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,960
I'll give you one last chance.

488
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,680
Yang Jin Gui.

489
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:44,840
Stay away from me.

490
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,800
Or don't blame me for being rude.

491
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,320
Last time, I didn't see clearly.

492
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,760
I didn't hit your head.

493
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,880
You might not be lucky today.

494
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,280
If you don't move,

495
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,600
I'll shoot twice,

496
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,560
shoot twice, shoot four times,

497
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,640
shoot three times, shoot six times.

498
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,360
Lu Yan.

499
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,560
You forced me to do this.

500
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,360
What are you doing?

501
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,080
Why are you...

502
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,680
Wait.

503
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,760
Wait!

504
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,560
What are you doing?

505
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,120
What are you doing?

506
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,720
Sir.

507
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,520
Master.

508
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,600
You did this again.

509
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,640
What nonsense are you talking about?

510
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,160
We're here to save people.

511
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,480
If I hadn't saved you,

512
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,880
you'd have been dead by now.

513
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,120
Stop talking about good people here.

514
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,840
Forget it.

515
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,120
Don't mind them anymore.

516
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,920
I'm not talking about you.

517
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:47,840
I'm talking about you.

518
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,760
I'm talking about you.

519
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,640
I'm talking about you.

520
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,480
I'm talking about you.

521
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,440
Don't mind them.

522
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,520
Let's go.

523
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,680
Master.

524
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,240
The spirit energy is low-grade,

525
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,480
and is good at controlling butterflies.

526
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,840
The spiritual powder on the body

527
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,160
can create the most real illusion

528
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,640
for humans or the spirit tribe.

529
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:12,320
If there are no ordinary people

530
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,320
with a certain degree of power,

531
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:14,800
it's easy to be hit by it

532
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,480
and hard to see through.

533
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,720
It's hard to detect

534
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,120
its secret action.

535
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,000
A small power of the Star Spring,

536
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,640
it can attract

537
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,080
so many spirit tribes.

538
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,760
Whether it's Yunxi or not,

539
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,600
we have to protect it first.

540
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,600
What if Yu Dengdeng

541
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
is really my master,

542
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,920
but he doesn't remember you?

543
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,840
What will you do?

544
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,920
What else can I do?

545
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
Give him the yuan bill.

546
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,000
I hope he can continue to carry out

547
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,120
his own faith and ambition.

548
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,880
But...

549
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,640
You'll die then.

550
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,600
I was born human.

551
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,480
I only live for a hundred years.

552
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,760
Now I've lived for thousands of years.

553
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,560
As long as I can do this,

554
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,480
I won't have any regrets.

555
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,440
Master,

556
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,120
don't worry.

557
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,840
I'll make sure that

558
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,800
I keep an eye on the Spring Fist.

559
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,240
I'll make sure that no evil spirit

560
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,440
can get close to it.

561
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,480
Okay.

562
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,920
So,

563
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,760
he didn't do anything to you.

564
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,240
He dared.

565
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,960
I'm the head of Yu's family.

566
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,480
I'm young and strong.

567
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,520
How dare he do that to me?

568
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,240
Besides,

569
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,800
I have spirit blood.

570
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,640
A drop of spirit blood

571
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,360
can destroy

572
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,800
his evil spirit tribe.

573
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,520
Ask him if he dares to do that.

574
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,200
Master, master.

575
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:38,760
No.

576
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,680
The brothers in the village

577
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,160
don't know that he's a spirit tribe.

578
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,600
I'm so relieved

579
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,480
that I fainted today.

580
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,400
But we can't let him go

581
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,840
so easily.

582
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,280
I've planned it.

583
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,400
He was hiding

584
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,440
in the school

585
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,600
before.

586
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,600
Now the turtle has finally shown its head.

587
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,760
I won't kill him.

588
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,440
No.

589
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,080
His magic is very evil.

590
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,040
I'm afraid that you'll be shot

591
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,480
before you hurt him.

592
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,000
Besides,

593
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,840
I'm his master.

594
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,720
If I want to kill him,

595
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,440
I have to kill him myself.

596
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,760
I won't bother you.

597
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,080
You finally know

598
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,640
what a man looks like.

599
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,800
Don't give him

600
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,720
any chance to explain.

601
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,960
He doesn't like you at all.

602
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,600
He even betrayed you.

603
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,720
He wants to kill your spirit tribe.

604
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,240
He should be cut off.

605
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,640
I'll help you

606
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
next time.

607
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,400
You help me?

608
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,920
You're not enough to make me suffer.

609
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:37,960
Fu Dian Chu.

610
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,440
Come on.

611
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,680
Let's have a meal.

612
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,240
I'm not hungry.

613
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:40,640
Come on.

614
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,600
You'll be late if you're hungry.

615
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,120
Come on.

616
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,200
I've had it.

617
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,200
You said it so well.

618
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:45,920
Did I?

619
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,080
I think he's heard it.

620
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,760
Heard it?

621
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,760
Let's go.

622
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,360
Think about it.

623
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,000
Don't be sad.

624
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,760
It's not easy for you

625
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,920
to escape from Lu Yan's hands.

626
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,440
Come here.

627
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,520
Keep watching their movements.

628
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,360
Report to me at any time.

629
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,760
Dr. Qin.

630
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,600
Master, you're in a state of depression.

631
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,920
You can't get rid of it.

632
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:57,120
Simply put, you have inflammation.

633
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,920
Is there any treatment for it?

634
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,360
Toothache is not a disease.

635
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,160
Actually, no matter how many medicines you take,

636
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,760
it's useless.

637
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,760
As long as you don't have any worries,

638
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,760
and people are happy,

639
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,920
and the inflammation is gone,

640
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,960
the pain will be healed naturally.

641
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:10,920
I see.

642
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,720
Thank you for your hard work.

643
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,520
You may leave.

644
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,680
You may leave.

645
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,200
Goodbye.

646
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,640
Deng Deng.

647
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,160
You're so worried.

648
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,160
Is it because you saw Lu Yan

649
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,720
down the mountain?

650
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,800
I can't hide anything from you.

651
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,120
You still can't forget him.

652
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,360
I...

653
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,200
I don't know what's wrong with me.

654
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,400
I hate him.

655
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,560
But sometimes I think

656
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,520
if we had this situation,

657
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,840
I would have been wrong at the beginning.

658
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,520
If I hadn't taken him up the mountain,

659
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,520
would it not have been like this?

660
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,000
I don't know why.

661
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,800
I don't know why

662
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,000
he wants to kill you.

663
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,320
Maybe he's just jealous.

664
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,120
He's inhuman.

665
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,240
But it's definitely not because

666
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,000
Deng Deng did something wrong.

667
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,800
Everyone can see that

668
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,080
you love him.

669
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,120
But he doesn't cherish you.

670
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,000
He's just unlucky.

671
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,560
Deng Deng is the best man

672
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,000
in the world.

673
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,240
If well-behaved,

674
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
people will think you're his servant

675
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,320
who does not care about the chrome.

676
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,000
You're many high-class people.

677
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,600
You don't March lifelong.

678
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,560
genial.

679
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,360
Master, look what I brought you.

680
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,680
Master, look what I brought you.

681
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,320
Master, master.

682
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:37,640
Brother Hai.

683
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,320
Where's Master?

684
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,360
Master has toothache.

685
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,880
He went to the restaurant to see a doctor.

686
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,920
Brother Hai, where did you go?

687
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,320
Look at you laughing like this.

688
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,240
I went to buy a new one for Master.

689
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,280
But I sold it out.

690
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,520
So I bought another one.

691
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,040
Oh.

692
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,520
Hey.

693
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,800
You're back, Master.

694
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,320
Come on.

695
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,280
Look.

696
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,240
Chief, I put your clothes on the bed.

697
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,200
Look what I bought for you.

698
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:05,800
I bought it especially for you.

699
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,400
It's a rocket.

700
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:14,680
What's wrong?

701
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:19,000
My head is talking to you.

702
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,800
It smells like Li Lao Er's.

703
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,360
Master, try it.

704
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,000
Come on.

705
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,320
I don't want to eat it.

706
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,000
Have a bite.

707
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,800
I don't want to eat it.

708
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:32,960
You can share it.

709
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,280
You don't want to eat it?

710
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,960
I've had too much toothache.

711
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,600
I quit.

712
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,600
What should I do?

713
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,160
How did you get it?

714
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,440
Master.

715
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,520
The informant said that the Chief had a toothache.

716
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,360
He even got a bandage.

717
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:01,720
I know.

718
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,760
You know?

719
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,960
Did you go to see him?

720
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,960
I was going to give him something.

721
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:12,920
And then?

722
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,240
He was kicked out, right?

723
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,840
I didn't go to see him.

724
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,680
Master.

725
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,920
It's better to give it to him in person.

726
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,760
We were reckless last time.

727
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,800
But this time,

728
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,680
it's not a big deal to apologize to him.

729
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,600
I just want to make sure

730
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,480
if he is Yun Xi.

731
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,240
That's right.

732
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,120
His identity needs to be checked.

733
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,400
Safety needs to be protected.

734
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,040
But the most important thing is to see the doctor.

735
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,680
It's not a disease.

736
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,680
It's a life-threatening disease.

737
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,920
If he gets a toothache, no one can stand it.

738
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,920
Si Ai is swollen today.

739
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,480
He may not be able to speak tomorrow.

740
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,920
Chang was swollen too.

741
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,840
He was already...

742
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,640
Sir, are you going or not?

743
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,600
Boss.

744
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,880
Boss.

745
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,480
Da Hai is here to see you.

746
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,680
He said he had something to talk to you.

747
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,240
Let him in.

748
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,680
Come in.

749
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,880
This way.

750
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,160
You're so bad at this.

751
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,080
You're practicing your front-line skills again.

752
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:42,400
Brother Wang, he's here.

753
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,000
You can go now.

754
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,680
Come back.

755
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,880
Yu Deng Deng asked you to come?

756
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,840
How could it be?

757
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,000
Then why are you here?

758
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,160
Why don't you stay in the village

759
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
and play with him?

760
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,240
Then I'm leaving.

761
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,120
Don't play.

762
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,320
Don't break your heart.

763
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,560
Gu Zhaichu.

764
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,720
I'm seeing that you really like my master.

765
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,360
I've been talking to my master

766
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,360
about your good words these days.

767
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
But what about your performance?

768
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,680
Your performance is so disappointing.

769
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,640
See him out.

770
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,720
Okay, okay, okay.

771
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,600
Let me talk.

772
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,160
What's going on?

773
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,760
My master

774
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,800
was really badly hurt by that Lu Yi Niang.

775
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,360
He was so sad and angry.

776
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,360
Yesterday,

777
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,760
he couldn't even eat his girl's food.

778
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,640
If it goes on like this,

779
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,080
his body will be in a bad shape.

780
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,600
So, Gu Zhaichu,

781
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:21,160
are you willing to pursue my master

782
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,720
and make him forget that man?

783
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,760
Look at his attitude.

784
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,400
He's so angry with a man.

785
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,400
I'll scold him.

786
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,480
Just lie down.

787
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,920
I've been meaning to tell you something.

788
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,280
Although you're sincere to my master,

789
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,240
can you

790
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:35,960
just

791
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,240
work a little harder?

792
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,960
Change your way of expressing your feelings.

793
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,400
Don't be so cold.

794
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,720
Cold?

795
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,720
We have to get back together.

796
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,960
After we get back together,

797
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,520
yes, I know what you mean.

798
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,240
It's right to scold and kiss.

799
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,920
But you always use this way to express yourself.

800
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,760
My master's brain doesn't react.

801
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,800
As a man,

802
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,960
you should be more direct.

803
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,880
As for the rest,

804
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,840
I'll speak nicely in front of my master.

805
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,120
Then I'll give you a chance.

806
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,880
And then you...

807
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,080
And then they'll like me.

808
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,280
You're so nice.

809
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,000
Understand?

810
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,960
You're so mean.

811
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,480
You're so mean.

812
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:10,720
I'll be there or not.

813
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,360
Okay.

814
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,240
Get ready.

815
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:12,960
I'm leaving.

816
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,560
My foot.

817
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,200
Wang.

818
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,720
Come on.

819
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,040
Ask some men

820
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:21,800
to go to our warehouse

821
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,880
and find all the boxes

822
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,680
that can hide things.

823
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,520
I want to find something.

824
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,120
What's this?

825
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,880
The gem ring my mother passed down.

826
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,040
For...

827
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,040
The one for Young Madam.

828
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,280
I'm going to send it to the Qingquan Village.

829
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,720
Don't touch it.

830
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:34,440
Go find it.

831
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,600
Go, go, go.

832
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,040
Wait.

833
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,200
It's not this one.

834
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,080
It's not this one.

835
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,960
I found it.

836
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,280
This one, right?

837
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,160
It's this one.

838
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,880
What's this?

839
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,480
A engagement letter?

840
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,640
Engagement letter?

841
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,120
What?

842
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,840
What?

843
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,120
What's this?

844
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,600
Who's getting engaged?

845
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,280
What's this?

846
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,280
What's this?

847
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,480
Burn it.

848
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,520
No, no, no.

849
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,480
This is what the old village head left behind.

850
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,760
A hundred golds for the white family in Yingdu.

851
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:39,080
The family is a family of two.

852
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,160
A fake adult's child.

853
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,680
The old village head

854
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,880
is so far-sighted.

855
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,880
Why didn't he mention

856
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,920
about Young Madam before he left?

857
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,080
Why didn't he mention it?

858
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,680
Yeah, why didn't he mention it?

859
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,080
Young Madam,

860
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,760
the head of Qingquan Village

861
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,440
is the Young Madam that I'm going to marry for you.

862
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,800
Besides,

863
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,080
that old man has been married for five or six years.

864
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,760
If he really wants to get married,

865
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,880
he can climb out of the house and get married himself.

866
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,680
Climb?

867
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,680
Get married?

868
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,800
Put it away.

869
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,080
Put it away.

870
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,120
Come on.

871
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,000
Put it away.

872
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,480
Go to the back hill

873
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,000
to pick some fresh pears.

874
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
And prepare some ice cubes.

875
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,080
I'll use them tonight.

876
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:20,720
Okay.

877
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,640
Okay.

878
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,520
Help me find a better box.

879
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:25,280
Okay.

880
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:25,680
Okay.

881
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,200
Get a good box.

882
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:26,960
Get a good one.

883
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,720
Chief Gu.

884
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,320
Chief Gu.

885
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,080
Chief Gu.

886
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,200
Please.

887
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,880
Please make my master feel better.

888
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,160
Don't worry.

889
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,200
I'm always in a good mood

890
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,280
when your master sees me.

891
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,560
Watch me.

892
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,120
Okay.

893
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,720
Okay.

894
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:52,520
I hope so.

895
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,920
Gu Weixi.

896
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,120
Why did you come to our village?

897
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,040
What are you doing?

898
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,120
You even sneak attacked my room at midnight.

899
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:11,800
The village is so poor.

900
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,400
Why would I sneak attack you?

901
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,960
I made some pear soup for you.

902
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,400
It's good for detoxification.

903
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,360
You often sneaked at our back hill when you were a kid.

904
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,440
Sit down.

905
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,520
Sit down.

906
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:26,800
Here.

907
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,520
Try it.

908
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,160
Don't worry.

909
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,000
It's not poisonous.

910
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,400
I made it with honey.

911
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,840
Besides,

912
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,120
if I really want to take over your village,

913
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,160
I won't use such a mean way.

914
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,760
You're not even willing to play tricks on my territory.

915
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,760
It's cool and refreshing.

916
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,760
You should drink it too.

917
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,080
You don't have to feel bad for giving me such a big bowl.

918
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,600
What's there to feel bad about?

919
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,320
I'm not short of money.

920
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,960
I'll be happy if you drink it.

921
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:10,960
Deng Deng.

922
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,080
Do you remember the first time we met when we were kids?

923
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,160
I remember that

924
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,840
you hit me once when we first met.

925
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,760
You even complained to my father.

926
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,760
My father hit me once again when we got home.

927
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,000
I remember now.

928
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,760
I hit you because you shaved my head first.

929
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
I've never mentioned

930
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,560
those bad things you did to my father.

931
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,120
But you hit me once

932
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,400
when we met once.

933
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:43,160
I even hurt my ass when I met you.

934
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,880
Where did you go

935
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,160
when you were young?

936
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,160
It would be better if I added some wine.

937
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,960
You're such a bad person.

938
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,160
You're still drinking.

939
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,680
You can't drown yourself in the water tonight.

940
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,360
What do you mean?

941
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,560
You're swollen.

942
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,760
You can't sink in the water.

943
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,080
Why didn't I realize

944
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,360
you were so good at joking?

945
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,960
You've realized too much.

946
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,360
This brush can brush your teeth faster.

947
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,960
Thank you, Gu Bei Xi.

948
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,360
These days,

949
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:50,960
our Qingquan Village

950
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,560
and I

951
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,960
have been in trouble.

952
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,160
Thank you for your help.

953
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,760
This isn't what you said, right?

954
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,960
I hope you'll be fine.

955
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,560
Then I can stay by your side and take care of you.

956
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,160
Gu Bei Xi, you're such a bad man.
