1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let go even if you walk away from me

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You ask you, it's not me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You ask you, it's not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You ask you, it's not me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You ask you, it's not me

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Wei Du

8
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Wei Du

9
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It's Wei Du

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This kid's life is really tough

11
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What? Can't recognize your little deputy?

12
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Do you want to save the people outside?

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Or save your loyal admirers?

14
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You choose

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Zhurou, let him go

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I know you feel bad

17
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He was tortured in the underground palace

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Still standing in front of the door

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But it's really a loyal dog to you

20
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
If it's me

21
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I can't bear to lose such a loyal dog

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I just want your yuan pellet

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Give me the yuan pellet

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can spare you

25
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
General, don't listen to him

26
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If you don't save him, he's really going to die

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Want to play tricks

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Try to be quick

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Or my ghost mouth hurts fast

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm going to kill you

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm going to kill you

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm going to kill you

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm going to kill you

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm going to kill you

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm going to kill you

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm going to kill you

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm going to kill you

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm going to kill you

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm going to kill you

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm going to kill you

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm going to kill you

42
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm going to kill you

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm going to kill you

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm going to kill you

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm going to kill you

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Old fish

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There are two명이

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Wei Du.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Xiao Jun.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Lei Xi!

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Wei Du.

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Uncle Wen.

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Father.

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's okay.

56
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Where is he?

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Where is he?

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
His energy is running out.

59
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He can't run far.

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Wei Du, how are you?

61
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
General.

62
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Zhurou.

63
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He should have run to the underground palace.

64
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Underground palace?

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Go after him.

66
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He will take care of it.

67
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Let's go.

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Let's go.

69
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Be careful.

70
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Father, be careful.

71
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Go.

72
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You go there.

73
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I go here.

74
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Go.

75
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I'm the last thing you can do.

76
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Haha, I got your name right, right?

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You're such a good pair of people.

78
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Spit on everyone.

79
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Go.

80
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
voted!

81
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Congratulations, Prince Slayer.

82
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Prince Slayer's sweet words

83
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I...

84
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
But with my life,

85
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I can let you see the world again.

86
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I, Zhu Rong,

87
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
will be satisfied with this life.

88
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Zhu Rong.

89
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Zhu Rong.

90
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Zhu Rong.

91
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The End

92
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It's over.

93
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Everything is over.

94
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What do you mean?

95
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What are you talking about?

96
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The thunder has come.

97
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The clouds have risen.

98
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The black saintess...

99
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
is dead.

100
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The black saintess?

101
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Who is the black saintess?

102
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What black saintess?

103
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
The black saintess

104
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
is the monster that takes life.

105
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I heard from Zhu Rong that

106
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
she was the evil spirit

107
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
that sealed you 3000 years ago.

108
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
After Zhu Rong found her,

109
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
she has been self-reliant in the underground palace.

110
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
She has been looking for ways

111
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
to revive the black saintess.

112
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Once the black saintess revives,

113
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,000
she will be devoured by the black saintess.

114
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The shadow will be thrown to the ground.

115
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No, Yun Xi.

116
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
No!

117
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Help me!

118
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Yun Xi, help me!

119
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Help me!

120
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
No!

121
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Help me!

122
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I think I've seen you before.

123
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
In the underground palace,

124
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
didn't you say that

125
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I sealed her 3000 years ago?

126
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Then I'll seal her again.

127
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Sealing

128
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
requires the power of the yuan-pellet.

129
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
But the yuan-pellet

130
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
is in the general's body.

131
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Miss Yu,

132
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I have something to tell you.

133
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Go ahead.

134
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You know

135
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
the general's wish for 3000 years

136
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
is to return the yuan-pellet to you.

137
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
But he never said

138
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
that if he gave it to you,

139
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
he would be separated from you

140
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
and be destroyed.

141
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Unless...

142
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Unless what?

143
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
If you return it to me,

144
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'll give you my head.

145
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I'll save you.

146
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Unless...

147
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If you die,

148
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
he can't live.

149
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Miss Yu,

150
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
you and the general

151
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
are entangled in life.

152
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You're related by blood.

153
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't want to admit it,

154
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
but the deeds of the people

155
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
are also because of you.

156
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Unless

157
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
unless

158
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
the person who died

159
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
is grateful,

160
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
there's no need to regret.

161
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
But there's only one yuan-pellet.

162
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You're the one the general loves.

163
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
In order to save you,

164
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
the general's life is more important than yours.

165
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Of course he won't hesitate.

166
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
General,

167
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
young and rich,

168
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
once a family of students

169
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
died together.

170
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
The old family of the Tuo family and I

171
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
suffered a lot.

172
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
They should

173
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
enjoy the happiness of the world.

174
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Miss Yu,

175
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
these days,

176
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I've realized that

177
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
the general

178
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
is also the person you love.

179
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
How to live,

180
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
how to get...

181
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Miss Yu,

182
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I believe you'll have a great future.

183
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Miss Yu,

184
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
the bad things I did to you

185
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I can't get back.

186
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm sorry.

195
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm sorry.

202
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm sorry.

203
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm sorry.

205
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm sorry.

206
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm sorry.

207
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm sorry.

208
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm sorry.

209
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm sorry.

210
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm sorry.

211
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm sorry.

212
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm sorry.

213
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm sorry.

214
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm sorry.

215
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'm sorry.

216
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm sorry.

217
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
How is it?

218
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's all over.

219
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Zhurong is dead.

220
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That's great.

221
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Wei Du,

222
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
how is it?

223
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
It's all over.

224
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's all over.

225
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's all over.

226
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's all over.

227
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It's all over.

228
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
It's all over.

229
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's all over.

230
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It's all over.

231
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's all over.

232
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's all over.

233
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's all over.

234
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It's all over.

235
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's all over.

236
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It's all over.

237
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It's all over.

238
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's all over.

239
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's all over.

240
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It's all over.

241
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's all over.

242
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
It's all over.

243
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
It's all over.

244
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
It's all over.

245
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's all over.

246
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
It's all over.

247
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It's all over.

248
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's all over.

249
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It's all over.

250
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
It's all over.

251
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's all over.

252
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's all over.

253
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It's all over.

254
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's all over.

255
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Again.

256
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Again.

257
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's all over.

258
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's all over.

259
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's all over.

260
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's all over.

261
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Next time when

262
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
they're back,

263
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
you come back,

264
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I'll blow all of them up.

265
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Come on, It's all over.

266
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Come on, It's all over.

267
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's all over.

268
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,400
It's too painful.

269
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,120
Now I can leave

270
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,600
and be free.

271
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,040
General,

272
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,680
I have to tell you

273
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,960
I remember the reason why I can't live long.

274
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,840
That year,

275
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,800
I was exposed to the blood of the Holy Lady of the Golden House.

276
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,240
I was born and raised.

277
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,840
Then,

278
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,160
I saved my men

279
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,080
without any hesitation.

280
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,800
I escaped to this place.

281
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,360
On my way,

282
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,160
I was chased by my men.

283
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,760
In the end,

284
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:37,960
I was the only one left.

285
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,360
Time passed by.

286
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:42,920
I was alive

287
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,880
like a ghost.

288
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,640
I was trapped in this ruins.

289
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,080
But I

290
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,320
couldn't cherish anyone here.

291
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,440
Then,

292
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,440
I was used by Zhurou.

293
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,040
I was deceived and controlled.

294
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,360
I was killed alone.

295
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,960
I was abandoned.

296
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,720
I was the only one who was defeated.

297
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,080
General,

298
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,680
I can see you again.

299
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,760
I've lived for 3,000 years.

300
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,720
The only meaning is...

301
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,120
at least now,

302
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,600
I hope he would

303
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,360
holidays

304
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,840
and become a Dainan playing Mal puding date

305
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,660
to

306
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:09,280
let his mortal mother

307
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,040
abandon him for good.

308
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,280
Be careful

309
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,360
Small

310
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,200
Big

311
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:21,840
Small

312
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,680
Big

313
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,080
Big

314
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,960
Big

315
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,560
Big

316
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,040
Good

317
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:28,760
OK, OK

318
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,760
I'm so used to it

319
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,360
Brother Daqian

320
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,920
Don't think about your wife

321
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,800
How can you be like our boss?

322
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,720
Get married and marry again

323
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,800
No big no small

324
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,880
If the boss is not here

325
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,240
I'm the boss who takes care of the village

326
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:43,720
Yes

327
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,240
Come

328
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,120
Big big big

329
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,640
Big big big

330
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,640
Be reasonable

331
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,000
Boss

332
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,240
Our village is busy

333
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,920
There are a group of people on the hill

334
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,360
The movement is quite big

335
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,920
I don't think they are good people

336
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,280
Come to find the Bodhisattva

337
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,880
Is it that Boss Yu is back?

338
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,000
No

339
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,600
Our boss Yu

340
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,240
He doesn't like to sleep in the shop

341
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,840
This guy is a stone bull

342
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,120
He must be sleepy

343
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,720
Hey

344
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,600
I don't know which village heard the sound

345
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,160
Know that it's my Daqian's business now

346
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,600
Dare not come in the day

347
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,280
Come to sneak attack at night

348
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,440
Sneak attack

349
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,480
Who dares to do it

350
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,520
OK

351
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:28,080
Ask brothers to blow out the light

352
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,720
Let's meet them

353
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,280
I'll show you

354
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,280
What is it called

355
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:34,480
Men rise up in the sky

356
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,520
Good good

357
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,160
Go

358
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,440
Boss

359
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,280
Where is it?

360
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,040
There

361
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,080
Daqian, what are you doing?

362
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,120
Boss

363
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,200
It's really you

364
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,080
What are you looking at?

365
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,160
The boss didn't even recognize it

366
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,600
Not me, who is it?

367
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:53,800
Daqian

368
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,640
It's been a while

369
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,880
Boss

370
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,840
Boss Yu

371
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,480
Boss Yu

372
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,480
Boss Yu

373
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,000
Boss Yu

374
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,640
The dragon enters the sea, the sword is back

375
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,840
Thank you for blessing us

376
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,720
Qingquan Village is safe

377
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,920
Thank you thank you

378
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,400
Second master, stop

379
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,160
I can't run fast

380
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:25,960
Eat quickly

381
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,160
Second master, eat

382
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,760
Are you going to eat?

383
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,480
it is good

384
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,720
Come and eat

385
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,280
Eat

386
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,080
Second master

387
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,600
Here

388
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,000

389
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,400

390
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,360
All are good things

391
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,160
Eat

392
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,160
I like to eat

393
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,000
Come come come

394
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Look at this.

395
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Look at this.

396
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
This is good.

397
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Come.

398
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Lu Yan.

399
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Eat more of this.

400
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
The waist.

401
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Yes.

402
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Eat more of this.

403
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Eat more of this.

404
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Young people don't need to eat so much waist.

405
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You should eat.

406
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Eat.

407
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Enough.

408
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Enough.

409
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I wasn't here during this time.

410
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Who was in charge of the village?

411
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Of course, my big brother.

412
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Big brother's village is quite rich.

413
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
The village is quite rich.

414
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
It's good for the food.

415
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
It's not just that.

416
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
We also added some people.

417
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Our mother pig gave birth to a baby.

418
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
She fed the pig.

419
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
The big king is also good.

420
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
He gave birth to a baby.

421
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
And that...

422
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
It's all about the chicken, hair, and garlic skin.

423
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Don't talk about it.

424
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
How much money did you add to the silver, silver, and skin?

425
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Boss.

426
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm the one who lives inside.

427
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I have to support you when you live outside.

428
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Come.

429
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Cheers.

430
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
It seems that Da Qian is still virtuous.

431
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Come.

432
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Cheers.

433
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Can you still drink?

434
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Yes.

435
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Big brother Qian.

436
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Old village head.

437
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Big boss.

438
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Lu Yingning.

439
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
Second boss.

440
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
You just came back.

441
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Then eat and drink and rest.

442
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I have something to do.

443
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'll go to work first.

444
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Go after you finish eating.

445
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I'll drink with you next time.

446
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I'm going first.

447
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Go.

448
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Go after you finish eating.

449
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Go.

450
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
You...

451
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Really.

452
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Dad.

453
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Come.

454
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I'll fill you up.

455
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You haven't drunk the high-quality wine

456
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
that our village made for a long time, have you?

457
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Second brother.

458
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Yes.

459
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Drink well.

460
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Sleep well.

461
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Drink well.

462
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Come.

463
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Lu Ying.

464
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Come.

465
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Come.

466
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Come.

467
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Drink well.

468
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Drink well.

469
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Come.

470
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Eat more.

471
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Eat quickly.

472
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
There's something important to do later.

473
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
What is it?

474
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Master, what can you do?

475
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You just came back.

476
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Let them rest.

477
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Besides, what do you have to do?

478
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
What do you have to do?

479
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Of course it's important.

480
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Eat quickly.

481
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Come.

482
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Eat.

483
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Eat.

484
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Okay, I'm full.

485
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Lu Yan.

486
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Are you full too?

487
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Come out with me.

488
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Master, where are we going?

489
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Where are we going?

490
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
I know you're full.

491
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Come here.

492
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Hurry up.

493
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Are we going now?

494
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
No, no.

495
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
What's going on, girl?

496
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
What?

497
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Why did you bring me here?

498
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I have a treasure for you.

499
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
What treasure can I have here?

500
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
You'll know in a while.

501
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I found it.

502
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Guess what this is.

503
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
A piece of cloth.

504
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Guess again.

505
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Isn't this a box?

506
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You have to guess.

507
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
There's a letter in it.

508
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
A letter?

509
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
For whom?

510
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
For you.

511
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
When I was a kid,

512
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
my dad and my second dad fought with me.

513
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
They said I was smart and smart.

514
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
No matter who I grew up with,

515
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
that person took a big advantage.

516
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
So,

517
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
they wrote this letter early.

518
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
They buried it under this tree.

519
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
They wanted to give it to their future son-in-law.

520
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
They must hope that

521
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
the person in the future can take good care of me.

522
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I've already thought about it.

523
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
As long as I find that person,

524
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I'll give him this letter.

525
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It seems that

526
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
you've already decided on me.

527
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I've already decided on you.

528
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Lu Yan,

529
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
we've defeated Zhu Rong.

530
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
He's done with the big trouble.

531
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
We won't have any worries in the future.

532
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
From now on,

533
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
we can live like gods

534
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
in the Qingquan Village.

535
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I'll call you my son.

536
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
You'll be a man of your word.

537
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Now that I think about it,

538
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I'm really lucky.

539
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I met you at the Star Sect.

540
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Although I was greedy for your beauty at first,

541
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
but later,

542
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
we've experienced so many things in the mountains.

543
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
We've experienced so many lives together.

544
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
I've already decided on you.

545
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I'll rely on you in this life.

546
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Deng Deng,

547
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I think after you've experienced so many things,

548
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
you've become more mature,

549
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
stable,

550
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
and can speak.

551
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Really?

552
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Then take a look.

553
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm also curious about

554
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
what the two old people wrote for you.

555
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Okay, I'll take a look.

556
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
What did you write?

557
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Did you ask me to love you,

558
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
spoil me,

559
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
and love me?

560
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
You can take a closer look.

561
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Wu Ye,

562
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Deng Deng is very powerful.

563
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
You should take care of yourself

564
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,000
after you marry him.

565
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
These two old men

566
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
have been fooling me since I was a child.

567
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Thank you.

568
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Thank you for your hard work.

569
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Thank you for your hard work.

570
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Give it to me.

571
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Give it to me.

572
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Give it back to me.

573
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
You're being considerate.

574
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
This letter is mine now.

575
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It doesn't count.

576
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
I have to let them rewrite it.

577
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Okay, with your current ability,

578
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
you can't take this letter back.

579
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Leave this letter with me for now.

580
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You've been working so hard these days.

581
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Go back and rest early.

582
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Forget it.

583
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I won't be as considerate as them.

584
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Let's go.

585
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Hurry up.

586
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Let's go.

587
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Yun Xi,

588
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
you've sealed me here

589
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
for 3,000 years.

590
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
This time,

591
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
it's your turn.

592
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Yun Xi,

593
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
you've sealed me here for 3,000 years.

594
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
You've sealed me here for 3,000 years.

595
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
You've sealed me here for 3,000 years.

596
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
You've sealed me here for 3,000 years.

597
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
You've sealed me here for 3,000 years.

598
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
You've sealed me here for 3,000 years.

599
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
You've sealed me here for 3,000 years.

600
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
You've sealed me here for 3,000 years.

601
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
You've sealed me here for 3,000 years.

602
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
You've sealed me here for 3,000 years.

603
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
You've sealed me here for 3,000 years.

604
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You've sealed me here for 3,000 years.

605
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You've sealed me here for 3,000 years.

606
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
You've sealed me here for 3,000 years.

607
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,000
That's right.

608
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Yun Xi,

609
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
it's really an unimaginable feat.

610
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
From now on,

611
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,840
your Owl Subduing tactic

612
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:26,760
I'll go.

613
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,400
Wang Lishan,

614
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,400
come here.

615
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,240
What's up, boss?

616
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,880
Set a card for Shi Qi tomorrow.

617
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,680
The card should be in our village.

618
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
Got it, boss.

619
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,720
And

620
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,080
the account with Xiong'er Village

621
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,440
is time to settle it.

622
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,920
Tomorrow, call your brother

623
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,880
and take the dog from Xiong'er Village.

624
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,720
Okay.

625
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,960
What are you doing?

626
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,040
What's wrong?

627
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:04,720
It's noisy.

628
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,000
You're looking for trouble.

629
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,400
We're not.

630
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,320
Looking for trouble?

631
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,760
Why are you looking for girls?

632
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,520
Go and have a look.

633
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,600
Don't move.

634
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,280
Are you okay?

635
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,000
I'm fine.

636
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,720
Get up.

637
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:20,760
Are you okay?

638
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,400
I'm fine.

639
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,800
You're not as old as the old.

640
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,080
I'll see

641
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,200
who breaks the rules

642
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,760
and breaks the rules of Taoism.

643
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Chief Gu,

644
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,880
this is not the place of your Nanfeng Village.

645
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:38,040
We got this card first.

646
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,560
Get out or not?

647
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:52,840
I'm sorry.

648
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,320
We got a new card.

649
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,600
Why

650
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,400
do you have salt clusters?

651
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,560
Go look for them by the roadside.

652
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,680
Why are you here?

653
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,080
Let's go...

654
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,560
Go...

655
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,280
're you Liam Mille?

656
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,240
I...

657
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,120
Shi Qi.

658
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,120
Shi Qi.

659
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,280
Shi Qi.

660
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,600
It's really you.

661
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,640
Shi Qi.

662
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,720
It's me.

663
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,440
Gu Bei Xie.

664
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,040
Long time no see.

665
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,440
Long time no see.

666
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,360
Come on, take the bamboo.

667
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,600
Come on, take the bamboo.

668
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,480
Come on, take the bamboo.

669
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,560
Come on, take the bamboo.

670
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,320
Coming.

671
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,240
Come on, take the bamboo.

672
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,960
Thank you.

673
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,640
You saved me so many times.

674
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,240
I'm glad you're fine.

675
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
I'm fine.

676
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,600
Shi Qi.

677
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,280
I failed to find you.

678
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,120
I lost my mother.

679
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,440
I'm sorry.

680
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,760
What are you talking about?

681
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,600
Do you know?

682
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,520
If it weren't for you,

683
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,880
I would have died long ago.

684
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,040
After I escaped from Xiong Ya Village,

685
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,800
I went to that shabby temple to wait for you.

686
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,160
But I didn't wait for you.

687
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,200
Instead, I was targeted by a spirit.

688
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,680
Do you remember the gun you gave me?

689
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,720
It saved my life.

690
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,400
I'm sorry.

691
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
Shi Qi.

692
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,400
You've changed a lot.

693
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,400
You're not like the Miss Bai

694
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,520
I knew before.

695
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,360
People change.

696
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:09,960
Besides,

697
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,480
there's no Miss Bai anymore.

698
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,160
Only Bai Shi Qi.

699
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,440
I'm going to work.

700
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,920
I'll find someone to change your gauze.

701
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:54,920
Okay.

702
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
Dad, Er Die.

703
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,640
Master, come and sit here.

704
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,520
It's hot today.

705
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,520
I'm sorry.

706
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,520
It's okay.

707
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,000
I'll cover you.

708
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,120
Master, don't shake.

709
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,960
You're making me nervous.

710
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,760
Be careful, Er Die.

711
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,960
I'm so worried about the sun.

712
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,280
It's weird.

713
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,840
I was so cold last night.

714
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,760
But now,

715
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,080
the sun is so hot.

716
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,480
What's going on?

717
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,240
Kill him.

718
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,160
Wait.

719
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:39,960
Stop.

720
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,680
Oh no.

721
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,000
We're going to lose again.

722
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,600
The Great Sage is taking us

723
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,040
to the Hongqing Village for a competition.

724
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,680
We're going to lose if we're too serious.

725
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,240
We're going to die.

726
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,240
What?

727
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,520
What?

728
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,520
What?

729
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:53,520
What?

730
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,520
What?

731
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,520
What?

732
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,520
What?

733
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,520
What?

734
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,520
What?

735
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,520
What?

736
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,520
What?

737
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,520
What?

738
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,520
What?

739
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,520
What?

740
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,520
What?

741
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:05,520
What?

742
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,520
What?

743
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,520
What?

744
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,520
What?

745
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,520
What?

746
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,520
What?

747
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,520
What?

748
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,520
What?

749
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:13,520
What?

750
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,520
What?

751
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,520
What?

752
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,520
What?

753
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,520
What?

754
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,520
What?

755
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,520
What?

756
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,520
When two hearts are so close

757
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:26,520
When the whole world is occupied by you

758
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,520
I will call you with all my heart

759
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:35,520
Until your memory

760
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:41,520
You are my only

761
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:48,520
The wind that comes close

762
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,520
This city is the last stop

763
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,520
The distance is far away

764
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,520
I hide my heart

765
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,520
And make a decision for you

766
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:23,520
When two hearts are so close

767
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,520
When the whole world is occupied by you

768
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,520
I will call you with all my heart

769
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,520
Until your memory

770
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:43,520
You are my only

771
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:48,520
The wind that comes close

772
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:52,520
This city is the last stop

773
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,520
The distance is far away

774
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:00,520
I hide my heart

775
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:05,520
And make a decision for you

776
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:18,520
The wind that comes close

777
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:23,520
This city is the last stop

778
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,520
The distance is far away

779
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:33,520
I hide my heart

780
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,520
And make a decision for you
