1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let go even if you walk away from me

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You ask me, it's not me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You ask me, it's not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You ask me, it's not me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You ask me

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't joke

8
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's about the same as me

9
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Lu Yan, you knew I would come and die

10
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Right?

11
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
In fact, you all know

12
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You are hiding from me, right?

13
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You are so careless

14
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'll go and kill all those spirits and monsters

15
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Wu Weixi

16
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Follow him

17
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay

18
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Okay

19
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Why are there so few yuan energy today?

20
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm useless

21
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I underestimated the girl in the Golden Whale Town and failed

22
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Please give me another chance

23
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I will use her energy to replenish your yuan energy

24
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
If I hadn't been hurt by Lu Yan 3000 years ago

25
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yuan energy is damaged

26
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
How can I rely on you little people

27
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yuan energy to maintain life

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:16,820
You are still

29
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,820
Get out

30
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You are a human.

31
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You actually got the yuan pellet.

32
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Return it to me!

33
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,440
formula

34
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,360
You can't kill me.

35
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,100
You can't even touch my real body.

36
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,360
How dare you try to kill me?

37
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,360
It's like a dream.

38
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,320
This sword

39
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,320
is for Yunxi.

40
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,520
If I hadn't been stabbed by her,

41
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,480
how could I have ended up here?

42
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,880
Please don't be angry.

43
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
I'm angry.

44
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,880
Why should I be angry?

45
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,360
The fish that was carrying the Saintess' yuan pellet

46
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,360
was sent to me.

47
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,240
As long as I get the yuan pellet,

48
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,560
I can revive the Black Saintess again.

49
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,000
By then, the whole Jiuzhou

50
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,920
will be the world of our tribe.

51
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,320
That's right.

52
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Lu Yan.

53
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,360
I want you to kneel down under my feet again,

54
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,760
and bear the taste of losing everything again.

55
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
All right.

56
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Stop it.

57
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Wait a little longer.

58
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Forget it.

59
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,640
It's not the point.

60
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,240
This is the legendary inner power.

61
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,320
I thought it was only in the five sub-links.

62
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,240
Put away your true power.

63
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,120
Don't use it on me.

64
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,120
What if the spirit monster really comes?

65
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,040
What should I do?

66
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,520
You really want me to be the old woman?

67
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,720
You're still in the mood to joke?

68
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,960
You're not afraid of me?

69
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,840
You're a big figure.

70
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,960
What are you afraid of?

71
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,120
Big figure?

72
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,160
Boss Bu called you General Yan just now.

73
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,560
You have so many skills.

74
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,800
Even a fool like me can see

75
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,560
that you're not an ordinary person.

76
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,280
You don't want to talk about it,

77
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
and I don't want to ask.

78
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,680
But I've thought about it.

79
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,600
Even if you're a spirit monster,

80
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,200
I believe you won't hurt me.

81
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,600
All right, stop talking.

82
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Come on.

83
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,200
Eat something to restore your physical strength.

84
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Ciba?

85
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Where did you buy this wild one?

86
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,320
Where did you buy it?

87
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Luo Yan.

88
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,720
You've been protecting me since before the wedding.

89
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,320
You even tried to save me.

90
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
Actually,

91
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,920
you don't really like me, do you?

92
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,720
If you like me, you should have told me earlier.

93
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,320
I'm very kind.

94
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,320
If you perform well,

95
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,720
maybe you can get a promotion.

96
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
I'm sorry.

97
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
I'm sorry.

98
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
I'm sorry.

99
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,120
I'm just kidding.

100
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,720
If I had died earlier,

101
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,520
you'd be an official husband.

102
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,120
So you'd better not like me.

103
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,080
Probably tonight

104
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,920
will be the first evening

105
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
we spend together.

106
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,840
At last I'll understand

107
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,240
what comes next in the spring.

108
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,960
We both

109
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,120
are old but good men, aren't we?

110
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,480
What if I end up

111
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
being a like manage한데?

112
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,080
Could you

113
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,280
stay

114
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,320
with me for a while

115
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
Help me settle down in the Qingquan Village.

116
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,320
The sea is barren.

117
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,320
My second father is old.

118
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,320
There are many people in the village who have no home or business.

119
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Our village is poor.

120
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,320
I really can't rest assured.

121
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
Don't think too much.

122
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,320
I won't let anything happen to you.

123
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,320
Lu Yan,

124
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,320
why are you so good to me?

125
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,320
You are so rich and have a lot of money.

126
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
You have a house, a home and a family.

127
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Why are you willing to stay in the village?

128
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Our village is so poor.

129
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,320
If you help me,

130
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,320
you won't blame me, right?

131
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,320
I'm not blaming you.

132
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,320
I'm blaming you for something in your house.

133
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,320
What is it?

134
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,320
The Yinglong Valley in the ancestral hall.

135
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,320
Yinglong Valley?

136
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,320
It's the valley of the ancient forest tribe.

137
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Okay.

138
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,320
It's no use keeping that thing.

139
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,320
I'll return the favor.

140
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,320
What I asked you to do...

141
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,320
It's your business to take care of your children.

142
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,320
If you don't want them to be in trouble, you can just hold on.

143
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Go back to the mountain village safely.

144
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,320
Don't say such sad things.

145
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,320
Okay.

146
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,320
Sir, is Gu Beixi missing?

147
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,320
I can smell the blood of the spiritual clan.

148
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,320
Changcheng is looking for her.

149
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
I'll go find her.

150
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,320
Why are you going? Have a good rest here.

151
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,320
I'll go. A'xin, take care of her.

152
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Okay.

153
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Be careful. Come back safely.

154
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Get up.

155
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Don't worry.

156
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,320
My husband will definitely save Gu Beixi.

157
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,320
You're back. Where's my husband?

158
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,320
Your husband?

159
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,320
I lost my way in the forest and didn't see your husband.

160
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Gu Beixi,

161
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,320
I remember when we were kids,

162
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,320
you and your old village head came to our village to play.

163
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,320
I cut all your hair.

164
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Now I think of it, I'm so sorry.

165
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,320
You don't have to be sorry. I forgot about this little thing.

166
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,320
I forgot about this little thing.

167
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,320
How can you forget our grudges?

168
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,320
Actually, you cut all my hair at that time.

169
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,320
You were beaten day and night.

170
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,320
A'xin!

171
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:51,320
I didn't expect that you would be so good at fighting.

172
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,320
You have a gun and a barrier.

173
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Your two men are quite caring to you.

174
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Where's Gu Beixi?

175
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,320
Gu Beixi?

176
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,320
I'm right in front of you.

177
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,320
Gu Beixi!

178
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,320
Gu Beixi!

179
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,320
Gu Beixi!

180
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,320
Gu Beixi!

181
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Gu Beixi!

182
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,320
Beixi, Beixi!

183
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Gu Beixi!

184
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,320
Gu Beixi, wake up!

185
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,920
I'll tell you when I catch up.

186
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
Kill the humans.

187
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,560
Do you think you can escape?

188
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,560
I never thought that I would escape.

189
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,640
As long as I can drive you away from Gu Bei Qi.

190
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
I'll kill you.

191
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
I'll kill you.

192
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,520
I'll kill you.

193
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
I'll kill you.

194
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,520
I'll kill you.

195
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
I'll kill you.

196
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,040
I'll kill you.

197
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,920
I knew it.

198
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,080
You would come.

199
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,260
So that you can be poisoned beaten by Light variant!

200
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,440
cup ceiling

201
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,760
Keyboard

202
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,200
statistics

203
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,400
Record

204
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,280
See

205
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,180
And the

206
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:30,720
Record

207
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,360
tilt it a bit

208
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:37,840
look

209
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,680
I turn your neck

210
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,360
then turn again

211
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,320
take it

212
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,480
it seems hard again

213
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,920
I bend my head

214
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
is it

215
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,840
you

216
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,000
bend or push

217
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,680
up

218
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,320
up

219
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,180
the chest

220
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,020
let me give back

221
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:01,980
Stop it.

222
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,420
Let me.

223
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,060
Hold on.

224
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,580
It won't hurt.

225
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:24,300
You are so cruel to your preparation.

226
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,700
It's weird if it doesn't hurt.

227
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,900
Just try anyway.

228
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,460
If my dad knows

229
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,660
I'm not a member of the Lin Clan.

230
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,060
It's true.

231
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,620
Do you think

232
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,820
I have any special background?

233
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,060
Could it be

234
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,740
that Sun Wukong has passed away?

235
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,420
Or that Erlang God has passed away?

236
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,980
Don't talk about Tang Monk.

237
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,060
The monster will know it.

238
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,660
Sir.

239
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,620
You think so, right?

240
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,620
Lu Yi Niang.

241
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,380
You're back.

242
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,980
I mean, Chief Gu

243
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,580
I've been waiting for you.

244
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,780
You've done me a great favor.

245
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,780
I'm not the one who's sleeping.

246
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,980
There's another one here.

247
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,140
Okay, that's all.

248
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,380
Let's go home.

249
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,980
Okay, let's go home.

250
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,660
Hey.

251
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,540
Girl.

252
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,300
Don't be too sad.

253
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,540
People die.

254
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,860
They can't come back to life.

255
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,140
I just thought of my mother.

256
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,340
Yashu was killed.

257
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,940
I can bury her.

258
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,580
My father said my mother was buried in her hometown.

259
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,860
But he didn't tell me where her hometown was.

260
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,940
I didn't even get a chance to bury her.

261
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,020
This is your father's sad story.

262
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:04,860
He's afraid you'll be sad with him.

263
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,140
Brother.

264
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,900
Brother.

265
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,220
You've known my father for so long.

266
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,340
You've watched me grow up.

267
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,420
You know my mother, right?

268
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,020
How did she die?

269
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,780
I heard your father tell me once.

270
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:27,220
He said your father went out to hunt when you were a kid.

271
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,700
One day, he came to your village and beat someone up.

272
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,740
He was killed by someone.

273
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,140
He even asked a three-year-old girl to take him away.

274
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,300
Your mother tried her best to hide you.

275
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,980
When your father came back,

276
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,780
except for you,

277
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,500
your village was killed.

278
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,620
Was it me they were looking for?

279
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,620
And why did my blood

280
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,300
shock the spiritual clan?

281
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,300
This should be

282
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,820
a story.

283
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,620
Do you remember

284
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,340
you got sick when you were three or four?

285
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:11,780
Yes.

286
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,060
You told me

287
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,700
my father caught a bird from the mountain

288
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,860
and ate it.

289
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,220
And he cured me.

290
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,580
I was so strong because of that.

291
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,260
Yes.

292
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,660
Your blood is special.

293
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,940
It's related to that bird.

294
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,300
Anyway, don't think too much.

295
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:32,500
It's a blessing to be back safely.

296
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,940
Uncle Jia,

297
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,980
here's your money.

298
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,700
Boss,

299
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,900
the horse is ready.

300
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,140
The journey is not short.

301
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,460
Do you have to go there yourself?

302
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,940
You're making me wait for you.

303
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,460
You can't invite a hunter like Master Huang Xuan.

304
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,860
I have to go there myself.

305
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,820
You can't invite him.

306
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,100
I have to go there myself.

307
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:06,740
Before you come back,

308
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,340
keep an eye on the Qingquan Village for me.

309
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,420
Especially Lu Yan and that little girl.

310
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,380
Got it.

311
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,620
Now Qingquan Village has our eyes.

312
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:14,420
Don't worry.

313
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:15,460
We have to keep an eye on him

314
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,500
for 12 hours a day.

315
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,220
Lu Yan,

316
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,260
I'll take your life sooner or later.

317
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,580
You're so kind.

318
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,980
You can go to the Fish Fountain to find me if you want to see me.

319
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,180
You even asked someone to invite me.

320
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,860
Now everyone in the village knows about it.

321
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,820
If you don't come to the Palace Museum,

322
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,260
how can you have the chance

323
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,660
to enjoy the flowers blooming tonight?

324
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,380
Go up and have a look.

325
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,140
It's so beautiful.

326
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:05,620
I've been busy with the wedding and catching the murderer.

327
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,420
But I didn't notice that

328
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,860
the old tree has already bloomed.

329
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,300
It smells so good.

330
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,260
This scene and this love

331
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,780
should be presented as a gift,

332
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,380
so that everyone can smile.

333
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:24,900
Yes.

334
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,860
It's a gift for you.

335
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,420
Thank you.

336
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:38,660
For what?

337
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,980
I, Yu Dengdeng,

338
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,460
can't keep my word.

339
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,540
Even if you want the stars in the sky,

340
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,860
I have to pick them for you.

341
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,780
But this old tree is so hard and hard.

342
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,860
Why do you want it?

343
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,580
I want to see the stars.

344
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,860
I want to see the stars.

345
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,060
I want to see the stars.

346
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,060
I want to see the stars.

347
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,060
I want to see the stars.

348
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,060
I want to see the stars.

349
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,060
I want to see the stars.

350
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,860
You don't want to do anything?

351
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,860
I don't want to do anything?

352
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,860
You're so mysterious.

353
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,660
But, Mrs. Lu,

354
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,660
I've given you the gift.

355
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:19,460
You don't have any gift back?

356
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,180
Wait a minute.

357
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,060
I'll give you the gift.

358
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,460
It's in this sedan chair.

359
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,460
Go in and have a look.

360
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,660
Isn't this the previous sedan chair?

361
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,660
Yes.

362
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:34,220
Oh my gosh.

363
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,820
What a great spot this is.

364
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,060
That's right.

365
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,660
When I was in senior high school,

366
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:41,460
I used to see displays of circle-s.

367
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,060
Every card was so ingenious

368
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,460
that it could even make your 작 calculator.

369
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,860
What do you know about this?

370
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,580
Then we could work with this.

371
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:57,660
This is this piece of art.

372
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:00,820
It must be the message

373
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,820
Go and have a look.

374
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,100
That house is where I lived when I was little.

375
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,620
This is the snowman I used to pile up when I was little.

376
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,500
This scarf was made by my mother.

377
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,460
And this carrot

378
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,660
was snatched from the mouth of the fat rabbit in my house.

379
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,820
Mother,

380
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:35,300
can you tell me another story?

381
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,660
Sure.

382
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,340
I'll forget about the day and

383
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:42,500
tell you a story about the little monkey and the little rabbit.

384
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,540
That's it.

385
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,420
It's snowing!

386
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,220
You're Deng Deng?

387
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,420
You're not here to gamble, are you?

388
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,520
My father isn't a fish stall.

389
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,020
I know.

390
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,020
Stop talking.

391
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,020
I'm just a little girl.

392
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:01,020
Father said that

393
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,420
whenever strangers came to my house,

394
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,620
they would say that my family's surname is Lin.

395
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,820
Actually, that's my mother's surname.

396
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,420
Father also said that

397
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,820
Deng Deng has grown up and needs to protect his mother.

398
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:15,220
How did you know?

399
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,220
Deng Deng,

400
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,820
Father is right.

401
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:23,820
You need to protect your mother.

402
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,820
You need to be good and don't eat too much.

403
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,820
Most importantly,

404
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:32,020
you can't say that I don't love you anymore.

405
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,820
Mother will be sad if she hears this.

406
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,020
She actually loves you the most.

407
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,220
Also, don't be naughty.

408
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,820
If Mother is in the middle of the day,

409
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,020
she'll be looking for you in the sun.

410
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,820
Mother has a leg pain problem.

411
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,420
You can't let her carry you.

412
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,420
I don't have one.

413
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,620
You need to be good and be filial to Mother.

414
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:00,020
Mother loves these few trees in front of her.

415
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,620
You can't pick them randomly.

416
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,220
You need to take good care of these flowers.

417
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,820
Do you hear me?

418
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,020
I know.

419
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,620
Are you done?

420
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,220
Deng Deng!

421
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,220
Deng Deng!

422
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,620
Mother!

423
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,020
What are you doing?

424
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,820
This sister is so weird.

425
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,020
She must be a person without a mother.

426
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,820
You child, don't talk nonsense.

427
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,220
It's so cold and you don't want to go home?

428
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,820
Miss,

429
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,020
it's snowing.

430
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,420
Why are you standing here alone?

431
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,220
You're wearing such a thin layer.

432
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,020
Look.

433
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,420
Your hands are frozen.

434
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,220
The snow is getting bigger.

435
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,420
It's getting colder.

436
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,020
Go home.

437
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,020
Your parents must be waiting for you.

438
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,020
I don't know either.

439
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,820
Why did I suddenly come here?

440
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,820
Put this on.

441
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,020
Put it on first. It'll be warmer.

442
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:20,820
Miss, what's wrong?

443
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,420
It's nothing.

444
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,820
Then hurry home.

445
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,420
Deng Deng, let's go.

446
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,820
Hurry home.

447
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,820
Wait.

448
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,820
This village is not safe.

449
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,620
Take her and leave.

450
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,820
What are you saying, Miss?

451
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,620
This is my home.

452
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,220
Do you remember what I said?

453
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,620
It's dangerous here.

454
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,020
Hurry and leave.

455
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,020
Okay. I remember.

456
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,420
Thank you, Miss.

457
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,020
Our child has grown up.

458
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,820
Just like you, she's beautiful and kind.

459
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,820
I'm satisfied.

460
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,020
Hurry home.

461
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,020
Deng Deng, let's go.

462
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,220
Deng Deng, let's go.

463
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,220
Hurry home.

464
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,220
Deng Deng, let's go.

465
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,220
Hurry home.

466
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,220
Deng Deng, let's go.

467
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,220
Hurry home.

468
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,220
Deng Deng, let's go.

469
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:40,220
Hurry home.

470
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:42,220
Deng Deng, let's go.

471
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,220
Hurry home.

472
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,220
Deng Deng, let's go.

473
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,220
Hurry home.

474
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,220
Deng Deng, let's go.

475
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,220
Hurry home.

476
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
Hurry home.

477
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,220
Hurry home.

478
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,220
Deng Deng, let's go.

479
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,220
Hurry home.

480
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,220
Deng Deng, let's go.

481
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,220
Hurry home.

482
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,220
Deng Deng, let's go.

483
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:37,220
Hurry home.

484
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,220
Deng Deng, let's go.

485
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,220
Hurry home.

486
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,220
Deng Deng, let's go.

487
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,220
Hurry home.

488
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,220
Deng Deng, let's go.

489
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,220
Hurry home.

490
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,220
Deng Deng, let's go.

491
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,940
Happy birthday.

492
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,340
What happened to my mom

493
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,200
was told to me by my dad.

494
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,220
I was a fraud when I was young.

495
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,500
I never had chance to say sorry.

496
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,920
But now I don't.

497
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,920
You've already had a dream.

498
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,360
This is already

499
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,200
a dream I haven't had in a long time.

500
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,520
Thank you,

501
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,920
Lu Yan.

502
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,280
But what should I do?

503
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:50,280
You've always been so good to me.

504
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,520
I can't leave you anymore.

505
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,000
Sir,

506
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,560
tomorrow is the night of the full moon.

507
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:01,360
After you get the Dragon Bone,

508
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,680
remember to take Yu Deng Deng out of the mountain.

509
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,640
But don't be soft-hearted.

510
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,040
So you are saying,

511
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,320
in order to win the Profound of fulfilled its commitment

512
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,280
to the state and the Russian Federation,

513
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,400
you have to put a calm heart

514
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,440
and be af Tai Hello

515
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,280
among fellow Imperial Battle Plan genders.

516
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,400
You've met Run crying,

517
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,800
have no nightmares and don't try to make shape.

518
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:29,920
No, I didn't.

519
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,720
I've met alredy your brother.

520
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:33,520
Just kidding.

521
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,440
My husband is aárias.

522
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
Yes.

523
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,640
It's time to fight.

524
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,200
All right.

525
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,960
I'll do whatever I can.

526
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,760
I don't usually go down the mountain.

527
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,920
But for you,

528
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,080
I'll sacrifice my life to accompany you.

529
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,040
Hey, keep an eye on them.

530
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,200
I'll report to Boss.

531
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,200
Okay.

532
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,880
Hey, stop!

533
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Boss.

534
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,080
Boss.

535
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,160
Did something happen to Deng Deng?

536
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
No.

537
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,400
The brothers are watching.

538
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,640
Something is strange.

539
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:30,640
I can't get it.

540
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:31,880
We should

541
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,800
ask Huang Xue Shi to check it out.

542
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,640
Okay.

543
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,240
This...

544
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,560
This...

545
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,920
This is clearly the Spirit Formation

546
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,920
used by the spirit masters.

547
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,440
Spirit Formation?

548
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,920
What if it's used on people?

549
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,120
We'll die.

550
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,400
Lu Yan is really going to ruin Deng Deng's life.

551
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,600
Master,

552
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,800
is there a way to break it?

553
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,120
To be honest,

554
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,880
if the Spirit Formation

555
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,920
is controlled by ordinary spirits,

556
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,160
there is a way to break it.

557
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,160
But this Formation

558
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,040
is made of ancient spirit ashes.

559
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,480
The one who controls it is powerful.

560
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,280
It can't be broken.

561
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,280
Even you can't?

562
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,720
I'm old and I'm too young.

563
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,320
I'm also too old to be a spirit master.

564
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:38,080
I don't want to get involved in this trouble.

565
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,880
But now,

566
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,440
there is a way to survive.

567
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,640
I can tell you.

568
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,480
Don't let that person

569
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,200
get into the formation.

570
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,520
Okay.

571
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,520
I won't force you.

572
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,400
Wang Li Shen.

573
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:57,320
Prepare a cart

574
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,240
to send Master back to the temple.

575
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,240
Yes.

576
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,800
I have something to give you.

577
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,680
Master Gu,

578
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,600
can you bring me some bullets?

579
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,560
Bullets?

580
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,200
So beautiful.

581
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,920
Yes.

582
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,040
Thank you.

583
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,000
Come again when you're done.

584
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,720
Excuse me.

585
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:32,800
Wait.

586
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,960
Gu Bei Xi, what are you doing?

587
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,000
What are you doing?

588
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
You're pretending to be a ghost.

589
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,320
I'm here to save your life.

590
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,000
What are you doing?

591
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:40,800
Wait.

592
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,280
That Lu Lian is not an ordinary person.

593
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,000
He's a spirit master.

594
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,040
Even if he's a spirit master,

595
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,080
I'll take him.

596
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:45,600
Goodbye.

597
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,760
Yu Deng Deng,

598
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,160
can you listen to me?

599
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,320
This is the bullet that

600
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,400
Master Huang Xuan gave me.

601
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:51,960
There are four bullets in total.

602
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:52,840
You have two bullets and I have two bullets.

603
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,240
If you can't bear to kill him,

604
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,000
I'll kill him.

605
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,640
Don't lie here.

606
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,880
You don't have to do my business.

607
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,360
Yu Deng Deng.

608
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,600
When did I lie to you?

609
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,540
The little

610
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,640
little thing next to him

611
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,800
has already made a ghost town

612
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,520
by the river.

613
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,480
He wants your life.

614
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,840
If there's no such thing,

615
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,760
just take it as a lie.

616
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
But think about it.

617
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,040
Then,

618
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,120
should you

619
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,360
have these money scratching your friends' parents

620
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,160
and request them to buy them?

621
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:35,760
Yes.

622
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,680
Yes.

623
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,400
Please.

624
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,520
Please.

625
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,400
不北戏.

626
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
These kind of nonsense

627
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,800
are ஒagier than yours.

628
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,160
You can't see

629
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,960
me living well for a whole day, can you?

630
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,400
Take over the price.

631
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,680
What's your problem?

632
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,440
Is the money worth it?

633
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,040
Take it.

634
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:57,240
I brought you this.

635
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:57,840
Take it.

636
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,520
What is it?

637
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,880
Red bath bomb.

638
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,720
It's crispy on the outside,

639
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,160
but it's covered with honey.

640
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:03,920
In our town,

641
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,520
we call it honey-heart loquat.

642
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,960
Whose husband eats it?

643
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,440
It's sweet and sweet.

644
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,560
It's very sincere.

645
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,320
I don't want to eat loquat.

646
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,800
You don't want to eat it now?

647
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,560
Okay.

648
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,960
Then I'll put it in my arms

649
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,080
and wrap it up.

650
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,240
It'll cool down slowly.

651
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,800
Eat it when you want to.

652
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,520
Sir,

653
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,280
Yueyuan is sending an emergency message tonight.

654
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,000
The Dragon Bone Society has used up all the loquat.

655
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,520
This is our only chance.

656
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,480
If I can say

657
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,600
love can be touched,

658
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,800
I'll say it when I miss you.

659
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,800
The most beautiful scenery

660
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,160
in my life

661
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:56,280
is all about you.

662
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,600
When two hearts are close together,

663
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,040
when the whole world is occupied by you,

664
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,840
I'll call for you with all my heart

665
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:13,800
until I can remember you.

666
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,680
You are the only one

667
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,640
who walks into the scenery.

668
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,600
This city is full of rain and thunder.

669
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,480
The clouds are about to fall.

670
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,120
I hide my heart

671
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,600
and make a decision for you.

672
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:04,560
When two hearts are close together,

673
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,040
when the whole world is occupied by you,

674
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,640
I'll call for you with all my heart

675
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,760
until I can remember you.

676
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:24,040
You are the only one

677
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,400
who walks into the scenery.

678
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,760
This city is full of rain and thunder.

679
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,760
The clouds are about to fall.

680
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:41,440
I hide my heart

681
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,840
and make a decision for you.
