1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'll stay far away from you, but I won't let you go

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Because you're not me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Because you're not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Because you're not me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Because you're not me

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Chapter 16

8
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Master, who is Lu Yan?

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Those boys, do you think he is a monster?

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Are they more scary than the trainees?

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Don't you hear her stories?

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
General Yan really is something

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Why is it that the hunting world

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
is thousands of times scarier than the forest?

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
By the way, 3000 years ago,

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
the forest tribe and humans

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
had a battle that lasted for decades.

18
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
It caused the world to be in a state of chaos

19
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
and bloodshed.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
At that time,

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
the ancient tree had a new general.

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
He used the power of one person

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
to end the war between the people.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Therefore,

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
the later forest tribe

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
called him General Yan.

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Wait.

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So,

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Lu Yan was a human?

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
No.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
To be precise,

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
he was half human and half spirit.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It is said that

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
General Yan

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
fell in love with the saint girl of the forest tribe

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and was hunted down by the forest tribe.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
General Yan was seriously injured.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
In order to save him,

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
the saint girl of the forest tribe

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
gave her her own yuan pellet.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
After she got the yuan pellet

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
of the saint girl of the forest tribe,

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
General Yan became more experienced

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
and became half human and half spirit.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
A low-ranking forest tribe like us

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
dared not disobey her.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So, she really has an old friend.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What happened to the saint girl?

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The yuan pellet

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
is the source of our spiritual energy.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The saint girl lost the yuan pellet.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
She lost her cultivation.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's good that

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
the bird was injured in the golden house

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and the spirit stone was also scattered.

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
there is a little news recently.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Three thousand years ago,

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
General Yan wanted to gather the spirit stone of the saint girl again.

60
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
He left the saint girl

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
with a spirit jade

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
in the mountain of Qingquan.

63
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He also sealed himself there.

64
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
He used the yuan pellet to feed himself

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and fed the spirit jade every day.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He suffered day and night.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
He only wanted to eat the spirit jade.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He suffered day and night.

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He only wanted the saint girl to be reborn.

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
If this is true,

71
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
then our spirit jade

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
will be reborn.

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I guess

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
she should be in the mountain of Qingquan now.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Golden

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
bird?

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Do you remember

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
you got sick

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
when you were three or four years old?

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I remember.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You told me

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
that my father caught a bird from the mountain

83
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
and ate it.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And he cured me.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Could it be

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
the spirit bird

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
that Master brought back from Qingquan

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
twenty years ago

89
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
to cook soup for you?

90
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Spirit bird?

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Master, don't do this.

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Master said

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
he only caught a bird from the mountain

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
and ate it.

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It may not be the saint girl.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Think about it.

97
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't lie to yourself.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
How can there be so many spirit birds

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
that can make people reborn?

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's not a wild chicken.

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I just said why he

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
wanted to kill me before.

103
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I see.

104
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I ate his good friend.

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No.

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
He gave us money along the way.

107
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Why?

108
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I got it.

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He used money on purpose

110
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
as a bait

111
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
to make us

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
relax and be alert.

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Boss Zhao

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Help me kill the fish.

115
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay.

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
When the lady was fishing

117
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
she took away the jewel ring

118
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
for the fish.

119
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
She was afraid that we could't use the knife

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
and hurt the ring.

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So she asked me to bring the fish to you

122
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
and help us throw the ring.

123
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Okay. Give it to me.

124
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Be careful.

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
After we relax and be alert

126
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
she threw the fish away

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
and opened my belly

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and dug out the spirit bird.

129
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's been 20 years.

130
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We've done all the digging.

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What's left?

132
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Right. It's a spirit bird.

133
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're not sure, are you?

134
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Am I too cruel?

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
There's a spirit bird?

136
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This is the specialty of our shop.

137
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Every room has it.

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Miss, have a try.

139
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
By the way, Da Hai

140
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Do you have a spirit bird in your room?

141
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What spirit bird?

142
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's from Lv's shop.

143
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Do you have a spirit bird?

144
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
No.

145
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
As expected.

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I know the smell of the spirit bird.

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's exactly the same as the one in Qingquan.

148
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Lu Yan followed us.

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He let us live in a free room

150
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
to come to Lv's shop.

151
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
What's the name of it?

152
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The name of it is the spirit bird.

153
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Lu Wang.

154
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Yes, that's what it means.

155
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Lu Yan is too evil.

156
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Da Hai

157
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
If we really follow

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
what the little spirit bird said

159
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
we're not his opponents.

160
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
We can't beat him.

161
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Then...

162
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
How about this?

163
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Da Hai, call Gu Bei Xi.

164
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let's go.

165
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Hurry up.

166
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Let's get out of here.

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Hurry up.

168
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The blood-sucking ghost is coming.

169
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Come and buy the grass.

170
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The grass is coming.

171
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The blood-sucking ghost is coming.

172
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The grass is coming.

173
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The blood-sucking ghost is coming.

174
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You two, buy the grass.

175
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Let's go.

176
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Let's go.

177
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Master.

178
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
No.

179
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Why do I feel like that little ghost is fooling us?

180
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
He's so useful.

181
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's better to take the brush than the brush.

182
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Where's Gu Bei Xi?

183
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I went to call him.

184
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
There's no one in the room.

185
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I left him a note.

186
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I said we should meet outside the city.

187
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Okay, I'll go find him first.

188
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't go find him.

189
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Gu Bei Xi is in trouble.

190
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He's fine.

191
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Besides, Lu Yan is not targeting him.

192
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The most important thing now is that you run away.

193
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll come back and win him.

194
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay, let's find the horse first.

195
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Hurry up.

196
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Where's the horse?

197
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Why is this...

198
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Horse is a protection.

199
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The horse was taken away.

200
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You...

201
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Lu Yan.

202
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You are not a man.

203
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Don't blame me for being unfaithful.

204
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You are not a man.

205
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Da Hai, can you ride a horse?

206
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'll split the time.

207
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You can.

208
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I can.

209
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Let's go.

210
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Move aside.

211
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Move aside.

212
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Move aside.

213
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm here.

214
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You've been secretly involved in so many things.

215
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You've been following me here.

216
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
What do you want?

217
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What does it have to do with you?

218
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It has nothing to do with me.

219
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
If you dare to hurt Deng Deng,

220
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'll kill you.

221
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Kill?

222
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
With this?

223
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I know you are capable.

224
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You are not afraid of guns.

225
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
But I have guns,

226
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
cannons,

227
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
and explosives.

228
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
And I have my life.

229
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Lu Yan.

230
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Listen to me.

231
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If you dare to hurt Yu Deng Deng,

232
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
even if you are a fierce tiger,

233
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and meet me,

234
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'll kill you

235
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
if I don't want my life.

236
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
If you don't believe me, try it.

237
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You can't control

238
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yu Deng Deng and me.

239
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Don't be so arrogant.

240
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'll find a way to deal with you.

241
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
We'll see.

242
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Sir.

243
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What are you talking about?

244
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
After all,

245
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
he is really caring about Deng Deng.

246
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
But we are not bad.

247
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
We've been fighting so much.

248
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Even the carriage was put there

249
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
and let him drive away.

250
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
But he still doesn't understand.

251
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I think

252
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
it's not a big deal

253
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
to keep protecting him.

254
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Let's tell him the truth.

255
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let's take him to find

256
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
the second half of the thousand-year-old subject.

257
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We can't be so hasty.

258
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
We haven't decided

259
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
whether he is Yun Xi.

260
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
If we tell him

261
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
about three thousand years ago,

262
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm afraid he won't believe it

263
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
and won't be relaxed.

264
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Sir, they are out.

265
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You dare to drive

266
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
their carriage?

267
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's not cheap.

268
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's a loss.

269
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Yes.

270
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And

271
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
he can't catch up with us

272
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
without a carriage.

273
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
He doesn't need

274
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
a horse-riding carriage.

275
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I think we should go faster.

276
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We should hurry to Ying Du.

277
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
At this rate,

278
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
we can't get to Ying Du tonight.

279
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
There is a flower town ahead.

280
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Why don't we stay for a night?

281
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Wei Chen, what are you doing?

282
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Sister,

283
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
what are you doing?

284
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Sister, you are so beautiful.

285
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Give me something to eat.

286
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I haven't eaten for days.

287
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Little devil.

288
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Hurry to eat.

289
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You are young.

290
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You have a sweet mouth.

291
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You are beautiful.

292
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm not bad.

293
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's getting dark.

294
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Tell me,

295
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
where do you live?

296
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
My home.

297
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Little devil.

298
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You were not born

299
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
when I broke into the martial arts world.

300
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Let the ancestral teacher

301
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
teach you a lesson.

302
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Don't be so rude.

303
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You are just a child.

304
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
She is leaving.

305
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Leave her alone.

306
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Stop.

307
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Good for you.

308
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I caught her.

309
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
No.

310
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I don't dare to.

311
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Get lost.

312
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'll catch you next time.

313
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Stop.

314
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Let her go.

315
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
She is the child

316
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
that no one in the mountain wants.

317
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
She is too young

318
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
to be a thief.

319
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Poor thing.

320
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If you don't lose anything,

321
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
just forgive her this time.

322
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I won't.

323
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You can't do that.

324
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I won't.

325
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I won't.

326
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I won't.

327
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I won't.

328
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I won't.

329
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Just forgive her this time.

330
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Did you lose money?

331
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I didn't lose weight.

332
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I think I did.

333
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
She is not a good girl.

334
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I have to teach her a lesson.

335
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Forget it.

336
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Since you have the money back,

337
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
just forget it.

338
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It's late.

339
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Let's go back to the Flower Town.

340
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You can't go back

341
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
to the Flower Town for a while.

342
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Did you come from the alley just now?

343
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The forest is about to start.

344
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The alley can't go any further.

345
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You have to go around the big road.

346
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's very far.

347
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Besides,

348
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
the forest is full of slaves.

349
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
If you don't know the way,

350
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
you can easily get lost in the forest.

351
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Besides,

352
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
there are beasts in the mountains.

353
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
It's scary.

354
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Master.

355
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Master.

356
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Master.

357
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Be careful.

358
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Master.

359
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Where is the thief?

360
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I think he has taken the money back.

361
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Okay.

362
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Well.

363
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Let's go.

364
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
We need to rest for a while.

365
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm so tired.

366
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Are you looking for a place to stay?

367
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Why don't you go to my hotel?

368
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's five kilometers ahead.

369
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You can rest for a night.

370
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
We can leave after the sunset tomorrow.

371
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Don't worry.

372
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm not a bad person.

373
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I just don't like the weather.

374
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So I just want to

375
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
attract guests by the roadside.

376
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Do you know

377
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
General Yan?

378
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What?

379
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Who?

380
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Mi...

381
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Mi Yu?

382
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
There should be no problem.

383
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Let's go and have a look.

384
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
No, Master.

385
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Although he doesn't know who that is,

386
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
what if he is a bad person?

387
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What if he is a bad human?

388
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Why are you afraid of him?

389
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
We are not afraid of anything.

390
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Since we are out,

391
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
we are just playing.

392
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
We are not afraid of anything.

393
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Since we are out,

394
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
we are just playing.

395
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Let's go.

396
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Please go to the main road ahead.

397
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Okay.

398
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Don't think that my hotel is simple.

399
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But the bed and the food are good.

400
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I guarantee that you will sleep comfortably.

401
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You won't wake up in the middle of the night.

402
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It's right ahead.

403
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
This is our Rose Hotel.

404
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Rose Hotel?

405
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What a strange name.

406
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's called that in the Western Regions.

407
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
So many people are staying in the hotel.

408
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The weather is bad today.

409
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Many people choose to stay in the hotel.

410
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Some people come to rest and have meals.

411
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The first floor is the restaurant.

412
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
The guest room is on the second floor.

413
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'll take you up there.

414
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Okay.

415
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Wait.

416
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I have something to tell you.

417
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I have nothing to tell you.

418
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't want to talk to you.

419
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Don't you understand?

420
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It's not safe here at night.

421
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Be careful.

422
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
He is going to do something.

423
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He is going to break my belly.

424
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
It's not safe with you here.

425
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You will be fine when you leave.

426
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Boss.

427
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Open three rooms.

428
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Okay.

429
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Don't follow me.

430
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I also want two rooms.

431
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Okay.

432
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll arrange it for you.

433
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Miss Yin.

434
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
The room is on the left.

435
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Master.

436
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I told you to come and see.

437
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Why did you stay there?

438
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Besides, it's dangerous to stay with Lu Yan.

439
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Go and check the window.

440
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Master.

441
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Why did you leave without saying anything?

442
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's dangerous to stay outside.

443
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It's better to stay here.

444
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
At least there are many people in the restaurant.

445
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He doesn't dare to do it easily.

446
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
If he really dares to do it,

447
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
we will shoot him.

448
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Master.

449
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You are so great.

450
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I admire you so much.

451
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm so sorry.

452
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What about...

453
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Master.

454
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Wait for him.

455
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I...

456
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm afraid too.

457
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Master.

458
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Let's hurry to make the pouch.

459
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Make more.

460
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Kill him.

461
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Yes.

462
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Kill him.

463
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Kill him.

464
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Is it okay, master?

465
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Almost.

466
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Let me do it.

467
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Hurry to make the pouch.

468
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Okay.

469
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Miss Yin.

470
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Your meal is ready.

471
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Please come down for dinner.

472
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Even if you want to go out,

473
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
you can't be a hungry ghost.

474
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Go.

475
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Master.

476
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Master.

477
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Master.

478
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Master.

479
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
It's okay.

480
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What's the style of you two?

481
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You don't understand.

482
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
This is the latest and most fashionable style.

483
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Yes, it was designed by my master.

484
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Boss.

485
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Why are these all vegetarian dishes?

486
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Give me two mixed ones.

487
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
What do you want?

488
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
No need.

489
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The vegetarian one is good.

490
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Okay.

491
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Master, give me a mixed one.

492
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I've been hungry all day.

493
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You have no money, right?

494
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I give you.

495
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
No need.

496
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
The boss didn't bring much money.

497
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
He even returned the money we sent.

498
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
This person is really cunning.

499
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
How about this?

500
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I'll lend you.

501
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I don't want interest.

502
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Just give me your embroidered pouch.

503
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
One hand to pay the money.

504
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
One hand to deliver the goods.

505
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Master.

506
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Isn't this pouch used to avoid evil?

507
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I was going to give it to him.

508
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Not to mention the shadow is more evil.

509
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Where do you think my pouch is?

510
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's easy to get dirty outside.

511
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
If you put it inside, others can't see it.

512
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Deng Deng.

513
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Where do you think I put it?

514
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Whatever.

515
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Then it's still a good place.

516
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'll give you a bag.

517
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'll give you a bag.

518
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Whatever.

519
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Then put it in your clothes.

520
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Little boss.

521
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Sir, do you have any orders?

522
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You go to my back door.

523
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Put my back in Deng Deng Yu's room.

524
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
What are you doing?

525
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Guarding the night.

526
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Guarding what night?

527
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Stay in your room tonight.

528
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
My room is too far from your room.

529
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm worried.

530
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's okay.

531
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'll guard the master.

532
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's okay.

533
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You're not allowed to go anywhere tonight.

534
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
By the way.

535
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Take this.

536
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
What's this?

537
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
The bodyguard the second master gave.

538
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Does the second master give work?

539
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Not necessarily.

540
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You don't believe it.

541
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You give it to me.

542
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
No.

543
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
If you don't want this, you give it back to us.

544
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
The second master gave two in total.

545
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I have one, my master has one.

546
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Then I want it.

547
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm fine.

548
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I have blood.

549
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'll take this.

550
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'll take this gift from Deng Deng.

551
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'll take it with me.

552
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I appreciate your kindness.

553
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I won't let you down.

554
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
What nonsense?

555
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
What's wrong?

556
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I won't be like someone.

557
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm fake and heartless.

558
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's right.

559
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
The forest tribe is all heartless.

560
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Where's the conscience?

561
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Enough.

562
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What's wrong?

563
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Some people dare not let others say it.

564
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I have to say it.

565
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I...

566
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What's wrong?

567
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Let him recover.

568
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
He's the one who first spoke out.

569
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Lu Yan, you're not as good as Ruo Bo.

570
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
What's the use of magic?

571
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Are you stupid?

572
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Be careful tonight.

573
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Why are you trying to annoy her, Gu Pei Xi?

574
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Can we beat him?

575
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Even if we three work together,

576
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
can we beat him?

577
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
If you're going to be that way,

578
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
stop working with us.

579
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,960
It's not a hole.

580
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,000
Master.

581
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,000
Sir,

582
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,600
should we change the position?

583
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,440
Change!

584
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,200
Master.

585
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,960
Master.

586
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,360
He's going to do it.

587
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,600
He's going to do it.

588
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,560
I'm afraid, Master.

589
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,120
It's okay.

590
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,760
He's going to do it.

591
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,840
We have Master Gu.

592
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,200
We have Aise.

593
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,320
Trust me.

594
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,480
I won't let him hurt

595
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,640
a cruel master like you.

596
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,880
Tonight,

597
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,720
you must be on the 12th place.

598
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,760
Be careful.

599
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,840
Don't worry, Master.

600
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,720
Master.

601
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:34,720
Master.

602
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,560
Master.

603
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,680
He's here.

604
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:40,480
Master.

605
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,240
Why are you hiding here?

606
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,560
Is Liu Yuan coming or not?

607
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,880
I'm so hungry.

608
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,680
You didn't eat well last night.

609
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,480
I heard that.

610
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,880
Master,

611
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,840
I'll go to Uncle Huo

612
00:23:58,840 --> 00:23:59,760
to find you some food.

613
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,480
Don't go.

614
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,400
It's dangerous.

615
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,480
It's okay.

616
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,320
It's already late.

617
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,280
He would have come if he wanted to.

618
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,280
It won't take long.

619
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,400
Besides, I have this Aise.

620
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,280
I have the Amulet.

621
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,000
It's okay. Wait here.

622
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,680
I'll hold it.

623
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,760
No need. Wait here.

624
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,720
Why are you here?

625
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,760
I'm afraid

626
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,360
you'll be attacked

627
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,400
by Luo Yuan.

628
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
Well,

629
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,440
I'll go to get some food.

630
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,120
Do you want some?

631
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,840
I'll have some.

632
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,080
You didn't eat well.

633
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,240
Okay. Wait for me.

634
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,120
Come in.

635
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,560
Don't stay outside.

636
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,760
Go back after you finish your meal.

637
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,360
It's so quiet

638
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,400
in the middle of the night.

639
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,160
Absolutely incredible.

640
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,920
That's the case.

641
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,360
What's going on?

642
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,920
Six,

643
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
two,

644
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,760
Three.

645
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,880
I've never seen this kid before.

646
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,640
Two.

647
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,840
Kid,

648
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,320
you didn't sleep at night.

649
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,320
Where are your parents?

650
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,040
My parents are out.

651
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,520
Isn't this Grandpa's embroidered?

652
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,400
Where did you get it?

653
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:57,600
Okay, okay, okay.

654
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,200
Don't cry.

655
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,440
I'll pay you back.

656
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,520
Tell me the truth.

657
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,240
Where did you get this?

658
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,680
Did an old man with a beard give it to you?

659
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,440
No.

660
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,000
It was brought back from the ghost market

661
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,280
to play with us.

662
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,400
Ghost market?

663
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,080
Look.

664
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,120
There's a very good thing in each.

665
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,920
I'll exchange this bag for your bag.

666
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:18,440
Okay?

667
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,120
Right.

668
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,200
No.

669
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,080
No, no, no.

670
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,320
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

671
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,960
What the hell is going on?

672
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,560
I can't explain it in a few words.

673
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,320
Anyway,

674
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,200
it's a place where you can freely enter and leave the spirit world,

675
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,520
but ordinary people can't get in.

676
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,960
So,

677
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,240
Dai Dai is not a human anymore?

678
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,560
How did your father get in?

679
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,120
Didn't you say he was in the capital?

680
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,560
My father is Xu Yun.

681
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,760
He's a man of the spirit world.

682
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,920
He's a man of the spirit world.

683
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,000
He's a man of the spirit world.

684
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,120
He's a man of the spirit world.

685
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
He's a man of the spirit world.

686
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,960
My father is a hunter.

687
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,120
He must have a way to get in.

688
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,360
Besides,

689
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,920
he's been missing for a while.

690
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,320
Maybe he stayed in India for a while

691
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,360
and went to the ghost market.

692
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,880
We have to go to the ghost market to check it out.

693
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,400
No.

694
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,080
The point is,

695
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,840
we don't know how to get into the ghost market.

696
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,880
What's going on?

697
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,120
Nothing.

698
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:21,960
What's going on?

699
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,080
You bastard!

700
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,280
Let me go if you dare!

701
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,800
We'll fight you!

702
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,280
How dare you act so rudely in front of me?

703
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,560
I'll teach you a lesson today.

704
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
You bastard!

705
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,280
I can't stand you!

706
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,400
Let's drive off the monster's hunter.

707
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,520
Don't worry about that.

708
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,040
Let's get out of here.

709
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,000
You bastard!

710
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,280
Oh, no,

711
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,520
I forgot to bring a gun.

712
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,760
Look who's coming.

713
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,080
Why are you here all of a sudden?

714
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,040
We're endangering him.

715
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,120
Master, what should we do?

716
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
Stop!

717
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,440
Monster hammer! Monster hammer!

718
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,600
Monster hammer! Monster hammer!

719
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,960
Monster hammer! Monster hammer!

720
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,440
Monster hammer! Monster hammer!

721
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,840
Monster hammer!

722
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,640
Monster hammer!

723
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,240
I knew it. I knew you were being fooled.

724
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,280
It's useless to be a coward.

725
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,920
Don't come over.

726
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,960
I know I owe you a life.

727
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,240
But they don't have one.

728
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,000
Let them go.

729
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,360
Kill them or kill them.

730
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,360
I'm not trying to hurt you.

731
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,120
This...

732
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,920
This...

733
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,160
What did you do to this place?

734
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,280
I didn't do anything to this place.

735
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,800
It's that shopkeeper.

736
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,040
She's a spirit.

737
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,240
She used magic to disguise this abandoned house

738
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
into a ghost house.

739
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
She's a spirit.

740
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
She's a spirit.

741
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240
She's a spirit.

742
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,920
She disguised this abandoned house

743
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,920
into a ghost house.

744
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,040
She would pull customers from the side of the mountain

745
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,840
and steal money from the guests

746
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:05,840
in the night.

747
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,840
Then you guys just ate and drank.

748
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,840
She saw that my power was not enough.

749
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,240
So she increased the amount of the ghost house.

750
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,440
The ghost house was too haunted

751
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,040
and couldn't wake up.

752
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,040
Maybe it's because you have

753
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,240
the second master's amulet

754
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,840
that she escaped.

755
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,440
What does your family

756
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,840
have to do with us?

757
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,240
Now,

758
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,040
the people in the inn are in a coma.

759
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,240
I can't help it.

760
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,640
So I hope you can go to the ghost house

761
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,840
with me

762
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,040
and find something to wake them up.

763
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,240
You're so strong.

764
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,240
You can do anything you want.

765
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,240
But I'll give you trouble.

766
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
Am I right?

767
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,440
You have to be by her side for this trip.

768
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,440
Don't listen to her.

769
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,440
Be careful of the traps.

770
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,440
Why?

771
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,240
You can just go with your men.

772
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,440
A Xin and the others

773
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,440
need to stay here

774
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,440
to guard the spirits

775
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,840
and the guests who passed out in the inn.

776
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,240
If you stay here

777
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,240
and there's an accident,

778
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,640
you can't protect yourself.

779
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,240
Put this in the room.

780
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
Take it.

781
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,240
You can feel better with it.

782
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,740
Thanks.

783
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,240
Don't worry.

784
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,040
If you want to kill me,

785
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,040
I won't hide.

786
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,040
She lied to you again.

787
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,240
I'm a rougher gun than you.

788
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,840
I can't hold her down.

789
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,040
I can't even shoot one of her hairs.

790
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,840
How can it be possible?

791
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:55,840
You liar.

792
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,240
There's no truth in your mouth.

793
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,880
No.

794
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,040
I can't let him stay here.

795
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:00,920
Otherwise,

796
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,600
you go to the ghost house alone.

797
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,800
We can't go.

798
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,200
He must have a reason.

799
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,600
I know.

800
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,200
Why do we have to go?

801
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,800
We were going to

802
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,040
the ghost house to find my father.

803
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,160
Now someone is leading us.

804
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,480
We still have time to investigate.

805
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,280
Isn't it better?

806
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:20,840
But...

807
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,960
You're a man.

808
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,240
Why are you so angry?

809
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,240
When we get to the ghost house,

810
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,080
we'll sneak away

811
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,720
and find my father.

812
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,480
I want to see

813
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,640
how he is doing

814
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,760
in front of the world's

815
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,400
first ghost hunter.

816
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,640
I've already checked.

817
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,040
The closest ghost house

818
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,720
is in Qianhe Town.

819
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,240
You stay here.

820
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,000
Keep an eye on the guests.

821
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,400
I'll be back soon.

822
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,440
Sir.

823
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,640
You can go alone

824
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,760
with the boss.

825
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,840
It's enough.

826
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,640
Now we need to take

827
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,840
Gu Beixi and Pang Dahai.

828
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,960
If the ghost family of the ghost house

829
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,680
finds out,

830
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,920
it'll be a big mess.

831
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,000
You can go alone.

832
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,360
It's faster.

833
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,640
There have been ghost families

834
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,400
attacking Yu Dengdeng

835
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,600
over and over again.

836
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,960
I haven't figured out

837
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
what the plot of

838
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,360
the black hand behind the curtain is.

839
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,760
So I can't leave him here.

840
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,240
Besides,

841
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,200
after these days of contact,

842
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,240
I found that Yu Dengdeng

843
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,560
still has some resistance to the ghost family.

844
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,320
Why don't we take this opportunity

845
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,560
to take him to the ghost house

846
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,360
and experience the life of the ghost family?

847
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,040
Maybe we can change

848
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,480
his view of the ghost family.

849
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,600
Isn't this Qianhe Town?

850
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,640
Where is the ghost house?

851
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,080
Let's go.

852
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,120
Go.

853
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,480
Go.

854
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,700
Jamie,

855
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:18,580
you are so helpful.

856
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,820
Thanks.

857
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:24,740
Look!

858
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:30,460
Look up there!

859
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,860
How incredible!

860
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,740
Look at that!

861
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,840
Your ears...

862
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,920
Master, you have ears too.

863
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,040
I have ears too?

864
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,240
You two are so ugly.

865
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,840
You did it, right?

866
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,360
This is where the Spirit Clan lives.

867
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,120
If you dress up like the Spirit Clan,

868
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,560
you won't attract their attention

869
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,680
to avoid trouble.

870
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:16,840
You're right.

871
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,360
Why don't you change yourself?

872
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:21,800
Let's go.

873
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,640
Here's your food!

874
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,320
Wow!

875
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,320
Here's your food!

876
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,040
Wow!

877
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:29,160
Master.

878
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,120
Here's the food from the 10-year Yuan Neng.

879
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,040
What's this?

880
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,480
Isn't this the boss

881
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,440
in Qianhe Town?

882
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,760
Have a bite.

883
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,840
And the mother and daughter.

884
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,320
Okay.

885
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,400
Say hello to your sister.

886
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,480
Here's your food!

887
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,080
But this isn't Qianhe Town.

888
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,240
The Ghost City is a place for the Spirit Clan.

889
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,720
Only the Spirit Clan can open the entrance

890
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,440
of the Ghost City with Yuan Neng.

891
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,720
Qianhe Town is one of them.

892
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,360
What's the Spirit Clan's secret?

893
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,160
It's a place for the Spirit Clan

894
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,000
to open the door with Yuan Neng

895
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,320
to avoid humans.

896
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,000
Did you hear that?

897
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,160
Did you hear that?

898
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:06,760
What's there to understand?

899
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,440
I see.

900
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,240
You can understand that

901
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,280
this place is for the Spirit Clan

902
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,320
to trade and have fun.

903
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,560
For example, the one you just saw,

904
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,000
when he was in Qianhe Town,

905
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,480
he sold ordinary meat buns

906
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,640
in the shape of a human.

907
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,880
And here,

908
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,800
he sold food that could enhance Yuan Neng's power.

909
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,160
We made money together.

910
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,120
Isn't he rich now?

911
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,640
The food of the Spirit Clan is very rare.

912
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,040
So the Spirit Clan needs to work harder

913
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,960
to make money.

914
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,600
Don't you guys

915
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,960
just grab it

916
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,280
or kill it?

917
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,000
Are you okay?

918
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,680
Are you okay?

919
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,200
Yes.

920
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,640
Don't humans

921
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,840
have their own

922
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,120
evil and evil ways?

923
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,760
But most of the humans

924
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,400
are kind and simple people.

925
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,880
The same goes for the Spirit Clan.

926
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,240
Although they have some bad intentions,

927
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,840
most of the Spirit Clan

928
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,480
are kind and simple people

929
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,080
who work hard to make a living.

930
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,640
So apart from their origin,

931
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,960
there's no difference between humans and the Spirit Clan.

932
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,120
Really?

933
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,960
I'm not sure.

934
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,000
I don't believe

935
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,840
what good things the Spirit Clan can use.

936
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,640
Good!

937
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,360
Good!

938
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,080
It's okay.

939
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,720
It's okay.

940
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,120
It's okay.

941
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,200
It's okay.

942
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,480
You're so good at dancing.

943
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,280
So beautiful.

944
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:46,920
This should be

945
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:49,120
the flower basket of the flower house on the street.

946
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,160
Master Gu,

947
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,240
are you not giving him money?

948
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:52,680
Why aren't you giving him money?

949
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,680
I'm a beggar wearing a school uniform.

950
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,200
I'm a poor man in white.

951
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,280
So beautiful.

952
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,120
If Deng Deng likes it,

953
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,920
I'll give him more money.

954
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,200
Okay.

955
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Okay.

956
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,720
What are you doing?

957
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,240
What's wrong?

958
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,240
This...

959
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:13,600
This...

960
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:14,360
This...

961
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,440
It's okay.

962
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,000
This...

963
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:19,520
Wait.

964
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:33,720
See you again.

965
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,000
See you again.

966
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,040
See you again.

967
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:42,560
I don't want to find my dream.

968
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,800
Most of the Spirit Clan

969
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,840
are kind and hardworking.

970
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,800
So, apart from their origin,

971
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,000
there's no other difference between them.

972
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,440
See you again.

973
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,280
See you again.

974
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,240
See you again.

975
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,800
See you again.

976
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,480
See you again.

977
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,640
See you again.

978
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,840
See you again.

979
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,760
See you again.

980
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,960
See you again.

981
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,800
See you again.

982
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,880
See you again.

983
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,880
Here, this is for you.

984
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,760
A book of the Spirit Clan.

985
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,480
Take a look.

986
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,280
See you again.

987
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,680
See you again.

988
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,640
See you again.

989
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,600
See you again.

990
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,320
See you again.

991
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,960
See you again.

992
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,720
See you again.

993
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,600
See you again.

994
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:26,840
In fact, the Spirit Clan

995
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,680
mainly eats two kinds of food.

996
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,560
One is the food of human,

997
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,760
which is used to protect the flesh.

998
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,920
The other one is the food

999
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,680
which can improve the energy of the spirit.

1000
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,280
General Yan.

1001
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,120
The violent and violent,

1002
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,680
the blood of the enemy,

1003
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:52,980
the eight-pickled

1004
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,040
In fact, we have another kind of food.

1005
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,680
We can also add the energy of the spirit

1006
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,640
to the food that the Spirit Clan likes.

1007
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,720
In this way, the food can be delicious

1008
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,120
and improve the energy of the spirit.

1009
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,360
What's wrong with you again?

1010
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,280
I'm not going to be a fool.

1011
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,240
What's wrong with you?

1012
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:10,440
Nothing.

1013
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,800
God bless me.

1014
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,760
God bless me to meet my father

1015
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,080
when I'm alive.

1016
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,160
When I find my father,

1017
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,680
I'll let him take this damn spirit.

1018
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,120
I'm sorry.

1019
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,000
