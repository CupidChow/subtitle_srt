174
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,280
What's up?

175
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,270
How…How could you suddenly appear? It's scary.

176
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,300
Or do you want me

177
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,470
to go back?

178
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:46,710
Wait a minute.

179
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,420
Were you in the interrogation room just now?

180
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,220
When did you get there?

181
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,270
How did you help me?

182
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,080
You asked me so many questions at once.

183
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,880
Which one should I answer first?

184
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:55,780
Was it hard

185
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,960
to help me?

186
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,170
Actually, it was not hard.

187
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,810
You can learn it by yourself.

188
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,750
Me?

189
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,650
Are you kidding me? How is that possible?

190
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,930
You absorbed Yun Xi's spirit

191
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,410
and you were nourished with the energy core for many years,

192
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,910
so there is energy in your body.

193
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,540
As long as you find the right way,

194
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,660
you can also use some simple magic.

195
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,300
Come on.

196
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,660
Give me your hand.

197
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,140
This is the energy

198
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,500
in your body.

199
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,610
I just got it out for you.

200
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,060
A…Amazing!

201
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,220
Teach me!

202
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,300
You've promised me

203
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,070
that if I help you, you'll pay me back 10 times.

204
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,730
This is the rule you set for me.

205
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,980
So when you

206
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,580
give me today's reward,

207
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,000
I'll consider

208
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,430
if I should teach you other kinds of magic.

209
00:09:58,430 --> 00:09:59,300
Goodbye.

210
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,190
Lu Yan.

211
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,390
You're petty.

212
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,550
General Yan?

213
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:14,890
What a petty man!

214
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,050
Ms. Yu, here we are.

215
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:31,730
Please.

216
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:36,710
Please.

217
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,870
How much have the Bais earned?

218
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,290
No wonder my father arranged a marriage with them before.

219
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,390
He's such a sly old fox.

220
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,570
Ms. Yu, this way, please.

221
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:20,750
Ms. Yu, this way.

222
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,060
Please.

223
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,350
Ms. Yu.

224
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,400
You'll be living here for a while.

225
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,320
Thank you.

226
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,030
Who are they?

227
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,320
Master said

228
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,120
these servants will protect you.

229
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,220
When you leave the house,

230
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,020
they'll follow and protect you.

231
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:48,080
Got it.

232
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,740
Alright.

233
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:50,290
Ms. Yu, good night.

234
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:42,810
The sly old fox

235
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,740
overestimated me.

236
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,590
He laid siege to me like this.

237
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:49,480
Even if I have wings, it's hard to fly out.

238
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,530
Lu Yan. Lu Yan.

239
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,530
What's up?

240
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,360
You're still awake?

241
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:13,580
Yep.

242
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,540
Thank you for the help today.

243
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,250
You sent someone to follow me before.

244
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,710
I'll no longer be angry about that.

245
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,340
I'm a woman of my word.

246
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,340
As long as you help me, I'll pay you back 10 times.

247
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,940
Tell me. What do you want?

248
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,490
I want to see you.

249
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:29,280
You can do it anytime.

250
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,510
You know what?

251
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,760
There's only one chance.

252
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,890
You need to seize it.

253
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,120
Tell me what you want.

254
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,050
I'm willing to do anything for you.

255
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,960
I want to see you 10 times.

256
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:41,400
Stop it.

257
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,370
Why are you even naughtier than me?

258
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,180
You're out of your mind today.

259
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,890
Let's talk about it another day.

260
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:46,950
It's time to sleep.

261
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,210
Is he still the one that I used to know?

262
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,590
How did he become so proactive?

263
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,260
Looks like

264
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,980
no one can resist

265
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,170
falling under my spell.

266
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,610
Lady.

267
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,900
Lady.

268
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,610
Guess what I've found

269
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,030
in the yard just now.

270
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,350
What did you find?

271
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,430
Just now

272
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:22,370
when I was feeding the last concubine's calico cat,

273
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:25,090
someone suddenly threw it over the wall.

274
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,060
Look.

275
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,350
[Kaitong Ingot]

276
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,330
Did you see the person who threw it?

277
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,460
No.

278
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,030
Anyway, I guess

279
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,430
it's a man.

280
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,890
How did you know?

281
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,150
That's what it says in every script.

282
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,080
Over the wall and on the horse.

283
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,330
Pass it in secret.

284
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:50,880
Promise to get married.

285
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:53,890
I guess it's for the last concubine.

286
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,800
Stop talking nonsense.

287
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,130
If someone hears you,

288
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,390
there will be trouble.

289
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,690
Zip your lip.

290
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,000
Now it's mine.

291
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,940
Don't tell anyone. Did you hear me?

292
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,750
Yes.

293
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:17,080
Well, lady,

294
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,500
today a girl moved

295
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,390
into Master's Western Garden.

296
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:24,800
Master even sent people to guard the Western Garden

297
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,110
as if he was afraid that the girl would run away.

298
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:29,480
The last concubine went missing not long ago.

299
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,980
Is my father going to marry a new woman?

300
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,120
No, he isn't.

301
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,320
She's one of the wanted people.

302
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,680
Is my father home?

303
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:41,940
Yes.

304
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,070
I'll go meet him.

305
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,380
Didn't I tell you to leave me alone?

306
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,190
Get out!

307
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,990
How many times has the doctor said

308
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,720
smoking is bad for your health?

309
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,550
Why can't you keep it in mind?

310
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,920
Well, I'm your father

311
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,270
instead of your son.

312
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:09,010
Is it right for you to scold me like this?

313
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,320
Is it right? Is it right?

314
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,750
Mung bean soup for you.

315
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,150
Good girl.

316
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:26,960
Father.

317
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,070
I heard

318
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:30,580
that you brought a wanted woman home.

319
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,840
Her name is probably

320
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,340
something like Yu Deng.

321
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,620
She's got something.

322
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,250
She said all the recent troubles

323
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,130
were caused by the spirit clan,

324
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,420
so I gave her a chance

325
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:43,920
to save her accomplice

326
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,410
and prove her ability.

327
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,660
Her accomplice was also arrested?

328
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,020
We only caught one accomplice.

329
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,220
There's another one.

330
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,470
You're a lady. Why are you asking me about this?

331
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,050
It's a jinx, right?

332
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,130
Alright.

333
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,580
Shiqi.

334
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,970
I heard

335
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:07,630
that you met a male classmate recently.

336
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,280
Did Wan Quan snitch on me again?

337
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,990
It doesn't matter who told me.

338
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,829
Anyway, I spent money sending you to a girls' school.

339
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,740
All the teachers at the school

340
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,030
are women.

341
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:21,280
How could you get a male classmate?

342
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:22,460
How did you know him?

343
00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:24,630
He…

344
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:27,510
Father, he's the older brother of my classmate.

When we studied in the provincial capital,

346
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,110
I hanged out

347
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:32,810
with him once.

348
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,150
Now he's in Yingdu.

349
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,400
When I see him, I should say hi to him,

350
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,460
right?

351
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,510
Really?

352
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,320
OK. I believe you.

353
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,770
I believe you will never lie to me, right?

354
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,180
But remember

355
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,180
that there's an arranged marriage

356
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,720
between us and the Gus of Nanfeng Stronghold.

357

Although they are

358
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,710
really unreasonable

359
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:55,520
and they never reply to us,

360
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,800
we

361
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,900
can't break our promise.

Don't bring shame on me. Am I clear?

365
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,930
I know, father.

366
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,150
I'm OK as long as you approve of this marriage.

367

Later

I'll ask Mr. Gu's son to come here

375
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,280
and marry you. OK?

How to treat him?

381
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,030
Beat him.

382
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,020
Hang him up and beat him.

383

A lot of men want to marry you.

387
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,360
But what he did?

388
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:53,520
He never replied

389
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,860
to the letters about your wedding.

390
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,060
What was he thinking?

391
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:58,880
I'll tug at his ear, telling him

392
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,530
I can give him anything

393
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
only if

394
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,940
he treats my daughter well. Right?

395
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,190
If he dares to treat you badly,

you should dress up when you go out

It's no use for you to disagree.

687

I've already reported to Chief Bai.

I hope he can help me

General Yan,

691
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:40,210
I know you're worried about me.

692
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,150
But I am at least

693

the Chief of Qingquan Stronghold.

694
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,640
I have Kung-fu and I'm equipped with weapons.

695
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,470
And then there's the hair pin you gave me.

696
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,350
So, you really don't have to stick with me all the time.

697
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,670
Until I get him,

698
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,290
everything must be on my terms.

How can you be so unreasonable?

And

702
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,580
as soon as you arrived, you said that you and I were a couple.

703
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:58,500
What couple?

704
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:59,790
Are you and I a couple?

00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:01,350
You're just a heroic husband.

706

Have you ever considered my honor and chastity?

707
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,610
Then when you took me back to Qingquan Stronghold,

708
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:11,010
did you think about my honor and chastity?

709
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,610
I'm not going to talk to you about this.

Not leaving? Okay.

I'll stay somewhere else.

it won't work so well.

Are you threatening me?

716
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:27,580

I don't like people touching me.

[The Bai Mansion]

00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,840
I've checked several places

760
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,050
where missing persons disappeared

761
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:23,050
and found some suspicious guys.

762
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,560
The guys you bring back

763
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,170
are spirit clansmen with the attribute of combining species.

764
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:28,830
Their energy is extremely low

765
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,280
and they are unable to revert to the spirit clansmen

766
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,480
or human appearance.

767
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:33,610
If so,

768
00:36:33,830 --> 00:36:36,310
the last concubine may also be a member of the spirit clan.

769
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:37,040
Do you think

770

771

Spirit clansmen and humans have been living together for a long time.

772
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,610
I heard Xin say

773
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,740
examples of marriage between a spirit clansman and a human

774
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,600
are quite a lot.

775
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:46,900
But

776
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,660
the spirit clan are, after all, aliens in the nine continents.

777

But why on earth do they

781
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,890
become like this today?

It doesn't look like she was attacked by an external force.

785
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,600
It was more like some kind of change

786
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,900
has occurred from the inside.

787
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,090
If the last concubine is a spirit clansman.

788
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:20,020
Then she

789
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,210
should have some kind of attribute.

Let's go check her room.

791

It is unexpected that the last concubine

792
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:43,550
is still a childlike woman.
