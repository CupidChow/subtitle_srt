I hate the Spirit Clan,

In Zhu Rong's formation,

00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,050
your strength will be weakened.

If it goes on like this,

00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,880
I will become a burden to you.

156

If we delay breaking the formation,

Don't worry.

159
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:00,790
I think

160
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,020
I'll find the center of the formation soon.

161
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,020
But I'm too familiar with this city.

162
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,000
When I walked all the way here,

163
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,660
there was no mark of the center of the formation.

164
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,660
It's not that there's no center of the formation.

165
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,230
It's just that while we're inside the formation,

166
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,830
it's hard for us to detect it.

167
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,070
The energy that Zhu Rong is using now

168
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,470
is Yu Dengdeng's energy.

169
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,370
I added the soul-tracing technique

170
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,790
to Yu Dengdeng's energy.

171
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,150
This mark

172
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,660
has been integrated into Zhu Rong's energy.

173
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:29,030
So if the energy, which keeps the formation working,

174
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,470
flows to a certain position,

175
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,440
the center of the formation will be right there.

176
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,640
Accordingly, Zhu Rong will be exposed.

177
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:37,890
You really care about your subordinate so much.

178
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,160
General Lu.

179
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,310
I have good news for you.

180
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:44,320
Your wife has returned to the city.

181
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,190
Today, I just want to see

182
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,800
how many people you can save.

183
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,110
How's packing going?

184
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,190
It's almost finished.

185
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:56,950
Dengdeng.

186
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:57,930
Dengdeng!

187
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,800
-Dengdeng. -Dengdeng.

188
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:01,380
Let's go home!

189
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:11,990
Oh no.

190
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:12,990
Where is she?

191
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:15,230
Where is Dengdeng?

192
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:16,370
Where is my master?

193
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,550
Gu Beixi must have taken her away.

194
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,380
Stop yelling.

195
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,380
This... This...

196
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,120
You... Go out and look for her.

197
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,140
The two of us go to the entrance of the village.

198
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,980
You wait here.

199
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:24,760
Let's go.

200
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:25,610
You must find her.

201
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,670
Don't come back if you can't find her.

202
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,290
General.

203
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,110
I'm very familiar with this place.

204
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,460
I did something bad

205
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,940
to her family and it's irreparable.

206
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,290
Please allow me to look for Ms. Yu

207
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,040
to atone for my sin.

208
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,870
Okay.

209
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,610
I'll entrust this task to you.

210
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:53,390
Okay.

211
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,290
But remember

212
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,130
to stay safe.

213
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,050
General.

214
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,600
You should be careful, too.

215
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,630
Zhu Rong.

216
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,790
As long as you repair the formation,

217
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,930
I can find your hideout.

218
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,510
Lu Yan.

219
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,060
You really know how to surprise me.

220
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,280
I didn't expect you, the respectable General Yan,

221
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,280
to play tricks with me.

222
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,840
You want to lure me to fight

223
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,170
so that you can find out where the center of the formation is.

224
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,580
In that case,

225
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,540
let's lay our cards on the table.

226
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,970
Let's play the game in another way.

227
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,050
Now,

228
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,000
if you still fail to find the center of the formation,

229
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,960
everyone will die.

230
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,100
These useless men!

231
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,610
They can't even find her.

232
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,780
We're back.

233
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,140
How is it?

234
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:05,180
Where is she?

235
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,590
The breach of the cliff is still there.

236
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,450
No one is there.

237
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,350
I guess she went in early in the morning.

238
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,130
Gu Beixi must have helped her.

239
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,720
Don't blame him or anybody else.

240
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,470
Don't you know what kind of person your daughter is?

241
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,780
Yes. If Chieftain Gu is with her,

242
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,100
my master can be safer. Right?

243
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:17,730
No!

244
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,710
Just the two of them.

245
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,660
One is an ordinary human with flesh,

246
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,050
and the other is without any energy.

247
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:21,900
What should they do

248
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,150
if they come across Zhu Rong?

249
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,430
Something bad might happen!

250
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,310
Well...

251
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,550
Chieftain Yu.

252
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,850
Chieftain Yu. Second-in-command.

253
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,380
Bad news!

254
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,430
Come out and take a look.

255
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,540
What's going on?

256
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,070
Look.

257
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,130
Zhu Rong is going to kill people.

258
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,380
Tell everyone to run.

259
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:39,950
Let's go!

260
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:40,940
-Go. -Go.

261
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,180
Lu Yan.

262
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,390
Do you like the gift I gave you?

263
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,170
I don't need to kill them myself,

264
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,069
and those insignificant people will offer their lives to me.

265
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,329
The longer you delay,

266
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:13,060
the more people will die because of you.

267
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,650
That's right.

268
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,410
If you want to break the formation,

269
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:39,640
kill me first.

270
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,300
Xin, Second-in-command's legs are not good.

271
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,620
You take him to leave first.

272
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,500
Nonsense!

273
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,070
Who has bad legs?

274
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,750
I'll go wherever you go.

275
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:52,110
Dengdeng is also my daughter.

276
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,970
Old chieftain.

277
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,700
His Lordship and Her Ladyship are still inside.

278
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,370
I know.

279
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,950
Didn't Second-in-command say

280
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,400
Dengdeng is also his daughter?

281
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,870
I'll save her. Okay?

282
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,130
Don't worry.

283
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,570
Take the Second-in-command to leave. Go!

284
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:05,730
Old chieftain.

285
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,410
Please save His Lordship and Her Ladyship!

286
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,220
You...

287
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,070
Get up.

288
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,290
Hurry up.

289
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:13,790
Second-in-command.

290
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,430
Okay. You can go back.

291
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,360
I'll escort you.

292
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,360
Don't worry.

293
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,110
How many years have we been together?

294
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,360
Whenever there was a big difficulty,

295
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,350
didn't we manage to overcome it every time?

296
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,430
Aren't we safe and sound?

297
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,190
Second-in-command, please leave.

298
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:22,870
Let go of me!

299
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,190
Second-in-command.

300
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,790
[Tea]

301
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:47,270
Come on, guys! It's her!

302
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:52,840
How is it?

303
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,760
I've searched the two streets and the three alleys in the west.

304
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,960
I can't find the weird place you mentioned.

305
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,620
I've also searched the several streets nearby.

306
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,190
The center of the formation is not there, either.

307
00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:03,850
Did we search the wrong place?

308
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,740
Impossible.

309
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,550
The center of the formation must be in the city.

310
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:09,080
But we haven't found it yet.

311
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,920
How about this?

312
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,080
Let's split up to look for it later.

313
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,590
I'll go to the south of the city, while you'll go to the north.

314
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,570
Dengdeng.

315
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,800
Don't you think

316
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,330
since we came here,

317
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,600
it's been getting hotter.

318
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,720
I don't feel hot.

319
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,150
If you feel hot,

320
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,490
take off your clothes.

321
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:32,880
Dengdeng.

322
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,310
I feel so hot.

323
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,910
Gu Beixi, although we are buddies,

324
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,500
and you don't treat me as a woman,

325
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:40,940
you...

326
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,310
you should still treat me with courtesy as a normal friend.

327
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:46,370
Dengdeng, I feel so hot.

328
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,140
I want to hug you.

329
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,640
Hug you.

330
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,470
Hug...

331
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,410
Gu Beixi.

332
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,040
What are you doing?

333
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,710
Hug me.

334
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,310
No.

335
00:19:57,390 --> 00:19:59,590
Gu Beixi, do you want to be beaten again?

336
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,440
Control yourself.

337
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,580
What are you doing? What's wrong with you?

338
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,430
Hug me.

339
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,380
Hug you.

340
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:21,630
Well, what did you do to me?

341
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,110
What did I do to you?

342
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,510
Why don't you ask what you did to me?

343
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,890
What did I do?

344
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:30,090
You were affected by the Hallucination Formation,

345
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,280
and hallucinated.

346
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,530
You were crazy for a while just now.

347
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,570
But don't worry.

348
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,840
I've cured you.

349
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,630
Then did I...

350
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,350
Yes.

351
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,130
Just now you promised me

352
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,790
to send 1,000 dan of grains and 50 jin of pork

353
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,260
to our Qingquan Stronghold every year.

354
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,030
I said no,

355
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,390
but you insisted on giving them to me.

356
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:47,520
I couldn't stop you.

357
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:49,450
Are you trying to trick me again?

358
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,250
You've become smarter.

359
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,190
Get down to business.

360
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:00,240
Did you hear anything?

361
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:02,850
No, I didn't.

362
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,370
The center of formation.

363
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,030
It's giving me a hint about the direction of the formation center.

364
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,810
In the underground palace.

365
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,540
What the heck is this place?

366
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,140
The secret room of the Ancient Shu's palace.

367
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:46,430
Be careful.

368
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:49,210
There are some strange vines at the entrance

369
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,550
which are called Ghost Vines.

370
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,580
If we offend them,

371
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,540
we'll suffer a lot.

372
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,630
There are some contraptions outside.

373
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,090
We need to find a Buddhist Gate to get inside.

374
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,350
[The State of Shu]

375
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,090
Let's go.

376
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,730
Thanks, bro.

377
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,130
You're welcome.

378
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,630
It's you.

379
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:55,790
Yes.

380
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,920
Our general saved me.

381
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,920
I'm not dead.

382
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,110
He saved you once,

383
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,360
but I can kill you again.

384
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,480
I should die to atone for my sin of killing them.

385
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,570
You can take my life anytime.

386
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,350
But you're in danger now.

387
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:16,010
There are Ghost Vines everywhere outside.

388
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,670
I'm familiar with this place.

389
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,120
I can take you away.

390
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,280
Cut the crap.

391
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:22,470
Dengdeng, kill him!

392
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:26,640
Why?

393
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,270
On what grounds?

394
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,550
On what grounds could you do that?

395
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,280
It was my fault.

396
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:38,550
I can't argue or refute it.

397
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,340
Now I just want you two to come with me first.

398
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,690
After you leave the underground palace,

399
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,170
then please kill me

400
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,030
to take revenge for your mother.

401
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,030
I don't need you to tell us that!

402
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:55,250
Our general

403
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,630
saved me many times on the battlefield.

404
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,790
For our general,

405
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,630
I've been struggling to stay alive dishonorably and stubbornly for 3,000 years.

406
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:10,310
I also made a severe and irreparable mistake.

407
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,040
I was born to protect people,

408
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,190
but now I bear the sin as a murderer.

409
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:21,870
I've just realized my own mistakes.

410
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,690
I have nothing left to live for.

411
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,070
However,

412
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:30,860
there's a savior of mine whom I care about.

413
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,420
My savior also has someone he cares about.

414
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,530
Saving you is saving the general.

415
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:42,290
The general is still fighting bitterly with Zhu Rong outside.

416
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,500
If you die,

417
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,510
for him,

418
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,890
everything will be meaningless in the world.

419
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,000
Gu Beixi.

420
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,780
Let's go forward.

421
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,180
Ms. Yu.

422
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,390
Don't follow me.

423
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,630
When I see you next time,

424
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,350
I will kill you.

425
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,460
We've been here before.

426
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,190
I've also been to this underground palace before.

427
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,470
The corridor is full of twists and turns.

428
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,730
It's like a rat's nest.

429
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,360
But it's not that deep.

430
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,160
Are we confused with the direction by a ghost?

431
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,310
There are not so many ghosts or monsters.

432
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,300
If you've never read any ancient book before,

433
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:05,310
you must have heard of story-telling scripts, huh?

434
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:07,440
These are people from the Spirit Clan.

435
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:08,990
Maybe

436
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,660
there is some deceptive magic formation here.

437
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,560
It's just that

438
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,880
we haven't found the Buddhist Gate yet.

439
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,870
You were able to sense the underground palace's

440
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:18,820
formation center, weren't you?

441
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,020
Try to sense it again.

442
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,670
If I can sense it, I wouldn't need you to tell me.

443
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:24,200
I don't know what happened.

444
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,290
I've been unable to feel anything since I came in.

445
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:28,760
What should we do?

446
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,560
We are illustrious figures all our life.

447
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,230
We can't stay here

448
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,550
for a year or so. Right?

449
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,560
I think I should find something to eat.

450
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,510
Just in case.

451
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,070
But in this shabby place,

452
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,990
there's nothing to eat.

453
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,710
I can't even see a rat or a bug.

454
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,860
A bug?

455
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:46,360
Oh, right. A bug.

456
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:47,930
A bug?

457
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,130
What bug is it?

458
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,660
Follow me.

459
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,490
What are you looking for?

460
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,480
Bugs.

461
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,080
Why are you looking for bugs? I'm really hungry.

462
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,040
Step aside. Step aside.

463
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,500
I think we can find the bugs in the dark place.

464
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,390
You can eat this. I'm not eating it.

465
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,070
What are you talking about?

466
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:36,630
These fireflies are incarnations of the spirit of ancient people.

467
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,730
They have sagacity.

468
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:38,930
They can lead the way.

469
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,430
Good bugs.

470
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,900
Can you tell me

471
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:47,060
where the center of the Hallucination Formation is?

472

480

People from the Ancient Shu are really strange.

488

In a place where the sun can't shine,

489
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,470
such a big tree can even grow here.

490
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,370
Don't get closer to it.

491
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,030

What's going on?

00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,100
Don't worry. Second-in-command is fine.

Let’s get down to business.

There are people dying ahead.

514
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,510
For the Baile villagers outside,

515
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,840
their energy may have been absorbed by it.

516
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:49,080
That's why they look expressionless.

517
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:50,960
Then why am I fine?

518
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:54,090
You have my blood.

519
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,910
It seems the center of Zhu Rong's Hallucination Formation

520
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,430
is built on this tree.

521
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:08,150
Yun Xi.

522
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,740
Yun Xi.

523
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,010
Yun Xi.

524
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,130
Yun Xi!

525
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,150
No!

526
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:22,930
Yun Xi, no!

527
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,620
Help me!

528
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:26,140
Yun Xi, help me!

529
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:27,860
Help me! No!

530
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:29,070
Help me!

531
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,300
Help me, Yun Xi!

532
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:31,890
Dengdeng.

533
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:33,010
Help me!

534
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:33,740
Dengdeng!

535
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,860
Help me!

536
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,630
Dengdeng, what's wrong?

537
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,160
What's wrong with me?

538
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,190
Why am I hugging it?

539
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,420
Why am I crying?

540
00:32:55,590 --> 00:32:56,520
You scared me.

541
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,720
You kept staring at it just now.

542
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,980
I couldn't wake you up.

543
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,510
You seemed to have deep feelings for it.

544
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,110
I saw a woman's face just now.

545
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,250
A woman's face?

546
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,010
Why didn't I saw it?

547
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,360
I think it must be the magic

548
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,590
conjured by Zhu Rong again

549
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,650
to confuse us.

550
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:21,990
That's right.

551
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,010
It was the trick Zhu Rong used on Wei Du.

552
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:27,790
We must break this formation as soon as possible.

553
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,590
We can't let it harm more people.

554
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:15,909
Dengdeng!

555
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:34,900
Ma'am!

556
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:37,670
Dengdeng.

557
00:34:38,389 --> 00:34:39,159
Are you okay?

558
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:40,670
I'm fine.

559
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,350
Oh, no.

560
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,680
We have to get out of here at once.

561
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,780
It's dangerous here.

562
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,400
Let's go.

563
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,090
It was Wei Du.

564
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,130
He was really tough.

565
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:20,580
He must have hung on till the last moment

566
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:23,110
before he was dragged away by the Ghost Vines.

567
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,800
Let's go!

568
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,290
Watch out!

569
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,710
That's really a monster.

570
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,540
Catch them!

571
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,660
Kill them!

572
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,290
I'll leave these annoying guys to you.

573
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:21,680
Wait!

574
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,350
A bullet.

575
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:29,960
How is that possible?

576
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:43,040
You could play this game like that?

577
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,200
What is it called?

578
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,280
Suppression from the same bloodline.

579
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,280
The most important thing is the tacit understanding.

580
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,790
Hide.

581
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,310
Here you are.

582
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,760
Go on fighting them.

583
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:23,110
I'm enjoying killing them.

584
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,910
Be adaptable to circumstances.

585
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,130
Let me do it for another round.

586
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:26,890
No.

587
00:38:27,450 --> 00:38:28,650
It's a fight between masters.

588
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,930
It determines life and death at any second. It's easy to hurt others accidentally.

589
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,870
Suppression from the same bloodline. Do it again.

590
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:33,430
No!

591
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,510
If I do it again, he won't get tricked.

592
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,220
Let me think of another way.

593
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:38,610
Silly kids.

594
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,650
You are lazy.

595
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,170
I told you to learn

596
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,840
some skills from me, but you refused to learn.

597
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,720
You're confused now, huh?

598
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,200
Father.

599
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,840
Uncle Yu, why did you come?

600
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,510
If I didn't come, both of you would have died.

601
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,830
Daughter, it's better to come in time than early.

602
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,050
Stick out your hands.

603
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,130
Just do it. Be quick.

604
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,530
Two pieces for each of you.

605
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:06,840
Stick one to the east, west, south and north respectively.

606
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,380
Leave the Red Dragon to me.

607
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,380
Wei Du?
