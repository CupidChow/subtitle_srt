Master,

59
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,610
what is wrong with you?

60
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:57,680
Why take out your energy core?

61
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,420
You will die.

62
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,030
It's not working.

63
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,800
I'm calling you over

64
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,170
to take Lu Yan away.

65
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,780
From now on,

66
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,380
Lu Yan

67
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,990
is your new master.

68
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,560
No, Master.

69
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,720
I'll take you with me.

70
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,330
I will find a way to save you.

71
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,040
Zhu Rong is coming soon.

72
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,380
Leave now!

73
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,630
Otherwise, we'll lose all our efforts.

74
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,790
No, Master!

75
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,670
This,

76
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,190
give it to Lu Yan.

77
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,110
Then I'll take the General away first.

78
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,130
Wait for me to come back and save you!

79
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:46,890
Wait for me!

80
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,030
There is another relationship called the love of men and women.

81
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,830
If your love for each other is deep enough,

82
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,680
it is also possible to give up your life for the other.

83
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,240
So,

84
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,130
this is the love of men and women.

85
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,040
The living one

86
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,030
is really willing to die instead.

87
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,310
When I woke up,

88
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,550
Yun Xi had disappeared.

89
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,110
And Xin told me

90
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,480
she took out her own energy core to

91
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,550
save me.

92
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,909
General,

93
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:38,860
after Master gave you her energy core,

94
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,110
she let me regard you as my master

95
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:42,450
and take you away.

96
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,290
When I came back,

97
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:48,040
I found that the master's spirit had dissipated

98
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,340
and the only remaining thing was this spiritual feather.

99
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,500
Yun Xi is the Saintess of the Spirit Clan.

100
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,970
Her original body is the golden crow

101
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,740
with which no ordinary clansman can compare.

102
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,330
Are there no other ways

103
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,880
to get her spirit back?

104
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,810
A way?

105
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,370
We, the Spirit Clan, have a legend

106
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,010
that as long as the person carrying the energy core

107
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,730
seals himself into a mountain with a lake

108
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,300
and uses the power of the energy core

109
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,650
to nourish the scattered spirit fragments,

110
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,190
the spirit can be reunited after 3,000 years.

111
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,220
Maybe this is a way

112
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,740
to make my master appear again.

113
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,060
Really?

114
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:47,480
Only it's just a legend.

115
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,970
There has never been a precedent.

116
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,420
As long as there's a one-in-a-million chance,

117
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:57,290
I'm going to try it.

118
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,180
It is said that this approach

119
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,530
will make the person carrying the energy core

120
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,530
suffer great damage.

121
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,570
Even if you survived 3,000 years

122
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,630
and got out of the mountain,

123
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,510
your disposition and energy

124
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,830
might also be affected.

125
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,040
You might become indifferent

126
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,840
and your energy might also become unstable.

127
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,800
As long as we can bring Yun Xi back to life,

128
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,310
this really doesn't matter.

129
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,120
The Saintess is so righteous.

130
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,710
She is kind of a heroine.

131
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,970
And you ought to find her

132
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,570
and save her.

133
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,710
If I were a man

134
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,120
and met a woman like this,

135
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,050
I'd try my best to save her too.

136
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,100
So,

137
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,280
the stuff I ate before

138
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,870
is the reunited spirit of the Saintess

139
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,540
which you gathered for 3,000 years.

140
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,010
That's a tough one.

141
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,590
According to you, she's a nice person.

142
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:13,720
I'm not a bad person, am I?

143
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,990
You can take the spirit if you want.

144
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,530
But can you let me live?

145
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,580
I don't want to die.

146
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,070
For my father has raised me for so many years,

147
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,340
you can't let him raise me for nothing.

148
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,860
I went to the Mysterious Market

149
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,150
to find a rare book.

150
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,670
It records an occult method

151
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,130
which can let me know all the things

152
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,650
a spirit has experienced from beginning to end.

153
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,400
I feel

154
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,480
I'm about to find her.

155
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,550
What are you doing?

156
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,470
No,

157
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,580
I just want to talk to you about it.

158
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,190
You don't have to do it now if you don't want to talk about it.

159
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:05,110
We can have a further discussion.

160
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,180
I must know

161
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,070
if you are her or not.

162
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,790
Am I her or not?

163
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,130
Who?

164
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,780
What are you talking about?

165
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,710
Don't be afraid.

166
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,360
This occult method won't hurt you.

167
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,300
Who am I?

168
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,730
Who else could I be?

169
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,890
I am definitely Yu Dengdeng.

170
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:48,950
Yu,

171
00:11:49,690 --> 00:11:50,520
there.

172
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,330
Is that a little girl?

173
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:54,910
Father.

174
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,180
Mother.

175
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,940
Don't go over there. That's a spirit clansman.

176
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,890
What's wrong with spirit clansmen?

177
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,400
Don't go over.

178
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,510
This child

179
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,680
is the same age as our Dengdeng.

180
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,080
If you leave her alone in the mountains,

181
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,270
how can she survive?

182
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,090
What?

183
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,860
You want to take her home?

184
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,190
-I'm hungry.
-Oh honey.

185
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,010
God has taken our Dendeng away.

186
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,150
What?

187
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,720
Maybe it's a chance

188
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,270
God gave us

189
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,740
by giving us this child back.

190
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:43,990
Don't you always say

191
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,930
there's no difference between human and spirit clansman?

192
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:48,950
Yeah.

193
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:49,910
Why can't she just

194
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,520
be our child?

195
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,950
Since you like her,

196
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,350
just take her back.

197
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,220
But you can't tell anyone about this.

198
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,880
Otherwise, the girl will be in danger.

199
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,700
Why?

200
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,140
What's going on here?

201
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,960
How can there be two Yu Dengdengs?

202
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,510
Yun Xi,

203
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,040
it must really hurt to take out the energy core, right?

204
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,510
I'm sorry.

205
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,750
I didn’t find you until now.

206
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,340
You, you stay away!

207
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,050
What illusion have you cast on me?

208
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,310
You can kill me if you want.

209
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,380
Don't do that.

210
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,470
This is not an illusion.

211
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,060
This is the memory of Yun Xi's spirit

212
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:54,440
inside you.

213
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,010
The real Yu Dengdeng

214
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,380
died young.

215
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,630
The Yu family adopted you

216
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,000
and covered your real identity with energy.

217
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,320
That's why

218
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,550
I've been treating you as a human woman.

219
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,790
Dengdeng,

220
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,500
you are the embodiment of Yun Xi's spirit.

221
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,590
You are the one

222
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:14,860
I've been looking for.

223
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,610
That's a poor lie.

224
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:22,720
I'll tell you

225
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:26,280
the one you're looking for is the noble and mighty Saintess.

226
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,710
I am Yu Dengdeng,

227
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,240
chief of a stronghold who almost got killed by you.

228
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,750
You said I was her.

229
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,690
What evidence do you have? Who believes it?

230
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,280
Evidence?

231
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,470
Didn't you just see all the evidence?

232
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,560
You are so mighty.

233
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,340
How do I know

234
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,600
what I just saw

235
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,180
wasn't made up by you to bluff?

236
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,180
I got it.

237
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,170
You're trying to make me willingly

238
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,080
give you her spirit, right?

239
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,540
That's too much drama.

240
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,300
No one dares to write a play script like this.

241
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,670
Three thousand years ago,

242
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,550
you gave me the energy core.

243
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,670
I've been looking forward to

244
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,840
the day when I can give it back to you.

245
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,050
I was born by my mother and raised by my father

246
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,260
and looked after by Second-in-command.

247
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,080
I am human.

248
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:13,670
Why would I want your energy core?

249
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,790
You leave your energy core for the one you like.

250
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,100
You are the embodiment of Yun Xi's spirit.

251
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,570
Now you are Yun Xi,

252
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,310
the one I like is you.

253
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,810
Stop joking.

254
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,870
Let me ask you.

255
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,820
Suppose I bought a jar of Dukang wine today

256
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,330
and drank it up.

257
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,660
Then I refilled the jar with Fen wine.

258
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,850
The jar is the same,

259
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,280
but could the wine inside be the same?

260
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,040
That is certainly not the same.

261
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,360
Think about it.

262
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:44,230
Dukang and Fen wine are not alive things,

263
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,030
but you come with a spirit inside.

264
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,190
Stop it. I won't listen.

265
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,030
How come I don't remember anything?

266
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,590
I'm telling you again.

267
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,160
I, the Chief of Qingquan Stronghold,

268
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,730
beautiful Yu Dengdeng,

269
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,310
don't want to play your game anymore.

270
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,860
I'm done listening to your story too.

271
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,960
Let's part our ways now.

272
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,530
I know.

273
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,839
It's hard for you to suddenly

274
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,220
accept all these things.

275
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,980
But it doesn't matter,

276
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,310
I can wait

277
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:12,210
until the day your spirit recovers.

278
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,980
To confirm what I said,

279
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,520
you can ask your father for confirmation.

280
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,099
But for these days,

281
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,280
I hope you can agree that

282
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,670
I can continue as before

283
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,150
protecting you in the dark.

284
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,380
Don't you be ridiculous.

285
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,480
Protect me secretly?

286
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,420
I feel more insecure

287
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,940
when you're by my side, okay?

288
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,600
Don't you have any idea how scary you are?

289
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,080
Spirit clansmen are also hiding from you.

290
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:55,990
Dengdeng,

291
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,530
the situation in the Mysterious Market is very complicated.

292
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,670
You also hurt your foot.

293
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,940
Where are you going?

294
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,540
You're a smart girl.

295
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,470
And you know that

296
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,160
you've been in danger many times along the way from Qingquan Stronghold.

297
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:08,940
You must have been targeted.

298
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:09,840
I don't know

299
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,100
what will happen in the future.

300
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,440
I have to stay by your side to protect you.

301
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,610
Nothing can be worse than someone trying to kill me

302
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,010
and take my spirit.

303
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:18,960
Don't you dangle in front of me.

304
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,640
For my bullets have no eyes.

305
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,160
You can still use the hair pin.

306
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,310
Here you are.

307
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:32,030
This hairpin is Yun Xi's which has energy with it.

308
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,410
This is the hair pin that Yun Xi used before

309
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:35,390
to dissect her energy core.

310
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,250
It can easily take my life.

311
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,190
Later if you feel that my actions

312
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,330
may threaten your life.

313
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:42,070
You can use this hair pin

314
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,950
to hurt me.

315
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,390
At that time, why would you hand

316
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,730
something so important to me casually?

317
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,160
I was in a hurry to save your life.

318
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,840
Maybe it's the fate of you and me.

319
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,530
This is destined to

320
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,840
return to the destined one.

321
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,610
Who's the destined one?

322
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,960
Weird.

323
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,470
What's this nonsense?

324
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,980
You don't believe me, do you?

325
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,200
Then I'll show you.

326
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,190
Hey!

327
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,990
You know that

328
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,140
whenever I get hurt,

329
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,570
the injury will heal immediately.

330
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,060
Now you can believe me.

331
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,840
This hair pin has one more use.

332
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,350
You call me using it.

333
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,500
I'll be able to notice

334
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:46,520
and come to your side right away.

335
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,280
So powerful!

336
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,020
It's better than any foreign phone invented overseas

337
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,050
with no need for wires.

338
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,490
How much does it worth?

339
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,670
Don't overthink it.

340
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:01,470
I'm not forgiving you.

341
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,500
I'm just figuring

342
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,240
the things that I encountered along the way

343
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,750
are very weird indeed.

344
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:07,130
I can deal with humans.

345
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:08,990
But it's hard when encountering spirit clansmen.

346
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:11,220
Before finding my father,

347
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,060
I'll believe you for the moment.

348
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:15,100
If you dare to hurt me again,

349
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:16,380
I'll stab you 10,000 times

350
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,050
with this hair pin.

351
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,340
So you agree.

352
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,550
Don't you worry.

353
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:25,150
I can assure you.

354
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,580
From now on,

355
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,940
I, Lu Yan, have no harm for you,

356
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,150
only guardianship.

357
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,110
Anyway, your legs grow on your body

358
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:36,550
and I couldn't stop it even I want to.

359
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,930
But I just want to find my dad now

360
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,020
and don't have time to hear anything from you

361
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,480
about the Story of the Saintess of Spirit Clan.

362
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:48,920
This is Millennium Memorial.

363
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,990
All the spirit clansmen and spirit-hunters

364
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,470
want this treasure.

365
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,870
Hope it will help you.

366
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,950
Seeing you so sincere,

367
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,330
I'll take it for now.

You can follow me.

369
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,810
But I have one condition.

370
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:08,730
What condition?

371
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,970
Can't get too close to me.

372
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:13,120
And do not live under the same roof as me.

373
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,790
Otherwise, I'd be insecure.

374
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,060
Okay.

375
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,270
Then I'll stay half a mile away from you.

376
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,300
And I'll never step into that range.

377
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,030

Lu Yan's energy is too powerful.

385

They escaped from the Mysterious Market.

386
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,660
I told you so.

387
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,320
With Lu Yan around,

388
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:04,960
you can't trap him at all.

389
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,240
Forget it.

390
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,680
Anyway, this time

391
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,650
we're just trying to feel him out.

392
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,720
I have laid a trap in Yingdu.

393
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:16,000
Let's see if he has the luck

394
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,330
to get out or not.

395
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,360
I just left some energy

396
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,660
on Yu Dengdeng.

397
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,470
Lu Yan took her out of the Mysterious Market to heal her wounds.

398
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,190
My energy got some strange fluctuations.

399
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,800
I found Yu Dengdeng's energy

400
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,910
is similar to someone.

401
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,190
Who’s that?

402
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,540

403
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,360

For sure.

405

If that's the case,

406
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,760
it would make sense.

407
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,290
I was wondering why Lu Yan

408
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,420
has been staying around

409
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,750
an ordinary human woman.

410

I'll have to try that girl first.

It stinks.

414
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,180
This really stinks.

415
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,480
If my Master hadn't asked me to save you,

416
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,430
you and Chief Gu

417
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,530
would still be trapped in the Mysterious Market.

418
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,110
You let go of me.

419
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,460
Will you show some gratitude?

420
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,100
Calm yourself!

421
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,910
What about this little weirdo?

422
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,360
What do you think?

423
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,700
I'm afraid that she may have already killed a lot of people

using this hotel.

425
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:08,890
I think it's better to just kill her.

426
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:10,170
That's not true.

427

she didn't hurt anyone's life.

But I don't know what happened.

440

Our parents

441
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:43,710
disappeared one after another.

442
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,270
We later found out that

443
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,430
they all disappeared in Yingdu.

444
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,840

we opened this hotel for robbery.

it has to rain, right?

614
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,120
When it's raining,

615
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,900
it waters a field, right?

No matter how fertile this field is,

617
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,830

Don’t take it seriously.

681
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,650
Spirit Clan’s Saintess?

682
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,510

686
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,180
I didn't use my hands.

694
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,290
the weather is too stuffy.

695
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,710
It's already autumn and it's still so hot.

696

Why don't we also switch to horseback riding?

697

706
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,950
to get some cold water from the well

707

711

Master,

712
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,500

Let's find a place to hide from the rain.

Where can we hide from the rain in the middle of nowhere?

724

Where are our umbrellas?

725
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,710
I left our umbrellas at the Rose Hotel.

726
