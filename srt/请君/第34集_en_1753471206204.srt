1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will never let go after you leave

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Because you're not me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Because you're not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Because you're not me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Because you're not me

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The child does not like to eat and does not teach

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Use the dragon mother to hit the bone

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The dragon mother hit the bone

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Remind you of the wonderful start

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The extra Bayard milk powder absorbs well and nourishes better

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The extra Bayard reminds you of the wonderful start

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The shadow of the light is getting lighter

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I just checked the blood vessels in her body

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I found that it had been damaged

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If this continues

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Even with my original ability

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It won't last a few days

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
So fast

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Can't

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Can't the master only wait here for him to eat?

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Dahong

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I didn't expect

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Now the only one who can talk

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Only you

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I recently encountered a very troublesome thing

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That person is back to life

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I sealed him before

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He seems to be revenge me

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
When I was in the old tree

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I heard that the stomach was poisoned

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I was shocked at the time

33
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But not in vain

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I didn't expect

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's all true

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The only thing is

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm saying it one by one

38
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The death is coming

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The girl is still alive

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The fairy

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Everything will be swallowed

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The shadow will be thrown to the ground

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's all so real

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I've never been so scared

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I dream every night about who died

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The next day they really died

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I can't tell

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Those people are me

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Or that person killed

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's really terrible

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Now he's just killing

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't know what he'll do later

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I only know

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This thing must stop

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Can't go on like this

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Since I am a saint

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Then I have to protect my family

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Protect humans and the spirit

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Now my shadow

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's disappearing little by little

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
He hit me in the gap today

62
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Maybe he'll attack me soon

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
But fortunately, Wei Du said

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I die

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He can't live

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I think

67
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's time to make a decision

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But this thing

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I can't tell anyone

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I can't tell Lu Yan

71
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm afraid he'll be sad

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
He'll be sad

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm more afraid

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Will be like what Wei Du said

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
He wants to make a deal to save me

76
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
If my death

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Can exchange for his life

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Make a deal

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That's worth it

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm sorry

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Just

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Before I go to see that person

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I want to live with him

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
A few happy days

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Otherwise

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I will have regrets

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And my father

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The sea

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
North west

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Stone west

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
AXI

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The brothers in the whole village

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
If I leave like this

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
They must be very sad

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But I have to do this

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry for them

97
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
But I can't

98
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I can't

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
AXI

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Yunxi could seal the Black Saintess with yuan

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I believe

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Deng Deng can do it

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Sir

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You mean you want to throw the bomb

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Absolutely not

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
The master will not agree

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't need his permission

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I have another way

109
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let me think about it again

110
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let me think about it

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
There must be another way

112
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
AXI

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I have decided

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You don't have to think about it anymore

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Sir

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's all AXI's fault

117
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
AXI didn't protect the master and the master

118
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You and the master are the most important people

119
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You do this

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
How to make AXI bear it

121
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
How to make the master bear it

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What face do I have to face the master

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
AXI

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yunxi used yuan to save me

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I have already given him my life

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Now he is in such a situation

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He needs me

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
How can I hesitate

129
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The master and the master love each other

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
AXI is ashamed

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But AXI

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He can't see the master anymore

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm afraid the master will be sad

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
In the next two days

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I will do my best

136
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Take care of my future

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I hope Deng Deng will be safe in the future

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But

139
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
But I'm afraid the master

140
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
What he wants is not just peace

141
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
If you don't do it

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The master will never be happy

143
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
This matter

144
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's about the safety of the world

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's the belief that Yunxi and I have been together for three thousand years

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
So Deng Deng and I must give up one

147
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
AXI

148
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I have made my decision

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No more words

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
AXI

151
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Master

152
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
AXI is here

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
What are you thinking?

154
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Nothing

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Yesterday

156
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I saw Bai Shixi and Gu Beixi

157
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
They met again after a long time

158
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
They laughed so happily

159
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I finally understood that there is a feeling

160
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's called a second time

161
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I have known Gu Beixi for so many years

162
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Although he is tough

163
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But I know

164
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
He has actually been interested in Miss Bai

165
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I believe they will be happy in the future

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Deng Deng

167
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's get married

168
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What

169
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
How do you know I want to

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
What can you hide from me

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Besides

172
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I know what you are thinking

173
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You eavesdropper

174
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I didn't eavesdrop

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Ok ok ok

176
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You are listening in a fair way

177
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What am I thinking now

178
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Now

179
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
In

180
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Miss me

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm not serious

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You learned seven or eight points

183
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Don't worry about others bullying you anymore

184
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
No one dares to bully me with you

185
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
No one can bully you without me

186
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Besides

187
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
General Yan is so powerful

188
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
And Yuan Dan is protecting himself

189
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Who can bully you

190
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Deng Deng

191
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You have to know

192
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
In this world

193
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Only you can hurt me

194
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
So you have to be careful in the future

195
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So to speak

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I still have such a great ability

197
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
General Yan is so brave and invincible

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I can hurt you

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But

200
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What's wrong with you today

201
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
So active

202
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I have a fever

203
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Deng Deng

204
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You married me before

205
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
This time I will marry you

206
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I marry you this time

208
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I hope you can be happy from now on

209
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Be healthy

210
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
No matter what happens

211
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I don't want you to cry anymore

212
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Then don't give me a chance to cry

213
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Otherwise, I will make trouble for you

214
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
There is a meteor

215
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Hurry up and make a wish

216
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The meteor is so beautiful

217
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Unfortunately

218
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Too short

219
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The shorter the thing is

220
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The more beautiful it is

221
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
How about we remember today

222
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
it is good

223
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I will remember

224
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I will remember

225
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I will remember

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I will remember

227
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
it is good

228
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Then let me

229
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Look at you again

230
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Beautiful eyebrows

231
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Beautiful eyes

232
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Beautiful nose

233
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Beautiful nose

234
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Beautiful mouth

235
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I really like Deng Deng

236
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Beautiful everywhere

237
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Beautiful

238
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
This is

239
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
These are the lotus flowers

240
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
In the Shu state

241
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Lotus flowers symbolize the love and happiness of a couple

242
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
When my father and mother were getting married

243
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The whole palace is full of peace and joy

244
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The fragrance of flowers never disappears

245
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
After that, they walked together for a lifetime

246
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
White hair and old life

247
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
So

248
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I also have a small wish

249
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I hope one day

250
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
When I propose to my beloved woman

251
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It can also make everyone around you happy

252
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Propose

253
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Propose

254
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
A thousand years of memory

255
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
In this life, the virtue can be connected

256
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The military knows my intention

257
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Please be my wife

258
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Deng Deng

259
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
From now on

260
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I Lu Yan

261
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I am willing to be a husband and a king

262
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Around you

263
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Are you willing to marry my mother?

264
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I am willing

265
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I will call you with all my heart

266
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Until your memory

267
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You are my only

268
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Walk into the scenery

269
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Just a long night

270
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
How to hold on to love

271
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I hide my heart

272
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Make a decision for you

273
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Marry again

274
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Marry

275
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
My dear Deng Deng

276
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Did you hit something evil again?

277
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I will give you

278
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Dad, what are you talking about?

279
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I slept all night last night

280
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I can go to the ground today

281
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
It seems to be evil

282
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That's even more amazing

283
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
This is getting married again

284
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Just a few days back in the house

285
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Just three thousand and two hundred million

286
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Lu Yan, he doesn't eat the fragrance

287
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What is it called

288
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I Yu Deng Deng is a man who is focused on one thing

289
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
In addition to that big rooster

290
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I only want Lu Yan

291
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
You two are getting married again

292
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Lu Yan is really

293
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I've been here for half a year

294
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Don't you think you're an outsider?

295
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Such a big thing

296
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Don't you have time to tell me

297
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I disagree

298
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm not here now

299
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Come to seek your approval

300
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It doesn't count

301
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
This time

302
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
It's the two of us

303
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm willing to get married

304
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We want to have an official wedding

305
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Gao Yuyao

306
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I think the uncle is very good

307
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The uncle is very good

308
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
He's good to Deng Deng

309
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
We should give him a title

310
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Besides, Deng Deng was so scary yesterday

311
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I feel like our village

312
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I ran into something dirty

313
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
It's good to get married

314
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I agree

315
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I have to give you a date

316
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Even next month

317
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
No need to count

318
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The day after tomorrow

319
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
The day after tomorrow

320
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
So urgent

321
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Big girl

322
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You think it's the world

323
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Buy a wheel, buy a horse

324
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I paid the money and I got my body back

325
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yes

326
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It's too late

327
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Dad, don't worry

328
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Lu Yan is the most decent and stable

329
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
He won't treat me badly

330
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Enough

331
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Such a big thing

332
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Don't you tell me in advance

333
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I disagree

334
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I'm on your side this year

335
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
No hurry

336
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
How can a marriage be a game?

337
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Yes

338
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Dad

339
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Dad, don't be angry, dad

340
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I know

341
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
You pretend to be angry on the surface

342
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Actually

343
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
You are already happy in your heart

344
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Right?

345
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
My Deng Deng

346
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What's so good about this kid?

347
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Old and not understanding

348
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
How can he be your father?

349
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
So handsome

350
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
So know how to deal with people and things

351
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Dad, when did you become so rich?

352
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You were not relying on two sheep

353
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
You tricked my mother

354
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Besides, wine is a smell of dust

355
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Lu Yan is a general of the ancient mouse three thousand years ago

356
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
The old antique is worth it

357
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What a joke

358
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Okay

359
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Dad

360
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Second brother

361
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I tell you the truth

362
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You two

363
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Don't laugh at me

364
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I really like Lu Yan

365
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
He is also sincere to me

366
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
My daughter is living with the big boss every day

367
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Always wrapped in the appearance of this mountain village

368
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Actually I also imagined

369
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
One day

370
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
In a red wedding dress

371
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
The hero in my heart was taken down by the flower sedan

372
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Lu Yan was the hero of their Gu Shu Kingdom three thousand years ago

373
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Now

374
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It's also the hero in my heart

375
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and so

376
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
One day early and one day late

377
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I don't marry him

378
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I'm sorry

379
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Dress up and get married

380
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Must be very beautiful

381
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
This married man and married girl

382
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
It's not a taste in the heart

383
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Da-lai wants to marry

384
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I know there will be such a day sooner or later

385
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Second father's heart

386
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I can't bear it

387
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Okay, old fish

388
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Dad

389
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Enough, enough

390
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Getting married is a good thing

391
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Yes, yes, yes

392
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Besides, can we control the mood?

393
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Can't stop

394
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Isn't this too much?

395
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
OK, I understand you

396
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
You go back first

397
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I have something to say to him

398
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Let's go out with second brother

399
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Come out first

400
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Hurry up

401
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Sit down

402
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Haven't seen him for days

403
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The fog cloud is gone for three days

404
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Not an emergency call

405
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
How do you know

406
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Another calculation

407
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Does this need to be calculated?

408
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Is your second brother and I a fool?

409
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Are you sure?

410
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What's not an emergency call?

411
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So many years

412
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I haven't seen you calculate it

413
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Nothing

414
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You are taking your wedding

415
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
You and Lu Yuan have a long life

416
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Second brother will buy you something

417
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Last time, it was not a dog jump

418
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
This time I will definitely give you a grand wedding

419
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Master, go down the mountain tomorrow

420
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
What do you need to prepare for A Xin?

421
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Tomorrow

422
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You just have to help me

423
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Just prepare your husband

424
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm going to give him a surprise

425
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
OK, if the master knows

426
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I will be very happy

427
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Lu Yan usually has a face

428
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I don't know if this surprise will work for him

429
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
A Xin

430
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Why are you bitter?

431
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Tomorrow I will have a wedding with your master

432
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
What are you not happy?

433
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Happy

434
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I am happy of course

435
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Master, don't worry

436
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
The wedding sedan I prepared for you and the master tomorrow

437
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Must be the most beautiful sedan in the world

438
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Although the master is not good at words

439
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
But he always cares about you

440
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
If he knows you prepare a surprise for him

441
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
He must be happy

442
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
A Xin

443
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Why are you so tired today?

444
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Tomorrow, you will have a sweet talk

445
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Teach your master

446
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
OK, sure

447
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Go

448
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Go

449
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Lu Yan

450
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Deng Deng just told me

451
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
The day after tomorrow you will hold a wedding

452
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Although this matter is very hasty

453
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
But you can rest assured

454
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
My fish stall and his second father

455
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Will definitely make this wedding

456
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Make it glorious and decent

457
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
You can rest assured

458
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Lu Yan

459
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You know

460
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Deng Deng lost his mother when he was a child

461
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
From childhood to adulthood

462
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
He has been by my side

463
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Never left

464
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I never thought that one day

465
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
He would leave me

466
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
But since he left

467
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But since he met you

468
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Our Deng Deng is not careful

469
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Open and shut up all day

470
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
It's all your Lu Yan

471
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
To be honest

472
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
When I first met you

473
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I don't like you

474
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm afraid you will take my Deng Deng

475
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Take away from me

476
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
For so long

477
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I have been silently observing you

478
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I want to see what kind of person you are

479
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Can you let my daughter Deng Deng

480
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
entrust to all

481
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
After this period of observation

482
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
You kid

483
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,000
can

484
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
You kid

485
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
can

486
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Be like a man

487
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Lu Yan

488
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I hope you will get married

489
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Can be together forever

490
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I

491
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Yu Tanzi has one more thing to tell you

492
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
After the husband and wife get married

493
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
It's inevitable to fight and fight

494
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Deng Deng has a temper

495
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I hope you

496
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
For my sake

497
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Don't be like him

498
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Okay

499
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
If one day you don't love him

500
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Tell me

501
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
I will bring him back

502
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
You must not hurt him

503
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Old Master Yu

504
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Don't worry

505
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I will protect Deng Deng

506
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Okay

507
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Yu Tanzi believes you

508
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Go

509
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Yu Deng Deng

510
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Don't come over

511
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Don't come over

512
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Why are you here

513
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I don't think you have enough medicine

514
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I also brought some from the provincial city

515
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Come over

516
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
What are you missing in the future?

517
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Tell me what I need

518
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I'll help you

519
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I thank you on behalf of everyone

520
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
You're welcome

521
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Where are you going

522
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
I'm going to find Deng Deng

523
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I'll go with you

524
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Come, I'll help you

525
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Come on

526
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Seventeenth

527
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Come

528
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Why are you so familiar with me

529
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Gu Weixin

530
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I know

531
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Because of our family

532
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You have been guilty

533
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
So you will be so good to me

534
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But I really don't need you like this

535
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Since I'm alive

536
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I will live well

537
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
And I can take care of myself alone

538
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,000
And

539
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
If you continue to be so good to me

540
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
I will misunderstand

541
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
You are as good as before

542
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Still my best friend

543
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Let's go

544
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Come in

545
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Deng Deng

546
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Seventeenth

547
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You are finally here

548
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
You asked someone to deliver it yesterday

549
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I brought you something

550
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I brought it for you

551
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Great

552
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You two are so mysterious

553
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,000
What are you doing

554
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
You two

555
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You two

556
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
You two

557
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
I'm sorry

558
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm sorry

559
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I'm sorry

560
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I'm sorry

561
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
I'm sorry

562
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I'm sorry

563
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
I'm sorry

564
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I'm sorry

565
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,000
I'm sorry

566
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I'm sorry

567
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Master Gu

568
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I have something to say to Deng Deng

569
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,000
You go out and wait for a while

570
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Yes

571
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
This is the secret of our girl's family

572
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Don't be mischievous

573
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Go away

574
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Go out

575
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Don't make trouble

576
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Go out and eavesdrop

577
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Deng Deng

578
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Hurry and feed them

579
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Finalist

580
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,960
Nina

581
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I was so ignorant

582
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Here

583
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Thank you

584
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
It's really interesting.

585
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Yes.

586
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Yes.

587
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Everyone,

588
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,000
I checked it.

589
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,360
Family, family,

590
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,440
red silk and silk cloth.

591
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,840
Three hundred and thirty each.

592
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,480
One hundred eggs for seeds.

593
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,800
The land of the Liangtian.

594
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,960
The white sow of the Liangtian

595
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,520
under the Qingquan Mountain.

596
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,280
And this, this,

597
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:28,960
the house.

598
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,040
Under the Qingquan Mountain.

599
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,960
The school's clothing store.

600
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,240
The most important thing is

601
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,080
the silver ticket is dry.

602
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,880
Did you see it?

603
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,480
These gold and silver treasures

604
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,760
are very valuable.

605
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,760
Great.

606
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,760
Great.

607
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,560
Great.

608
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Master.

609
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,200
So beautiful.

610
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,680
Chief.

611
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,320
You dressed so beautifully today.

612
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,280
The brothers in the village don't dare to see it.

613
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:11,760
I know the land of the Liangtian.

614
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,640
This school and the medical school.

615
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,920
What's the point?

616
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,280
Chief.

617
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,960
You have a good taste.

618
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,080
I also saw it.

619
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,320
With the land of the Liangtian,

620
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,880
the mountain village is full of medical supplies.

621
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,120
In the future, we can eat the land.

622
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,640
Brothers don't have to worry about

623
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,640
going to play the ball.

624
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:29,680
In the future,

625
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,000
we can solve the medical problem.

626
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,520
In the future,

627
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,640
the education of the children in the mountain

628
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:33,760
should be followed.

629
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,920
The children read books,

630
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,800
learn craftsmanship,

631
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,640
and do business.

632
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,240
These are the right ways.

633
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,680
In addition to this medical school,

634
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,560
the master invited the best doctor.

635
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,120
The family is not sick and not worried.

636
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,400
These are added together.

637
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,240
Our mountain village

638
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,280
will be a good news in the future.

639
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,280
Great.

640
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,160
Great.

641
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,040
It's our Mr. Lu's idea.

642
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,040
Yes.

643
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,040
Let's go.

644
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:57,760
What are you going to do?

645
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,680
Go to the village with Master Guan.

646
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,280
This kid is not bad.

647
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,920
Go.

648
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,240
Guys,

649
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:04,920
go back first.

650
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,920
Thank you.

651
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:07,200
Come on.

652
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,360
Let's split this.

653
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,040
Come on.

654
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,000
Let's split.

655
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,720
OK.

656
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,320
Come on.

657
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,080
Come on.

658
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:13,080
Let's split.

659
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:13,800
Come on.

660
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,320
Look.

661
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,160
So many.

662
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:15,640
Come on.

663
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,640
All of them.

664
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,480
Good.

665
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:17,720
Come on.

666
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,480
Look.

667
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,880
Mr. Lu.

668
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,720
Thank you for doing so much for me.

669
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,040
It's my duty.

670
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,000
Why are you dressed like this today?

671
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,040
The village head

672
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,880
is a son-in-law.

673
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:41,960
It looks more like

674
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,200
a husband with a wife.

675
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,800
General Yan.

676
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,560
Your gifts are not bad.

677
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,440
It seems that

678
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,160
you have taken out all the belongings.

679
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,360
Your gifts

680
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,560
can buy

681
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,600
the mountain village of our 18th village.

682
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,560
You can add more details.

683
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,000
These are added together.

684
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,160
You can buy

685
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,920
two mountains of our 18th village.

686
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
You can save some money.

687
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,920
It's useless for me to save these.

688
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,280
OK.

689
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,880
Let's go down the mountain

690
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,880
and buy some clothes.

691
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,840
Shi Qi.

692
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,200
You go with them.

693
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:19,920
OK.

694
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,720
I'll go with them.

695
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,160
The clothes of that shop are beautiful.

696
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,760
I'll ask Shi Qi to pick some.

697
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,960
You're a man.

698
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,080
Why do you go?

699
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,920
Who said a man can't pick clothes?

700
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,920
Besides,

701
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,880
I have something to tell my brother-in-law.

702
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,240
OK.

703
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,200
I think you're old enough to wear this.

704
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,920
It's time to change a new one.

705
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,120
Let's go together.

706
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:46,960
Let's go, A'Qing.

707
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,640
Hey.

708
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,200
We're outsiders.

709
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,560
Don't go in.

710
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,040
Look at them.

711
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,320
They're so tired.

712
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,600
They're so tired of me.

713
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,440
You haven't let go?

714
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,720
What?

715
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:16,320
Let's go.

716
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,840
I'll take you to a place.

717
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,120
Where?

718
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,640
You'll know when we get there.

719
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,960
I'll give you a surprise.

720
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,600
Let's go.

721
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,400
Let's go.

722
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,720
You're here.

723
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,720
You're here.

724
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,720
You're here.

725
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:18,720
You're here.

726
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,720
You're here.

727
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,720
You're here.

728
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,720
You're here.

729
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,720
You're here.

730
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,720
You're here.

731
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,720
You're here.

732
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,720
You're here.

733
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,720
You're here.

734
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,720
You're here.

735
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
You're here.

736
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,720
You're here.

737
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,720
You're here.

738
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,720
You're here.

739
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,720
You're here.

740
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,720
You're here.

741
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,720
You're here.

742
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,720
You're here.

743
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,720
You're here.

744
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,720
You're here.

745
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,720
You're here.

746
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,720
You're here.

747
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,720
You're here.

748
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,720
You're here.

749
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,720
You're here.

You're here.

755
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,720
You're here.

756
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,720
You're here.

757
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,720
You're here.

758
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,720
You're here.

759
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,720

770
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,720
You're here.

771
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,720
You're here.

772
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:05,720
You're here.

773
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,720
You're here.

774
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,720
You're here.

775
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,720
You're here.

776
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,720
You're here.

777
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,720
You're here.
