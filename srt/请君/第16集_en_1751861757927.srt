1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let go even if you walk away from me

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You ask you, it's not me

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You ask you, it's not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You ask you, it's not me

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You ask you, it's not me

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Go

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You want

9
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Be careful

10
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Be careful

11
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Be careful

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Be careful

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Here

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
After her

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Master

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Master

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Princess

18
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Princess

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Go

20
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Go

21
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Give me your hand

22
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hurry up

23
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's too late

24
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Hurry up!

25
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Jump!

26
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You saved me?

27
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't misunderstand.

28
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You're just a human.

29
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't want you to die so quickly.

30
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Are your hands okay?

31
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm fine.

32
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
My lady!

33
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You're lucky today.

34
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Don't say anything to me.

35
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Got it?

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Got it.

37
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Gu Bei Xi.

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
My lady!

39
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I didn't expect

40
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
to meet you in this way.

41
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
My lady!

42
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
My lady!

43
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
My lady!

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
My lady!

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Are you okay?

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Are you okay?

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm fine.

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
My lady!

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The bandit has run away.

50
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't chase after him.

51
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Let's go to see the lady.

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Okay.

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm fine.

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Is anyone inside?

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Something happened.

56
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's go down and have a look.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Okay.

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No one is here.

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Empty?

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I should have known

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
that I wouldn't die so quickly.

62
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No.

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Bai Shi Qi

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
was talking to

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
the lady inside.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes.

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
A living person

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
is lost like this.

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Lady!

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Lady!

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Lady!

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Lady!

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Lady!

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Lady!

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Lady!

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Lady!

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Lady!

78
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Go and look over there.

79
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Lady!

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Lady is missing.

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The bandit and the heroine

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
are missing.

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
They appeared so strangely.

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
They must be together.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Stop talking nonsense.

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Lady is missing.

87
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's not a small matter.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's go home

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and tell my father.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's strange.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Why is someone

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
suddenly missing?

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Master,

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm done for.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm done for.

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I should have come to the library.

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I shouldn't have

98
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
kidnapped the food.

99
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Don't care about who is missing.

100
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Let's protect ourselves first.

101
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Let's go.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Go.

103
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Master,

104
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
something bad happened.

105
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Your lady

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
was kidnapped

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
on the way to the upper house.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The bandit

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
is missing.

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Where is Lady?

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Lady is fine.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
She has gone back to her house.

113
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
She is so arrogant

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
when she is on my head.

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Master,

116
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
there are two people in the bandit.

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Did they do

118
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
the previous case?

119
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Stop talking nonsense.

120
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You are smart.

121
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Go to find the painter.

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Go to the east of the city.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hurry up.

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't be so slow.

125
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's a girl.

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes.

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How can I recognize her?

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You two are watching the scene of the scene.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh, no.

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
She will see

131
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
what you look like.

132
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's these two bastards.

133
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You,

134
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
go to the painter.

135
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yes.

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm so angry.

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Boss,

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
have you seen

139
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
these two people these days?

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
These two people...

141
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
General Yan,

142
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
did you see who did it?

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
No.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But General Yan,

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
she must be a spirit.

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You tell me.

147
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This...

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's Huan Ling.

149
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's her again.

150
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Recently,

151
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
the disappearance case in Yingdu City

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
is frequent.

153
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Is it related to her?

154
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Although this matter

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
needs to be investigated,

156
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
the disappearance case

157
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
is likely to be related to Zhu Rong and others.

158
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Is there any other clue?

159
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No.

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Forget it.

161
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You go.

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Thank you, General Yan.

163
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Sir,

164
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
what should we do next?

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Go.

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Go.

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
General Yan,

168
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
please help me.

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Help me,

170
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
General Yan.

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
General Yan,

172
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
don't leave me.

173
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
General Yan,

174
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
please help me.

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
General Yan,

176
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
please help me.

177
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Don't leave me.

178
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't leave me.

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
It's you.

180
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's been three thousand years.

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
We meet again.

182
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I didn't expect you to be alive.

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What you didn't expect

184
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
is more than that.

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Do you want to get

186
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
what you want here?

187
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Sir.

188
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Sir.

189
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I just took

190
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
some memories of the ghost.

191
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
But during the process,

192
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
she chose to commit suicide.

193
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Suicide?

194
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Sir,

195
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
you're hurt.

196
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Her spirit stone

197
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
hurt my primordial energy.

198
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
It seems that

199
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
we can't use this method

200
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
to retrieve memories.

201
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I remember.

202
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The book says

203
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
that the memory is reflected by the host.

204
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
We'll find another way.

205
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You can't do this.

206
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But at least

207
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
we got some information

208
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
to figure out

209
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
what happened

210
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
around Deng Deng recently.

211
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
By the way,

212
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
it's not just the host.

213
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Look.

214
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Gu Bei Xi and others

215
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
were arrested

216
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
for the missing person case.

217
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Sir,

218
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
you are...

219
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Do you know these two people?

220
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Have you packed up?

221
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The police are coming.

222
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So fast.

223
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Go.

224
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
These two criminals

225
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
live upstairs

226
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
with a woman

227
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
who was with them.

228
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Go.

229
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Search.

230
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Sir,

231
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
no.

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Sir,

233
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
no.

234
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Sir, no.

235
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Call the electric shock.

236
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yes.

237
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You...

238
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You...

239
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You dare to trick me?

240
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
How dare I?

241
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I didn't...

242
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I didn't return the room.

243
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Get that woman out.

244
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
We'll be in trouble.

245
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Okay.

246
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Come on.

247
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Come on.

248
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Hurry up.

249
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's so weird today.

250
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
First, we were scared.

251
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Then we lost someone.

252
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What happened?

253
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I really don't know.

254
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Why?

255
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
When I opened the door,

256
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
there was no one inside.

257
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Only a cat.

258
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Could it be that

259
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Director Bai

260
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
wanted to find a scapegoat?

261
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
We made a decision.

262
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
But we went into his.

263
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The horse that pulled the cart today

264
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
has a lot of blood stains.

265
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It looks like it was just scratched.

266
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I have that horse on my back.

267
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Why do you think

268
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
there are more marks on it?

269
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Could it be that the Spirit Clan did it?

270
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Could it be Lu Yan?

271
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I haven't seen him for two days.

272
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
He must be the ghost in the basement.

273
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'll ask him about it.

274
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
But

275
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
no matter where this little ghost is,

276
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
he must be in the basement.

277
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Director Bai

278
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
will not give up easily.

279
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Now the city is in a terrible state.

280
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
The police station will only

281
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
check the population of the outside world.

282
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Maybe

283
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
my father has already registered.

284
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
But

285
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
it will be harder

286
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
for us to enter the police station

287
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
after today.

288
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
We don't have to go to the police station.

289
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Director Bai is too stressed

290
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
because of the missing case.

291
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
He has already

292
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
sent people to the Bai family.

293
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I have an idea.

294
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'll go to the Bai family tomorrow.

295
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll go to the Bai family tomorrow.

296
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'll go to the Bai family tomorrow.

297
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'll go to the Bai family.

298
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
If you are here to take a rest,

299
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
this is not a smart way.

300
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't want to take a rest.

301
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I ask you.

302
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You are the one who

303
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
caused the chaos

304
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
and disturbed the spirit clan of Golden Horse today.

305
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
No.

306
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Who else can it be if it's not you?

307
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The disappearance of the little ghost

308
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and the disappearance of the little ghost

309
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
is also related to you.

310
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Of course it's not related.

311
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I tell you.

312
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Don't worry about me in the future.

313
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You help me a lot.

314
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Wait.

315
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
It's very dangerous now.

316
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You still have to be very careful.

317
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'll say it again.

318
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Don't make the decision yourself.

319
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You ruined my good thing.

320
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Otherwise,

321
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'll kill you.

322
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Miss.

323
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Come in.

324
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Miss.

325
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
It's too hot.

326
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Miss.

327
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Let's have a bowl of mung bean soup.

328
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Thank you.

329
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Miss.

330
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You miss the Lord again?

331
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I miss you.

332
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I miss you.

333
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I miss you.

334
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I miss you.

335
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I miss you.

336
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I miss you.

337
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I miss you.

338
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I miss you.

339
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I miss you.

340
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I miss you.

341
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Number one.

342
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
How could others know?

343
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
My wife is pregnant.

344
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Okay, okay.

345
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Don't don't.

346
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm just ACE.

347
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So what?

348
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Is it considered unique?

349
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Do you want to ask your boss to cook?

350
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Huh?

351
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You said the flower shop

352
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
is special.

353
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
That man who you called

354
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
was poor,

355
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
but you won't come here if you really want.

356
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What a receipt.

357
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Take it.

358
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Thanks a lot.

359
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Come on.

360
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Take it.

361
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Give it to me.

362
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,680
Miss has been 18 years old.

363
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,400
They should have married long ago.

364
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,320
But now, there's no movement.

365
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,000
Just beat him up.

366
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,160
Miss, the portrait of the owner of the house

367
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,560
is very similar to the one that kidnapped our bandit.

368
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,520
That bandit was masked.

369
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,560
How could anyone see his face?

370
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,160
We didn't see it clearly.

371
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,200
But someone saw it in the police station.

372
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,560
After you and the bandit were kidnapped,

373
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,360
Master was so angry.

374
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,760
Now, the whole city is in chaos.

375
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,960
Wei Chu, I'll go check.

376
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,960
Yes.

377
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,800
Open the door.

378
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,160
I need to connect to connection.

379
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,560
groundwater

380
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,000
What's wrong?

381
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Yu Yihao.

382
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,960
Why is there no normal picture?

383
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,320
Old Yu.

384
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,880
How much trouble have you made to your daughter?

385
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,240
A yellow hair on her head.

386
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,880
Why are these people so strange?

387
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,080
Be careful.

388
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,840
Don't be rash.

389
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,680
Captain.

390
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,080
Wait.

391
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,600
It's a pity for these two.

392
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,040
I think I've seen them somewhere.

393
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,480
Big Sea, wake up.

394
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,840
The police have found us.

395
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,680
You guys, follow them.

396
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,080
Especially pay attention to that girl.

397
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:44,880
See where they go.

398
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:45,960
We're on our way.

399
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:46,760
The inn is near the backyard.

400
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,920
Don't go to the temple.

401
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,520
I'm afraid they'll meet the Gubei star.

402
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:52,560
Stop.

403
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,640
Stop.

404
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:54,960
Stop.

405
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,440
Don't run.

406
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,320
Don't run.

407
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,200
Stop.

408
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,120
Stop.

409
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,560
Don't run.

410
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,600
It's strange.

411
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,400
Miss, you are...

412
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,480
Come.

413
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,040
Come.

414
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:19,600
Come.

415
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,480
Come.

416
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,880
Give me some tea.

417
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,400
Miss, this is a cafe.

418
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,560
No tea, only coffee.

419
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,800
No.

420
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
What do you mean?

421
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,080
Are you looking down on me?

422
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,160
Old woman.

423
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:36,920
Come.

424
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,280
Give me a cup of...

425
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,640
What did you say?

426
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,920
Calafie.

427
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,320
Okay, wait a minute.

428
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,560
Go.

429
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,800
Stop.

430
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,360
Stop.

431
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,640
You want to chase me?

432
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,880
You don't want to see who your grandma is?

433
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,120
It's still early.

434
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,760
It's all my fault.

435
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,080
Huang Yongcai

436
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,680

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,360
report

461
00:21:52,040 --> 00:22:07,120

Mr. Yulong

470
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,960

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:49,960
What's going on?

476
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
Excuse me.

477
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
Wake up.

478
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:55,960
Coming.

479
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
Where is that lady?

480
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:01,960
What lady?

481
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,960
I'm that lady, remember?

482
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,960
Boss, did you see that lady?

483
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
That lady?

484
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
No.

485
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
No.

486
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,960
You!

487
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,960
Where did you hide the lady?

488
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,960
Who hid the lady?

489
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,960
I...

490
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
Oh no.

491
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,960
That's the kidnapper!

492
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,960
Call the police!

493
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
Boss.

494
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,960
Police!

495
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,960
What?

496
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,960
It's you!

497
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,960
Listen to me.

498
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,960
Go out and talk.

499
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,960
Go out and talk.

500
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:31,960
It's you!

501
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
Hurry up!

502
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,960
It's him!

503
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,960
I'll kill you!

504
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,960
Okay, okay.

505
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,960
It's him.

506
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,960
It's him.

507
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Oh no.

508
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,960
Even if you don't kill me,

509
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
I'll kill myself this time.

510
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
According to the cause,

511
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,960
Da Hai should have woken up long ago.

512
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,960
Why hasn't he come?

513
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:01,960
Might as well

514
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,960
leave a mark for him

515
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,960
and go straight to the temple to meet.

516
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
I wonder

517
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,960
how Lu Yan is doing?

518
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
I hope no one knows about it.

519
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,960
Where is he?

520
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,360
Did I say too much yesterday?

521
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,520
No matter what,

522
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,920
it's to save me.

523
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,680
We agreed to meet for two hours.

524
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,440
How long has it been?

525
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:43,800
No.

526
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,640
I can't wait anymore.

527
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,360
The robbers who killed Yingdu

528
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,080
have been caught.

529
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:51,760
Look at them.

530
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,160
Let's go.

531
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,160
It's him.

532
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,960
It's him.

533
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,760
Hit him.

534
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,360
Hit him.

535
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:56,960
Hit him.

536
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,560
Hit him.

537
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,160
Hit him.

538
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:58,760
Hit him.

539
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,360
Hit him.

540
00:24:59,360 --> 00:24:59,960
Hit him.

541
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,560
What's going on?

542
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,360
It's him.

543
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:01,960
It's him.

544
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,560
Hit him.

545
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,160
Hit him.

546
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,760
Stop.

547
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,160
Take out your pass.

548
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,160
Hurry.

549
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:12,760
Let them go.

550
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,160
They've been lost.

551
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,360
What's the use of you?

552
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:15,960
Director.

553
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,560
They're too cunning.

554
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,760
They're too cunning.

555
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,360
Hey,

556
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,560
where are you going?

557
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,160
You don't look like a local.

558
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:35,360
Feng Xingzheng.

559
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,360
I forgot to bring it.

560
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,360
Stop playing with me.

561
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,560
Take off your glasses.

562
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,360
My eyes are burning.

563
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,560
What are you looking at?

564
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,160
Why do I see you look familiar?

565
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,360
Kong Jiliang.

566
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,160
Captain.

567
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,160
I've seen you before.

568
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,560
Officer Zhang.

569
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:56,560
I...

570
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,160
Miss Bai.

571
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,960
Why are you here?

572
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,960
Why are you here?

573
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,160
Miss Bai.

574
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,760
Yingdu City is not peaceful recently.

575
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,960
Why are you here alone?

576
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,960
I'm here to find my friend.

577
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,560
The one in front of you.

578
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,960
He's your friend?

579
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,560
Yes.

580
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,160
I'm a classmate in Shenzhen.

581
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,760
Don't report to my father.

582
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,760
How can I?

583
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,160
Miss.

584
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,960
You look like a wanted criminal.

585
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,360
Officer Zhang.

586
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,560
Do you think I don't even recognize my classmate?

587
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,160
How dare I?

588
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,360
I'm a man of my word.

589
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,760
Here you are.

590
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,360
I'll go first.

591
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,560
Go.

592
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,760
What are you doing?

593
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
I'm helping you.

594
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,360
I know.

595
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,360
I'm asking why you're helping me.

596
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,560
Because you saved my life on the mountain road.

597
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,760
I want to repay you.

598
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,160
Is this enough?

599
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,560
Then you're a good man.

600
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,760
You can't tell others about me.

601
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,360
Otherwise I'll...

602
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,160
I know.

603
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,160
You'll come back to me.

604
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
Don't worry.

605
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,960
I'm a man of my word.

606
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,760
You're Bai Shiqi, right?

607
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,160
I want to ask you something.

608
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,960
Miss Bai...

609
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,160
Forget it.

610
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,160
Forget it.

611
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,360
You...

612
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,160
I have a question.

613
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,160
You've helped me.

614
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,760
We're even now.

615
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,960
What else do you want to ask?

616
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,760
Why did you come to Yingdu?

617
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,560
And you were going to pick up the car of our Bai family

618
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,160
as a bandit?

619
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,160
It's none of your business.

620
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,360
Can you tell me your name?

621
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
Gu Bei Xi.

622
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,360
And...

623
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,760
You can't tell your family about my name.

624
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,560
Got it?

625
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,960
Got it.

626
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,760
Gu Bei Xi.

627
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,160
Da Hai was caught.

628
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,160
I want to borrow some from you.

629
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,360
I know what you're going to do.

630
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,360
You're not allowed to go.

631
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:19,960
No matter how much I borrow from you today,

632
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,360
I'll pay you 10 times more in the money.

633
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,760
Do you think this is a matter of guns and bullets?

634
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,960
But Peng Da Hai is very timid.

635
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,160
If the police force him to do something,

636
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,560
he'll definitely be unable to take it.

637
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,560
Yu Deng Deng.

638
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,560
That's the police station.

639
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,560
It's not a joke.

640
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,760
You can't stop him.

641
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,960
What do you think we should do?

642
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,560
Don't worry.

643
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,760
I'll go to the police station first.

644
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,760
No.

645
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,960
Even if Xiao Ye doesn't want to die,

646
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,360
I'll help you save Da Hai.

647
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,760
No.

648
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,760
I have to see Da Hai no matter what.

649
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,960
I have to confirm his safety.

650
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,760
I'm afraid that Chief Bai

651
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,960
will blame Da Hai for everything.

652
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,160
He'll be the scapegoat for all the missing cases in the city.

653
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,960
But what's the use?

654
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,360
You're just a scapegoat.

655
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,760
Yes.

656
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,160
If you want to save Da Hai,

657
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,360
I have to turn myself in.

658
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
What?

659
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
Turn yourself in?

660
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
Are you crazy?

661
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,560
Isn't it enough to go in?

662
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,960
Listen to me first.

663
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,160
This is a chance to return the soldiers.

664
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,760
Ying Du is a gathering place of the forest tribe.

665
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,360
There should be a lot of bad things happening.

666
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,360
I said I was a hunter.

667
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,760
I can only bet one.

668
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,760
I bet that Chief Bai

669
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,360
wants to find those missing people

670
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,760
and his little Yitai.

671
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,960
If it doesn't work,

672
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,760
I still have reinforcements.

673
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,960
Lu Yan, Lu Yan.

674
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,560
Can you hear me?

675
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,960
My disciple Peng Da Hai has been arrested.

676
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,960
I need your help now.

677
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,960
If you help me today,

678
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,760
I'll pay you back ten times in the future.

679
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,560
I'll keep my word.

680
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,960
It's disgusting.

681
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,960
Little boy, let me tell you.

682
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,760
I'm very tired.

683
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,360
I'm curious about you. I want to sleep.

684
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,960
Can you tell me where the little Yitai is?

685
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:25,960
Can you?

686
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,760
I didn't see it.

687
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,360
You didn't see it?

688
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,360
Let me help you think about it.

689
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,560
You didn't see it, right?

690
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,760
You didn't see it.

691
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,960
You didn't see it.

692
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,160
I didn't see it.

693
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,560
You didn't see it, right?

694
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:44,960
Say it.

695
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,160
Chief Bai.

696
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,960
Where is the little Yitai?

697
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,760
Chief Bai, listen to me.

698
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,560
Do you remember?

699
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,360
Chief Bai.

700
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,560
Where are those missing people?

701
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,160
I didn't see it.

702
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,760
Where are you?

703
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,160
I didn't see it.

704
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,960
Say it.

705
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,960
I didn't see it.

706
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
You didn't see it, right?

707
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,560
I told you to go away.

708
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:56,960
Chief Bai.

709
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,560
Did you see it?

710
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,560
Chief Bai, he's really new here.

711
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,360
He's the same as the name of the gate we entered and left.

712
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,360
You idiot.

713
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,760
That name tag won't be wrong.

714
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,160
Look.

715
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,760
Now, for this case,

716
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,960
I'm being watched every day.

717
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,360
I'm so angry.

718
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,360
Isn't this a criminal in the county?

719
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,960
Let me go up there and catch a new one.

720
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,960
Chief, I'm warning you.

721
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,360
Come.

722
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,760
The criminal, Peng Dahai.

723
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
I'm here.

724
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,760
I'm here.

725
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,760
I'm here.

726
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,760
I'm here.

727
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
I'm here.

728
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,760
I'm here.

729
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,960
Peng Dahai.

730
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,560
I'll give you one last chance.

731
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Say it.

732
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Where are my little Yi Tai and those who were kidnapped?

733
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,960
I'm really innocent.

734
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
Write it.

735
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,360
Kill the West Tree.

736
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,960
Throw the stone into the river.

737
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,160
And where are your accomplices?

738
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,360
That guy.

739
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,760
I'm here to turn myself in.

740
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,760
Don't move.

741
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,960
Don't move.

742
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,760
Let your chief Bai come out and see me.

743
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,760
I'm here.

744
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,360
Let's go.

745
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,760
Write it.

746
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,560
Three people are wanted.

747
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,560
Chief.

748
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,960
Chief.

749
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,360
The accomplice, Yu Dengdeng, has turned himself in.

750
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,560
What's that?

751
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,760
I'm dead.

752
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,560
Chief.

753
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,680
-'Dahai.

754
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,160
Why are you here?

755
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,360
Please leave quickly.

756
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,760
Chief Bai, this has nothing to do with him.

757
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,360
This has nothing to do with him.

758
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,360
Dahai.

759
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,360
It's fine.

760
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,360
They can't do anything to me.

761
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,560
Who knows how to turn himself in?

762
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,360
Explain your own problem first.

763
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,360
I heard that the chief Bai of the capital is a wise man.

764
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,160
But he's not like this today.

765
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,760
He's really a fool.

766
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,560
Chief Bai, I'm not here to turn myself in today.

767
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,960
I'm here to help you.

768
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,360
Help me? Thank you.

769
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,160
Miss Yu Deng Deng, right?

770
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,160
You idiot!

771
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,360
You helped me.

772
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,360
Do you know how much you've committed?

773
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,760
Killing and kidnapping.

774
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,560
That's a headache.

775
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,160
Whether it's a headache or not,

776
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:57,160
you have to hear me out first.

777
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,760
Say it.

778
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,560
I heard that the capital is the home of the Lin family.

779
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,960
As the official here,

780
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,560
you should have heard about it.

781
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,960
Stop talking nonsense.

782
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,860
We never advocate these

783
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,760
strange and chaotic things.

784
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,960
Why are you nervous?

785
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,760
You should have heard about it.

786
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,560
I believe you've heard and seen

787
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,560
some strange things happen.

788
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,160
To be honest,

789
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,360
the Lin family does exist.

790
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,160
My apprentice and I

791
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,760
are the special scouts of the Lin family.

792
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,960
That day,

793
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,760
we came to the dark cloud

794
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,360
under the capital.

795
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,560
There will be a disaster soon.

796
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,160
And I'm sure that

797
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,160
the disappearance of the Lin family

798
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,760
in the capital is done by the Lin family.

799
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,360
It's true. It's true.

800
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:53,760
Chief Bai,

801
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,960
I stopped the carriage at your mansion that day

802
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,360
because I knew that

803
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,960
the Lin family would attack your family.

804
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,360
Fortunately, my apprentice and I

805
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,160
arrived in time and conquered the Lin family.

806
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,360
Otherwise,

807
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,960
your family would not only disappear.

808
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,960
I'm afraid that

809
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,560
you're already in trouble.

810
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,560
I'm sorry.

811
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,760
I'm sorry.

812
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,760
I'm sorry.

813
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,760
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

817
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,760
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

823
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,760
I'm sorry.

824
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
I'm sorry.
