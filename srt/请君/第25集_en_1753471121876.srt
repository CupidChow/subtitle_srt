1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,100
Once the

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:23,720
cleaning of the

3
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,720
Love is a long-lasting love, love is very unwavering

4
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,720
Follow me, let's go far away

5
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,720
Never say let go

6
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:12,720
You are me

7
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:20,720
You are me

8
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:28,720
You are me

9
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:36,720
You are me

10
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,720
You are me

11
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,720
Episode 3

12
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,720
Sir

13
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,720
Sir, what's wrong?

14
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
Nothing

15
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,720
Is it because of what the owner's father said?

16
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,720
What?

17
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,720
Actually, the dragon pattern they just talked about

18
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:23,720
I have one

19
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,720
And now I'm the only one who has it

20
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,720
What's going on?

21
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,720
This dragon pattern was left by my father

22
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,720
He reminded me never to forget the dangers of the human race

23
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
Anti-ghost race

24
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,720
But the owner said he...

25
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,720
I also think it's very strange

26
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,720
Now the most important thing is to find the Beecheng Pearl

27
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,720
I will find a chance to find out the truth

28
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,720
Shi Qi

29
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,720
Shi Qi

30
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,720
Shi Qi

31
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,720
Shi Qi

32
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
Shi Qi

33
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,720
Shi Qi

34
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Shi Qi

35
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,720
Shi Qi

36
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,720
Shi Qi

37
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Don't come over

38
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,720
Don't come over

39
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,720
Don't come over

40
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
Don't come over

41
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
Don't be afraid

42
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm human

43
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
There are monsters

44
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,720
They caught so many people

45
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,720
Don't be afraid

46
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,720
I ask you

47
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,720
Did you see a sister with long hair in white?

48
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,720
She was caught

49
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,720
She was caught

50
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,720
Is it the sister who took this gun?

51
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,720
She was caught

52
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,720
That sister shot a monster

53
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
Didn't hit

54
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,720
Then she was caught by the monster

55
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Dad

56
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,720
We should set out

57
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
Where are they?

58
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
What's wrong?

59
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
My father is missing

60
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
My second father is missing too

61
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,720
Last night

62
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,720
I did hear the footsteps of the two of them leaving the room

63
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
They must have gone to find that fool

64
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,720
Strange

65
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
Why is there no one?

66
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,720
My father didn't come here

67
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,720
Where did the fool go to the sea?

68
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,720
He should have left not long ago

69
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
My father left me a mark

70
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,720
I have something to do with Lv Er

71
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,720
Misunderstanding

72
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,720
This old man

73
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,720
I didn't tell him

74
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,720
Who?

75
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,720
What's going on?

76
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
Open the door

77
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
I

78
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,720
Someone is setting fire outside

79
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,720
Someone is setting fire outside

80
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
How dare you set fire to your grandma?

81
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
I'll show you

82
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,720
I won't give you a chance to save the hero

83
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
Next time

84
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
Go back to the village

85
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,720
I'll come out for your grandma

86
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
You can set fire and hide in the dark

87
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
What's the matter?

88
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,720
The person who set fire is not around

89
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
Run so fast

90
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,720
We only talked to this fool for a few words

91
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Someone is going to kill someone

92
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,720
It seems that this fool really knows some secrets that are not known

93
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,720
Maybe this is the key to the strange and strange things in this village

94
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
Master

95
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
What's going on?

96
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Don't mind what's going on with me

97
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
I told you to take care of people

98
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Where are they?

99
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Almost put it down

100
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Master, hurry up and go with me to save the fool

101
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
I slept too late at night

102
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
I didn't pay attention

103
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
When I woke up, I found that many villagers went to the fool's room

104
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
I dragged him away

105
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
I followed them secretly

106
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
I found that they were going to kill the fool

107
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
Hurry up

108
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
Hurry up

109
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Kill him

110
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
Kill him

111
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
Kill him

112
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
It's a trap

113
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
It's a trap

114
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,720
Stop

115
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,720
What are you doing?

116
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Dare to kill people privately

117
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,720
Is there any law?

118
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
You are evil

119
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
You are evil

120
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
You are monsters

121
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,720
I think you are more like monsters

122
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
I warn you

123
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,720
This is the private matter of our village

124
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
You guys hurry up and leave now

125
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
Let's save water and not drink water

126
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
I don't ask about my aunt and me

127
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
What kind of person is Yu Deng Deng?

128
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,720
I just like to be idle

129
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
You guys are so noisy

130
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
I'll take care of this

131
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,720
This fool is a sinner in our village

132
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
He shouldn't have come back

133
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,720
Sinner

134
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
He offended the man in the bridge

135
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
He even wants to reveal the secrets inside

136
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,720
Is it to let our whole village die with him?

137
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
Who is the man in the bridge?

138
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,720
The man in the bridge is the god of the mountain

139
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
It's the guardian spirit of the village

140
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,720
He blesses our village with good weather

141
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,720
The villagers are happy and healthy

142
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Who is against the man in the bridge?

143
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,720
Who is our enemy?

144
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Protect the man in the bridge

145
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Protect the man in the bridge

146
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Protect the man in the bridge

147
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
Protect the man in the bridge

148
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Protect the man in the bridge

149
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
You can't take him away

150
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
If we let him go today

151
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
The god spirit in the mountain will not spare us

152
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,720
I have to take him away today

153
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Go

154
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Can we take him away now?

155
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
You

156
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
You

157
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Sir, master

158
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,720
Still no news from the old village head

159
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
Woke up, master

160
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
You woke up

161
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,720
Did two old people come to you yesterday?

162
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Master

163
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
It's okay

164
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
It's okay

165
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
We won't hurt you

166
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
It's okay

167
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Don't be afraid

168
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
Don't be afraid

169
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
It's okay

170
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,720
Who is so vicious?

171
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,720
Who is so vicious?

172
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Who are you?

173
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,720
Do you remember what happened just now?

174
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
The village head wants to kill you

175
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
I remember

176
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,720
I was knocked out by the villagers

177
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,720
You saved me

178
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
It's us

179
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
What do you remember?

180
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Did two old people come to you last night?

181
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Yes

182
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
What did they do to you?

183
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,720
They asked me

184
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
I can't sleep

185
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,720
It smells good

186
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,720
The sunflower seeds are also on the roof

187
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Go

188
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Woke up

189
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
Don't be afraid

190
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
Don't be afraid, kid

191
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Don't be afraid

192
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,720
Don't be afraid

193
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
I have two things to ask you

194
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
The first thing

195
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,720
You used to be a embroiderer

196
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,720
How did you become this look now?

197
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,720
You are not a fool to ask a fool

198
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,720
What's the matter?

199
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Show you something

200
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,720
This is called a bichengzhu

201
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:10,720
This is called a toteng

202
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Think about it

203
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
Where have you seen

204
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
The village head

205
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,720
The village head

206
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,720
You mean

207
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,720
Where there are people in the village

208
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,720
I've seen this before

209
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,720
The village head

210
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
Let's go

211
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
The village head

212
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
This is the pattern

213
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,720
This is the dragon pattern you've been talking about

214
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
Where have you seen this dragon pattern?

215
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
To put it long

216
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,720
Bailou Village

217
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,720
It was originally an ordinary village

218
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
I grew up here

219
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
Until I was a teenager

220
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
I made embroidery

221
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Go to school and teach

222
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
Just left here

223
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,720
I found out after I came back

224
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,720
Bailou Village has changed

225
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
Everyone has no expression on their faces

226
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
And many of my childhood partners

227
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
All missing

228
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
Who are you looking for?

229
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:20,720
Grandma

230
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
I'm Sun Xiucai

231
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
I'm looking for Da Niu

232
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,720
Da Niu went over there

233
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,720
Where?

234
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,720
Our Da Niu went over there to be a man of the bridge

235
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,720
I went there to live a divine life

236
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
Man of the bridge

237
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,720
Shui Sheng went to be a man of the bridge

238
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
What is the man of the bridge?

239
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,720
Man of the bridge is the god of Bailou Village

240
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,720
My friends all went to be a man of the bridge

241
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
But no one can say clearly

242
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,720
What is the man of the bridge?

243
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Later I found out

244
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
Those missing people

245
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,720
When I went to the village to fish

246
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,720
No trace

247
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
For a search

248
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
I also went to the west

249
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Go by boat

250
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Enter a cave

251
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,720
After entering the cave

252
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,720
I do not remember

253
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
I only remember

254
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
Something terrible happened there

255
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,720
I was very scared after I came out

256
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
I want to tell the truth to the villagers

257
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,720
But they blocked my mouth and didn't let me say

258
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,720
Then

259
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,720
Then those villagers are behind you

260
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
Fixed two bronze nails

261
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Causing you to lose your memory

262
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
They are afraid that I will tell the secret of the person in the bridge

263
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
The village is in a disaster

264
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Think again

265
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,720
What is there in this cave?

266
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,720
What is the connection between this dragon pattern and the god of Bichen?

267
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Are you okay?

268
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,720
I am in a dark place

269
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,720
Is the firefly

270
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,720
The firefly took me out

271
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,720
What about the god of Bichen?

272
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,720
Have you seen the god of Bichen?

273
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
I can't remember

274
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
I just saw these pictures

275
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
I feel so scared

276
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
I can't go there

277
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,720
That's you

278
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
You calm down

279
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,720
It's okay

280
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
No more thinking

281
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,720
You take a break

282
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
This warrior

283
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,720
We have left all the money

284
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,720
Please make it convenient for the warrior

285
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,720
Let us go

286
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Gu Zhai Zhuo

287
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
Say you will take me to eat meat and drink

288
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,720
No experiment

289
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
Gu Meixi

290
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
Then you have to promise me

291
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,720
Will definitely come to me

292
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
You don't come

293
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,720
I'm not leaving

294
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,720
Shen Qi

295
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
Sorry

296
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,720
I'm late

297
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,720
Shen Qi

298
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
Shen Qi

299
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
Boss

300
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,720
Boss, I finally found you

301
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Are you okay?

302
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
I heard about Miss Bai on the way

303
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,720
I'm sorry, boss

304
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,720
Did you say she was really dead?

305
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
She said

306
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,720
I won't come

307
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
She won't go

308
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,720
Boss, I know Miss Bai is gone

309
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,720
You are very sad

310
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,720
But I heard that Yu Zhai Zhuo

311
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,720
They went to the east

312
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
There has been no news for many days

313
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,720
Will it be

314
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,720
What danger is it?

315
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720
Boss, people die and cannot be revived

316
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Miss Bai has left

317
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,720
What is Yu Zhai Zhuo doing?

318
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,720
Where did you say Yu Dang Dang went?

319
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,720
She went to the east

320
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,720
Be careful

321
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
Isn't this the entrance direction that the fool said?

322
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
There is no hole

323
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
The fool won't lie to us, right?

324
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
He didn't lie to us

325
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
We were all deceived by the blind spell in front of us

326
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,720
This is a kind of time-space miscalculation spell that the spirit clan used

327
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,720
The hole miscalculation spell

328
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
The entrance to the cave he saw

329
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,720
It's just a kind of expression

330
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
This entrance can turn into anything else

331
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
So the people who escaped

332
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,720
Even if you make a mark

333
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
I can't find the original way

334
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
Can't go back

335
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
I understand

336
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
It's a bit like the one in the picture

337
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
The peach blossom garden

338
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,720
Right?

339
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,720
The entrance

340
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,720
Let's go

341
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,720
It's so dark

342
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
Right?

343
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
It's dark

344
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Slow down

345
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,720
Don't fall

346
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
Boss, we are here

347
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
What is this?

348
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
The person who is here

349
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,720
The person who is here

350
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Boss

351
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
Don't fall

352
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,720
I'm scared

353
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
Don't fall

354
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Don't fall

355
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
Don't fall

356
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
Be careful

357
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Everyone be careful

358
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,720
Follow the person in front

359
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
Boss

360
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,720
Do you think this place is a passage to the Yeluo Hall?

361
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Why is it so scary?

362
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,720
Don't talk nonsense

363
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,720
Don't scare yourself

364
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Hurry up

365
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,280
Here's a

366
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,200
A

367
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,300
the

368
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,500
Brother

369
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,160
Chun Blanch.

370
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,200
No wonder only the spirit

371
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,240
can take such a角s.

372
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,720
Who can separe the two previous stories?

373
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,880
This one.

374
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,280
Hu Na.

375
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,480
Hu Na.

376
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,080
Come.

377
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,000
Come over here.

378
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,920
Hello.

379
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,920
Mr. Ye, you're right.

380
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,120
How did you know?

381
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,520
You've been here before?

382
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,920
I know this place

383
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,520
because it's the same as the old capital of the Gu Shu.

384
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,920
What?

385
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,920
What's written on this stone tablet?

386
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,520
It's written that

387
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,120
the history of the conflict between the people of the Gu Shu

388
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,520
and the forest tribes 3,000 years ago.

389
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,120
With one foundation,

390
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,920
it's a great achievement for the forest tribes.

391
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Mr. Ye,

392
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,320
it seems to be written by you.

393
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
Maybe

394
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,920
the Gu Shu immigrants

395
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:40,920
wrote it.

396
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
I don't know.

397
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,920
I don't know.

398
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
I don't know.

399
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
I don't know.

400
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,920
Maybe the Gu Shu immigrants wrote it.

401
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,920
If the Gu Shu immigrants really wrote it,

402
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,920
it's been 3,000 years.

403
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,920
It's not changed at all.

404
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Maybe the forest tribes did it.

405
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,920
I've been here

406
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,920
and there's no smell of the forest tribes.

407
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,920
Although this city

408
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
is different from the outside world,

409
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,920
it doesn't scare a man.

410
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,920
Is this the place

411
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
where he came from?

412
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,920
Let's look around.

413
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,920
Let's split up.

414
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,920
It's so big here.

415
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:19,920
It's faster to split up.

416
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,920
We go to the east, you go to the west.

417
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,920
There are no forest tribes here anyway.

418
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,920
It's not a threat to us.

419
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Okay.

420
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,920
If there's a danger,

421
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,920
remember to call me by a taxi.

422
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,920
Okay, don't worry.

423
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Let's go.

424
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
No, right?

425
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
Why do you want to split up?

426
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,920
Don't you think the production city is weird?

427
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,920
It's built according to the Gu Shu's old capital.

428
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,920
And the story on the stone tablet

429
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,920
is based on the road.

430
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,920
So you think...

431
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,920
The person who built the city

432
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,920
must have a close relationship with him.

433
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,920
He must have noticed this.

434
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,920
That's why he agreed to split up with us.

435
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,920
If a woman who loves him saw it,

436
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,920
I have to let him deal with it first.

437
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,920
No, master, aren't you afraid?

438
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,920
The person who loves him took him away.

439
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
Impossible.

440
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,920
I like men.

441
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,920
No one can take it away.

442
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,920
Okay, master, that's enough.

443
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Don't think about it.

444
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:05,920
Let's split up and find my father.

445
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,920
See if the second master has left us any clues.

446
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:07,920
Let's go.

447
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,920
Master, this is...

448
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,920
This used to be the old capital of the Gu Shu Palace.

449
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,920
General Lu Yan, please bless my three sons

450
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,920
to marry the princess and get married soon.

451
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,920
Don't get married again.

452
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,920
General Lu Yan?

453
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,920
Master, is this statue of you?

454
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,920
It can't be the same.

455
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,920
It's the same.

456
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,920
It can't be the same.

457
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,920
It can only be that it has nothing to do with it.

458
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,920
That's right.

459
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:52,920
Stop!

460
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,920
Did you see any suspicious people?

461
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,920
No.

462
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:55,920
Let's go.

463
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,920
Stop!

464
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,920
Did you see any suspicious people?

465
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
No.

466
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,920
Wei Du?

467
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,920
Master, let's go.

468
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Let's go.

469
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,920
Everyone is here.

470
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,920
Today is the full moon.

471
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,920
I'm here to congratulate you all.

472
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,920
I've prepared a few drinks.

473
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,920
I'll toast to everyone.

474
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,920
Father, have you thought of the name of the castle?

475
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,920
I've thought of it.

476
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,920
I'll name it Jin.

477
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Liu Jin.

478
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:30,920
Okay.

479
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:31,920
Let's go.

480
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
Let's go.

481
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,920
Let's go.

482
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,920
Isn't this the mark left by Master?

483
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,920
Cheng Nan.

484
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,920
Cheng Nan.

485
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,920
Cheng Nan.

486
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
The whole city is looking for a place.

487
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,920
Where can Master and the others go?

488
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,920
They won't run away.

489
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
He broke the iron shoe and destroyed the place.

490
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,920
He's getting all the credit.

491
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,920
I have to tell Master.

492
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,920
There's another one here.

493
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
There's more?

494
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,920
Master.

495
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
Be careful.

496
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
Master.

497
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
Look.

498
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
It's gone when you get here.

499
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
The underground palace?

500
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,920
Did my father go into the underground palace?

501
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
What's this?

502
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
Be careful.

503
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
Who are you?

504
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
Be careful.

505
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
What's going on?

506
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,920
General, they're the ghost tribe.

507
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,880
General has ordered the battle

508
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,800
Can the court decide who shall come in or not

509
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,280
General

510
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,840
don't be upset

511
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,560
I think

512
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,720
very well

513
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:21,920
look

514
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,320
Lin Feng

515
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,320
General.

516
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,080
It's really you.

517
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,200
It's really you.

518
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:36,760
General.

519
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,680
You're finally back.

520
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,960
General.

521
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
Wei Du.

522
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,480
Why is it you?

523
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,840
General.

524
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:55,960
Always am so worried

525
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,320
about you.

526
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,840
When the Ukrainian soldiers

527
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,560
shot a Widow inlehad

528
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,140
say they

529
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,360
would never

530
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,600
shoot an rapport.

531
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,000
And

532
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,800
if we

533
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,560
gone through

534
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,700
Green

535
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,580
Luyan

536
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,260
What the hell is going on?

537
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,940
The werewolf

538
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,820
General, please

539
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,340
as far as I know

540
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,660
You don't like the palace designed those days

541
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,060
So the general's mansion

542
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,300
was built

543
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,380
after you left the palace

544
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,680
The grass and the wood

545
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,280
are all made according to your preference.

546
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,800
The backyard is a single room.

547
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,960
There are four rooms

548
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,400
for four people.

549
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,680
The palace of Shu State?

550
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,920
So you're not the general of the Shu State,

551
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,440
but the prince.

552
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,040
Our general

553
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,880
is the prince that the late king values most.

554
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,880
The late king wanted to entrust the country to the general.

555
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,240
But the general took the initiative

556
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,160
to lead us to the battlefield

557
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,720
to resist the spirit.

558
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,840
All the past

559
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,560
are just like the past.

560
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,080
Master,

561
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,400
you said you would marry a concubine.

562
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,600
You're the general and the prince.

563
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,000
You'll definitely make a fortune.

564
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,000
What concubine?

565
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
She's Lu Yan.

566
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,560
Lu Yan is the concubine my master

567
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,440
married to the mountain.

568
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,280
How dare you!

569
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,680
A man should respect his own son.

570
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,600
How can our general

571
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,080
be a concubine to you?

572
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,440
He's really your deputy general.

573
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,400
He's exactly like you.

574
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:50,560
Wei Du,

575
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,160
they're just kidding.

576
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
Don't mind them.

577
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,560
How dare you joke with the general!

578
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,240
Chu Ran,

579
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,560
let's go over there.

580
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,000
What's this?

581
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,120
A jade vase.

582
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:06,800
My goodness.

583
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,520
It's huge.

584
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:09,960
General,

585
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,160
is she really the sacred daughter of the Ling family?

586
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,160
The sacred daughter

587
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,440
is already dead, isn't she?

588
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,880
Is she dead?

589
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,480
Although Yun Xi's body was dead,

590
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,040
her spirit stone hasn't been destroyed.

591
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,120
Look. Look.

592
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,800
I spent more than three thousand years

593
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,280
to recover her spirit stone

594
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,160
and it became the jade lamp today.

595
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,800
What's this?

596
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,040
When you got the spirit stone,

597
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,280
you came back to life.

598
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,120
You didn't know where you were after killing Zhu Rong.

599
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,040
So you went to save the sacred daughter.

600
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,600
Zhu Rong was dead at that time.

601
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,680
The battle of the spirit stone has been over.

602
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,280
Since Yun Xi died to save me,

603
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,760
I should have saved her back.

604
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,280
Then what's your relationship with Miss Yu?

605
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,200
We're married.

606
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,080
What?

607
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:16,880
General,

608
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,240
I've ordered someone to prepare the night-gathering banquet for you.

609
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,000
Everyone,

610
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,600
please follow me.

611
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,200
Please.

612
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,440
What are you looking at, Master?

613
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,560
Let's go.

614
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,000
Let's eat.

615
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:38,560
Let's go.

616
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,120
Coming.

617
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,000
General,

618
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,120
everyone,

619
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,080
please.

620
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,360
Come on.

621
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,080
Good wine.

622
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,720
General Wei,

623
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,280
I'm a straightforward man.

624
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,360
So don't mind if I say something.

625
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,520
I'm just a man.

626
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,320
I'm just a man.

627
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,320
I'm just a man.

628
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,320
I'm just a man.

629
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,320
I'm just a man.

630
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,520
Don't mind if I say something.

631
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,280
Please.

632
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,440
Here's the thing.

633
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,920
I think you're just an ordinary man.

634
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,040
How did you live for so long?

635
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,200
Da Hai.

636
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,040
When General left that year,

637
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,200
the eldest prince inherited the throne.

638
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,800
But the Shu Kingdom was destroyed a few years later.

639
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:38,520
My brothers and I left the capital,

640
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,400
but the other tribes were attacked.

641
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,920
The tribes were trying to test us with the elixir.

642
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,840
Most of our brothers were poisoned to death.

643
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,160
The few brothers we survived

644
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,640
escaped

645
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,360
and got mixed up with the refugees outside the city.

646
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,080
Then,

647
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,320
we don't know where to go.

648
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,320
We don't have the resources to restore the country.

649
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,960
I remember that

650
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,960
the legendary Royal Treasury is in this direction.

651
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,320
So I led a group of refugees

652
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,160
to come here.

653
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,840
General,

654
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,840
it should be ahead.

655
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,360
Okay.

656
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,480
Let's go.

657
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,520
It should be here.

658
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,160
I didn't expect

659
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,640
that the Royal Treasury was found in the underground palace of Shu Kingdom.

660
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,720
There was a skilled hunter in the refugees

661
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,880
who set up a magic mechanism at the entrance.

662
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,320
He made the outside world not to be disturbed.

663
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
After many years,

664
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,960
we brothers who tried the elixir

665
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,360
found that we were not old and not dead.

666
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,640
So we started to build the capital here.

667
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,640
The locals also

668
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,960
rare to see again

669
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,440
and enjoyed their lives here.

670
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:08,800
General,

671
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:29,620
do you remember the ideal city

672
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,600
These three culprit hidden in this palace

673
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,120
are known to be hard to find.

674
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,720
Everyone,

675
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,160
March on.

676
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,560
What exactly is that煙 ventilator?

677
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,680
Only King of Chu

678
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,480
knew where it was.

679
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,160
We have a lot of treasures there, don't we?

680
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,240
Of course.

681
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,000
And the에

682
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,240
was the spirit clan's.

683
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,680
Back then,

684
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,360
the spirit clan wanted to break into the underground palace.

685
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,240
But the underground palace was full of traps.

686
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,640
So the spirit clan

687
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,440
planted the aggressive Ghost Sleeve

688
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,000
to break through the underground palace.

689
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,440
Maybe because Zhurong died,

690
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,200
the spirit clan was in danger,

691
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,680
so they gave up.

692
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,400
Is there any way

693
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,440
to avoid the Ghost Sleeve and enter the underground palace?

694
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,280
There are no people who can get close to the underground palace

695
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,520
without the Ghost Sleeve.

696
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,520
Let alone entering the underground palace.

697
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,720
I order people to guard the underground palace.

698
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,960
First, to guard the underground palace.

699
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,360
Second, to prevent people from breaking in

700
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,120
and getting hurt by the Ghost Sleeve.

701
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,880
General Wei,

702
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,600
since your people guard the underground palace day and night,

703
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,320
have you seen two old men enter?

704
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:52,920
I haven't seen

705
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,640
the two old men you mentioned.

706
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:56,880
Gui Du,

707
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,480
Gui Du,

708
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,040
these two old men are Deng Deng's family.

709
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,440
They are one step ahead of us.

710
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,600
They should be in the underground palace now.

711
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,080
General,

712
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,400
it's impossible.

713
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,080
The underground palace is guarded by the national treasure.

714
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,520
No one is allowed to break in.

715
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,800
Besides,

716
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,680
no one will break in

717
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,200
and get hurt by the Ghost Sleeve.

718
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,760
Then, the two old men...

719
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,080
may still be in the city.

720
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:32,920
Well,

721
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,880
I'll ask people to look for them.

722
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,520
General Wei,

723
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,240
as you said,

724
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,640
there is a formation outside the city

725
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,440
to avoid being disturbed by the outside world.

726
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:46,640
But we passed by a village

727
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,640
and met one person.

728
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,560
He said that many villagers had entered this place by accident.

729
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,520
It's normal that

730
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,880
one or two people had entered by accident for thousands of years.

731
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,000
But they all left.

732
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,120
What about you?

733
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,800
Have you ever left this place?

734
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,920
People in the city

735
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,200
have been living in peace here

736
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,040
and never want to interact with outsiders.

737
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,520
They never go out.

738
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,960
But we saw many people

739
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:18,080
who look like the Shus in that village.

740
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,360
Aren't they

741
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,400
the refugees of the Shus?

742
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,440
Well,

743
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,080
maybe the villagers who had entered this place

744
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,000
saw the Shus

745
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,040
and were used by them.

746
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,080
They've been using them to this day.

747
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,400
What a coincidence!

748
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,960
Wei Du,

749
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,280
we're here

750
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,440
to find out where the Ghost Sleeve is.

751
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,480
Do you have any news

752
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,720
about the Ghost Sleeve?

753
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,160
The national treasure, Bichen Pearl?

754
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,640
Yes.

755
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,800
After the capital was destroyed,

756
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,560
Bichen Pearl was lost.

757
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,440
The specific location...

758
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,200
I need to find out.

759
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,840
Thank you, General Wei.

760
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,840
What's wrong, Deng Deng?

761
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,640
Nothing.

762
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,720
Maybe the wine is too strong.

763
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,120
I'll send you back.

764
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,160
General,

765
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,280
I've ordered people to wait outside.

766
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,760
Miss Yu and the others have prepared the room.

767
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,440
You can rest in peace.

768
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:36,920
Okay.

769
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,440
Guards,

770
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,360
send Miss Yu back to her room.

771
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:40,880
Yes.

772
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,040
We're going back with Master.

773
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,000
Master, let's go.

774
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,600
Let's go.

775
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,120
General,

776
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,800
Miss Yu is a spirit.

777
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,440
The people in the city

778
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,280
are very concerned about her.

779
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,360
Miss Yu, you must be careful

780
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,080
in the city from now on.

781
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,560
Don't worry.

782
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,160
I'll protect her.

783
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,200
General,

784
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,920
I wonder

785
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,320
why you want Bichen Pearl?

786
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,880
Deng Deng's health is not good.

787
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,840
She needs Bichen Pearl to cure her.

788
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,440
Miss Yu's health is not good?

789
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,880
There's a famous doctor in the city.

790
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,400
Why don't I ask him to come and see her?

791
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,520
No need.

792
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,120
As long as we find Bichen Pearl,

793
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,320
Deng Deng will be fine.

794
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,160
That's good.

795
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,560
General,

796
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:47,920
do you remember

797
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,040
the days when we were in the army?

798
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,000
We drank together

799
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,880
and killed enemies together.

800
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:55,880
It was so happy.

801
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,440
We said that the country was strong

802
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,840
and the people were rich.

803
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,720
It was so peaceful.

804
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,000
It was all those spirits.

805
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,080
Those spirits killed our people

806
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,720
and plundered our country.

807
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,840
My head hurts so much.

808
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,680
I'm so tired.

809
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,280
It hurts so much.

810
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,680
What's wrong?

811
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,280
Why does my head hurt so much?

812
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:51,280
The most beautiful scenery

813
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,280
is all about you

814
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,680
When two hearts are so close

815
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,280
When the whole world is occupied by you

816
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,880
I will call for you with all my heart

817
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,080
Until your memory

818
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:20,480
You are the only one

819
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,680
who walks into the scenery

820
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:31,280
This city is so beautiful

821
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,280
The clouds are so beautiful

822
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:39,080
I have so many heart

823
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,680
I will make sure for you

824
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:51,080
Until we are together

825
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,080
When two hearts are so close
