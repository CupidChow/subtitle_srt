1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I won't let go even if you walk away from me

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not me

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's not you

4
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It's not me

5
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's not you

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It's not you

7
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Episode 16

8
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
No, no

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There's nothing strange about this

10
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Stop talking

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Stop talking

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Wei Tu, in this ancient city

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
There's no one alive except you and me

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
In this ancient city

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
There's no one alive except you and me

16
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No

17
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No

18
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No

19
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No

20
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No

21
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No

22
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No

23
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't want to listen

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I don't want to listen

25
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Come back

26
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Come back

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Come back

28
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Come back

29
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No

30
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
General, leave us alone

31
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Please

32
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let us be like this

33
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let us be like this

34
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Wei Tu, this dream should wake up

35
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
This is Zhu Rong's magic array

36
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It makes you in the illusion

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
In the past

38
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You are in the illusion

39
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You are in the illusion

40
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You are in the illusion

41
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You are in the illusion

42
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You are in the illusion

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
So you can't get out

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You are locked here

45
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But it doesn't matter

46
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Wei Tu, I will take you away

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's go

48
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't touch me

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Your memory is real

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Everything is fake

51
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Really?

52
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Ok

53
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let me see

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What did Zhu Rong do to you?

55
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You are still alive

56
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Gou Lingzuo

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You are not dead

58
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I will kill you for the general

59
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Stop

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Stop

61
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Stop

62
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Stop

63
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Stop

64
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Stop

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Stop

66
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Stop

67
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Gou Lingzuo, let me go

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You know little about the magic of the spirit tribe

69
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I have a little trouble

70
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You can solve it for me

71
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't worry

72
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I will get it out in a while

73
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I just want you to listen to me

74
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,860
Channel one,

75
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:35,540
the

76
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,820
There is a village

77
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,920
which is gathering a group of hunting 실� Enter it

78
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,600
You check and kill them

79
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,660
Yes

80
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,900
Let's go hurry

81
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,260
Yes

82
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,720
Everyone stop

83
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,040
Come

84
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,000
I'll be making a path

85
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,040
Hurry

86
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,760
Run

87
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,720
Run

88
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,180
Careful

89
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Look.

90
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
What's this?

91
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,680
What's this?

92
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
What's this?

93
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,960
What's going on?

94
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,960
What's going on?

95
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,320
Help.

96
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Hurry!

97
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,760
Lee Cheon people are来了

98
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,900
Take it

99
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,640
Please

100
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,640
It Your Highness

101
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,600
It was suggested to be chainsaw

102
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,260
What do you mean

103
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,600
How can this case

104
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,160
You said it could not wait

105
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,420
And we must wait

106
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,780
I'm glad you didn't commit

107
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,760
I am well off

108
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,040
Oouw

109
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:19,620
stars

110
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,900
Let me go!

111
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,900
Let me go!

112
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,700
You've been to the Yujia Village?

113
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,340
No.

114
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,420
I...

115
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,380
I can't remember.

116
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:42,900
What did you see?

117
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,100
What did I do?

118
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,580
What?

119
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,100
The King of Shu is not capable.

120
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,340
But the underground palace is well-made.

121
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,700
It's a good place for keeping people.

122
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,180
Wei Du,

123
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:03,220
you've been here

124
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,620
for thousands of years.

125
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:08,100
Waiting for your master to come back to you.

126
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,340
You're such a heartless and pitiful person.

127
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,460
How can you depend on others

128
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,620
but yourself?

129
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,500
General,

130
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,980
I'll come back

131
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,860
to lead us to our country.

132
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,100
I used to think that

133
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,980
Saintess

134
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,020
is the hope of the Spirit Clan.

135
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,140
For this, I risked my life

136
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,260
to get out of the dirt

137
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,740
and bloodiest mud pit

138
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,300
and step by step.

139
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:48,020
But when I was no longer kneeling,

140
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,980
standing by her side,

141
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,940
I found

142
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,180
that the Saintess I once admired

143
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,260
was a coward

144
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,260
who was selfish and weak.

145
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,660
By then,

146
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:04,340
your eyes will naturally open.

147
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,180
You'll find

148
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,500
that you don't need her at all.

149
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,380
You have other choices.

150
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,660
Wei Du

151
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,100
doesn't understand.

152
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,100
You don't need to understand.

153
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,820
You just need to keep this place

154
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,340
and listen to my arrangement.

155
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,980
You've been lonely for so many years.

156
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,820
As your enemy,

157
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,300
I can give you

158
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,100
a dream that will never come true.

159
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,100
Yea.

160
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,780
Zhurong.

161
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,220
What did you do to me?

162
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,900
I'm going to kill you!

163
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
Have you forgotten?

164
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,500
I'm here to help you.

165
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Help me?

166
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Help me?

167
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Yes.

168
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,900
Have you forgotten?

169
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,500
You and your brothers

170
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,500
built your own palace here.

171
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
You've been living here

172
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,500
for thousands of years.

173
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
But recently,

174
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
your bodies

175
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
are getting old.

176
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Only one thing

177
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
can save you.

178
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
That is

179
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
the Beech Pillar.

180
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,500
The Beech Pillar?

181
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
This...

182
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,500
This is...

183
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
Our capital!

184
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Such a good capital!

185
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,500
So many people

186
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
are living in it.

187
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
You can't just give up.

188
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
You can't just give up.

189
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
You can't just give up.

190
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,500
You can't just give up.

191
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
You can't just give up.

192
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
We can't just give up.

193
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,500
Let's make a deal.

194
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,500
You want me

195
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
to make a deal with the Spirit Clan?

196
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
We don't have

197
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
the Spirit Clan and the human race.

198
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
We are all

199
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,500
the same race who want to restore the country.

200
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
You want to restore the country?

201
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
You want to restore the country?

202
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,500
I don't want to.

203
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
I don't want to.

204
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,500
I don't want to.

205
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,500
I don't want to.

206
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
I...

207
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,500
This is not real.

208
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
I don't believe it.

209
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,500
I don't believe it.

210
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,500
Wei Du!

211
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,500
Zhu Rong lied to me.

212
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
The Beech Pillar can't be useless.

213
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Is this fake?

214
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Is this fake?

215
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
I don't believe it.

216
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,500
I don't believe it.

217
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
I don't believe it.

218
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,500
I don't believe it.

219
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,500
I don't believe it.

220
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,500
I don't believe it.

221
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
I don't believe it.

222
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,500
I don't believe it.

223
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,500
I don't believe it.

224
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,500
I don't believe it.

225
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
I don't believe it.

226
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,500
I don't believe it.

227
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,500
I don't believe it.

228
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,500
I don't believe it.

229
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
I don't believe it.

230
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Wei Du?

231
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,500
You woke Wei Du up

232
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
and gave him the fish lantern?

233
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Lu Yan...

234
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,500
You think I can't do anything to you?

235
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,500
This sword

236
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
is from me.

237
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
He has the yuan pellet

238
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,300
and he's become so powerful

239
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,900
Don't be afraid

240
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,900
I won't kill you

241
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,260
Yunxi and I

242
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,900
hope you can live on

243
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,740
The Great Zhou Empire

244
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,740
is surrounded by dragon ginseng

245
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,900
There's a way to live

246
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,900
I hope

247
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,620
you can treat this place as your home

248
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,580
and live peacefully with humans

249
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,740
I finally found you

250
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,100
My real Saintess

251
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,860
I will get back what belongs to our tribe

252
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,100
Tong Dahai

253
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,100
Where did you hide my shoes?

254
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:02,100
I'll kill you

255
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,100
I'll kill you

256
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,100
I'll kill you

257
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,100
I'll kill you

258
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,100
I'll kill you

259
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,100
I'll kill you

260
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,100
I'll kill you

261
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,900
Master, you're awake

262
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:18,900
I told you you need to rest

263
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,900
Master, when you're better

264
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,900
I'll beat you, okay?

265
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,900
Yes, Master

266
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,900
Give it to me

267
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
No

268
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,900
Liya

269
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,900
Tong Dahai, you unfilial son

270
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,900
You haven't come out for a long time

271
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,900
and you didn't wake me up

272
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,900
And you, A'Xin

273
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,900
Don't you worry about your master?

274
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,900
He has no other way

275
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
We all know that Lu Yi Niang is reliable

276
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
She can save herself

277
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,700
You are extremely unreliable

278
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,700
Who is unreliable?

279
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,700
You

280
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
So you're so weak

281
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,700
You just rest

282
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,700
Who is weak? You are weak

283
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,700
I'm weak?

284
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,700
I'm weak

285
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,700
What are you afraid of?

286
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,700
I'll make up

287
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,700
Master, you hurry up

288
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,700
What are you two doing?

289
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,500
Drink it

290
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
I've been drinking for days

291
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,500
I don't drink it anymore

292
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Then you have to drink it

293
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
This is the old ginseng your father found in the mountains this morning

294
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,500
The second master has been working hard for a day

295
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
He saved his life

296
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,500
Besides

297
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,500
If your father's heart

298
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
If he comes back and sees you not moving

299
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
How sad

300
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500
All right

301
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,500
I ask you

302
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Are you two old people?

303
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
Who is not here

304
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Dad

305
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Don't be angry

306
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,500
Dad

307
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
You see my body is already good

308
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
I want to

309
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
I didn't say it

310
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Why can't it work?

311
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
You are a girl

312
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,500
I know what you're doing

313
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,700
I just came back

314
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,700
I have already thanked God

315
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,700
If you come again, I can't help you

316
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,700
It is very possible to go to beg that boy named Lu Yan

317
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,700
Dad

318
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,700
Dad, Lu Yan is the most trustworthy

319
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
But it's been so long

320
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,700
If he is fine, he will definitely send me a message

321
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
But I can't contact him at all

322
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,700
If there is no message

323
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
It means he must have been in trouble

324
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,700
We have to save him

325
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,700
We are still in a mess

326
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,700
It's hard to protect yourself

327
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,700
There is a big knot between good and bad

328
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,700
You are still going to save him

329
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,700
Maybe you have to save you

330
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,700
You see

331
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,700
You also know he will save me, right?

332
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
So we have to go to save him now

333
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,700
I am now

334
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,700
It was all given by Lu Yan

335
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,700
He is also the one who took us to find the Beecheng Pearl

336
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,700
People have to repay the kindness

337
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,700
This is what you taught me

338
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,700
right

339
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,700
Dad

340
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,700
I know you are the best to me

341
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,700
You girl

342
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,700
Ok, ok, ok

343
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,700
Sit down

344
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
Sit down, eat some fruit first

345
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,700
Boy, come out with me

346
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,700
So you agreed

347
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,700
I'll tell you later

348
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,700
Old fish, you are playing tricks

349
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
Wait, wait

350
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
Dad is not cruel to you

351
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,700
Dad doesn't want you to die for this man

352
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,700
Lu Yan

353
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,700
We have to wait for him for another day

354
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,700
If there is no one else, we will roll the roll

355
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,700
Go back to the mansion

356
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
Gu Beixi

357
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,700
Without my order

358
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,700
No one is allowed to open the door for him

359
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,700
Ok, master, don't worry

360
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,700
Go, go, go

361
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,700
Dad, you are lying to me

362
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,700
Master, calm down

363
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,700
We are back

364
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,700
Master, come out

365
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,700
Master, come out

366
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,700
Master, come out

367
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,700
Master, come out

368
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,700
How is it

369
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,700
How is it

370
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,700
I asked you

371
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,700
The result is not good

372
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,700
What do you mean

373
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,700
Not only Baile Village

374
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,700
Surrounded by the village town around the ancient city

375
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,700
Someone disappeared

376
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
The villagers who did not disappear

377
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
Gradually became like the people of Baile Village

378
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
No emotion, no expression

379
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
From five miles to ten miles

380
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,700
This strange disease

381
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:20,760
There are more and more

382
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,760
But it's been decades

383
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,760
There are more strange things than these days

384
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,760
It seems that this place is not to be left for a long time

385
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
such

386
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,760
Pack up tonight

387
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,760
Go back to Qingchuan Town tomorrow morning

388
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:34,760
Master, master

389
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,820
I don't think your mother will agree

390
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,820
Then tie her back

391
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,820
Then master

392
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,820
Go persuade him

393
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,820
No way

394
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,820
No way

395
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,820
Everything here

396
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,820
How could it be fake

397
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,820
Must be Zhu Rong

398
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,820
Must be her

399
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,820
She must be confusing me

400
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,820
This

401
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,820
Isn't this the people who throw themselves to death?

402
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,820
Li Chen Zhu has been taken out of the underground palace

403
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,820
Why would you still absorb the energy of these people

404
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,880
I can't understand

405
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,880
Do you really think

406
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,880
You will die without Bi Chen Zhu

407
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,880
Do you really think

408
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,880
You can't leave here because of Bi Chen Zhu

409
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,880
I do not believe

410
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,880
Who else

411
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,880
Who else

412
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,880
What is real

413
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,880
What is fake

414
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,880
What am I doing in these three thousand years

415
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
What did I do

416
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,880
My head hurts

417
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,880
Am I not working

418
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:32,940
No

419
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,940
Help

420
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,940
No, no, I'm not feeling well

421
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,940
Stop yelling

422
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,940
Your father has arranged it

423
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,940
Know you are fine

424
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,940
Even if you shout

425
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,940
No one will let you go

426
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,940
Gu Zhaizhu

427
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,940
You pity me

428
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,940
I'm not that bold to offend your father

429
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,940
You don't know

430
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,940
Our ancestors have a craft

431
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,940
Massage

432
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,940
Do you want to try

433
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,940
Thank you

434
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,940
No need

435
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,940
I'll treat you to a drink

436
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,940
Not bad for your wine

437
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,940
What's wrong with you today

438
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,940
No knife, no knife

439
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:23,940
Say it

440
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,940
How can I get out

441
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,940
I have other things to ask you

442
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,940
I have other things to ask you

443
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Ask me

444
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Help you tie your father

445
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Let you go out to find that Lu Yan

446
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
You are my brother

447
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Thanks

448
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Can let you go out

449
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
But I have one condition

450
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Take me with you

451
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
No

452
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
This is a dangerous place

453
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
You stay here

454
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Help me take care of my father

455
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:01,060
Help me take care of my father and my father

456
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,060
I do not agree

457
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,060
Bai Shiqi has an accident

458
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,060
I can't watch you

459
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,060
There was an accident in front of me

460
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,060
Miss Bai, she

461
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,060
Can't find

462
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,060
She was expelled from the forest tribe in India

463
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,060
Killed

464
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,060
How come

465
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,060
The people of Xiongya Village

466
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,060
Fu Chou took Shi Qi

467
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,060
After I saved Shi Qi

468
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,120
I let him go to Taiping Village to wait for me

469
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,120
But all this is my own smartness

470
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,120
She trusts me so much

471
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,120
Do I really trust her

472
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
I am also wrong

473
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,120
Those forest tribes are homeless

474
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
Have a grudge

475
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,120
So it caused today's situation

476
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,180
Bai Shiqi died

477
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,180
I was thinking

478
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,180
What kind of people are the forest tribes

479
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,180
You are the forest tribe

480
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,180
A Xing is

481
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,180
Every generation is

482
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,180
But you are all good people

483
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,180
But those who kill others are also the forest tribe

484
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,180
They can turn their faces

485
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,180
But kill the innocent

486
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,180
I think

487
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,180
Whether it's human or the forest tribe

488
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,180
Everyone has their own difficulties

489
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,240
But the difficulties can't be the reason for evil

490
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,240
You have to be able to afford your conscience

491
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,240
Just like others think we are not serious

492
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
But what I do

493
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,240
I think it's worthy of the people and conscience

494
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,240
I don't think we're bad

495
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
As long as we can protect the weak and the good

496
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,240
Whether it's the forest tribe or the human

497
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,240
It's worth admiring

498
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
I think

499
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,300
So you take me to see

500
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,300
Look at this place related to the forest tribe

501
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,300
I want to get it clear in person

502
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,300
Shiqi

503
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,300
Still waiting for us to avenge her

504
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,300
Besides

505
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,300
I am lucky

506
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,300
I am also good at shooting

507
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,300
Can't die

508
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,300
You can't miss me

509
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,300
Wait

510
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,300
What happened

511
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,300
The same shoes before

512
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,300
After waking up, I have been talking about something

513
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,300
What house

514
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,300
Let's go ask it clearly

515
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,300
go

516
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,300
Xiaomei

517
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,300
Xiaomei

518
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,300
What does the house you saw look like

519
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,300
Xiaomei

520
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,300
Xiaomei

521
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,300
Xiaomei

522
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,300
Xiaomei

523
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
What does the house look like

524
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,360
There is a door

525
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,360
And a tree

526
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,360
A tree

527
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,360
I can't remember

528
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,360
I almost died in that room

529
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,360
There seems to be something in that room

530
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
It will eat people

531
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,360
It will eat people

532
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,360
It will eat people

533
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,360
Will the tree eat people

534
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
Will there be a forest tribe in the underground palace

535
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,360
But why is it in the underground palace

536
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,420
Let's go find Lu Yan quickly

537
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,420
Tell him this news

538
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,420
Let's go

539
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,420
We run all the way

540
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
Those forest people chased all the way

541
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,480
Already killed at the gate of the underground palace

542
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,480
The brothers outside

543
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
I don't know how

544
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
This place

545
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,480
Is the secret warehouse of the Shu State

546
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
There are many mechanisms and tools

547
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,480
They can't get in for a while

548
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,480
Everyone is in a rest

549
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,480
Those people who followed us

550
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,480
Still in the valley

551
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Rest

552
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,480
After half an hour

553
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,480
We will kill out

554
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Kill out

555
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,480
Kill out

556
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,480
Are you afraid

557
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
I'm afraid

558
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,480
I really miss my mother

559
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,480
I miss my mother

560
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,480
How many people are we in the next life

561
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,480
492 people

562
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
This is the general's funeral

563
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,480
All the people who are miserable

564
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
Although Zhou Rong died

565
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,480
The first tribe has not been destroyed

566
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
But

567
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,540
I took the general's mother

568
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,540
Ran out

569
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,540
But let the brothers

570
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,540
All died on the road

571
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,540
General Fu

572
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,540
Listen to my military order

573
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,540
This secret room

574
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,540
Still safe

575
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,540
You stay here

576
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,540
Don't go out in three days

577
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,540
Three days later

578
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,540
The spiritual clan should have retired

579
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,540
Then you come out

580
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:31,540
To collect the body for me

581
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,540
General Fu

582
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,540
We want to be with you

583
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,540
The Shu State is almost gone

584
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,540
The general's horse

585
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:45,540
Can't die

586
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,540
After I die

587
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,540
You come out

588
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,540
Collect the body for me

589
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,540
You are here

590
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,540
An Jiasheng

591
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,540
Finish the job

592
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,540
General Fu

593
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,540
General Fu

594
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,540
General Fu

595
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,540
General Fu

596
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,600
General Fu

597
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,600
General Fu

598
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
General Fu

599
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:31,600
General Fu

600
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
General Fu

601
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
What happened

602
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,600
Stop

603
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,660
Zhou Rong

604
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,660
You caused me to lose my best friend

605
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,660
Since a person is three thousand years old

606
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,660
Still said to be deceived by the family

607
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:29,660
Think you still have the past

608
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,660
What happened

609
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,660
Brother

610
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,660
Brother

611
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,660
I'm sorry

612
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,660
Think you still have the past

613
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,660
Come out

614
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,660
Come out

615
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,660
Don't leave me alone

616
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,720
Come out and carry me

617
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,720
Come out

618
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,720
You caused me to recognize the enemy as a friend

619
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,720
Do all the wrong things

620
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,720
Make an irreparable mistake

621
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780
Zhou Rong

622
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,780
You pit me and hurt me

623
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,780
Cheat me and lie to me

624
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,780
You hurt me so hard

625
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,780
I want you to taste it too

626
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,780
The fire of the human world

627
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,780
Was wronged

628
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,780
You are wronged

629
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,780
You are wronged

630
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
You are wronged

631
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,840
The taste of being ruined

632
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,840
It seems that our General Wei Fu has remembered everything

633
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,840
Zhou Rong

634
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,840
Don't look, go

635
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,840
You didn't say before coming

636
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,840
This is too exciting

637
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,840
When you were in Nanfeng Village

638
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,840
I haven't seen you so many cold sweat

639
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,840
Can that be the same

640
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,680
That's all real

641
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,680
Look at this

642
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,880
One by one

643
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,880
No eyes

644
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,880
Don't talk

645
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
Tell the truth

646
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,880
If you want to go out

647
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,880
While Zhou Rong hasn't repaired the internal and external channels yet

648
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,880
It's still too late

649
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,880
Okay, stop talking

650
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,880
I'm not going to talk

651
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,980
Enough brother

652
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,980
Lu Yan, Lu Yan

653
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,980
Can you hear me

654
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:25,980
The original power is also controlled within the formation

655
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,980
Want to find the formation

656
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,980
Don't worry, General Yan

657
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,980
This is just the beginning

658
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,980
Zhu Rong can actually use the formation

659
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:41,980
Let them attack me

660
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,980
I'm not afraid

661
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:45,980
I'm not afraid

662
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:46,980
I'm not afraid

663
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,980
I'm not afraid

664
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:48,980
I'm not afraid

665
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,980
I'm not afraid

666
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:50,980
I'm not afraid

667
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,980
I'm not afraid

668
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,080
Lu Yan, Lu Yan

669
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,080
Can you hear me

670
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
Lu Yan

671
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
The energy here is chaotic

672
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,080
I can't contact him

673
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,080
Then don't contact

674
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,080
Go find him

675
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,080
Where is the master

676
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,080
There is a theater

677
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,080
Lu Yan

678
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,080
You can't break this formation

679
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,180
Don't waste time

680
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,180
Die

681
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,180
How could this be

682
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,180
Such a big formation

683
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,180
There is no sign of shock

684
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,180
General Lu

685
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,180
Look at your good husband

686
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:36,180
What is your loyal dog now

687
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:39,180
This dog has two hard bones

688
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,180
Dozens of wounds

689
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:44,180
Still alive

690
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,180
General

691
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,180
Don't blame me

692
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:50,180
Zhu Rong

693
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,180
He just wants to use your energy

694
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,180
Let you use your strength

695
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,180
He will kill you

696
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,180
General

697
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:04,180
Finding the formation

698
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:06,180
Is the only way to break the formation

699
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,180
Zhu Rong

700
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:10,180
Your energy

701
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,180
Is all used in this formation

702
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,180
Come down

703
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,180
Otherwise

704
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,180
They dare to hide

705
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,280
Who uses this trick

706
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,280
Come out

707
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,280
Come out

708
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,280
Gui Du

709
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,280
Are you okay

710
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,280
General

711
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,280
Don't blame me

712
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,280
I'm sorry

713
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,280
I'm sorry

714
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
I'm sorry

715
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,280
I'm sorry

716
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,280
I'm sorry

717
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
I'm sorry

718
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,280
I'm sorry

719
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,280
I'm sorry

720
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,280
I'm sorry

721
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,280
I'm sorry

722
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,280
I'm sorry

723
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,280
I'm sorry

724
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,280
I'm sorry

725
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,280
I'm sorry

726
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,280
I'm sorry

727
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,280
I'm sorry

728
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,280
I'm sorry

729
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,280
I'm sorry

730
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,280
I'm sorry

731
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,280
I'm sorry

732
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,280
I'm sorry

733
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,280
I'm sorry

734
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,280
I'm sorry

735
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,280
I'm sorry

736
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,280
I'm sorry

737
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,280
I'm sorry

738
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,280
I'm sorry

739
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,280
I'm sorry

740
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
I'm sorry

741
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,180
I will call you with all my heart

742
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:26,180
Until your memory

743
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:32,180
You are the only one

744
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:39,180
Walking into the scenery

745
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,180
This city is like a cloud

746
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:43,180
The clouds and the moon are like four seasons

747
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:46,180
The clouds and the moon are like four seasons

748
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:51,180
I will call you with all my heart

749
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:56,180
Until you remember

750
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,180
When two hearts are so close

751
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:23,180
When the whole world is occupied by you

752
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:27,180
I will call you with all my heart

753
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:32,180
Until your memory

754
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:39,180
You are the only one

755
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:45,180
Walking into the scenery

756
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,180
This city is like a cloud

757
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:49,180
The clouds and the moon are like four seasons

758
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,180
The clouds and the moon are like four seasons

759
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:57,180
I will call you with all my heart

760
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:02,180
Until you remember

761
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:16,180
I will call you with all my heart
