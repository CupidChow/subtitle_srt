Episode 14

5
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What day is it today?

6
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Four days left

7
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Have you packed up?

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
No need to pack up. I trust her

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I also believe in world peace

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You can still laugh?

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
No

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I just thought of something about her

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What do you believe in her?

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I believe what she said will come true

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You've known her for only a few months

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I can't recognize you

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
When did I teach you

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
to trust something that is impossible?

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
It's not something that is impossible

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay, then tell me

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You've been together for so long

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Have you done anything to improve each other?

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why not?

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Even if you have, have you planned for the future?

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The long-term and the present?

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Have you?

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You've learned so much abroad

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You're in the same profession

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Shouldn't you teach her some skills to live and die?

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Did she contact you when she left you?

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yes? Okay

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That means when you face so many difficulties

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
she will still put the limited energy on you

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Does she not have a work plan?

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Aunt, not everyone needs this plan

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But work is needed

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Do you want her to be with you forever?

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Aunt, you only have one dog

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
who will argue with you

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and then you will have a pet

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I think you can go to take a photo now

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The appointment is at 9.30

44
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You have to line up yourself if you're late

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Okay, okay, don't be upset

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I don't doubt your feelings

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
To be honest, I'm a little touched

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But people have to be responsible for their choices

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
If you choose love at this age

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
it means you have to give up your bigger dream

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Think about it

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Think about it

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm sorry

54
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Who is it?

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You service staff are so rude

56
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We're here to talk business

57
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The little ones are good

58
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Come in

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is the cake I made

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I heard you like to drink Pu'er

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Pu'er and Pu'er go well together

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Try it

63
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Go

64
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No, thanks

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't like to talk about people

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Would you like to try it?

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
After all, a gourmet like my mom

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
would like it

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You two should have the same taste

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yes, yes, try it

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I think it's delicious

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'll try it

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
How do you feel?

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Not bad

75
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
A little bit of talent

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Thank you for your compliment

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's a little sweet

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Sweet?

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't know when your mom

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
became a gourmet

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
No, it's delicious

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
A gourmet thinks it's delicious

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I said I don't like to talk about people

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Let's talk about your business

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
5 million, I earned it

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You can take a look at this contract

87
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I don't have so much cash

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But once I travel

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I should have enough money

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
to pay off my debt

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You did a good job

92
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
But didn't you learn

93
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
math and elementary school?

94
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
All your cash

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
plus the part of the settlement

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
is only 4.4 million

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The remaining 600,000

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
are you going to buy lottery tickets

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
or continue?

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's up to you

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Me?

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Take a look at this contract

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Your partner, Miss. Jimei Na

104
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
said that

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
as long as you taste my snacks

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
and admit that it's not bad

107
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
she would like to add

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
600,000 to my investment

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
to transform and expand my red envelope

110
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
That's what Mr. Jin said

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You're good

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You're much better than your mother

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Actually, I just think

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
everyone sees the world in a different way

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You may care more about money

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But in our eyes

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
we only think it's a string of numbers

118
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Who can say that

119
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
the happiness of getting a contract

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
is lower than eating a delicious dessert

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
and the happiness?

122
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Who can say that

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
people who start a business abroad

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
will live happier than those who are loved?

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Right, mom?

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yes

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
At least these years

128
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I've been very happy

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
But I miss you very much

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Tingting

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
How are you doing abroad these years?

132
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What do you think?

133
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I think you've lost weight

134
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Don't be angry

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't be angry

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You've been gone for so long

137
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
and your hair is so long

138
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Then you say

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
you've short hair

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'll have long hair

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
We're a match

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's okay

143
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
We've tried our best anyway

144
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
After I go to France

145
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Nanxing will be yours

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Why do you have to

147
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
let others take care of you?

148
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Can't you take care of yourself?

149
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What?

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You've never seen anyone wearing a wedding dress?

151
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
This wedding dress is what you want

152
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Does it look good?

153
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yes

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm so jealous

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I want to wear a wedding dress in the future

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Okay, okay

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
When you finish it

158
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll find you a second hand

159
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You said the sea waves are so clear

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The silence of each breath

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
needs to be used to make the heart beat

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
When the sun shines through the sea

163
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Listen to you

164
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Romantic stars will meet the sea

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The warm sea breeze is worth your love

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm hiding out of the clouds

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Ready for my confession

168
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Listen to you

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Romantic stars will meet the sea

170
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The sometimes touching feelings are all because of you

171
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Nanxing

172
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'll tell you a secret

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Before I met you

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I've dreamed of you countless times

175
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What a coincidence

176
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I've dreamed of you too

177
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I've dreamed of you too

178
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm hiding out of the clouds

179
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Ready for my confession

180
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Listen to you

181
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Romantic stars will meet the sea

182
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Do you think we're together for three lives?

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Or why do I always ask you?

184
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Even if it's a three-life-three-life fate

185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It has to start from this life and this world

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm hiding out of the clouds

187
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Ready for my confession

188
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Listen to you

189
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Romantic stars will meet the sea

190
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The warm sea breeze is worth your love

191
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm hiding out of the clouds

192
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Ready for my confession

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Listen to you

194
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Romantic stars will meet the sea

195
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The sometimes touching feelings are all because of you

196
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The wind blows through the mountains

197
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The clouds open the sky

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The beach and the sea are romantic with you

199
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
In the palm of your hand, you say the sea waves are so clear

200
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Like the silence of breathing

201
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I need to use my heart

202
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
When the sun passes by the bottom of the sea

203
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Listen to you

204
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Romantic stars will meet the sea

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The warm sea breeze is worth your love

206
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm hiding out of the clouds

207
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Ready for my confession

208
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Listen to you

209
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Romantic stars will meet the sea

210
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The sometimes touching feelings are all because of you

211
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm leaning on the arms of the evening wind

212
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Waiting for you to pass by the window

213
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Waiting for you to pass by the window
