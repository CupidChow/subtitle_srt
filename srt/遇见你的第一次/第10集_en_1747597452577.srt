1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I like the breeze of March and the clouds of July

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You, the gentle sun and the free you

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Holding your hand and I am covered in clouds

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I like the breeze of March and the clouds of July

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You, the gentle sun and the free you

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Holding your hand and I am covered in clouds

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I like the breeze of March and the clouds of July

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
You, the gentle sun and the free you

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Just finished the exam

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Try it

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Maybe it can change your mood

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Try it

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Actually I really don't understand

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You said your parents let you continue the work of editor

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And take over the gallery

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Isn't it good?

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Why are you doing this?

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
You know my family is an art gallery

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Actually I went to the comic club for internship

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
To find some good signs for my family

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But now my dad is sick

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
He let me manage the gallery

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Now the only way to solve the problem is

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I have to find a painter with a good chance to get famous in a month

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Nanxing, only you can help me

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You know I have been used to free-spirited since I was a kid

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Now I have no Qianhua gallery

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I am afraid of those little things in the middle

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
And my dad always told me

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
To be a person who doesn't go to meet others

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I think what I am doing now

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Is to fulfill his wish

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You two are like little couple

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Don't make a fool of yourself

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But I tell you the truth

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
All problems start from rejection

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You can not understand him

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Then you should respect him

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
After all, everyone has their own life

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You may think he is not as stubborn as you

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But he is

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Do you like him?

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Brother, I can't like a person who is not into music

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Brother, you are looking for a partner

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Not a teacher

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I tell you, it is impossible

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
In short, it is impossible

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Hello, sorry to keep you waiting

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Your cake

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
If you can't finish it

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Remember to put it in the refrigerator

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Otherwise the cream will melt

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't have candles

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I just put a box of fairy sticks for you

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's a small gift for you

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You are so cute

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's windy today

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
If you have nothing to do, go back and rest

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Bye

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Go

61
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I am waiting for you here

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Not yet

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You live alone

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You are here

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I am here

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I am here

67
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I am here

68
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I am here

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I am here

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I am here

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Hey

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What are you doing?

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You have been in my car twice, do you forget?

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Are you crazy?

75
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You

76
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
If it wasn't for that man last time

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You would have gone home with me

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You are far away from me, you pervert

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I am leaving

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Don't move

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It will be done soon

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Thank you

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Thank you today

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Together

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Help me block the storm

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
In the vast night sky

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I hear your voice

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Please say I love you

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I will play a role

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Do you know how to tell a story?

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Not even one

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I know one too

95
