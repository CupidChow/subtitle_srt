1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm waiting for the starry sky to fall

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
If the rain and the waves are with you

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
If you are addicted

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I want to meet the next weather

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I like the evening breeze in March

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And the clouds in July

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The gentle sun and the free you

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You say

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Your those what

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Monet, Lepin, Leblanc

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
If you see this scene

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
What will they say

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't know

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You think about it

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If you say wrong

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
They won't jump out of the coffin

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hit you

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I thought of one

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Then you say

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I don't know what is eternal in this world

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I only know

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
As long as there is a star

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Start dreaming

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This sentence

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Is it the great painter

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Did Ding Nanxing always say

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Are you mocking me?

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
This is what your great painter Fan Gao said

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's your turn

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Have you thought about it

31
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I think

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I think

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
If you haven't thought about it

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'll go buy an ice cream first

35
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Wait for me

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Then

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
On the neck

38
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I thought

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
No one in this life

40
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Will come to my world

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But until the first time I met you

42
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
My world is getting clearer

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Thank you

44
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Miss Guo He Chaiqiao

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Thank you

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Ding Nanxing

47
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sorry

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm sorry

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm sorry

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm sorry

51
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm sorry

53
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm sorry

54
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm sorry

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Ding Nanxing

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Xu Baiyan

57
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Do we two

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Do you want to have a game?

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Our game rules today are

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
The one who earns more money

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The one who wins

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
The one who loses

63
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You have to meet the other party's conditions

64
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
How about it?

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Don't hesitate

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Start now

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Don't miss it

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Self-portrait

69
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Quick-witted

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Only one wish

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Do you want to draw?

72
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Little sister

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Do you want to draw a picture?

74
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It only costs ten yuan

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Okay, draw me one

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Give me one too

77
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Did you forget that you won a prize?

78
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Maybe

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
My draw is done

80
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Is it ok if I look at the picture?

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're pretty

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It just came out

83
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's drawn

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
CONFESSIBLE

85
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Is this your drawing?

86
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Right

87
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Think leg

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You're so handsome.

89
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,800
Thank you.

90
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,640
I just paid for it.

91
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,240
You're welcome.

92
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,960
Bye.

93
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,600
Is my painting ready?

94
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:03,920
Let me have a look.

95
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,960
What is this?

96
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,680
I can't draw anything for a long time.

97
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,760
Let me draw.

98
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,640
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,720
I can't see you.

100
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,600
Xu Baiyan.

101
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,760
Don't say sorry.

102
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,720
I didn't expect you to feel this way.

103
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,600
So I should apologize to you.

104
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,280
I'm sorry.

105
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,320
I said it was none of your business.

106
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,480
You didn't do anything wrong.

107
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,840
But

108
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,840
having a face is not your fault.

109
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,440
I want to stick to painting.

110
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,680
Maybe

111
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,520
it's a mistake.

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I can ask you a question.

113
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
In your eyes,

114
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
what does this world and us look like?

115
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
In my eyes, everyone is wearing colorful clothes.

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
When I want to see what they look like,

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I can't see anything.

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What about me?

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Can you see what I look like?

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
In my eyes,

121
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
you have a very long eyebrows,

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and a clear-eyed eyes.

123
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This nose is not too high,

124
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
but the lips are quite red.

125
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I...

126
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You see it quite clearly.

127
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
But it's really weird.

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Why do you look so strange?

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why do you have this disease?

130
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Maybe it's because I was hurt when I was young.

131
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I was scolded when I was young.

132
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Why did you get scolded?

133
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Because I didn't work hard enough.

134
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You still don't work hard enough?

135
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You are the most hardworking person I've ever seen in this world.

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But I can't make it 100% to make everyone satisfied with me.

137
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Why should everyone be satisfied with you?

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
We were born not to win other people's hearts.

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We are born to be happy, right?

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Thank you.

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm very happy.

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's bright.

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It seems that I have to tell my mother that

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
nothing is all about men.

145
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I can still do things like light bulb.

146
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Then leave this kind of thing to me.

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Where are you going?

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Take a bath.

149
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Please come in.

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
What's wrong?

151
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Xu Baiyan, my upstairs is full of flowers.

152
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I can't take a bath.

153
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Can I borrow your bathroom?

154
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But...

155
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Just this time today.

156
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
When the bathroom is fixed tomorrow, I will definitely not come down.

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Thank you.

158
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Thank you.

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Thank you.

160
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't think about it.

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Don't think about it.

168
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But the bathroom is so messy.

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What's wrong with you?

170
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Ding Danxing.

171
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Ding Danxing.

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Xu Baiyan.

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Who let you in?

174
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I just heard your voice outside.

175
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm fine.

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You go out.

177
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Go out.

178
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Go out.

179
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Stop.

180
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Ding Danxing, you are so annoying.

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I...

182
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
My legs are numb now.

183
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I can't get up.

184
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm sorry.

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
