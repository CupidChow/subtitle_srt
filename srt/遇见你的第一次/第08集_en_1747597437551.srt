1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like the breeze of the third month and the rain of the seventh month

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The gentle sun and you who are free

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Holding your hand and I am being healed by you

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The breeze of youth and the rain of the night

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The bright moon is shining on you

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The deep eyes, oh I can't forget

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Episode 16

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
This is his request. You saw it too.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
No, Mr. Xu.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Although I have a wide range of connections,

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
but you are a different man.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
This range is too wide.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You are tall and low. Tell me what you want.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I want to be a man who can be a man.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You are tall and low. Tell me what you want.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
How tall are you? How tall are you?

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Second marriage? First marriage?

19
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I will give you three times the intermediary fee.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
If you say so,

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
there is a way.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Then I will prepare a blind date for him.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I will take care of it.

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
KT Computer.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This is also from KT.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Strange.

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Why are there so many orders from their store today?

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Still KT.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Why are there so many cakes from KT today?

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Are they making a team there?

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's go.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
KT Computer.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
KT Computer.

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
KT Computer.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The dessert has been delivered.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Please go to table 1 and receive it.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
KT Computer.

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Zhang Jiahao. 25 years old. 1.75 meters.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
1995.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
He has a high-speed talent.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Look at this.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Here it is.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is the best cake in the room.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
1.86 meters.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And I remember that

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
the price is good.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Look at this. It's professional.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Professional.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Did I take it wrong?

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Miss.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm here to take my cake.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Your name is...

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Shen Hao.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Shen Hao.

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is your cake.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This is mine.

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This is yours.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Thank you.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Another one.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let me tell you, Mr. Xu.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
This one.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
This one.

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is mine.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Your name is...

65
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I want to laugh.

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Good people. Good character.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Tell me.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What's the most important thing for a man?

69
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Character is the most important.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This is your cake.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
So small.

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Add me on WeChat. I'll transfer the money to you.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Sorry. I don't need it.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hello. I'm here to take my cake.

75
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Your name is useless.

76
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Why do you have a high school student?

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
And dyeing hair?

78
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I made a mistake.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
A third-year student.

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This...

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Is there more?

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't worry. Mr. Xu.

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
This is yours.

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Thank you.

85
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
This is yours.

87
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Thank you.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Bye.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
This is an artist.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
A hip-hop singer.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Long Guo Guo.

92
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
There is hip-hop in China.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Hai Xuan.

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
He's here.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He's talented.

96
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Okay. He's a man.

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
He's not here yet.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I guess he's busy with the performance.

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He can't come.

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
How about we just let him in?

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll give you the money.

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Then give me the money.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No, Mr. Xu.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You can't come.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't mention Mr. Xu.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'll explain.

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yeah!

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
My brother is a hip-hop singer.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm afraid he'll take a cake and I'll turn around.

111
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll send you a WeChat message.

112
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Yeah!

113
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The payment.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
200.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I don't think it's necessary.

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What do you mean necessary?

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I think you're hopeless.

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Come back with me.

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Mr. Xu, help!

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I knew it was you.

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I was wondering why so many weird people came to order me a cake.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's you two.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You two are in a relationship.

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You're in a relationship.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You're in a relationship.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Your vocabulary is quite good.

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
But I think you have a good point.

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You should make a rap group with Kitty.

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Okay, we just had a good time.

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Don't be mad at me.

131
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Mr. Xu, take your time.

132
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Don't be angry.

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You should be happy today.

134
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
At least you made a lot of money.

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You're right.

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
But I want to ask you.

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You arranged so many weird people for me.

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What do you mean?

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And the WeChat message you sent last night.

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
What does it mean?

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Xu Baiyan,

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
you should be happy.

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You should be happy.

144
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Baiyan,

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
are you going to...

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What?

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You want to introduce someone to me and let me date.

148
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And then you'll get out of here with me.

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Right?

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Ding Daxing, I'm telling you.

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
This house is half of my aunt's property.

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But you'll move out after you lose the game.

153
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But it doesn't affect our right to own it.

154
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Okay.

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll go back and change the lock.

156
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I won't move out even if you change it.

157
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
You're in the car, right?

158
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Be careful when you get home.

159
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Girls are so narrow-minded.

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's so dark.

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's not easy to get out of the village.

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It would be great if you had a boyfriend.

163
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I know.

164
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
how can you be in a relationship with your boyfriend?

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Why do you want to date?

167
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Think about it.

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If I find a boyfriend,

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll definitely be with him.

170
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll be with him every day.

171
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'll definitely be with him every day.

172
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I want to be with him every day.

173
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Then I'll definitely move out of this house.

174
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
If I move out of this house,

175
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
you and your girlfriend's agreement,

176
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
you'll lose, right?

177
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
It's your ex-girlfriend.

178
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You're right.

179
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Okay?

180
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Be careful on the road.

181
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I know. It's safe.

182
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Don't always look at the rumors in the circle of friends.

183
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
They're all nonsense.

184
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You're scaring yourself.

185
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay.

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Mom,

187
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I'm almost home. I won't talk to you.

188
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I have to continue making cakes when I get home.

189
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I have a lot of orders tomorrow.

190

Okay.

Bye.

193
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You make cakes?

194
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yes. Do you want to order?

195
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I can give you a discount.

196
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000

197
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Okay. I'll get it for you tomorrow at the village gate.

198
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay. No problem.

199
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I'll get it for you tomorrow at the village gate.

200
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Okay.

201
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Bye.

202
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Bye.

203
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Bye.

204
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Bye.

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Bye.

206
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Bye.

207
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Bye.

208
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Bye.

209
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Bye.

210
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Bye.

211
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Bye.

212
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Bye.

213
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Bye.

214
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Bye.

215
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Bye.

216
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Bye.

217
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
How can this guy move out so quickly.

218
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
He even changed his lock.

219
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The End

220
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,440
The silence of deep breathing

221
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,280
Needs to be heard with the heart

222
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,720
When the sun shines through the sea

223
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,200
Listen to you say

224
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,760
Romantic today

225
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,000
Will meet the sea

226
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,560
Warm sea breeze

227
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,920
All worth your love

228
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:48,480
I hide in the clouds

229
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,280
Prepare my confession

230
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,560
Listen to you say

231
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,880
The blue sky

232
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,240
Will meet the sea

233
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,120
Occasionally touched

234
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,400
Only because of you

235
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,720
I'm leaning on the evening wind

236
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,760
Waiting for you to pass by the window

237
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,760
Waiting for you to pass by the window
