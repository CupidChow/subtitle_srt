1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like the breeze of March and the rain of July

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The gentle sun and you who are free

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Holding your hand and I am covered in clouds

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The breeze of youth and the rain of the night

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The beautiful moon is shining on you

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The deep blue eyes, oh I can't forget

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 18

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I...

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I brought the wrong thing.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What are you doing?

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Where can I go to see the play?

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Don't you need it?

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm done.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Thank you.

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What did our great artist Bi Jia Suo say?

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Excellent artist plagiarism, great artist plagiarism.

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You are so weird.

19
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
How is it? Is it time?

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Three minutes left.

22
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Great.

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I remember.

24
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's what Bi Jia Suo said.

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I spent four years

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
learning how to paint like Lafayette.

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
But I spent my whole life

28
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
learning how to paint like a child.

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I said it.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Bonus time.

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You are so lazy every day.

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Why are you so good at drawing?

35
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Have you seen the moon?

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
What?

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Have you smelled the sea?

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Have you blown the sea breeze by the cliff?

39
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Have you seen shells on the beach?

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Good art, good art.

41
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The lines of the love line and the high-light are trees.

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The people and the nature are the real beauty.

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You always say I'm so good at everything.

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I think you are so dead.

45
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Yuchuan is back to Hong Kong.

46
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
When you are free,

47
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
go to the beach by yourself.

48
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The End

49
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What?

50
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Maybe it's a nightmare.

51
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What nightmare?

52
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What's going on?

53
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You lost the game.

54
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
And you were kicked out, right?

55
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What kicked out?

56
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I moved out by myself.

57
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I have a lot of work.

58
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's convenient to move to the studio.

59
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I moved out by myself.

60
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Guess if I can do it.

61
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Drink with me.

62
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Drink?

63
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Now?

64
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Is this what you said?

65
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Do you have something to say?

66
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The studio is going to close down?

67
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Impossible.

68
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I've been in charge of the account.

69
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Do you have an experience?

70
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
In a moment,

71
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
you suddenly feel that everything you do is wrong.

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Indeed.

73
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
For example, drinking coffee is not a cup of coffee.

74
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Can you stop talking about the wind?

75
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I mean...

76
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Drinking coffee is not a cup of coffee.

77
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Painters can't be called painters.

78
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Some things you think you did wrong.

79
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But you just didn't think about how to do it.

80
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
It's already started.

81
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Any fate,

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
no matter how long or complicated,

83
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
it only responds to a moment.

84
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That's when you enjoy who you are.

85
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
This is not what I said.

86
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This is what Borges said.

87
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Because Xingxiang said I was going to see Latin America this month.

88
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
By the way,

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Xingxiang also said that you went out to blind dates recently.

90
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Xu Baiye,

91
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
move back quickly.

92
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Aunt,

93
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
you have so many real estate assets.

94
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Why do you have to compete for this one?

95
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What do you know?

96
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Are you competing for a broken house now?

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
That's your little aunt's face.

98
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Do I have a real estate certificate?

99
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What I want is respect.

100
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Everyone paid for the house together.

101
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's been a dozen years for his daughter.

102
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But after you graduated,

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
you went abroad with your uncle.

104
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
No, boy,

105
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
which side are you on?

106
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You won't be in a few days

107
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
by Di Yan's sugar-coated house, right?

108
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You're so ungrateful.

109
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Do you know that

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I made a bet with Xu Jiuyun

111
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
that you and his daughter

112
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
will move out first.

113
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Even if someone gives up all the property,

114
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
you'll be ashamed.

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Okay, okay, okay.

116
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Aunt, stop talking.

117
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll think of a way to move back as soon as possible.

118
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Okay?

119
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You've raised me for so many years.

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
If I can make you happy by doing this,

121
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
why don't I do it?

122
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Baiye,

123
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm not raising you to repay you.

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I want you to be happy.

125
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I know.

126
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Me too.

127
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Mom,

128
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
the person who gave birth to me

129
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
can't contact me anymore.

130
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I can only go to the welfare home.

131
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But don't worry.

132
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'll be there

133
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
to study hard.

134
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Hello.

135
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The tenant of this house has passed away.

136
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If you need anything,

137
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you can contact the landlord directly.

138
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If you're my mom's friend,

139
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'm very grateful

140
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
that you came to send my mom to the last bus.

141
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
This is you.

142
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
This is me.

143
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It's all my fault.

144
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Baiye,

145
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm aunt.

146
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
From now on,

147
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
you're the only son of Xu Tingting.

148
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Xu Baiye,

149
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
didn't I say

150
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
that you can't turn off the light and ring the bell?

151
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Xu Baiye?

152
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Did he really leave?

153
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's so clean.

154
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It doesn't matter.

155
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's better

156
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
if you don't turn it off.

157
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's all mine.

158
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's all mine.

159
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Insane.

160
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
