1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like the breeze of March and the rain of July

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The gentle sun and you who are free

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Holding your hand and I am being healed by you

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The breeze of youth and the rain of the night

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The beautiful moon is shining on you

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The deep eyes, oh I can't forget

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 16

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Dad

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
How is the signing?

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I am talking

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Isn't that painter your good friend?

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Why didn't you finish it after so long?

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Nanxing has some questions about the signing

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Any conditions can satisfy her

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
As long as she agrees to sign

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I have released the painting to the investor

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Next month, she will not go to work tomorrow

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and do a personal painting exhibition

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
So you must hurry up

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I know, dad

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
According to what Luoli said

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,780
There is no more public

25
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,000
This time it should be possible to sign

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I am the one who was reported

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Now you call me here

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
to clean your studio

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Why?

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
First of all

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I am not the one who reported you

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But the one who messed up my negotiation

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
is you

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Second

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You drank Luoli's unique wine

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
and you are now clean

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You are already very sober

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What do you want to do in the end?

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
First

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You and Luoli are a team

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I have been reported by him once

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I have to suspect you

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Second

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Your business and negotiation

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
are not going well

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Why blame me?

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Maybe because

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
your EQ is not enough

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and you offended someone

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I have always been a good drinker

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Even if I drink too much

53
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I won't do anything out of the box

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You are a good drinker

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Think about it carefully

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What did you do last night?

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Ding Nanxing

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Go back to your room

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I will talk to you

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Ding Nanxing

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Go back to your room

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why are you on my bed?

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Get up

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This is my house

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I can sleep wherever I want

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Can I sleep here?

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You still want to dance on my bed?

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I heard it

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Xue Bajian

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You are digging a hole in the ground

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Right?

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't understand

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What are you so great?

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What's wrong with me being a salted fish?

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I am a salted fish who loves you

76
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Do I take your place?

77
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You are drunk

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Go back to your room

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I am not drunk

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Xue Bajian

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I want to ask you a question

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You can draw

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and write the script

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What else can you do?

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I know

87
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You can report

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You are like a primary school student

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What else can you do except reporting?

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I didn't report

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You are bullying me

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Only you bully me

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I want to bully you today

94
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What do you want?

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What do I want?

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I want to bully you

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What?

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You remember

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You were happy last night?

100
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Well

101
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
People

102
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
When they are stressed

103
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
They will find a good place

104
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
to vent their emotions

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You know it, right?

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You said

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can only draw and write the script

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I can do it today

109
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What do you want?

110
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
What are you thinking?

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Go to work

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Xue Bajian

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You are not easy

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
to grow up

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You don't need to clean this room

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Why?

117
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Why?

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Why don't you need to clean this room?

119
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I said I don't need to clean it

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I don't need to clean it

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
There must be something wrong

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Xue Bajian

123
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What's in that room

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
that you don't allow people to see?

125
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Is there

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
any secret?

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If you like cleaning

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You should clean the room

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
from now on

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Why?

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I am not a cleaner

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I am not a cleaner

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But I see you are very skilled

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
in cleaning

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You forced me to do it

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
How about this?

137
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
From now on

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You can clean here

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
from now on

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You can draw here from now on

141
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I will give you a day off on the weekend

142
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What do you think?

143
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Xue Bajian

144
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Do you think

145
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I should thank you

146
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
after you said these words?

147
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You are welcome

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But you can think about it

149
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Did anyone tell you

150
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
that you are so close

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
to people?

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You are so rude

153
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No

154
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
But do you think

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
you are too close to me?

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
When did you come?

157
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You two

158
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Today is the weekend

159
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Why are you here?

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What?

161
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I can't come to the studio on the weekend?

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I am here to see him

163
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Me?

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Let's make it clear

165
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Before you drank the wine

166
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I checked online

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Three bars, two bottles of wine, and a bottle of wine

168
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And you gave me a bottle of wine

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't think about me

170
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's not about the wine

171
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's about something else

172
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This

173
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Is this your best friend?

174
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What?

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You like her?

177
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No

178
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I mean this

179
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I mean

180
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I met her on the street that day

181
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Hello

182
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Hello, is this the Food Management Bureau?

183
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I want to report that someone is unauthorized

184
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes

185
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Please give me an email

186
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I will send it to you after I finish it

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I didn't hear it clearly

188
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's about it

189
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
And then?

190
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And then

191
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
She reported that someone was unauthorized

192
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Why did you say it so late?

193
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I am busy

194
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't have time for that

195
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You

196
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Why are you going?

197
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Don't participate in the war

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Nanxing, you are here

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You are here

200
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Is your new job place?

202
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
My dad said he would give me this place

203
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
How is it?

204
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's good

205
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Nanxing

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Come on, sit

207
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Nanxing

208
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I was not considerate about the contract last time

209
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I made some adjustments

210
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Xiaoyue

211
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I am here today

212
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
to ask you something

213
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
When I told you that I was reported

214
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
How did you do it

215
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
to comfort me without any discrimination?

216
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
When I told you

217
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
that I suspected Xu Baiyan

218
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Did you say anything

219
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
about how you did it

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
to comfort me without any discrimination?

221
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If it wasn't for Lu Li's bar

222
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
If it wasn't for

223
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
the fact that he met you on the street

224
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
and called you

225
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You were going to keep it from me

226
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
How long were you going to keep it from me?

227
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I don't understand

228
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
In your heart

229
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What do you think of me?

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We went to college together

231
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
When you failed the exam

232
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
in college

233
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Was I helping you?

234
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You graduated from college

235
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
and joined the job

236
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You failed the monthly KPI

237
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Was I helping you to complete the job?

238
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
In my heart

239
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I always treat you

240
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
as my best friend

241
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
But how did you treat me?

242
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Why do you have to

243
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
do this to me?

244
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Nanxing

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I have a few questions

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
to ask you

247
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Okay

248
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Go ahead

249
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
The sun rises

250
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The wind blows through the mountains

251
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The clouds open the sky

252
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The beach and the sea

253
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Are full of you

254
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Hold your hand

255
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You said the sea waves are clear

256
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The silence of breathing

257
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Needs to be heard

258
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
When the sun shines through the sea

259
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Listen to you

260
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Romantic classics

261
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Will meet the sea

262
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The warm sea breeze

263
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Is worth your love

264
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I hide in the clouds

265
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Prepare my confession

266
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Listen to you

267
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Romantic classics

268
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Will meet the sea

269
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Occasionally touching

270
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Just because of you

271
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm leaning on the evening breeze

272
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Waiting for you to pass by the window

273
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Waiting for you to pass by the window
