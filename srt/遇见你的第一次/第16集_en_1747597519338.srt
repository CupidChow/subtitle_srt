Episode 16

5
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,000
Why are you here?

6
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
I just got off work and passed by.

7
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,600
I want to take you home.

8
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,400
Together?

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,600
Why don't you go back by yourself?

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,400
I want to go to the beach alone.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,200
I can go with you.

12
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,400
Ding Nanxing, tell me.

13
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,800
Why do you help me every time?

14
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,800
You make me feel that I can always rely on you.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
But you refuse me so easily.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,800
Ding Nanxing.

17
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,000
Tell me why.

18
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,200
I once took a stray cat.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,200
I called it Fugui.

20
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,600
I wanted to give it a home.

21
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,800
So I brought it back.

22
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,200
I tried my best to be nice to it.

23
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,200
But it still got lost in the end.

24
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,200
And then?

25
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,200
And then,

26
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,200
after a long time,

27
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,800
I found its body in the weeds.

28
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,600
It was all wounds.

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,600
Only bones were left.

30
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
You're blaming yourself?

31
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,400
I'm just thinking.

32
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,800
If I didn't want to take it home,

33
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,800
it might be the best stray cat in the living environment.

34
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,400
I'm thinking,

35
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,600
if I can't take care of it all the time,

36
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
I shouldn't change its life.

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,600
What did Yan Xiaoyue say to you?

38
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
He asked me,

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,600
why I got full marks in college.

40
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
He asked me,

41
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,800
why I completed the monthly KPI every month during internship.

42
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
He said he didn't do this.

43
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,000
Every time he wanted to give up,

44
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,600
he was pushed by me step by step.

45
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
He said,

46
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,200
all these things are just a dream.

47
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
He said,

48
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,400
all these false images

49
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,200
made him be hung up in front of his parents.

50
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
When he needed me the most,

51
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,000
I decided to leave him.

52
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
He asked me,

53
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,200
whether it was a cruel thing

54
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,800
to see my own poverty clearly.

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,200
What's your answer?

56
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,400
I'm so confused.

57
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,000
This is my answer.

58
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,800
Xu Banyan,

59
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
do you know that

60
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,600
when I walked into Yan Xiaoyue's studio,

61
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
I thought I was stubborn.

62
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
But when he asked me these questions,

63
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,200
I found that I did it myself.

64
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,600
Maybe it's really like what he said,

65
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,000
I didn't do it.

66
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,800
I didn't do it.

67
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,400
I didn't do it.

68
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,200
I didn't do it.

69
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,600
In the beginning,

70
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
he chose to give up

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,800
and do what he liked the most.

72
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,400
Maybe the result will be completely different from today.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,200
Every adult

74
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
has to take responsibility for his own choice.

75
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,400
You didn't do it wrong.

76
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,200
Thank you for being with me today.

77
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,200
I've been nagging you.

78
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm also very grateful to you

79
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,200
for showing me such a beautiful scenery.

80
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
It's pretty.

81
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,800
Can you take a picture for me?

82
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Sure.

83
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
I want the sun in my hand.

84
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,200
Are you done, Xu Banyan?

85
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,200
Are you done?

86
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,200
I think so.

87
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,200
Let me see.

88
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,200
What?

89
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,400
Why are my eyes closed?

90
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,000
There's no one to see it.

91
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,200
Did you do it on purpose?

92
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,800
The wind is quite strong today.

93
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,800
You're lucky.

94
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
I knew it.

95
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,200
The temperature of the body temperature today

96
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,600
is about ten degrees.

97
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,200
It's not a big deal.

98
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,000
The body temperature today is 14 degrees.

99
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
The wind is at level three.

100
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,000
I really don't understand what's wrong with you.

101
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,600
You're wearing so little and you're out to sea.

102
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,200
What? Am I wrong?

103
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,800
Yes, you're right.

104
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,800
You can blow the sea wind here.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,200
I'm going home.

106
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,000
You're a little kind.

107
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
I'm good at making mistakes.

108
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,200
Are you cold?

109
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
I'm not.

110
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,000
Blow the wind here.

111
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,400
I'm going home.

112
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Bye.

113
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Bye.

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Wait for me.

115
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
I'm going home.

116
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
I'm going home.

117
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
I'm going home.

118
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
I'm going home.

119
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
I'm going home.

120
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Who is it?

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Coming.

122
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,800
I'm going out. You guys have a good talk.

123
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Come in.

124
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
I was wrong.

125
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,800
You guys must be learning art.

126
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
Are you drawing a star?

127
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Is this a Gemini?

128
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,800
What else?

129
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,800
A virgin, a virgin, a Gemini.

130
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,800
You guys know there are mountains and people out there, right?

131
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Actually, I'm drawing a 28-star show.

132
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,800
How about this?

133
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,800
Sorry to bother you.

134
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
The students are so busy now.

135
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
They're studying 28-star shows.

136
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,800
You're back.

137
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
Come.

138
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
I have good news for you.

139
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
You made up with Yan Xiaoyue?

140
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,800
How did you know?

141
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,800
You can't hide secrets from me.

142
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
You'll know it when you see it.

143
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Congratulations.

144
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,800
You don't have to cry in secret anymore.

145
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,800
Thank you for going to the fan meeting with me yesterday.

146
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,800
As a thank you, I owe you a favor.

147
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,800
When you think of how to repay me,

148
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
you can tell me.

149
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Let me read books.

150
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,800
I'm sorry.

152
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
I'm sorry.

153
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
I'm sorry.

155
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
I'm sorry.

156
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,800
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
I'm sorry.

158
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,800
I'm sorry.

159
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
I'm sorry.

160
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:45,800
I'm sorry.

161
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,800
I'm sorry.

162
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,800
I'm sorry.

163
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
I'm sorry.

164
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
I'm sorry.

165
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
I'm sorry.

166
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
I'm sorry.

167
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
I'm sorry.

168
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
I'm sorry.

169
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
I'm sorry.

171
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
I'm sorry.

173
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
I'm sorry.

174
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
I'm sorry.

175
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
I'm sorry.

176
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
I'm sorry.

177
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
I'm sorry.

179
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
I'm sorry.

180
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
I'm sorry.

181
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
I'm sorry.

182
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
I'm sorry.

183
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
I'm sorry.

184
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
I'm sorry.

185
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
I'm sorry.

186
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
I'm sorry.

187
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
I'm sorry.

189
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
I'm sorry.

191
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
