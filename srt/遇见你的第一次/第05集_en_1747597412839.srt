1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like the evening breeze of March and the clouds of July

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The gentle sun and you who are free

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Holding your hand and I am covered in clouds

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The youth breeze and the clouds of the night

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The bright moon is shining on you

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The deep blue eyes, oh I can't forget

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 16

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Why should I come instead of you for your blind date?

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If it wasn't for drinking coffee and having a stomachache and having a soft leg,

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
do you think I would use this stupid trick?

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I can't pretend to be you.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I don't have any experience in dating women.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
My mom said that this cafe is a place for blind dates.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If you can't, you can see how others interact with girls.

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Learn, learn.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I don't want to learn this kind of experience.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Either you come now or I'll leave.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Welcome.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What can I do for you?

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Sorry, I'm looking for someone.

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hello, you are Mr. Wang.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Are you Miss Ding?

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yes.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Sit down.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ding Nanxing?

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Why is she here?

28
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
This photo was taken when I was in college.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This photo was taken years ago.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Isn't it a lie?

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If my mom didn't force me to come,

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
do you think I would come?

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Forget it, everyone is here.

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Let's talk about it.

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I really appreciate your advice.

36
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I think I've told you everything about your situation.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's talk about my idea.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Please.

39
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
First of all, I'm particular about the girl's body.

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I can see her body by looking at her.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Her appearance is good, 80 points.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But the body must be good.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This requirement is a little different from you.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Sorry, let me interrupt.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You mean you want a good body with an appearance of 80 points.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Is that right?

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Yes, the body is the most important.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If the body is not good, I will divorce even if I get married.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm not very satisfied with your condition.

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Don't be angry.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm always straight.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Don't mind.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Besides,

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I think you should take good care of yourself.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Shi Baiyan?

56
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Ding Nanxing, you're really a good person.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You're very cold to me at home.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I can step on you when I'm outside.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Come here.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Don't misunderstand.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
He's not my boyfriend.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What's going on?

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Your boyfriend is still on a blind date?

64
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Xu Baiyan.

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What do you want?

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You'd rather spend time on a boring blind date than reading, right?

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why is Ding Nanxing so rude?

68
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Xu Baiyan, you're calling Yuanren to be on the show, right?

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What I like to read is my business.

70
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What does it have to do with you?

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Do you know that you're so confused today?

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
My mom will scold me again.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No, I have to find someone to beg for help.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
How could you draw such a picture

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
with your learning attitude?

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's just a picture.

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Do you think that if you can't draw it,

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
no one else can?

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What's wrong with you?

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I told you to help me stabilize my four stars first.

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Brother, you only talked about blind dates for three sentences.

82
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You just took a taxi to send the girl home?

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What kind of operation is this?

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
She said she didn't want to drink.

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
She said she was sleepy and wanted to find a place to rest.

86
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I should be right to take her home by taxi.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes.

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Anyway, you're not interested in women.

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I want to ask you a question.

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Sure.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But I don't want to answer the question about women.

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Why?

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Because I think it's useless to you.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What do you mean?

95
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Only women can answer your question.

96
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Who?

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Who?

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm worried.

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Isn't that the girl who lives with you?

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What's wrong with her?

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You two?

102
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
She's the best painter in the national vote.

103
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
She won't work tomorrow.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I suspect she's looking for a substitute.

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Then what's your problem?

106
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm thinking how to prove that she's looking for a substitute.

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I think I'm really crazy.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I thought you were trapped by love.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay.

110
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Leave it to me.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You go to practice.

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Why did you mess it up?

113
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Do you know how much you've been promoted?

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're still young and you're still single.

115
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
How can you be so noisy?

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm not.

117
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm not.

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm not.

119
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Mom, actually, I don't have high requirements.

120
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I just need to find someone like my dad.

121
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Like your dad,

122
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
he's gone when he's over 30 years old.

123
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Are you stupid?

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Mom, I beg you.

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Can I not tell you first?

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I have work to do.

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm preparing to make a cake.

128
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Come here. Bye.

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Xinxin, what are you doing?

130
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Why are you here?

131
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Wait.

132
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You want me to hand in the draft now?

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I really can't.

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Give me some more time.

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
The magazine received an anonymous letter

136
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
saying that it was to check the last time

137
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
the people voted for the best painter.

138
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
An anonymous letter?

139
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Who do you think it is?

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Who else can be so boring?

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Write an anonymous letter?

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
He's just missing the ID card.

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He's too old.

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But if he doesn't go to work tomorrow,

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
he'll be addicted to the work he's done.

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This kind of performance is not reasonable.

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Why is it not reasonable?

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Painting is tiring.

149
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Painting is a waste of brain.

150
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Look at my hair. It's getting thinner.

151
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The situation is that

152
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
the editor-in-chief has to propose to you and Long Yan

153
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
to have a transparent public competition

154
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
in order to appease the readers' public opinion.

155
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm not going to compete with him.

156
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Ding Nanxing,

157
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
you know the reason

158
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
why you're competing with him.

159
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Of course I know.

160
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Do you remember

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
what I told you back then?

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Why did I paint?

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I did it for the prize and the reward.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Other things are not important to me.

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Ding Nanxing, you have to know that

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
once you're approved by the editor-in-chief,

167
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
you'll ruin your future in the painting industry.

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm ruined?

169
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I'm not going to

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
ruin my future.

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Why do you all

172
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
keep forcing me to do this?

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Can I not go to his house?

174
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You don't want to compete or you don't dare to?

175
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Xiao Yue, you go first.

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You're so innocent.

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm leaving.

178
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You came at the right time.

179
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I want to ask you.

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Children play the trick of telling the truth.

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Telling the truth?

182
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

183
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
But this competition

184
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
is a great opportunity

185
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
to prove that you're right.

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Do people all over the world

187
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
think like you?

188
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
If you lose, you'll be a cat.

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
No.

190
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I just want to know

191
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
if I lose to you

192
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
in the painting competition,

193
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
is winning so important?

194
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I started painting when I was six.

195
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I read a lot of books about painting.

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I modeled countless paintings

197
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and participated in countless competitions

198
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
before I got here.

199
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't believe

200
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you can win so easily.

201
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So?

202
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
To make you believe,

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I have to do something

204
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't want to do.

205
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Funny.

206
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I met you one day

207
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I was anxious when I saw you

208
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
When the sun rises

209
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The wind blows through the sand

210
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The clouds open the sky

211
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
The beach is full of you

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Holding your hand, you said

213
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The sea waves are so clear

214
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The silence of life

215
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Needs to be used to lift the heart

216
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
When the sun passes the sea

217
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Listen to you, the romantic sky

218
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Will meet the sea

219
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The warm sea breeze

220
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Is worth your love

221
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I hide in the clouds

222
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Prepare my confession

223
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Listen to you, the blue sky

224
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Will meet the sea

225
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Occasionally, the emotions

226
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Come only because of you

227
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm leaning on the evening wind

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Waiting for you to pass by the window

229
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Waiting for you to pass by the window
