Episode 2

5
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
What a coincidence, we meet again.

6
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's you again.

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yes, fate is so wonderful, isn't it?

8
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I knew that day that you were Ding Nanxing's friend.

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
My partner showed me the pictures of your gallery.

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Said you wanted to sign with her, right?

11
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You know I signed a contract with Nanxing?

12
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Just a few words.

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Then how did she tell you?

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
She said she was impressed with the contract.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Really?

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes.

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But she rejected me later.

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Maybe because she couldn't let go of her baking business.

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Is baking so important?

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Of course.

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Of course.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
She has been doing this business for a long time.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
She must have feelings.

24
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But I have to say,

25
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I think if she doesn't do this baking business,

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
she will definitely choose to sign with you.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Everything will change.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You don't have to worry too much now.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, right.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Actually, I am also one of the shareholders of this bar.

31
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So we have a special bar here

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
specially made for the shareholders.

33
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's very good.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Do you want to try?

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Wait a minute.

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Ok.

37
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What are you doing?

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I am fixing the lock.

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The lock is broken.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why don't I help you?

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No need.

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm afraid you'll be not familiar with the technique.

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You'll break my door.

44
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Who is not familiar with the technique?

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
No need.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I can fix it myself.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Forget it.

48
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'll go to see the master of Kaesuo.

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Master of Kaesuo can do it.

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Don't move.

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'll go to see the master of Kaesuo.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Hello, master.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Master.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Okay.

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hello, speak.

56
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Master.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Are you familiar with the second-hand washing machine?

58
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No.

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
No.

60
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He made fun of me again.

61
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay.

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're good.

63
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Not bad.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Ding Danxing.

65
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Do you want to consider following me?

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You said you wanted me to follow you.

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You want me to follow you to work here?

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes.

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You're so talented.

70
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why don't you use it well?

71
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We lack people in the studio.

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You can come to the hardware studio.

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I believe our cooperation

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
can make a unique game.

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Xu Bayan.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'm really stupid.

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
That's why I promised you to come here.

78
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What's up?

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Nothing.

80
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You're reading these books.

81
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's helpful to you.

82
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Do you want to listen to yourself?

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Stupid man.

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
If you say so,

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I have something to do now.

86
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm going home to make a cake.

87
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Is it so important to make a cake?

88
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Of course.

89
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Goodbye.

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Xu Bayan.

91
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You're a flower roll, right?

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You like to roll inside.

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Why don't you be a sushi chef?

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'll make you roll enough every day.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I understand what's going on.

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll give you a very loyal advice.

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's to keep the money from now on.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Then?

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You'll live in the studio.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And you'll take care of the company.

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't want to stay in the studio.

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I just want to be able to talk about it.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Don't be afraid.

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'm a man of my word.

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm a man of my word.

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm a man of my word.

107
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But...

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm a man of my word.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm a man of my word.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm a man of my word.

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
I'll save money now.

112
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,960
Then,

113
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,480
I'll find a comfortable nursing home.

114
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,040
What do you mean?

115
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,160
It's not easy to get beaten

116
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,480
by a comfortable one.

117
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,880
Why should I go to a nursing home?

118
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,240
It's a matter of experience.

119
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,080
How can you find a boyfriend

120
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,200
like you?

121
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,440
You don't even have a baby.

122
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,240
I clearly...

123
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,120
What do you clearly understand?

124
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,120
I've already worked hard.

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,920
Really?

126
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,600
Then you don't mind

127
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,880
working harder, do you?

128
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,040
Come on.

129
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,200
What do you mean?

130
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,640
My father,

131
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,600
my mother,

132
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,880
and even younger.

133
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,000
If we take her down,

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:43,840
our development speed

135
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,040
can be at least half.

136
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,760
Our development speed

137
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,600
is already at its peak.

138
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,200
Yes.

139
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,240
But who will be sorry

140
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,160
for the money?

141
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,160
If we can't,

142
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,360
we can take this budget

143
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,520
and renovate our studio,

144
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,880
okay?

145
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,280
Okay.

146
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,160
You're persuading me.

147
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,920
But I have a problem.

148
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,200
You're always

149
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,880
in charge of such things.

150
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,560
I've definitely tried it.

151
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,800
But she doesn't like my style.

152
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,520
Don't misunderstand.

153
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,800
I didn't mean that.

154
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,760
I mean, Mr. Jin

155
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,640
likes to talk about business.

156
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,080
But I can't do that.

157
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,720
I have to depend on you.

158
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:22,760
Come on.

159
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,120
Hello.

160
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,720
Hello.

161
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,000
Sorry, I was busy.

162
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,360
We're from the Market Supervision and Management Bureau.

163
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,680
You're reported to be

164
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,040
unqualified for hygiene.

165
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,000
Please cooperate with the investigation.

166
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,280
What?

167
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,760
You're so talented.

168
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,000
Why can't you use me?

169
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,120
We're short of people in the studio.

170
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,560
You can be the finalist.

171
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,440
If you say so,

172
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,440
I'm busy now.

173
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,280
I'm going home to make cakes.

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,160
Is it that important?

175
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,160
Of course.

176
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,920
I'm leaving.

177
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,080
Xu Ben Yan.

178
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,680
Where's Xu Ben Yan?

179
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,480
He's not here.

180
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,080
He went out.

181
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,840
Where did he go?

182
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,160
He went to do some work.

183
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,920
If you're not in a hurry...

184
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,120
I'm in a hurry.

185
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,200
I'm in a hurry.

186
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,080
Can't you see that?

187
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm in a hurry.

188
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,920
Where's his address?

189
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,200
Tell me now.

190
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
At Banxin Hotel.

191
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,400
Thanks.

192
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,080
I'll give you two bottles later.

193
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,000
No.

194
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
That's expensive.

195
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,480
He's going to the table?

196
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,640
No.

197
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,040
Don't change my business.

198
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,480
You said the sea is blue.

199
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,840
The silence of deep breathing

200
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,600
needs to be replaced with heart

201
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:43,480
when the sun shines through the sea.

202
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,120
You said the romantic sky

203
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,520
will meet the sea.

204
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,960
The warm sea breeze

205
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,320
is worth your love.

206
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,880
I hide out in the clouds

207
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,760
to prepare for my confession.

208
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,600
You said the romantic sky

209
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,960
will meet the sea.

210
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,400
The sudden feelings

211
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,760
are all because of you.

212
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,280
I'm leaning on the evening breeze.

213
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,000
Waiting for you to pass by the window.

214
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Waiting for you to pass by the window.
