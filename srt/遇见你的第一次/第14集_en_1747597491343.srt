Episode 16

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's not a good idea to wait so long.

6
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
President Jin, it might be a little late in the afternoon.

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Remember to attend. Don't forget.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Okay.

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Xu Bai Yan.

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So you are the smart and intelligent President Xu.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hello, President Jin. I'm Xu Bai Yan.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's a good coincidence that I met you here.

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Since we are so fated,

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I wonder if President Xu will have time to chat with me later.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Of course. It's my honor.

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Please.

17
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The style is elegant and creative.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You are so creative.

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm not exaggerating.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
President Xu, you are indeed talented.

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The games you have played in recent years

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
are all invested by Long Teng Capital.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No matter how much you owe,

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
it's useless to not have a good profit.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
So you are better than me.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm just helping my family to do business.

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Investment cost, revenue.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Just that.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
But I can see that

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
President Xu, you want to make a real good work,

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
not a product.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
How can a good work lack business opportunities?

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I think the goal between me and President Jin is not conflicted.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
My partner, Lu Li, said that

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
you are a very professional investor.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I think the project you want should be both.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Isn't it?

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
President Xu, you are really interesting.

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Come on, tell me about your project in detail.

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You are drunk, Miss.

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We really don't have this person.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Just help me to see.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Have you really never seen this person?

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No, no.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
He is really nice.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
His name is Xu Baiyan.

48
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
President Jin,

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
this is all the content of our Fenghua Road project.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is indeed a good project.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Just like what you said,

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
full of business opportunities.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
President Jin,

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
there is a woman downstairs making trouble over there.

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
She is calling President Xu to take care of it.

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
How about you...

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Calling my name?

58
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
President Xu, is there any misunderstanding?

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How about we go down and see?

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Okay.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This misunderstanding is big.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What are you doing here?

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Xu Baiyan.

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You have to be responsible for me.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
What are you doing?

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I am not.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I am not.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
As a man,

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
you should do your own work.

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You should be responsible.

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You can't admit what you have done.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It doesn't matter.

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Then, President Jin...

74
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
President Xu, love is like a mall.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You should be responsible.

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You should take care of your own business first.

77
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
No, no.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
President Jin, I...

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I am responsible.

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
It hurts.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Tianan,

82
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
when did you...

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I want to vomit.

84
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Hello, do you have medicine?

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Xu Baiyan.

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Are you okay?

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I really...

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
How did I meet you?

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I want to drink water.

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I want to drink water.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I want to drink water.

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Drink water.

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Here.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Do you want more?

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I want to tell you a secret.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
A secret?

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Really.

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Really.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This secret...

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
My dad, my mom,

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
and even Yan Xiaoyue

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
don't know about this secret.

103
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I don't want to hear it.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I treat you as the most important person in my life.

105
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I must tell you.

106
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Actually, I don't have 36 soldiers.

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Everything is a lie.

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Everything is a lie.

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Comfortable.

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Comfortable.

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
So comfortable.

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Tianan,

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
what are you doing?

114
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Are you crazy?

115
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
How can I tell you?

116
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm leaving.

117
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Don't go.

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Xu Baiyan,

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
you can't go.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I have something to tell you.

121
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
How can you leave?

122
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Do you know why I drink today?

123
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Why?

124
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I drink to prove it to you.

125
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
And this bottle of wine

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
is given by your good brother Lu Li.

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He gave you?

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I drank a bottle of wine.

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
How is it?

130
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Now it looks good.

131
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You are really good.

132
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Let's play a game.

133
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Play a game?

134
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I will perform a show for you.

135
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Come on.

136
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I will perform a show for you.

137
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I tell you.

138
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I was a child.

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Are you okay?

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I was a dance teacher when I was a child.

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Can't you see it?

142
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You are right.

143
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Do you know what is called bold dance?

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Sit down.

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Look.

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I want to

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
be impulsive.

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Impulsive.

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
And new name is Dongbo.

150
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Do you know it?

151
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Dongbo.

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Come on.

153
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And there is a fierce dance.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Okay.

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Stop dancing.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Don't move.

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I can also do this.

158
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I can also do this.

159
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
How is it?

160
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Okay.

161
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I can also do this.

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Xu Baiyan.

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Why am I so unlucky?

164
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I met you.

165
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Xu Baiyan.

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
How did I offend you?

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I am so unlucky.

168
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Why did you report me?

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I didn't report you.

170
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You did.

171
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I really didn't.

172
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What did I do?

173
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I just wanted to be a matchmaker.

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Now the matchmaker also reported me.

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I thought you were so unlucky.

176
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Why are you so unlucky?

177
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Okay.

178
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Okay.

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't touch me.

180
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You broke my fake eyelashes.

181
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Did you?

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Okay.

183
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You are tired.

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Do you still dance?

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Tibetan dance, Mongolian dance, Xinjiang dance.

186
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I can do all of them.

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I can dance for two hours without tiredness.

188
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You are so good.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Although it sounds like you are praising me.

190
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But I don't feel happy at all.

191
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Tell me.

192
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What do you want to do?

193
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I want to go home.

194
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Xu Baiyan.

195
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Xu Baiyan.

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Take me home.

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But you can't even sit properly.

198
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
How can I take you home?

199
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I have an idea.

200
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Ding Danxing.

201
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
This is the way you think, right?

202
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Don't you think this is a good idea?

203
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Xu Baiyan.

204
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Are you cold?

205
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Hold me tight.

206
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm going to drive.

207
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Ready.

208
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Go.

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Go.

210
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Go.

211
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Go.

212
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Go.
