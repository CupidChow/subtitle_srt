1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like the breeze of March and the rain of July

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The gentle sun and you who are free

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Holding your hand and I am healed by you

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The breeze of youth and the rain of the night

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The beautiful moon is shining on you

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The deep blue eyes, oh I can't forget

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Episode 16

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I burned the pot and made it all over the house.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's my problem.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
But it's hard for you to be so hard.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I can't do it.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I can't do it.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I can't do it.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I can't do it.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
But it's hard for you to be so hard.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Okay, okay, okay.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's my problem, my responsibility.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I admit.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I can't pay you.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
It's just a original manuscript.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
One week.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ten days.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Within ten days.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I will return all the lost original manuscripts to you.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No need.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No one can draw my paintings.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hey.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Is your painting so hard to draw?

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
At least I am the best painter in the world.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You are not going to work tomorrow?

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
How do you know my ID?

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
How is it possible?

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Absolutely impossible.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
How is it impossible?

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Take me to see your painting.

37
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
No need.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It's necessary.

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Xu Peiyan, let go.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Let go of me.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Let go of me.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let go.

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What do you want?

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Show me your manuscript.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No.

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If you don't show me, I won't leave tonight.

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Go away.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Go away.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What's this?

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You don't recognize the words?

52
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It says, the goddess of moonlight.

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What's this?

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
A book.

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You don't even know the book.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The principle of baking.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The method of baking bread.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The method of baking bread.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You just read this.

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I beg you.

61
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm a baking master.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm a dessert master.

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I don't read these books.

64
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What books do I read?

65
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Le Moulin.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Bouliman.

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Liebing.

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Have you read Da Fanqi's books?

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You draw.

70
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Stay away from me.

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You are strange.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I just do a part-time job.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Do I have to draw a famous book?

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Go away.

75
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Get out of my room.

76
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Stop reading.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Get out of my room.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Xu Ban Yan, I tell you.

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
If you don't have my permission,

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
you will never go to the second floor.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
My ancestors.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You finally have the heart to look for me.

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You finally came.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The best painter of the last national vote.

85
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The prize and the trophy are still in my house.

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I have enough prize money.

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Those things are not important to me at all.

88
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What you said is not wrong.

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
But what if you let those who didn't win the trophy say?

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Especially that Long Yan.

91
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You will be pressed into the second place.

92
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So that's why.

93
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I said why he wanted to kill me yesterday.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What do you mean?

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
That Long Yan you just said.

96
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The second place.

97
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He lived in my house last night.

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And I told him to know.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I won't go to work tomorrow.

100
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Wait.

101
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You mean you live with a male painter?

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Yes, Ding Nan Qing.

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What can I do?

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Think about the point.

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
The point is that I...

106
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I...

107
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm a fake.

108
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Tell me quickly.

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Is he handsome?

110
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Is he 1.8 meters tall?

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Is he handsome?

112
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You are so gossipy.

113
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Tell me quickly.

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
The wind and rain have entered the internal stage.

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The overall temperature of the day has risen.

116
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But the distance from the estimated popularity.

117
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
There is still a clear distance.

118
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Anyway, I am the first painter in Weiman.

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You won't go to work tomorrow?

120
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
How do you know my ID?

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
How is it possible?

122
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Absolutely impossible.

123
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
How is it impossible?

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Mr. Xu, what do you think?

125
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What do you think?

126
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The person who is the spokesperson?

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Do you have a suitable person to recommend?

128
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Mr. Xu, please look.

129
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
In terms of the comprehensive aspect,

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I think this is a very suitable coser called Xia Dong Ge.

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I am also one of the internal players invited by Fang Yun Lu.

132
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I am very good at the plot and style of the whole game.

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Just a little suggestion.

134
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I think that in the current game,

135
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
the characters' interests are not very characteristic.

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You can consider trying to change the painter in charge of CG.

137
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Like Weiman magazine,

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
a few months ago,

139
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
a public painter was selected.

140
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The champion, not going to work tomorrow,

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
is a very unique master with his own style.

142
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He is my friend.

143
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I can introduce him to you.

144
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
And now, the painter hired by your company is...

145
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Long... Long Yan.

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
As the second place,

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
he is always defeated by his subordinates.

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
If he can draw for Fang Yun Lu,

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
then the character's love and welcome will increase a lot.

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Thank you for your valuable opinion.

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We will carefully consider it.

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Okay, then we'll just do it for today.

153
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You must think about it.

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I really did it for the sake of the game.

155
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay, okay.

156
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Take care.

157
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Little friend, you don't understand anything.

158
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I don't understand.

159
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I just think that you...

160
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You didn't go home tonight and you're much better than him.

161
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Right?

162
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
He is indeed a painter.

163
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He always makes me feel uncomfortable.

164
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Forget it.

165
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You can't work today.

166
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Let's go out and play.

167
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You want to go out and play all day long.

168
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
When will you finish your work?

169
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I can't finish my work.

170
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
When can I stop working?

171
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let me take you to a place.

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Good luck with peach blossoms.

173
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Here, drink some water.

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Water crystal ball, hand ring.

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You're so good at combining things.

176
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
How can you know so many strange people?

177
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Xiao Lu, you look so good.

178
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You must have a good luck with your luck recently.

179
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Oh, right.

180
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I came here today

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
mainly to show this friend of mine.

182
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You're a little bit difficult as a friend.

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
But I think you look like a cook, right?

184
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Did you tell her?

185
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I swear I didn't say anything.

186
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
A twin and a virgin.

187
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I don't deserve it.

188
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
How about you two break up?

189
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Don't talk nonsense.

190
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm leaving.

191
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Wait.

192
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Why are you leaving?

193
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's not time to pay the consultation fee.

194
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Xiao Lu, for the sake of the consultation fee,

195
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll give you a few more words of good luck.

196
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Yes.

197
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Do you have a blind date recently?

198
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Me?

199
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't need a blind date.

200
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm telling you.

201
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
In the last few months,

202
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
the chance of finding true love is as high as four and a half stars.

203
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You must seize the opportunity.

204
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm telling you.

205
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Recently, we have a few single parties here.

206
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Do you want to come and play?

207
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Isn't this a superstition?

208
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But I've read so many new horoscopes.

209
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I didn't see which book said I could meet four and a half stars.

210
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
This time is fate's arrangement.

211
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Boss, didn't you arrange it?

212
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You...

213
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
What single party?

214
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Tell me.

215
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm telling you.

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You'll know when you come at 7.30 pm the day after tomorrow.

217
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
7.30 pm on the day of the wedding.

218
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Xiao Lu, your friend...

219
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What?

220
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't bother him.

221
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
7.30 pm on the day of the wedding.

222
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I will never let you down.

223
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
7.30 pm.

224
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The sea is so blue.

225
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
The silence needs to be heard.

226
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
When the sun shines through the sea.

227
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Listen to you.

228
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Romantic sunny days will meet the sea.

229
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The warm sea breeze is worth your love.

230
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I hide in the clouds.

231
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Prepare my confession.

232
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Listen to you.

233
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Romantic sunny days will meet the sea.

234
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
The sudden touch is because of you.

235
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm in the arms of the evening breeze.

236
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Waiting for you to pass by the window.

237
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm in the arms of the evening breeze.

238
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Waiting for you to pass by the window.
