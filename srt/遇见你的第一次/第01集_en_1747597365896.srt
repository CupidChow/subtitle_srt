1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like the breeze of March and the rain of July

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The gentle sun and you who are free

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Holding your hand and I am healed by you

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The breeze of youth and the rain of the night

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The distant moon shines on you

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The deep eyes, oh I can't forget

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Episode 16

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Aunt Wen said

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If I don't live here

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I will let her down

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let her down with her youth

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
My mom said

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Even if I die

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I can only be in this room

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
To play the instrument

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So I will live here from today

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So I will continue to live here

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Don't make any trouble for me

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You can put all the trouble I made in the refrigerator

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I won't change anyway

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
In case I force you to die

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's see today's news

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Ex-girlfriend together to buy a house

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The biggest problem is that the property rights belong to the city

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Mom is a rebel, son and daughter are in trouble

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Single man and widow are forced to live together

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Law of the Three Kingdoms

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I am Ding Nanxing

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I am a private bodyguard

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Just to be able to take a vacation

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And have fun in time

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Now to avoid blind dates

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
But I am forced to work overtime

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Or the kind of self-sufficiency

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I am Xu Baiye

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
A natural face

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
A person who sees everyone

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
As the life of Mosaic

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Have a game development company

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The biggest wish

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Is 24 hours a day

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Can increase to 28 hours

44
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
So I can complete more

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I am Xu Baiye

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I am a person who sees everyone

47
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
As the life of Mosaic

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
So I can complete more

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What's wrong with the oven temperature?

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's burnt again

51
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Dear customers

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Due to the new product

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The house is not enough material

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So during Valentine's Day

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Stop picking up the order

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Thank you, Sister Liang

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Who?

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Miss Xu

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Why are you here?

60
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why can't I come?

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You are busy recently, right?

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Not busy

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I plan to take a break for two days

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Just baked

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Have a taste

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No need

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's delicious

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's baked outside

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Take a break, right?

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm not going to eat

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm going to eat

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm going to eat

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Take a break, right?

74
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's good

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Explain

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Aunt Wang's nephew

77
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Asked you to go out for dinner

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Why refused?

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Mom, you are here again

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Is it that girls

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Must get married when they are old enough?

82
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Who can save me?

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Hello, Xiaoyue

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You just wait for me in the bar

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Hello, sir

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What do you need?

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm going to the bar

88
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You must tell our Miss Xu

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Don't find me a boyfriend again

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Bye

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Bye

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So perverted

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Keep staring at her chest

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What's this?

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What's this?

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I can see her face clearly

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Have you seen enough?

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Sorry

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Master, go back to Nan Yue?

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Go back

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Then help me

102
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm sorry

103
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm sorry

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm sorry

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm sorry

106
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm sorry

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm sorry

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm sorry

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm sorry

110
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm sorry

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm sorry

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Then pack the car and walk around

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
OK, last set

114
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Get in the car

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Thank you, master

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
What are you doing?

117
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's dangerous to take a black car

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Who are you?

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Do you know that

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You are rude to do this?

121
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I just want to remind you

122
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's really dangerous to take a black car

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I think you are more dangerous than a black car

124
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Thank you

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Miss Xu

126
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
If you really like to take care of children

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll give you a month-end training class

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Let you take care of children

129
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Don't force me to get married, OK?

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What do you want to do if you don't get married?

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Be an old man

132
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm rich and free

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I'm free

134
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
What old man?

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What's wrong with being an old man?

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You don't even have a decent job

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You are embarrassed to say whether you are rich or not

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm worried that you will get old

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Miss Xu

140
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm your daughter

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Pay attention to your own words, OK?

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Just your daughter

143
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
If I work hard

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I must be working hard

145
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Now open a dessert shop

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I can support myself enough

147
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Don't worry about me

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You said you don't go out to socialize

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You can't play with strangers

150
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
No

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This blind date

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You can't give me any advice

153
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What?

154
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Did you hear me?

155
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Hello, mom

156
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Miss Xu

157
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What were you talking about?

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I can't hear you

159
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Hello

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hello

161
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I can hear you

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Master

163
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why did you stop here?

164
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Did you take the wrong way?

165
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes, it's here

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm sorry

167
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm sorry

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm sorry

169
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm sorry

170
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm sorry

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'm sorry

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sorry

173
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'm sorry

174
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm sorry

175
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm sorry

176
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm sorry

177
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm sorry

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm sorry

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm sorry

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm sorry

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I'm sorry

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'm sorry

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm sorry

184
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm sorry

185
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm sorry

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm sorry

187
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sorry

188
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm sorry

189
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm sorry

190
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm sorry

191
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I'm sorry

192
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm sorry

193
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm sorry

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm sorry

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm sorry

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
