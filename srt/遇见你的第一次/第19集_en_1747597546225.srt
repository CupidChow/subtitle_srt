Episode 16

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Old classmate, you're here. Long time no see.

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Long time no see.

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Let's sit down and eat something.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Thank you.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Nanxing, why are you here?

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Why can't I come?

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
After all, you two are getting married.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Nanxing is your matchmaker.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Without her, how could you two know each other?

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I do want to thank Nanxing.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
After all, people who are destined to meet are not bad.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Right?

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
By the way, Nanxing, I heard from Xiao Yue that

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
you also have a boyfriend.

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Why don't you bring him here today

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
to meet him?

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Actually,

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
my boyfriend has work today.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
So I can't come.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Is it inconvenient or...

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Some people

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
like to think they are their mother-in-law.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Do they want to be a real son-in-law?

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They don't think they are strong enough.

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What are you talking about?

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Aren't we all concerned about Nanxing?

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm afraid she will be single all the time.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Then you worry too much.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The boyfriend we are looking for

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
is a soft and hard guy.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But he is good-looking.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've never seen him before. Who knows?

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Whether he is really good-looking

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
or not, I know it in my heart.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I know it in my heart.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What are you doing now?

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Friends, there is an activity.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If we shoot 10 times in a row,

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
we can save the money for this time.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Really?

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So good?

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes, we can try it.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Who will shoot arrows?

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You or you?

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't know how to do it.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Right.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I don't know.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Come here, come here.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Come on.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Jiuxing is here.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't talk nonsense. Hurry up.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Hurry up.

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Why are you here?

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Who is Nanxing?

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This is Nanxing's boyfriend.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So awesome.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Don't listen to him.

62
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Since Xiao Yue praised Mr. Xu,

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
there is a underground house in the sky.

64
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Then Mr. Xu must help us

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
realize our new wish.

66
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Can you?

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Of course.

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Let's go.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So awesome.

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So awesome.

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Ding Nanxing,

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
you are the last one to get angry.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Me?

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I won't get angry.

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'll teach you.

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Go.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Go.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Ding Nanxing.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Ding Nanxing.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Come on.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
So fat.

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Hold it.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Here?

84
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Wait.

85
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I think it's still not working.

86
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm here.

87
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Trust yourself.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Ready.

89
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Come on.

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Three, two, one.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Go.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I hit it.

93
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Xu Baiyan.

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This is my first time to shoot arrows.

95
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hello, sir.

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Your free ticket.

97
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
No need.

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll pay for the whole ticket today.

99
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
OK.

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Xu Baiyan.

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What are you doing?

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What's wrong?

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Didn't you say you were going home?

104
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Why are you here?

105
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm afraid you're in a bad mood.

106
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
So I want to take you out.

107
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm in a bad mood

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's hard to be in a good mood at a party like this.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
How about you?

110
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Are you happy?

111
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I think it's worth it.

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What's worth it?

113
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
When they asked me to say you were my girlfriend,

114
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I was happy.

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's worth it.

116
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But I don't like it.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You did what you thought was right.

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Not everyone likes Prince White Horse who comes from heaven.

119
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't understand what you mean.

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Xu Baiyan.

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You don't have to do this in front of me.

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Really.

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You can be yourself happily.

124
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You don't have to force yourself to do what you don't like.

125
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Ding Nanxin, look at me.

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I've been a facial mask since I was a child.

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I can't see everyone's face.

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But I'm still living with paintings.

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm willing to fight against fate.

130
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I can change myself for you.

131
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Look, you've always been like this.

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You've been changing for others.

133
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You're going to be someone's friend, someone's classmate, someone's brother.

134
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You don't have yourself.

135
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
At this moment, you think you should play the boyfriend of Ding Nanxin.

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
So you appeared.

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So today, you play such a bad scene that was wasted money and time.

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't like to be someone's girlfriend.

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I just want to be myself.

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm just myself.

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What do you mean you just want to be yourself?

142
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What about me?

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
If you don't like me, why did you take me to Mr. Hai Ping?

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
If you don't like me, why did you make me a cake?

145
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If you don't like me, why did you get close to me?

146
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Do you hate this bad scene or do you hate me?

147
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll answer for you.

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I hate everyone, including me.

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I hate you.

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Five yuan.

151
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You can't care about why I came here today.

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Why do you ask?

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Your private room has been reported.

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You can't open the order.

155
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Girl, let me tell you.

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I can feed you and drink with you these months.

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But you have to remember that house must be kept.

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You can't let Xu take the lead.

159
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
What if I say I like Xu Bai Yan?

160
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Actually, I don't have any prejudice against Xu Bai Yan.

161
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I just think he is a child raised by Xu Ting Ting.

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
What did you say just now?

163
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I said, what if I like Xu Bai Yan?

164
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I don't know.

165
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't know.

166
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm hiding in the clouds.

167
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Prepare for my confession.

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I heard you say that the blue sky in the future will meet the sea.

169
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Occasionally, the emotions come because of you.

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm leaning on the arms of the evening wind.

171
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Waiting for you to pass by the window.

172
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Waiting for you to pass by the window.
