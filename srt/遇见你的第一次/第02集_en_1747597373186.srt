1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I like the breeze of March and the clouds of July

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You, the gentle sun and the free you

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Holding your hand and I am being cured by you

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I like the breeze of March and the clouds of July

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You, the gentle sun and the free you

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Holding your hand and I am being cured by you

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I like the breeze of March and the clouds of July

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You, the gentle sun and the free you

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Holding your hand and I am being cured by you

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I like the breeze of March and the clouds of July

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You, the gentle sun and the free you

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Something!

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Wait!

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Sorry, I don't have time to send you home

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I didn't say that you should send me home

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You don't have to say that I can see it

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But I am really busy, please move away

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You have to be responsible for me

19
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We are in the same room, why should I be responsible for you?

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You are the one who dropped me off the black car

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I lost my car and my things

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's all because of you

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You are not responsible for me, who is responsible for me?

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Take it

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Get in the car

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Get in the car

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What's your name, beauty?

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Shuang Zizuo

29
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Shuang Zizuo

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Shuang Zizuo is really popular this month

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Really?

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I will order the most handsome guy in the whole place

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Is the beauty alone?

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Sorry, I don't want to drink tonight

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That's good

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is a drink that I asked this drinker to make for you

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Blueberry juice

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I see you have been sitting here alone tonight

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You must have some troubles

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
According to scientific research

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
When people have troubles

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
They should drink something sweet

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It will make them feel better

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Nonsense

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Listen

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
How is it?

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I ordered it for you

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I find you are funny

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Are you being too deliberate?

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No, it's not deliberate

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The impulsiveness of liking someone

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Can't be hidden

53
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's good to take the initiative

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But I'm not interested in you

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm not interested in you

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You are so bad

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Ding Nanxin didn't wait for you

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
She just waited for a bad guy

59
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If it wasn't for you

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I would have been in the company long ago

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Thank you for saving me

62
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Sorry, I'm late for work

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But I personally suggest

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We have to go to see it as soon as possible if we are sick

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
As soon as possible

67
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You mean I'm sick

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I just saved you

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I thanked you

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But am I honest?

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'm telling the truth

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You are so rude to others

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
To be honest

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm polite to normal people

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You say I'm not normal

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Isn't this obvious?

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
gone

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Miss Guo Hechai Qiao

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I hope we will never meet again

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Sick and sick

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I think so too

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
See you later

83
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Go

84
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Pervert

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's ridiculous

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Hello, Xiao Yan

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I've been looking for a long time

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Really didn't find

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I went to the village of Nan Yue Village

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The village of Nan Yue Village

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Are you sure it's here?

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Bai Yan, I told you

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
This house is very close to me

94
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You have to take this house back

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I really didn't see

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
White house, right?

97
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I saw it

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Hello, this is

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Why are you

100
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Why are you here

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Why did you know my house is here

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You follow me

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Pervert

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Not

105
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Pervert

106
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What is this little auntie's house?

107
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Pervert

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I didn't do it wrong

109
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Is it here

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm sorry

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sorry

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm sorry

113
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm sorry

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Hello, auntie

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't think I can take this house today

116
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Are you sure it's here?

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Who is it?

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Knock knock knock early in the morning

119
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
How is it you

120
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I thought you were a pervert last night

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Pervert, evil, not expensive

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Today I brought a person

123
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
A crazy hand

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Crazy

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Who did he say?

126
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He lashed my car yesterday

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Today he lashed my house

128
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Is it possible that he also wants to lash your person?

129
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
roll

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Okay

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What are you doing again

132
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is the property certificate of this house

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There is my aunt's name on it

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Look carefully

135
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I also have a real estate

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It says my mother's name on it

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Hello

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Little auntie has to live here

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I don't have money to find a place to live

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
And I can sleep in the studio

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This house was bought by his mother and me

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
How did it become their private property now?

143
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You have so many properties

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You can't live here even if you live here once

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The house is not important

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What's important is that you can't be wronged

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Wronged?

148
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He is wronged

149
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
If you can drive this kid out of this house

150
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
And vent your anger on me

151
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I promise you

152
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I will never force you to get married and have children in a year

153
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Ten years, a leave, no return

154
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You can't mention getting married, having children, going to the park

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Or I will give this young master Xu a place

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
If you really can't get back this house

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You have let auntie down

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You have let mom down

160
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
For the 20 years of your care

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I tell you

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Even if you want to die

163
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You have to vent your anger on this house

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Do you hear me?

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes

166
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I want to see you

167
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Walked by the side

168
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Watching the sunrise

169
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
When the sun rises

170
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The wind blew through the sand

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The clouds opened the sky

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The beach and the sea

173
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Are slowly coming together

174
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Holding hands, you said

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The sea waves are close

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The deep breathing is quiet

177
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I need to use my heart

178
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
When the sun rises

179
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The waves are close

180
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The sea waves are quiet

181
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I need to use my heart

182
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
To let the sun rise

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The waves are quiet

184
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I need to use my heart

185
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
To let the sun rise

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The waves are quiet

187
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I need to use my heart

188
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
To let the sun rise

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The waves are quiet

190
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I need to use my heart

191
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
To let the sun rise

192
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
The waves are quiet

193
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The waves are quiet

194
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
The sea waves are quiet

195
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I need to use my heart

196
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
To let the sun rise

197
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The waves are quiet

198
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The waves are quiet

199
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The sea waves are quiet

200
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:13,000
There is No honor

201
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
that no father can get

202
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I want to give my heart

203
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
In his hands
