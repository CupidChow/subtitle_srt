1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like the breeze of March and the rain of July

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The gentle sun and you who are free

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Holding your hand and I am healed by you

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The breeze of youth and the rain of the night

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The bright moon shines on you

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The deep blue eyes, oh I can't forget

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Episode 16

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hurry up.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The oven is just ready.

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Xu Wen Yan, why are you still here?

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Get out of my kitchen.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Ding Nan Xing, do you want to consider what I said?

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No.

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Why is Mr. Xu in your house?

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You know him?

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Isn't he the person in charge of the light and technology?

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We met before.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
But why does he pretend not to know me?

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
He is a bad guy.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Xu, he is definitely a bad guy.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He is a bad guy.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Bad guy? He is definitely a bad guy.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Why is he a bad guy?

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I went to his company for an interview.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He is too bad.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You also think he is a bad guy?

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Bad guy.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I will pour you some hot water.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's talk about how he is a bad guy.

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
If I tell him that I was rejected by him in the interview,

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
wouldn't it be very embarrassing?

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What? What did you say?

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I mean he was in the interview.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He was too bad.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I won't mention it.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
He wouldn't say it so badly, right?

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He really bullied you?

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Xu Bai Yan.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
He lived in my house, ate my cake,

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and bullied me.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now he is bullying my friend.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Today, today,

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
today,

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
today,

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
if you don't die, I will live.

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I will live.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Wait for me.

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If you don't die, I will live.

51
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Isn't it the same meaning?

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Weird woman.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
If she is not afraid of losing,

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
why doesn't she accept my challenge?

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
She is afraid that she will lose.

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So she doesn't want to compete with me, right?

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I found it.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What are you doing?

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I heard that you bullied my friend.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
So...

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You are so rude.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's just a competition.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I promise you.

64
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You agree?

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But I have a condition.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What condition?

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Whoever loses

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
will move out of this room.

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
It's a deal.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
It's a deal.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's a deal.

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You keep your promise.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You said I was childish.

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I didn't mature much when I saw you.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I will live.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If you don't die, I will live.

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Isn't it the same meaning?

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Weird woman.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
If she is not afraid of losing,

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
why doesn't she accept my challenge?

81
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
She is afraid that she will lose.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So she doesn't want to compete with me, right?

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I heard that you bullied my friend.

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000

I heard that you bullied my friend.

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000

Missing now. Please wait a moment.

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Please call the police.

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Please wait a moment.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Zuo Zuo, where are you?

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The whole venue is waiting for you.

124
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I know.

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Can you let him draw first?

126
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
This is a competition.

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I know it's a competition.

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But I don't have any ideas now.

129
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
How can I draw?

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Do you really want to win?

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Hello, Ding Nanxing.

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Ding Nanxing, say something.

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Ding Nanxing.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000

I'm sorry.

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
But the training was finally over a thousand light years ago.

172
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Thank you.

173
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Thanks, Ding Lanxing.

174
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I didn't know you needed such a car bathroom.

175
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,040
Really?

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
érie.

177
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
But now that you're in the same race with me,

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,120
It's already half past the time of the game

179
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,360
Why are you in such a hurry?

180
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,160
Win her?

181
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,160
That's not easy

182
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,160
Let's go

183
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,000
I took the wrong thing

184
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm sorry

185
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,960
I'm sorry

186
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
I'm sorry

187
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
I'm sorry

188
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
I'm sorry

189
