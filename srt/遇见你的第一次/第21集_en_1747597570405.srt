1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like the breeze of March and the rain of July

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The gentle sun and you who are free

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Holding your hand and I am healed by you

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The breeze of youth and the rain of the night

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The bright moon is shining on you

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The deep eyes, oh I can't forget

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Episode 16

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
The Long Ballad

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Just say what you want to say.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Bai Yan said he wanted to leave this house

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
because he likes you, but you don't like him.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He has always been lost and never used to be disturbed.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So he decided to stay away from your life.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
He said he liked me.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Yes, he likes you.

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
When he was abroad, he also had some women

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
who were strong women and women with a strong heart.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
But he didn't have a heart.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But he didn't like anyone.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Why is he so fond of you?

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What attracts him?

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You should ask me this question, not him.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, tell me why.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Because he is Ding Nanxing.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I hate myself and I hate everyone.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
But I like Ding Nanxing.

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Come with me.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm so worried.

30
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Do you have anything to say to me?

31
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Listen to you, the romantic scenery, the sea,

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
the sea breeze, you deserve to love me.

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm hiding in the clouds.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Xue Bai Yan, I like you.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I don't know when I started to like you.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I want to share everything with you.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I want you to be in my love.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
So, will you be with me?

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What? Are you a goldfish?

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
You forgot what I just said.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Forget it if you can't hear it.

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What? You want to break up?

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Who told you to pretend to not understand?

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You are so rude. Let me go.

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Then I will let you go.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Let me go.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Since what you said doesn't count,

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I will ask you.

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Miss Ding Nanxing, I like you.

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Can we be together?

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Can we be together?

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I don't want to.

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The sea breeze, you deserve to love me.

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm hiding in the clouds.

55
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Prepare my confession.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Listen to you, the romantic scenery, the sea,

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
the sea breeze, you deserve to love me.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay, I agree.

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Thank you, auntie.

60
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
But you don't have to be so happy.

61
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I can understand you.

62
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What do you mean?

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Five years in England, five years in France, five years in the United States.

64
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Even if it's a small horse, you should go to the battlefield.

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You are going to return the investment.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You have grown up overnight.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You don't do this kind of business.

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What do you mean?

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
To be honest, you took away the most capable manager.

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Tell me, how to pay?

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
How about I pay you the interest?

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
As your manager?

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The interest is worth more than five million.

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What?

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
One side wants to pay back all the tuition fees to the other side.

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Five million?

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I haven't calculated the interest and living cost.

78
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm kind.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Where did we get five million in such a short time?

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
If you can't do it,

81
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
you can go to Europe with me.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Take over all my business in Europe.

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The entry fee at that time was not five million.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And this house is probably worth five million.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Do you understand what I mean?

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This is his mother.

87
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I understand.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't worry.

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I can do it.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay.

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I look forward to it.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Believe me.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Ding Nanxing.

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Hello, Miss Ding.

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Mr. Xu.

96
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Is the decoration style here very special?

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
In order to make our employees feel like home,

98
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
the decoration style of the studio is also similar to home.

99
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Of course.

100
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The budget of the studio is limited.

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's also part of the reason.

102
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Miss Jin.

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You have made some suggestions to the Human Resources Association of Fenghua Road.

104
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
So now we cut in from the perspective of women.

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Make some changes.

106
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You do it.

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It seems to be different.

108
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
But it doesn't feel like it was lost before.

109
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
That's because when I was editing,

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I only changed the flat things, not the ancient ones.

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I think the male style designed by Mr. Xu before is more tough and handsome.

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I added some elements that women like.

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I think this way,

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
the tolerance should be higher.

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
So that's it.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Miss Ding, you are talented.

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You are overpraising.

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I think this is just a difference between the male and female artists.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
And Mr. Xu is also a very good artist.

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Of course.

122
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
It's a good combination.

123
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
But I personally like Miss Ding's style more.

124
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Mr. Xu, you know that

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I have no resistance to the girl's heart.

126
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Miss Jin, you are a girl.

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
If you like it, it proves that all our directions are right.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Right?

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I look forward to this cooperation.

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What does Miss Jin mean?

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Mr. Xu, I think you should give Miss Ding the right to

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
be responsible for all the details of the characters in this style.

134
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't mind making a birth of a great work.

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
No problem.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No problem at all.

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I agree.

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Then I look forward to it.

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
OK.

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm leaving today.

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
OK. OK. OK.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Goodbye, Miss Jin.

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Goodbye.

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Bye.

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Come on.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Goodbye.

147
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Goodbye, Miss Jin.

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
OK. Goodbye.

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Goodbye.

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Thank you.

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Be careful, master.

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Bye. Bye.

153
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Goodbye. Bye.

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We are lucky to have won the competition.

155
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Xu Baiyan, I will work hard.

156
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Actually, if you don't want to work hard,

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I can help you.

158
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I...

159
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm willing to.

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
When I was a kid, my father told me that

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
when you grow up, you should do what you like.

162
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You don't have to care about anyone's thoughts.

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Until he died of heart disease

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
because of too much work pressure.

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
At that moment, I told myself

166
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
that everything is better than nothing.

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Life is the most important.

168
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's nothing wrong to be a free-spirited fish.

169
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
So this is the reason

170
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
why you don't want to work hard all the time.

171
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But now I have a new idea.

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I remember I told you

173
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
if you can't be with this person all the time

174
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
and give him happiness,

175
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
don't stop his life.

176
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
But now I think

177
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
if you really love each other,

178
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
you can change for each other

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and become a better person.

180
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Love is a matter between us.

181
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
So I don't need to prove anything to you.

182
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I just want to tell you

183
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
that everything I do now is because of you.

184
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I won't leave you.

185
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You can't leave me either.

186
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I won't leave you either.

187
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I want to share with you

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
a secret about me.

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What secret?

190
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This is...

191
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
This is the light in my dark eyes.

192
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Please.

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Please don't leave us.

194
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Bai Yan is not a fool.

195
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Everything will be fine.

196
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
How old is he?

197
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He can't even recognize people.

198
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He said it's not a problem of his IQ.

199
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He has been making mistakes since he was born.

200
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He is not a fool.

201
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
He is not a fool.

202
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He has been making mistakes since he was born.

203
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
He is a blind man and a psychologist.

204
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
He won't be a problem for the rest of his life.

205
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You are so generous.

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You still want to save me.

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Then you can take care of yourself.

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I can't stand it anymore.

209
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I really want to have a Doraemon.

210
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I can get all kinds of props from her pocket.

211
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Help me get 100 points and get first place.

212
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But I found that

213
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Doraemon never existed.

214
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And it's so big.

215
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I really tried my best.

216
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Even though I have a sense of shame,

217
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I can't let it go.

218
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I can't let it go.

219
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I can't let it go.

220
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I can't let it go.

221
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Even though I have a sense of shame,

222
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I still hope that I can overcome everything.

223
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But after I met you,

224
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I realized that

225
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
there is something called talent

226
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
in this world.

227
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Xu Baiyan,

228
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
do you know that

229
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
God gives you perseverance and courage.

230
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
This is something I will never forget.

231
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You are very good.

232
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
So you don't have to envy me.

233
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I met you yesterday.

234
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
We walked side by side.

235
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I was anxious.

236
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The sun rises.

237
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The wind blows through the mountains.

238
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The clouds open the sky.

239
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The beach and the sea are full of you.

240
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You said that

241
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
the sea waves are clear.

242
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The silence of deep breathing.

243
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I need to use my heart

244
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
to wait for the sun to pass the sea.

245
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Listen to you.

246
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The romantic sky

247
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
will meet the sea.

248
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The warm sea breeze

249
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
is worth your love.

250
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I hide in the clouds.

251
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Prepare my confession.

252
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Listen to you.

253
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The blue sky will meet the sea.

254
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Occasionally, the emotions

255
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
come from you.

256
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm leaning on

257
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
the evening breeze.

258
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Waiting for you to pass by the window.

259
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Waiting for you to pass by the window.
