Episode 16

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I just don't understand

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Since you treat Mr. Xu of Lingguan Technology

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
as a stranger, why do you still...

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Kids are not sensible, right?

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They think that the way he has been given

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
is the way he has walked out.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
As an elder, you should always be cool.

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let him understand that

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
the world can't be completely as he wishes.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Mom, don't think too much.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Aunt has never taken care of me.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Really.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm busy every day now.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Your daughter and I

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
are now the main artists in the studio.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Do you feel proud?

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Don't worry.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I won't make myself too tired.

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Mom, I'm going to call someone.

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I won't talk to you now.

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Bye.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's Xi Ke.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Why don't you serve him in front of the store?

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why do you come to my house?

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Peng Ping, where is Xu Bayan?

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He's not at home. He went out.

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Went out?

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He went out after he got a fire in his ass.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Did the studio catch fire?

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What fire?

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Didn't he show you the messages I sent him?

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What messages?

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Jin Meina is the person of auntie.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Jin Meina is the person of auntie?

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hello, President Xu.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm in the studio.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Stop pretending.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I invested in the company.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What else do I know?

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let the little girl answer the phone.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Wait a minute.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Auntie, answer the phone.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's me.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I guess you know it.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I just heard it.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Then you should know that

51
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
the contract between Lin Guang and Jin Meina has been cut off.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I guessed it.

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But there is one thing you don't know.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I've banned Xu Bayan.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Xu Bayan was...

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm not...

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm the devil on your love road.

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You should know your true ability.

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Besides, you're making money from Xu's family.

60
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It doesn't seem to be a good thing.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I've discussed it with Xu Bayan.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
He also agreed to let you pass my exam

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
with your own ability.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
But you can also give up.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I can arrange a farewell party for you.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
No need.

67
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you, Aunt Meina.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'll finish the contract between us on time.

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Goodbye.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
My phone?

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You heard it.

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
There are two blinds.

73
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
They're more responsible than I thought.

74
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
How many days left?

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Seven days.

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Good.

77
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If it's me,

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll go to see if my passport expired.

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Do I need to take a new photo?

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's a decision I've made with him.

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I trust him.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Okay.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm looking forward to it.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Five million?

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
My god.

86
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Where can we get so much money?

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
We're not in a relationship.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The key is...

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The key is that Xu Bayan is banned now.

90
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Right?

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Listen to me.

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The key is...

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What can be more important than five million?

94
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Listen to me.

95
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The key is that we need to meet Xu Bayan first.

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
We'll lead the security guard to see Xu Bayan.

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Let's go.

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Let's go with the flow.

99
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
President Xu.

100
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
A girl is here.

101
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're so petty.

102
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Call Bayan.

103
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Stop.

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Don't move.

105
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You...

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Please take off your mask.

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What's wrong?

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
My girlfriend is exercising.

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I can't.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
President Xu, you got the wrong person.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Xu Tianxiao.

112
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Xu Xiuyun.

113
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Are you crazy to marry a stranger?

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I know what I'm doing.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I've made up my mind.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You told me that you didn't believe in love.

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You said you'd never marry again.

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You said you'd buy a house and raise your children.

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Now you're going to leave after you meet your true love.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't be so mean.

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What do you mean by that?

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'm not being mean.

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
When I bought the house, I paid half of the rent.

124
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I was the one paying the rest.

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If I can't, I'll sell the house.

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll split the rent.

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Xu Xiuyun.

128
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You'll pay for your love-sickness.

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
When you lose your husband and get married,

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
you'll know how terrible you are.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You're so disappointed.

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I've been doing well these years.

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm worried.

141
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Don't hug me.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Hello, your takeout.

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I didn't order this.

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Wait a minute.

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This is the star baking room.

146
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm sorry, it's mine.

147
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay, enjoy your meal.

148
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I can't wait to see you in person.

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Eat well.

150
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't get sick.

151
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You're following me.

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You pervert.

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This is my little house.

154
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You pervert.

155
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You're weird.

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you're not afraid of showing your face,

157
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
why don't you accept my challenge?

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You're afraid you'll lose.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So you don't want to tell me the truth.

160
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You always say I'm a fool.

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I think you're so stupid.

162
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I have a little bit of love.

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm trying to hide from your love.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Have you ever used special ingredients to make cake?

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Duck egg cake.

166
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
In the vast night sky,

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I hear your voice.

168
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You say I love you.

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm willing to give up all my superpowers.

170
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Connected together,

171
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
like the love I hugged you.

172
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I never met such a guy.

173
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm not like 너то if I'm not upset.

174
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm not like him.

175
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm like him.

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Hello, I have to talk to you.

177
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm Wang Patronid.

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm trying to Native Americans now.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm busy the most.

180
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Can you share this?

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I have PartJuan.

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Haha, I know where you are.

183
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
No.

184
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Ok, I'll share with you.

185
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

188
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

190
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

191
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

192
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

193
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

194
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

196
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

197
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

198
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

199
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

200
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

201
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

202
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

203
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

205
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

206
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

207

I'm not afraid of anything.

208
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

209
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
All the long and hard stories

210
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
are connected together

211
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
like the bond we have.

212
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Really, uncle?

213
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Of course.

214
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's nothing.

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Okay.

216
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Last time, Xiao Yue treated you like this.

217
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I haven't had time to apologize.

218
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Besides, you deserve this money.

219
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Uncle, don't say that.

220
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Then,

221
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll leave all the things

222
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
about the Phoenix operation right to you.

223
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll wait for your news.

224
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Okay, don't worry.

225
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Leave these things to me.

226
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Thank you, uncle.

227
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Goodbye, uncle.

228
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Goodbye.

229
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm so worried.

230
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
The sun rises.

231
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The wind blows past the mountain.

232
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The clouds open the sky.

233
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The beach and the sea are full of you.

234
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You said the sea waves are clear.

235
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The silence of deep breathing.

236
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I need to use my heart

237
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
to wait for the sun to pass the sea.

238
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Listen to you.

239
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The romantic sky

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
will meet the sea.

241
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The warm sea breeze

242
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
is worth your love.

243
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I hide outside the clouds.

244
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Prepare my confession.

245
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Listen to you.

246
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The blue sky

247
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
will meet the sea.

248
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Occasionally, the emotions

249
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
come from you.

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm leaning on the arms of the evening wind.

251
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'm waiting for you outside the window.

252
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'm waiting for you outside the window.
