1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like the breeze of March and the rain of July

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The gentle sun and you who are free

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Holding your hand and I am healed by you

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The breeze of youth and the rain of the night

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The distant moon is shining on you

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The deep eyes, oh I can't forget

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I can't forget

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
There is a bear in the cave

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The bear tells the bear a story

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
There was a mountain in the past

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
When I was young, my parents told us stories

12
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Isn't it usually fairy tales?

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Or Cinderella or something like that?

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
When I was young

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
My parents didn't tell me this

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
They would put text books before I went to bed

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And read and understand English words

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You were so poor when you were young

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's okay

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I haven't heard of this after I was five

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why?

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
After I was five, my mom passed away

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You can fly even a stupid bird can fly

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Why can't you?

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You are lazy all day

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Learn from me

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If you can't learn, you can learn from me

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Mom, I did it

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I am not qualified

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
to miss someone

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
who I can't remember

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Am I really qualified

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
or have the right

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
to miss someone

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I don't remember?

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I don't know

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Like you said

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I seem to be

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
In my eyes

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
In the place of 75 million light years away from the earth

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
There is a star group called the star cloud

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It's full of red light

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
In a dark rain

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's there

45
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Shining quietly

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Like an ordinary heart

47
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I remember my aunt told me

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Every family that died

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Would be a star in the sky

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't know if it's a piece of paper

51
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I believe it's true

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Because I hope one day

53
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I can be a star too

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Okay

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The story is over

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The star fell asleep

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The story is over

58
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The story is over

59
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Breakfast prepared for you

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Do you like it?

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Thank you

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
By the way

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Actually I also prepared another gift for you

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Wait for me

65
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll do it

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Let me

67
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
This is the cake I made for you in the morning

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Do you like it?

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Unique

70
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
How is it?

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Really suitable

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
You used special ingredients

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
To make the cake

75
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Excuse me

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Wait for me

77
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
This girl can also make cakes

78
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll be with you

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll be with you

80
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You ate so much

81
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Say something

82
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
How does it taste?

83
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This is already the seventh

84
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I think the sixth is better

85
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Xu Baiyan

86
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You just pretend I didn't say

87
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What's wrong?

88
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
That

89
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
How about

90
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We two go out for a walk

91
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I know

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
There is a particularly beautiful place

93
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I met you yesterday

94
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Walked by the side

95
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
See me anxious

96
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
When the sun rises

97
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The wind blew through the mountains

98
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Clouds open the sky

99
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The beach and the sea are full of you

100
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Hold your hand

101
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You said the waves are clear

102
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The silence of deep breathing

103
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Need to use the heart

104
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let the sun pass the sea

105
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Listen to you

106
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:55,060
Romantic

107
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:59,000
I hide in the clouds

108
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Ready for me

109
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Waiting for you

110
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Whoever's behind
