1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like the breeze of the third month and the rain of the seventh month

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The gentle sun and you who are free

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Holding your hand and I am being healed by you

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The breeze of youth and the rain of the night

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The bright moon is shining on you

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The deep blue eyes, oh I can't forget

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Episode 16

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I remember when I left, the lights were off.

10
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I remember when I left, the lights were off.

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Why did he move back so fast?

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I didn't have time to change the lock.

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,920
Ah!

14
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,280
What are you yelling at?

15
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,520
I won't look.

16
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,440
I won't give you a chance to play the hooligan.

17
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,280
Don't touch me.

18
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,800
Turn around and open your eyes.

19
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,000
No. Don't touch me.

20
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,400
Open your eyes.

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
No.

22
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,520
I'm afraid of my eyes.

23
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,280
Open your eyes.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You...

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,280
You're wearing clothes.

26
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,000
Do you want me to not wear it?

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I... I hope...

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,600
I hope the world is peaceful.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,400
Okay, peace messenger.

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Let's talk about the next cohabitation treaty.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
Since you want to live again,

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,000
then the terms of the treaty

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
must be determined by me.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Okay.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'll go to the room.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll go to the room.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,400
Then I must be the one to decide about the terms of the treaty.

39
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,680
If you have any requests,

40
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,080
go ahead and discuss it.

41
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,400
That's what you said.

42
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,800
If I do,

43
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,000
can you do it?

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,800
Vinก and volin is impossible to catch.

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,400
The first one,

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,600
you must not wear the shorts longer than my pants.

47
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,600
What?

48
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,400
Even though

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,600
I don't know

50
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,400
if you can stay in the summer house,

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,600
but for the sake of safety,

52
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
this one means yes.

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,400
That is, you can't touch anything in my fridge or cabinet.

54
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,040
Unless I treat you to something.

55
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,040
Or you'll be paid.

56
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,520
Okay.

57
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,920
The third one is...

58
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,360
After 10 o'clock,

59
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,560
no noise is allowed.

60
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,400
The fourth one.

61
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,480
Anyway, I'm the boss in this house.

62
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,480
I said no, but no.

63
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,800
I'm asking you to make a request.

64
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Not to do whatever you want.

65
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,680
What I said

66
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,000
is reasonable.

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,920
If you don't think it's okay,

68
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,720
then I'll write it.

69
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,720
You tell me.

70
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,720
I've written it all.

71
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Sign it.

72
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,720
It's so sweet.

73
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,720
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
Miss Xu.

75
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,720
She said she's the legal owner of this house.

76
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,720
How can you kick her out?

77
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,720
Just kick her out.

78
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,720
I can't let her live like this.

79
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,720
Or I'll be embarrassed.

80
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,720
She said she didn't want this house when Xu Tingting went abroad.

81
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,720
Now she's taking it away.

82
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,720
She really thinks I'm a vegetable marketer.

83
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,720
She wants to take it away.

84
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,720
Didn't the doctor tell you

85
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,720
that your sister

86
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,720
is angry and angry.

87
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Don't mind.

88
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
And don't worry.

89
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,720
I'll keep this house for you.

90
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Okay?

91
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,720
You're not looking at this kid, are you?

92
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
Mom.

93
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Don't talk nonsense.

94
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
How can I...

95
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
Mom.

96
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,720
Someone's coming to my house.

97
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,720
I'll hang up now.

98
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Bye.

99
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Coming.

100
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,720
You are...

101
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Lu Li.

102
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,720
We met before.

103
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
You forgot.

104
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,720
You scolded me at the door last time.

105
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,720
You even scolded me as a dog.

106
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
I remember.

107
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,720
Come in.

108
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,720
Close the door.

109
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,720
Xu Baiyan is inside.

110
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
Actually, I'm here to see you today.

111
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Yes.

112
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,720
I want to apologize to you today.

113
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,720
Because of what you reported in the painting.

114
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,720
You may have misunderstood Xu Baiyan.

115
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,720
He didn't do that.

116
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,720
Actually, I...

117
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
It's you.

118
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
You talk too much today.

119
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
I'm just explaining it to you.

120
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,720
You're carrying the pot.

121
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,720
I'm carrying more than this pot.

122
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,720
In English, it's soulmate.

123
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
You probably don't know.

124
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,720
He doesn't like socializing because of some special reasons.

125
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,720
But I'm different.

126
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
I'm just like him.

127
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,720
I have a good personality.

128
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,720
So I have a lot of friends.

129
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:58,720
So I became the only friend of him when I was in college.

130
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,720
After graduation, everyone's working ideas are the same.

131
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,720
Just so happens that his aunt invested in our studio.

132
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,720
So we'll do something together.

133
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
I'll tell you a secret.

134
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
Don't tell anyone.

135
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
What secret?

136
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,720
He doesn't know human face.

137
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
So sometimes he pretends to be a man.

138
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Actually, he's trying to reject socializing.

139
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
Impossible.

140
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,720
He can even see my eyeline.

141
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Really?

142
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
He's still here.

143
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,720
So he thinks...

144
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,720
You can just put these words in your heart.

145
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,720
You have to say it so loudly that I can hear it, right?

146
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
What are you doing?

147
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Ding Danxing.

148
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
I don't have to lie to you.

149
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,720
I have a facial blindness because of the problem in my heart.

150
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,720
It doesn't mean I haven't been in love.

151
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
If you really don't believe me,

152
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
then you can try.

153
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,720
No, no.

154
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
I believe you.

155
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
I believe you.

156
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,720
Hello, Xiaoyue.

157
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,720
Your call is so timely.

158
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,720
Nanxiang, I...

159
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,720
I need you.

160
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,720
I need you.

161
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
I need you.

162
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
The sun rises.

163
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
The wind blows past the mountain.

164
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
The clouds open the sky.

165
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,720
The beach and the sea are romantic.

166
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,720
We hold hands and talk about the harmony of the waves.

167
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,720
The silence of deep breathing.

168
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,720
I need to use my heart to wait for the sun to pass the sea.

169
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
Listen to you.

170
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
Romantic classics.

171
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,720
The sea where we meet.

172
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,720
The warm sea breeze is worth your love.

173
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
I hide in the clouds.

174
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Prepare my confession.

175
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
Listen to you.

176
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
The blue sky in the future.

177
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,720
The sea where we meet.

178
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,720
Occasionally, the emotions come from you.

179
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,720
I lean on the arms of the evening breeze.

180
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Waiting for you to pass by the window.

181
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:09,720
Waiting for you to pass by the window.
