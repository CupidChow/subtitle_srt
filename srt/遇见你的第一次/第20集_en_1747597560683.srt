1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like the breeze of March and the rain of July

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The gentle sun and you who are free

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Holding your hand and I am healed by you

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The breeze of youth and the rain of the night

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The beautiful moon is shining on you

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The deep eyes, oh I can't forget

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Episode 16

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What did you say?

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I said, if I like Xu Bai Yan, what should I do?

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
How can you like Xu Bai Yan?

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I introduced you to so many boys, you didn't even look at them.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
What do you like?

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Be more handsome.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Be smarter.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Be more capable.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Be better at home.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If you say so, it seems that he is worth liking.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
If you say so,

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
if I am with Xu Bai Yan,

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
will you support us?

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Will you let go of the grudges between you and his aunt?

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
There is no grudge between me and him.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Tomorrow is the seventh day, he wants to send this gift to confess.

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But you see me, I am so poor.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Enough, the old man over there heard you.

27
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Give it to me.

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You say, this gift doesn't seem to want to confess.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But you want to propose.

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You are only 19 years old, why are you so arrogant?

31
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What do you know?

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
In ancient times, women were married when they were 16 years old.

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Compared to me, it's not too late.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Can we be a new generation of women?

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Independent, strong and confident.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't care, I just want love.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Sweet love.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You are a woman who doesn't even have a first love.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You won't understand.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes, I am a pure tool.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
My Xiaoyun is not a tool.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
My Xiaoyun is a beauty.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Xiaoyun, what do you say I'm not good?

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You are very good.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Then why did she reject me?

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Tingting, if you don't want these love words, you will live better.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You two decided to buy a house together?

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Yes, we paid the deposit on the same day.

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I borrowed some from your grandparents.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
To get it together.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,000
According to the rules at that time, the house is the property of all the people in the property.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So I have one with him.

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Then why did you two get into this?

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Why don't you want to forget it?

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I didn't think he would look at the painting so heavily.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
After graduation, I met your dad.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I told him I was going to get married.

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I won't go abroad with him.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
He got a very bad temper.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Said very harsh words.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Actually, now I can't remember what he scolded me for.

62
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's just that he was young at that time.

63
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He looked at his face more than his life.

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Since then, I haven't contacted him.

65
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't know how he carried it abroad alone for so many years.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
If I have something to do with him,

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I owe him.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't think about the past.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Dad is watching in the sky.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If you really like Xu Baiyan,

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Mom will not object.

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He is a well-mannered child.

73
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
His temperament must be good.

74
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Dad,

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Our generation can't affect your young people.

76
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So do whatever you want.

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Thank you, mom.

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You're welcome.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Then stay for the store tonight.

80
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You are my real mother.

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You have to accompany me.

82
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Consider it.

83
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
In your heart

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The air is so sweet

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
The first time I felt that the dream came true.

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's not that bad.

87
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
But it seems that it's back now.

88
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
In the vast night sky

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I hear your voice

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I said I love you

91
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm willing to give up everything to run to you

92
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Hello, Baiyan.

93
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I admit defeat.

94
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You will agree to move out, right?

95
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Deep love enters your heart

96
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The air is so sweet

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
There are stars at night

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
There are clouds and clouds

99
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
At this moment, I want to hug your coat

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You block the wind for me

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Also help me block the storm

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
In the vast night sky

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I hear your voice

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I said I love you

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm willing to give up everything to run to you

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The stars are connected

107
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's like me hugging you

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There are stars at night

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
There are clouds and clouds

110
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
At this moment, I want to hug your coat

111
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
You block the wind for me

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Also help me block the storm

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Xu Baiyan

114
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
In the vast night sky

115
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I hear your voice

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I said I love you

117
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm willing to give up everything to run to you

118
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The stars are connected

119
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's like me hugging you

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The dream comes true

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Regret is endless

122
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
At this moment, I want to hug your coat

123
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You block the wind for me

124
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Also help me block the storm

125
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
In the vast night sky

126
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I hear your voice

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I said I love you

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm willing to give up everything to run to you

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The stars are connected

130
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It's like me hugging you

131
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I hear your voice

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I said I love you

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm willing to give up everything to run to you

134
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The stars are connected

135
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Do you have guests?

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Don't you know how to serve tea?

137
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It's like me hugging you

138
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Perfect

139
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,480
The wind blows through the mountains

140
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,920
The clouds open the sky

141
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,920
The beach and the sea are full of you

142
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,560
Hold your hand and say the sea waves and you

143
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,880
The silence of deep breathing

144
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,800
Need to use the heart

145
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,360
When the sun passes through the sea

146
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,160
Listen to you say romantic classics

147
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,480
Will meet the sea

148
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,240
The warm sea breeze is worth your love

149
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,840
I hide in the clouds

150
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,720
Prepare my confession

151
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,360
Listen to you say romantic classics

152
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,680
Will meet the sea

153
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,440
Occasionally touching only because of you

154
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,960
I'm leaning on the arms of the evening wind

155
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,960
Waiting for you to pass by the window

156
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:20,720
Waiting for you to pass by the window
