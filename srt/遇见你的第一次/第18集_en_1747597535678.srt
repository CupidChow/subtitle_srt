1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like the breeze of the third month and the rain of the seventh month

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The gentle sun and you who are free

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Holding your hand and I am being healed by you

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The breeze of youth and the rain of the night

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The bright moon is shining on you

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The deep eyes, oh I can't forget

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Episode 16

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What's the password?

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
201314

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Huh?

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
201314

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
201314

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
201314

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
201314

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The Long Ballad

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I happen to be in the sky

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Missing you so much

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
A rain shower in the world

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You appear in front of me

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What are you looking at?

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm looking at you

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm losing my wish, my wish has come true

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm missing you

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The shadow in the light shines on me

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The moon lit the door

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Look at your smile

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm walking with you on the street

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I miss you in the crowd

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
The waves are like the waves under the sea

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I feel so blue

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The smile is like the light in my heart

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Warm like the sun

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The story is short

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The night is beautiful

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The shadow is engraved in my mind

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The clouds and clouds in the sky

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The softness in my heart

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Because you will embrace the sunny day

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Like the sunset, there is no deviation

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You and I continue to warm up

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let time be the happy padlock

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The shadow in the light shines on me

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The moon lit the door

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Look at your smile

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm walking with you on the street

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I miss you in the crowd

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The sea is like the sea

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The waves are like the waves under the sea

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The sea is like the sea

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The waves are like the sea

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The sea is like the sea

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The waves are fruits

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
like the morning summer

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You and I don't disagree

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We want to beorters

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So we don't expect ourselves to be raised

58
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
We hope

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So we present

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But we don't live like that

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We hope

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That it makes a pass

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The flowers strengthen in our hearts

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
But there is no artificial flowers

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Lu Liang.

66
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes!

67
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,740
Three-star

68
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,000
I had a dream last night.

69
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I dreamed that I was married to him and had a child.

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What?

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You are married?

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You have a child?

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I mean, he saw me sleeping last night.

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I had a dream.

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You had a dream?

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He saw you sleeping?

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You dreamed that you were married and had a child?

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You are so wrong.

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I tell you.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I also feel strange.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Why did the dream about him become a reality?

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:08,860
And it's already a matter of scientific

83
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,000
This is called thinking and dreaming.

84
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What are you talking about?

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Love is not as easy as you said.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Love is cultivated.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
How do you know if it's not?

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Then you have to ask him if he is willing.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This Xu Baiyan.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I made him allergic.

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's me wrong.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I also want to take good care of him.

93
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I know to punish me for cleaning.

94
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I am a trash can transfer room.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Just sweep.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Move out.

97
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,000
Didi men's heart.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I have something to tell you.

99
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Yours.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Moving to the country.

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You need to mention.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I will never move.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Other mistake.

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I want to ask you the reason.

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Wait a minute.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, unforgettable.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Will you wait ten minutes before picking it?

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Wait for a second.

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What's the matter?

110
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I saw the news about you.

111
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm not free on the weekend.

112
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Don't come.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I tell you, you must go.

114
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You have to take a man to the venue.

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
By then, you must be in front of Chen Qi Zheng and Ke.

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
To show off.

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
They go?

118
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Of course.

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
He hasn't broken up with the girl he had a crush on before.

120
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I tell you, this time, prepare well.

121
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Must find the venue.

122
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You say it easily.

123
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You are a man is a cabbage.

124
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
How delicious it is.

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You have a fresh cabbage beside you.

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Okay, that's it.

127
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll wait for you on the weekend.

128
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You kissed.

129
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Just...

130
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Head.

131
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So you knocked down people when they were sick.

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He was sick.

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He was already down.

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I didn't knock him down.

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You are taking advantage of the danger of people.

136
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Take advantage of the fire.

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Take advantage of the blood.

138
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I take advantage of you.

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You are a big head.

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
To be honest.

141
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You don't like the blind date that your mother introduced to you.

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Why don't you consider Xu Bai Yan?

143
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Why must I find Xu Bai Yan?

144
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He looks handsome.

145
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Work is decent.

146
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
And very diligent.

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Isn't this your ideal partner?

148
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If I find my ideal partner.

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It should be like me.

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Like to eat and drink.

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Why must I find a workaholic to blame myself?

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You are so idle.

153
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
According to my observation.

154
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I think he likes you.

155
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Shut up.

156
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Don't talk nonsense.

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If my mother knows.

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
She will scold me again.

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Miss Ding Dan Xin.

160
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You are overacting now.

161
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The more you want to clear the relationship.

162
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I think you two have a problem.

163
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Shut up.

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Shut up.

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
By the way.

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Don't forget about the weekend.

167
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I know.

168
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You really have a boyfriend.

169
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Really.

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
He is handsome.

171
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
He is tall.

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Handsome.

173
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Handsome.

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You will know when you come.

175
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Xiao Yue.

176
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Hi.

177
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Come here.

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Why are you here alone?

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I am here alone.

180
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You will be scared.

181
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Wait.

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
What?

183
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I have told you everything.

184
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I said you have a boyfriend.

185
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He is much better than Zheng Ke Du.

186
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But you.

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The key is a broken chain.

188
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What are you talking nonsense with them?

189
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Where did you get a boyfriend?

190
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Are you stupid?

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
In this situation.

192
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You have to say yes.

193
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Remember me.

194
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No.

195

You have waited for a long time.

It's okay.
