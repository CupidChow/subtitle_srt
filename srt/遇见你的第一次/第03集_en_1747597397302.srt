1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I like the gentle sun and you who are free

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Holding your hand and me, I'm being healed by you

3
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The gentle breeze and the rain

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The distant moon shines on you

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The deep blue eyes, oh I can't forget

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
The gentle breeze and the rain

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The deep blue eyes, oh I can't forget

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can only be in this room to vent my anger

9
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So I'm going to live here from today

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So I will continue to live here

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Don't cause me any trouble

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You can put all the trouble I caused on the refrigerator

13
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I won't change it anyway

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In case I force you to die

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's watch a group of today's quick news

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The old friends together go out to buy a house

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The biggest problem is that the property rights belong to the family

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Mom and dad are committing crimes, children are suffering

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
A single man and a widow are forced to live together

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Three rules

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Xu Banyan

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Xu Banyan, what are you doing?

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Hanging flowers on the nail

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Who allows you to hang flowers on the wall

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Hey

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Xu Banyan, what are you doing?

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I just came back from running at night, I want to take a bath

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Then you can't go back to your own room

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Take off your clothes

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Xu Banyan

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Who told you to touch my kitchen things?

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You won't even let me do the cleaning now

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I'm so angry

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Wait for me

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm so angry

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm so angry

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm so angry

40
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm so angry

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm so angry

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm so angry

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm so angry

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm so angry

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm so angry

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm so angry

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I'm so angry

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I just saw your success

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Don't believe

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I still can't believe you

51
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Ding Daxing, I find that you should learn law.

52
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You should learn the law.

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,960
The

54
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Xu Ban Yan, do you know it's already midnight?

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You have seriously affected my work and my life.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Can you hear it upstairs?

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Of course.

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Please, I'm doing business, listening to songs and drawing, not playing games.

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If you really think it's so noisy, you can make a soundproofing for this house.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I thank you. I suggest you not to see another one.

61
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The light and shadow are mixed up, the structure is still poor.

62
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What is this drawing?

63
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Have you learned visual art?

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No, I just think it can reduce your habit of changing.

65
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Thank you for your suggestion, but I don't need your suggestion.

66
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Long Yan, so familiar.

67
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Weiman magazine.

68
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
You know Weiman? You are also our painter.

69
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What is your ID?

70
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Why should I tell you?

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But you just told me you don't know how to draw. Why did you lie to me?

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I said I didn't learn it, but it doesn't mean I don't know how to draw.

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But I just want to know what your ID is.

74
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What do you care about my ID?

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Why can't I find it?

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
So annoying.

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So noisy every day.

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I can't sleep because of the noise.

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I will be hungry if I can't sleep.

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I will eat when I'm hungry.

81
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm so hungry.

82
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I will eat when I'm hungry.

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Who is this fat?

84
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's him again.

85
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Xu Baiyan, did I tell you not to use a high-power electric power?

86
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I didn't save my drawing just now.

87
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Who are you to blame if you didn't save it?

88
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Before you came, we never had a shop.

89
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Who are you?

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I...

91
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Damn it.

92
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I met you.

93
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We walked side by side.

94
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You looked at me anxiously.

95
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
When the sun rises,

96
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
the wind blows past the mountain.

97
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The clouds open the sky.

98
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
The beach and the sea are full of you.

99
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You said the sea waves are clear.

100
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The silence of life.

101
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I need to use my heart

102
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
to let the sun shine through the sea.

103
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Listen to you.

104
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
The romantic sunny day will meet the sea.

105
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The warm sea breeze is worth your love.

106
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I hide in the clouds and prepare my confession.

107
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Listen to you.

108
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The blue sunny day will meet the sea.

109
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
My sudden feelings are all because of you.

110
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm leaning on the evening breeze.

111
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Waiting for you to pass by the window.

112
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Waiting for you to pass by the window.
