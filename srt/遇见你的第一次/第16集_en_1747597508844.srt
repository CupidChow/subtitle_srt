1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I like the breeze of March and the rain of July

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The gentle sun and you who are free

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Holding your hand and I am being healed by you

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The breeze of youth and the rain of the night

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The distant moon shines on you

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The deep blue eyes, oh I can't forget

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Episode 16

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This Xu Baiyan,

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
after thinking about it for a whole night,

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
he just wants me to clean up.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Why does he like to see people cleaning up?

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I don't know.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Why does he like to see people cleaning up so much?

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
He likes to see people cleaning up so much,

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
he should open a cleaning company.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
He can see his employees cleaning up every day.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So tired.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He hasn't got up yet.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
He doesn't go to work?

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm so sad.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'm so sad.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You're calling me?

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm so sad.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm so sad.

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You're calling me?

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Xu Baiyan.

28
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Xu Baiyan.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What's wrong with you?

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I feel bad.

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You feel bad?

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Xu Baiyan, you have a fever.

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Get up.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'll take you to the hospital.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't want to go to the hospital.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You're sick now.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
How can you not go to the hospital?

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll just have something to eat.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What do you want to eat?

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll order takeout for you.

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I don't want to eat takeout.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I want to drink some porridge.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
For the sake of my due,

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll cook some porridge for you.

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You sleep here.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll call you when it's done.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Is it enough?

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It should be enough.

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It should be enough.

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't have much time left.

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I think I'll have some准 consider it somehow.

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I also care about電子飞了

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Come on, envisage for me.

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,660
The

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,760
Here you are

57
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,600

62
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,040
What to eat

63
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,440
You seem to likeep

64
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,000

65
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,960
Your Brazil

66
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,800
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,800
Be careful. It's hot.

68
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,680
I called Lu Li.

69
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,160
She said that when you had your physical examination,

70
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,880
the doctor told you

71
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,440
not to stay up all night.

72
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,280
How do you feel now?

73
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,600
I can't die.

74
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,600
I have a meeting in the morning.

75
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,920
I'll call Lu Li.

76
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,360
You...

77
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,120
You'd better lie down, Xu Bai Yan.

78
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,840
It's 39 degrees now.

79
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,280
You still want to have a meeting?

80
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,040
Be careful.

81
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,640
It'll turn into your chase party.

82
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,760
Lie down here.

83
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,240
I'll go and check if you've packed up.

84
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,120
But I still can't give up.

85
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,520
Xu Bai Yan.

86
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,600
You're not going to work if you're done?

87
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,880
Lu Li is a pawn.

88
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,600
Lie down here.

89
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,440
Don't move.

90
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,240
Do you hear me?

91
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,280
Sheng Xia

92
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,600
Hello.

93
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
Long time no see.

94
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,680
Is there anyone sitting next to you?

95
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:04,960
No.

96
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,760
Can I sit next to you?

97
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,600
Here.

98
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,480
Last time,

99
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,560
I wanted to buy you a special drink.

100
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,480
But you left because you had something to do.

101
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,720
Are you free today?

102
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,400
Are you tired?

103
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,080
How is that possible?

104
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,040
You've been running in my heart for a whole day.

105
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,760
I'm tired.

106
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,280
It's not hot anymore, right?

107
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,720
What's wrong?

108
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:26,840
I don't know.

109
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,360
I feel itchy.

110
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,840
Itchy?

111
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,960
What else did you put in the porridge?

112
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,280
Seafood porridge.

113
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,920
I called you specifically.

114
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,720
Ding Nan Xiang.

115
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,720
I'm allergic to seafood.

116
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,640
Allergic to seafood?

117
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,000
Then...

118
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,400
What should we do now?

119
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,040
Call the doctor.

120
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,880
How is it, doctor?

121
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,400
The patient's immunity is low and he's allergic to seafood.

122
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
Luckily, we saved him in time.

123
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,680
Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.

124
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,920
He's allergic to seafood?

125
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,120
Is he okay now?

126
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,400
He's fine now.

127
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,960
But if we give him more food,

128
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,640
it'll be hard to tell him next time.

129
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
I know.

130
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,280
I won't do it again.

131
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,920
Okay.

132
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,760
There's nothing else this time.

133
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,200
I'll leave now.

134
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,800
You must take good care of him.

135
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,920
If there's anything uncomfortable,

136
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,240
you must take him to the hospital.

137
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,200
Don't worry.

138
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,880
I'll call you if I need anything.

139
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,640
Okay.

140
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,440
Thank you.

141
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,080
It's okay.

142
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,560
Let me help you.

143
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,200
Well...

144
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,120
What's wrong?

145
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,960
I'm fine.

146
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,240
Well...

147
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,800
The doctor said

148
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,960
you're fine now.

149
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,480
I promise I won't give you food anymore.

150
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,000
Is there anything else I can help you with?

151
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,800
I haven't finished my sketch yet.

152
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,200
Why don't you help me?

153
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,480
You're already like this.

154
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,760
You still want to finish your sketch?

155
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,120
Is there a problem?

156
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,200
No.

157
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,920
Where's the sketch?

158
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,160
Why did you take such a long walk?

159
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,200
Come here.

160
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,520
Do you want to be lazy?

161
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,560
Come here.

162
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,560
That's great.

163
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Just a few more steps.

164
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,100
Kurashiro Okada will assemble the sketch book for you.

165
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,660
Not bad, right?

166
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,020
A little bit more.

167
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,380
What's the password?

168
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,260
201314.

169
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,500
You are missing me, how will you find 6A?

170
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,960
⑥지만對,不讓你多哭

171
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,960
book 2.

172
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,160
I like this one.

173
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,000
Festivals with lady Na-Cheng Almost everything.

174
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,600
What anime?

175
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,820
There are2000 episodes.

176
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,180
Metrowoman development,

177
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,100
The beach and the sea are full of you

178
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,820
Holding hands, you said the sea waves are so clear

179
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,940
The silence of deep breathing needs to be heard with your heart

180
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,700
When the sun shines through the sea

181
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,700
Listen to you, the romantic sky will meet the sea

182
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,500
The warm sea breeze is worth your love

183
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:27,860
I hide in the clouds, preparing my confession

184
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:32,860
Listen to you, the blue sky will meet the sea

185
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,660
Occasionally, the emotions come because of you

186
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:42,140
I'm leaning on the arms of the evening wind

187
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,140
Waiting for you to pass by the window

188
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:57,660
Waiting for you to pass by the window
