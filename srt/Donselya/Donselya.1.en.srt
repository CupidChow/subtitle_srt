1
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:17,945
Over here.

2
00:02:19,498 --> 00:02:21,965
Help me carry the snails, okay?

3
00:02:26,067 --> 00:02:27,067
My back hurts.

4
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:32,777
Come back for me later.
We’ll bring these to the market.

5
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,505
Around 8 AM.

6
00:02:34,876 --> 00:02:38,796
And I’ll pay you later,
once I’ve sold all of this.

7
00:02:39,854 --> 00:02:42,741
Gabo said you haven’t paid
your tab for a week now.

8
00:02:42,766 --> 00:02:46,588
Don’t worry, I’ll pay you.
Tell Gabo I’ll pay him too.

9
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:48,332
Good thing your daughter is beautiful.

10
00:02:48,357 --> 00:02:50,455
Of course she’s pretty,
she took after me.

11
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,093
Rosa, what’s that?

12
00:02:52,296 --> 00:02:53,720
Come back later, alright?

13
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:55,805
Please tell Iris I want to court her.

14
00:02:56,488 --> 00:02:57,865
- What was that?
- It’s nothing.

15
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,510
I told him I’ll pay him later,
once I’ve sold all this.

16
00:03:01,553 --> 00:03:03,304
- Where’s Iris?
- Inside.

17
00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:04,765
- Go ahead!
- Can you carry all that?

18
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:07,908
- Yes, go on. I can.
- Okay.

19
00:03:10,366 --> 00:03:11,681
- Bene?
- Yes?

20
00:03:12,767 --> 00:03:15,016
Is there really no one else
you can borrow from?

21
00:03:16,354 --> 00:03:20,070
I’m running out of money
to buy the snails that we sell.

22
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:21,906
No one.

23
00:03:21,931 --> 00:03:27,143
We haven’t even paid the 21 thousand
we borrowed from Paul.

24
00:03:27,168 --> 00:03:29,986
I haven’t paid back the ones
I borrowed from too.

25
00:03:30,045 --> 00:03:33,627
Bene, I’m having such a hard time.

26
00:03:34,516 --> 00:03:36,222
What do you want me to do?

27
00:03:36,278 --> 00:03:37,940
Do you want me to go
back as a tricycle driver?

28
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:39,728
Can’t you see my situation?

29
00:03:40,832 --> 00:03:43,173
What if we just sell our land?

30
00:03:43,206 --> 00:03:45,829
I’ve already done
all kinds of prayers.

31
00:03:46,302 --> 00:03:47,302
Looking up.

32
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,685
Looking down.

33
00:03:48,986 --> 00:03:50,854
Kneeling. Lying down.

34
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,879
Facing down!

35
00:03:52,826 --> 00:03:57,298
Try praying while your legs are open,
maybe then you’ll be heard.

36
00:03:58,795 --> 00:03:59,795
Bene!

37
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:11,312
What’s that?

38
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,001
Stay here.

39
00:04:25,913 --> 00:04:27,219
Damn it!

40
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:36,714
Damn!

41
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:43,960
- Stay here.
- Bene!

42
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:45,785
- What’s that?
- Just stay here, don’t go out.

43
00:05:10,483 --> 00:05:11,793
Thank God.

44
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:13,929
Heaven sent.

45
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:29,767
Hey!

46
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:31,859
What’s the problem?

47
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:35,368
I thought it was a gun shot.

48
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,510
Flat tire.

49
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:38,864
Too bad!

50
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,919
That’s some bad luck.

51
00:05:40,944 --> 00:05:44,961
Of all the places, you wound up
with a flat tire at our place.

52
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:49,495
Here... How about you remove your tire?

53
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,172
I’ll help you fix that.
I have a vulcanizing shop.

54
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,211
- Okay.
- I’ll wait for you.

55
00:05:57,397 --> 00:05:59,855
- Bring your tire and follow me.
- Okay.

56
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,882
- Okay.
- I’ll wait here.

57
00:06:07,591 --> 00:06:08,591
Over here.

58
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,379
He got a flat tire.

59
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:13,961
I’ll fix it.

60
00:06:19,734 --> 00:06:20,963
Come on, over here.

61
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:29,305
- He’s so handsome.
- Ma!

62
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,891
- I’ll tell papa.
- Hey!

63
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,797
Go wash up, it’s already 7 AM.

64
00:06:34,242 --> 00:06:36,165
Give me that.

65
00:06:36,302 --> 00:06:38,094
But, he really is good-looking.

66
00:06:40,394 --> 00:06:42,773
Go ahead, wash up. Hurry!

67
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:51,297
A big nail caused this!

68
00:06:52,407 --> 00:06:56,061
- I just bought that last week.
- Yeah, it does look new.

69
00:06:56,645 --> 00:06:58,063
Your tire got devirginized!

70
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:01,858
Look, this is big!

71
00:07:05,453 --> 00:07:06,537
Can you do it fast?

72
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:07,746
Yes, this will be quick.

73
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:13,282
You know, back in the day,
I used to have a tricycle.

74
00:07:13,961 --> 00:07:15,766
I was taking passengers

75
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:18,415
when a big truck hit me.

76
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:22,461
That broke my foot.

77
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:25,844
When I talked to the truck company,

78
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:29,977
they paid me 300 thousand but...

79
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:33,875
that’s gone now.
That was long ago, after all.

80
00:07:34,362 --> 00:07:39,899
So, I opened a vulcanizing shop,
but when they fixed our road here

81
00:07:40,488 --> 00:07:42,751
I had fewer customers.

82
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:02,748
- Are you done?
- Yes.

83
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:04,836
Here.

84
00:10:05,292 --> 00:10:06,627
Keep this as a souvenir.

85
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:10,702
Come on, let’s put this back.

86
00:10:11,441 --> 00:10:13,757
- Come on.
- Let’s go.

87
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:16,343
My foot hurts.

88
00:10:36,898 --> 00:10:37,898
Phew!

89
00:10:38,288 --> 00:10:41,773
That’s good to go.
It’s like new.

90
00:10:41,798 --> 00:10:43,550
Don’t let it get punctured again.

91
00:10:45,592 --> 00:10:47,046
- Okay.
- Why?

92
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:48,584
Here.

93
00:10:48,717 --> 00:10:50,330
Thank you, boss.

94
00:10:51,874 --> 00:10:53,799
Take this too.

95
00:10:54,608 --> 00:10:57,322
- Boss, this is too much.
- No.

96
00:10:58,293 --> 00:11:00,734
- It’s fine.
- Thank you. Thank you.

97
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:04,593
- What was your name again?
- Bene.

98
00:11:04,643 --> 00:11:05,643
Okay.

99
00:11:05,672 --> 00:11:08,257
- Alright, Benny. Thank you.
- Thank you.

100
00:11:08,315 --> 00:11:09,654
Take care, okay?

101
00:11:10,276 --> 00:11:11,276
Okay.

102
00:11:23,286 --> 00:11:24,418
Take care.

103
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:30,051
Look!

104
00:11:30,491 --> 00:11:34,636
He gave me three thousand.
He doesn’t know that I put the nail there.

105
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:37,943
Well, look at that! Now I
have money for my snails.

106
00:11:37,968 --> 00:11:41,090
- You’re unbelievable!
- There, two for me, one for you.

107
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:42,785
Okay, fine.

108
00:11:50,897 --> 00:11:52,011
Virgin...

109
00:12:05,787 --> 00:12:06,787
Hey!

110
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:07,917
What?

111
00:12:07,942 --> 00:12:10,465
I have good news for you, Iris.

112
00:12:10,876 --> 00:12:12,043
What’s the good news?

113
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:13,995
I’ve lost my virginity.

114
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,608
Really?

115
00:12:15,995 --> 00:12:17,261
You’re not a virgin anymore?

116
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:19,472
I had sex!

117
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:21,022
Just earlier.

118
00:12:21,136 --> 00:12:22,136
By whom?

119
00:12:22,394 --> 00:12:23,590
Robert.

120
00:12:25,924 --> 00:12:29,472
While my grandma
was still asleep, I sneaked out.

121
00:12:32,314 --> 00:12:34,191
He’s awake until early morning.

122
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:36,535
He sleeps in the morning.

123
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,629
That’s his work hours online.

124
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:42,198
I know that he wants me.

125
00:12:43,043 --> 00:12:44,201
I want him too.

126
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:47,797
I really want to have sex with him.

127
00:12:50,655 --> 00:12:51,707
What’s this?

128
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,805
What? That’s Playtime.

129
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,082
Teach me how to play this.

130
00:13:10,268 --> 00:13:12,312
There! We got free spins.

131
00:13:16,066 --> 00:13:17,066
Times eight!

132
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,786
Oh my god!

133
00:13:28,315 --> 00:13:29,315
There you go!

134
00:13:30,064 --> 00:13:31,817
That’s amazing!

135
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:35,919
That was easy.

136
00:13:36,086 --> 00:13:37,963
Is that the scatter game that trended?

137
00:13:38,129 --> 00:13:40,969
Yeah, you can play
that also on Playtime.ph.

138
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:43,134
Apart from Gcash and Maya.

139
00:15:12,307 --> 00:15:13,642
Shit!

140
00:15:26,237 --> 00:15:27,317
Do you want me to fuck you?

141
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:37,247
Ready?

142
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:47,652
I really thought I would
go crazy! He’s so good!

143
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:49,738
You’re exaggerating!

144
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:51,852
No, it’s true!

145
00:16:52,023 --> 00:16:55,067
I really thought I would go crazy!

146
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:58,037
Did it hurt?

147
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:02,834
Yeah, it did at first.

148
00:17:03,877 --> 00:17:07,172
Because his dick was
so big, like an eggplant.

149
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:09,407
But...

150
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,383
It’s incredible!

151
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:14,554
So satisfying!

152
00:17:16,552 --> 00:17:18,489
He used to just finger me.

153
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,920
But earlier, we had sex.

154
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:27,756
You should try it too!

155
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:28,900
With whom?

156
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,978
With Jimbo!

157
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:37,059
No way!

158
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:39,211
I still have dreams.

159
00:17:39,312 --> 00:17:41,146
Don’t be silly.
You won’t get pregnant!

160
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:42,912
You’re just going to lose your virginity.

161
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,865
I don’t want to! I’m fine!

162
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:49,514
Just choose!

163
00:17:49,747 --> 00:17:51,803
I don’t want to do it yet! I’m okay.

164
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:53,584
Thank you.

165
00:17:54,643 --> 00:17:57,006
- Your quail eggs are here.
- Eat first.

166
00:17:57,732 --> 00:18:01,357
- Wow, those snails look so fresh.
- Take a break, Iris.

167
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:06,230
Iris, when will you let me
taste your snail?

168
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,764
Here! I packed this for you!

169
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:17,867
Eat all my snails until
you’re sick of them.

170
00:18:17,892 --> 00:18:18,892
Why this?

171
00:18:21,663 --> 00:18:23,206
Lose your virginity!

172
00:18:23,581 --> 00:18:25,583
No, way. Not to him.

173
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:27,168
Then to whom?

174
00:18:30,672 --> 00:18:33,716
This morning there was a guy
who stopped by our house.

175
00:18:34,092 --> 00:18:35,092
So what?

176
00:18:35,218 --> 00:18:36,386
He was so handsome.

177
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:41,141
He got a flat tire after
because of a nail on the road.

178
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,643
And then?

179
00:18:43,927 --> 00:18:47,087
But papa was the one who
scattered nails on the road.

180
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:53,323
So, he asked papa to fix his tire.

181
00:18:54,057 --> 00:18:56,072
Do you know how much he gave us?

182
00:18:56,097 --> 00:18:57,347
How much?

183
00:18:57,372 --> 00:18:58,784
Three thousand!

184
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:00,394
Three thousand?

185
00:19:00,704 --> 00:19:03,346
So, I think he’s rich.

186
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:05,393
And he looks kind.

187
00:19:23,224 --> 00:19:24,642
So, Rosa?

188
00:19:24,851 --> 00:19:29,355
I told you. The heavens
answered your prayers.

189
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,607
Three thousand?

190
00:19:30,635 --> 00:19:32,290
That’s nothing!

191
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:34,611
Why? How much
were you asking for?

192
00:19:34,718 --> 00:19:36,704
To get us out of poverty.

193
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,564
I don’t want to sell
snails anymore! Even fish!

194
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:41,549
I don’t want to be a vendor
in the market anymore!

195
00:19:41,939 --> 00:19:42,939
Anybody home?

196
00:19:43,745 --> 00:19:45,430
He’s here. He came back!

197
00:19:45,455 --> 00:19:47,140
- Who?
- Three thousand!

198
00:19:47,165 --> 00:19:48,165
Who?

199
00:19:50,782 --> 00:19:52,133
Three thousand is back.

200
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:58,945
Good evening!

201
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,978
Good evening. Come in!

202
00:20:01,102 --> 00:20:02,780
I don’t want to disturb you.

203
00:20:02,805 --> 00:20:04,642
No, come inside.

204
00:20:05,183 --> 00:20:06,183
Come.

205
00:20:09,354 --> 00:20:10,354
Sit!

206
00:20:10,394 --> 00:20:11,394
Um...

207
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:12,774
Sorry, you’re eating.

208
00:20:12,815 --> 00:20:14,542
No, we’re done eating.

209
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,970
Bring your food into your room.

210
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,872
Finish eating there.

211
00:20:18,905 --> 00:20:20,650
Hurry, we have visitor.

212
00:20:21,217 --> 00:20:22,217
Have a seat.

213
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:25,729
- Sit.
- I brought a little something.

214
00:20:25,754 --> 00:20:30,962
Thank you so much!
You’re really heaven sent!

215
00:20:33,127 --> 00:20:36,296
What brings you here, boss?

216
00:20:36,297 --> 00:20:39,008
Is there a problem
with the tire I fixed?

217
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,300
None!

218
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:41,791
It’s good.

219
00:20:42,948 --> 00:20:44,352
So why are you here?

220
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,654
It might be better
if you finish eating.

221
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:51,542
We’re done.
Tell us what you wanted to say.

222
00:20:54,936 --> 00:20:57,605
I have a proposition for you.

223
00:21:00,571 --> 00:21:01,571
Proposition?

224
00:21:01,864 --> 00:21:02,864
Agreement.

225
00:21:03,491 --> 00:21:04,951
Between the three of us.

226
00:21:06,244 --> 00:21:07,244
Um...

227
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:12,667
About what?
If it’s about a business

228
00:21:13,251 --> 00:21:15,961
we don’t have the
money to invest in that.

229
00:21:15,986 --> 00:21:19,014
As you can see from
how we are living.

230
00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:21,029
It’s not about a business.

231
00:21:24,756 --> 00:21:26,498
Then what is it about?

232
00:21:28,022 --> 00:21:29,309
I’m already 50 years old,

233
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:31,748
and living alone.

234
00:21:32,161 --> 00:21:34,475
My wife died ten years ago.

235
00:21:36,286 --> 00:21:38,631
Right now I’m looking for a wife.

236
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:43,920
But I want a virgin.

237
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,918
- What?
- A virgin.

238
00:21:46,121 --> 00:21:47,121
Virgin?

239
00:21:47,706 --> 00:21:49,162
Wait a minute.

240
00:21:49,544 --> 00:21:51,248
What are you getting at?

241
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,123
Your daughter.

242
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:54,911
You mean... Iris?

243
00:21:55,593 --> 00:21:58,585
I’ll pay you if you agree
to let me marry her.

244
00:21:59,237 --> 00:22:00,237
If...

245
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:01,856
She’s a virgin.

246
00:22:03,694 --> 00:22:05,767
She’s a virgin.
My daughter is a virgin!

247
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:06,832
What are you saying, Rosa!

248
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:08,410
Hold on! Hold on!

249
00:22:08,749 --> 00:22:11,725
You’re going to buy my daughter?
I don’t even know who you are.

250
00:22:14,187 --> 00:22:15,187
I’m Joaquin.

251
00:22:15,897 --> 00:22:16,897
Joaquin Ignacio.

252
00:22:28,618 --> 00:22:29,618
How old is she?

253
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:31,579
How old is Iris?

254
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,926
She’s eighteen.

255
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:35,423
Hold on! Rosa, don’t butt in!

256
00:22:35,448 --> 00:22:36,448
He’s asking.

257
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:39,110
I’ll marry her.

258
00:22:40,144 --> 00:22:41,352
I have a lot of money.

259
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:43,079
I have a lot of property.

260
00:22:43,578 --> 00:22:44,578
I have no children.

261
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:45,980
How much?

262
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:47,532
Rosa!

263
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:48,557
What’s wrong with you?

264
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,142
All you think about is money.

265
00:22:51,721 --> 00:22:52,721
Two million.

266
00:22:53,173 --> 00:22:55,411
Two million?
You’ll give us two million?

267
00:22:55,436 --> 00:22:57,079
Rosa! Shut your mouth!

268
00:22:58,306 --> 00:22:59,306
Three million.

269
00:22:59,945 --> 00:23:00,945
Cash?

270
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:02,289
Wait a minute!

271
00:23:02,832 --> 00:23:04,306
What do you think our daughter is?

272
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,844
A pig? A goat?
Some animal you can just buy?

273
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:08,953
Five million.

274
00:23:09,485 --> 00:23:10,817
- Five million?
- Five million?

275
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:16,081
Cash!

276
00:23:16,666 --> 00:23:17,666
Cash!

277
00:23:22,231 --> 00:23:23,524
The important thing
is she’s a virgin.

278
00:23:23,548 --> 00:23:26,185
She is.
She definitely is a virgin.

279
00:23:26,795 --> 00:23:28,188
Rosa! What’s wrong with you?

280
00:23:28,552 --> 00:23:30,295
That’s enough.
Can you please leave?

281
00:23:36,656 --> 00:23:38,169
Bene, why?

282
00:23:38,194 --> 00:23:39,288
What do you mean “why”?

283
00:23:39,313 --> 00:23:40,560
Don’t you see?

284
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,310
He’s buying your daughter?

285
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:44,464
How do you see
your daughter? A closet?

286
00:23:44,782 --> 00:23:47,998
But he’s talking to us properly.

287
00:23:48,023 --> 00:23:49,240
Honestly!

288
00:23:49,996 --> 00:23:52,959
He’s just asking us.
If we say no, then it’s a no.

289
00:23:54,131 --> 00:23:55,287
How much was it again?

290
00:23:56,114 --> 00:23:57,114
Five million.

291
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,565
My gosh! Really? Five million?

292
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,795
Benicio! Benicio,
he’ll give us five million!

293
00:24:02,195 --> 00:24:04,461
- I don’t want it!
- Can you please sit down?

294
00:24:04,721 --> 00:24:06,693
Sit down.

295
00:24:07,695 --> 00:24:08,982
Sit down.

296
00:24:15,975 --> 00:24:18,654
You don’t need to
decide at this moment.

297
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:21,873
Ask her first if she wants to.

298
00:24:22,315 --> 00:24:23,691
Maybe she doesn’t want to.

299
00:24:24,603 --> 00:24:26,498
Once you’ve reached a decision,

300
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:29,224
visit me at my house in the valley.

301
00:24:29,536 --> 00:24:31,262
It’s the only big house there.

302
00:25:03,564 --> 00:25:05,191
Damn! I say no!

303
00:25:07,271 --> 00:25:11,303
That’s five million, Bene!
We won’t earn that.

304
00:25:11,489 --> 00:25:14,867
You can buy a tricycle!

305
00:25:14,992 --> 00:25:17,161
We can have your foot fixed!

306
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:20,372
And I can buy a stall in the market.

307
00:25:20,373 --> 00:25:21,832
I can start selling meat.

308
00:25:22,291 --> 00:25:24,603
We can get the
kids through school.

309
00:25:25,562 --> 00:25:29,315
I’ve been selling snails
since I was a little girl!

310
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,572
Rosa, I won’t sell my daughter!

311
00:25:35,015 --> 00:25:38,647
- It’s a sin against the Lord.
- It isn't!

312
00:25:38,863 --> 00:25:42,366
He gave this to us so that
we can get out of poverty.

313
00:25:43,646 --> 00:25:44,646
I want to do it!

314
00:25:45,648 --> 00:25:46,648
What did you say?

315
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:49,902
I don’t want to see you
going through so much.

316
00:25:50,403 --> 00:25:54,323
It won’t be long
and I’ll get married anyway.

317
00:25:54,657 --> 00:25:57,952
I don’t want to marry
someone who’s poor like us.

318
00:25:58,452 --> 00:26:00,830
Thank you, Iris!
Thank you.

319
00:26:01,405 --> 00:26:03,602
But wait, are you still a virgin?

320
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:05,166
Yes!

321
00:26:05,293 --> 00:26:07,962
I’m only asking, because
that’s what Joaquin wants!

322
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,773
Over here.

323
00:26:33,195 --> 00:26:34,196
Here.

324
00:26:34,905 --> 00:26:37,033
Thank you.

325
00:26:56,886 --> 00:27:00,097
- This house is nice. It’s so big!
- This place is beautiful.

326
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:04,185
He’s really rich!

327
00:27:05,978 --> 00:27:10,441
- There he is.
- Come in.

328
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:13,731
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

329
00:27:14,026 --> 00:27:15,699
Perfect timing.
The food is ready.

330
00:27:15,988 --> 00:27:17,114
Come on. Let’s go inside.

331
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,836
You’ll live here.

332
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:33,714
Nice place you’ve got here.

333
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:37,238
Thank you.

334
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:39,419
I live here by myself.

335
00:27:39,753 --> 00:27:40,753
I don’t have a helper.

336
00:27:41,532 --> 00:27:42,532
I do everything.

337
00:27:43,941 --> 00:27:45,171
I take care of everything.

338
00:27:48,562 --> 00:27:53,567
About the deal that we discussed...

339
00:27:54,485 --> 00:27:56,112
We accept.

340
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,030
Really?

341
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:03,160
Great. Let’s talk about it inside.

342
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:10,376
Come on, that’s enough.

343
00:28:10,668 --> 00:28:12,668
- We’re going to talk about it.
- I’m still hungry!

344
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,610
- Let’s go inside!
- I’m still eating.

345
00:28:17,216 --> 00:28:18,216
Let’s go.

346
00:28:19,802 --> 00:28:22,179
- Hurry up.
- Fine. Fine.

347
00:28:25,349 --> 00:28:26,851
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

348
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:28,059
Come in.

349
00:28:29,353 --> 00:28:30,604
I’m still eating.

350
00:28:31,939 --> 00:28:34,220
Please have a seat.
I just need to get something upstairs.

351
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,650
Okay.

352
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,860
Sorry.

353
00:30:06,116 --> 00:30:07,116
Read this.

354
00:30:14,124 --> 00:30:18,211
That contract states that you agree
to let me marry your daughter, Iris,

355
00:30:18,212 --> 00:30:20,256
in exchange for five million pesos.

356
00:30:20,756 --> 00:30:23,967
You’ll get half
after signing the contract

357
00:30:23,968 --> 00:30:26,095
and the other half after our wedding.

358
00:30:27,435 --> 00:30:28,952
And you guarantee

359
00:30:29,882 --> 00:30:30,975
that she’s a virgin.

360
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:32,886
A virgin.

361
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:34,905
What about the wedding?

362
00:30:36,295 --> 00:30:38,226
Because, that’s important.

363
00:30:41,499 --> 00:30:42,971
The wedding will be simple.

364
00:30:43,481 --> 00:30:44,481
Just a few of us.

365
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:46,991
A judge will officiate the wedding.

366
00:30:47,491 --> 00:30:49,618
A friend of mine,
Judge Hipolito.

367
00:30:50,697 --> 00:30:52,350
It will be held here, at home.

368
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,186
Afterwards, a small celebration.

369
00:30:55,595 --> 00:30:57,421
The important thing for me is

370
00:30:57,913 --> 00:30:59,311
that the wedding is legal.

371
00:31:01,134 --> 00:31:02,404
She will live here.

372
00:31:06,528 --> 00:31:08,002
Does that mean

373
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:13,651
you’ll give us the 2.5 million
once we’ve signed this contract?

374
00:31:19,053 --> 00:31:22,024
You’ll get that once
you’ve signed that contract.

375
00:31:23,209 --> 00:31:26,045
Sign it. Thank God!

376
00:31:27,007 --> 00:31:28,340
Sign every page.

377
00:31:28,365 --> 00:31:30,564
- Okay.
- I’ll sign now.

378
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:31,659
I don’t want to!

379
00:31:31,915 --> 00:31:32,972
What?

380
00:31:32,997 --> 00:31:34,588
Why? What do you mean?

381
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,916
I don’t want just five million.

382
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,089
I want...

383
00:31:45,814 --> 00:31:47,160
Ten million!

384
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
Ten million!

385
00:32:21,827 --> 00:32:23,205
Ten million!

386
00:32:24,393 --> 00:32:25,814
Let’s sign it.

387
00:32:26,749 --> 00:32:28,760
- I’ll just get something.
- Okay.

388
00:32:29,749 --> 00:32:32,197
Ten million!

389
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:34,838
- Sign it!
- Okay.

390
00:32:35,365 --> 00:32:37,049
Nice thinking.

391
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,241
Wait, this is just half.

392
00:33:32,483 --> 00:33:34,199
How did you wife die?

393
00:33:38,746 --> 00:33:39,746
Suicide...

394
00:33:40,972 --> 00:33:42,201
She drank poison.

395
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:47,042
Depression.

396
00:33:47,701 --> 00:33:48,949
My wife was a doctor.

397
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:50,957
I’m a doctor, too.

398
00:33:50,982 --> 00:33:54,027
Ever since she died, I lost focus.

399
00:33:54,931 --> 00:33:56,182
My practice was ruined.

400
00:33:57,306 --> 00:33:59,933
So, I lost my license.

401
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:01,386
I went into business after.

402
00:34:21,955 --> 00:34:24,442
Hey, thank you!

403
00:35:16,635 --> 00:35:17,678
Anyone home?

404
00:35:18,234 --> 00:35:19,496
Who is it?

405
00:35:19,888 --> 00:35:20,994
Sienna.

406
00:35:21,557 --> 00:35:23,970
Oh! The door is open. Come in.

407
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,775
- Is Iris here?
- Ah...

408
00:35:27,062 --> 00:35:29,251
She left. She said
she was going to you.

409
00:35:30,669 --> 00:35:31,669
Uh...

410
00:35:32,781 --> 00:35:34,845
We must’ve missed each other.

411
00:35:35,294 --> 00:35:36,880
She won’t be selling snails anymore.

412
00:35:36,905 --> 00:35:39,080
We’re getting our own stall in the market.

413
00:35:39,844 --> 00:35:41,423
I’m going to sell meat.

414
00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:42,691
Okay.

415
00:35:42,716 --> 00:35:45,040
Can you please
tell her I stopped by?

416
00:35:45,065 --> 00:35:46,982
- Sure.
- Thank you.

417
00:35:57,176 --> 00:35:59,695
What are we going
to do here, Jimbo?

418
00:36:00,008 --> 00:36:02,328
Trust me. Just relax!

419
00:36:04,768 --> 00:36:07,124
Just like the old times.

420
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:09,229
I’ve missed you.

421
00:36:09,641 --> 00:36:10,641
Come here.

422
00:39:30,508 --> 00:39:31,835
Stop! I don’t want to!

423
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:33,215
Why?

424
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:35,710
Because!

425
00:39:36,285 --> 00:39:37,285
Why?

426
00:39:38,337 --> 00:39:39,699
I’m getting married.

427
00:39:40,315 --> 00:39:41,315
What?

428
00:39:41,762 --> 00:39:43,775
We can’t see each other anymore.

429
00:39:44,778 --> 00:39:46,408
I’m going to live with him.

430
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:52,478
- No!
- Ouch!

431
00:39:52,978 --> 00:39:54,681
- I’ll get your virginity.
- That hurts!

432
00:39:55,618 --> 00:39:57,685
What are you doing?
I don’t want to!

433
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,587
- Come here.
- I don’t want to.

434
00:40:00,303 --> 00:40:01,583
- You’re mine.
- I don’t want to.

435
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:10,165
I don’t want to.

436
00:40:25,527 --> 00:40:27,362
I don’t want to.

437
00:40:38,457 --> 00:40:39,958
I don’t want to.

438
00:42:29,943 --> 00:42:32,445
You know, our daughter is really smart!

439
00:42:33,071 --> 00:42:37,325
I can’t believe she got that
guy to give us ten million.

440
00:42:38,047 --> 00:42:40,501
She got that from me, not you.

441
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:44,087
Well, he agreed.

442
00:42:46,459 --> 00:42:47,836
He’s got a lot of money anyway.

443
00:42:48,787 --> 00:42:50,160
And it’s not a loss for him.

444
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:53,627
He’s lucky to get Iris.

445
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:55,973
Our daughter is a virgin.

446
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:57,160
Like I said,

447
00:42:57,319 --> 00:43:00,465
she’s more of a virgin
than virgin coconut oils.

448
00:43:01,099 --> 00:43:02,266
Nonsense.

449
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:07,188
I was thinking, why don’t we
get this house fixed up?

450
00:43:07,415 --> 00:43:11,418
No, you need to get your foot fixed first.

451
00:43:11,443 --> 00:43:13,068
And by the way, stop counting the money.

452
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:16,347
You started this morning and
you’re still counting that now.

453
00:43:16,372 --> 00:43:19,341
I lost count again.
Don’t confuse me!

454
00:43:19,896 --> 00:43:21,935
Look! Now I have to start over.

455
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:24,126
Let me count

456
00:43:25,425 --> 00:43:28,396
- I actually talked to Paul.
- Then?

457
00:43:28,421 --> 00:43:31,802
He said he knew someone in Pasig

458
00:43:32,028 --> 00:43:34,357
who makes prosthetic feet.

459
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:39,255
If it’s just a prosthetic foot,
that’s 20 thousand.

460
00:43:39,941 --> 00:43:43,090
If I’ll have my feet amputated,
that's 40 thousand.

461
00:43:43,377 --> 00:43:46,114
Then let’s do it. I’ll go with you.

462
00:43:47,048 --> 00:43:49,396
Let’s have your prosthetic foot made.

463
00:43:49,692 --> 00:43:51,427
We can pay for it there and then.

464
00:43:51,532 --> 00:43:54,177
Then let’s buy a tricycle.

465
00:43:54,311 --> 00:43:56,755
We can think about the house later.

466
00:43:56,872 --> 00:43:58,155
Okay, fine.

467
00:43:58,327 --> 00:44:01,568
Bene, let’s buy a refrigerator

468
00:44:01,593 --> 00:44:05,302
- and electric fans as well.
- Sure, why not?

469
00:44:06,505 --> 00:44:08,145
- Iris?
- Oh!

470
00:44:13,021 --> 00:44:14,297
God bless you.

471
00:44:14,346 --> 00:44:16,919
Hold on, where were you?

472
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,568
I went to Sienna’s house.

473
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:23,130
She was here earlier,
looking for you.

474
00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:26,349
I’ll just rest.

475
00:44:42,064 --> 00:44:44,193
Did you go out with Jimbo?

476
00:44:44,887 --> 00:44:46,169
I didn’t, ma.

477
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:49,708
Don’t you ever meet up
with Jimbo, Iris! Got it?

478
00:44:49,798 --> 00:44:52,724
I am not going out with Jimbo.

479
00:44:53,552 --> 00:44:55,213
You’re getting married.

480
00:44:56,054 --> 00:44:59,099
We told Joaquin
that you’re a virgin!

481
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,888
He gave us five million already.

482
00:45:01,913 --> 00:45:03,997
He can still take that back.

483
00:45:04,315 --> 00:45:06,153
Do you understand
what I’m saying?

484
00:45:07,642 --> 00:45:09,068
From now on,

485
00:45:09,885 --> 00:45:11,528
don’t go out.

486
00:45:11,624 --> 00:45:16,138
Stay here at home,
until your wedding.

487
00:45:45,999 --> 00:45:47,169
I’m sorry, Ma.

488
00:45:50,727 --> 00:45:51,853
Sorry.

489
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:00,779
I’m sorry, Ma.

490
00:46:59,854 --> 00:47:01,139
From divine law,

491
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:02,760
marriage is a vow.

492
00:47:03,439 --> 00:47:05,128
From a legal standpoint,

493
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,354
marriage is a legal contract

494
00:47:07,379 --> 00:47:08,956
of a permanent union

495
00:47:08,981 --> 00:47:10,636
between a man and a woman.

496
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,417
Entered in concordance with the law.

497
00:47:13,505 --> 00:47:16,979
for the establishment of
conjugal and family life.

498
00:47:19,174 --> 00:47:22,401
May we have one heart and one soul.

499
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:25,282
For better or for worse,

500
00:47:26,015 --> 00:47:28,636
for richer or for poorer,

501
00:47:29,215 --> 00:47:31,386
in joy and in sorrow,

502
00:47:32,510 --> 00:47:34,596
in sickness and in health.

503
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:37,471
Until death do us part.

504
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,724
Forever and always,

505
00:47:52,891 --> 00:47:55,393
I promise to love you and honor you.

506
00:47:55,810 --> 00:47:58,563
Iris, wear this ring

507
00:47:59,564 --> 00:48:03,318
as a sign of my love, loyalty, and respect.

508
00:48:04,402 --> 00:48:06,070
For the rest of my life.

509
00:48:07,822 --> 00:48:09,991
Joaquin, take this ring

510
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:14,037
as a sign of my love, loyalty, and respect.

511
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:15,955
For the rest of my life.

512
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:21,961
I now pronounce you,
husband and wife.

513
00:48:22,629 --> 00:48:24,088
The ceremony has now ended.

514
00:48:24,881 --> 00:48:27,258
Joaquin, you may
now kiss the bride.

515
00:48:46,027 --> 00:48:47,946
You’re such a talented cook!

516
00:48:48,529 --> 00:48:49,529
Thank you.

517
00:48:49,554 --> 00:48:52,402
Don’t expect anything
from my daughter.

518
00:48:52,427 --> 00:48:55,409
- She doesn’t know how to cook.
- Don’t say that!

519
00:48:55,434 --> 00:48:58,667
Well then, I’ll go ahead.
I still need to go back to Manila.

520
00:48:59,097 --> 00:49:01,245
Congratulations to you both.

521
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:02,270
Thank you.

522
00:49:03,128 --> 00:49:05,270
- Thank you.
- Thank you judge, take care.

523
00:49:06,277 --> 00:49:07,277
Thank you.

524
00:49:07,682 --> 00:49:08,886
Take care.

525
00:49:12,595 --> 00:49:15,098
- Take care. Thank you.
- Okay.

526
00:49:24,812 --> 00:49:27,397
Joaquin, take care
of our daughter.

527
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:28,839
We love her so much.

528
00:49:28,864 --> 00:49:32,033
Of course he’ll take care
of our daughter.

529
00:49:32,073 --> 00:49:33,448
She’s his wife now.

530
00:49:33,449 --> 00:49:34,939
I’m just saying.

531
00:49:34,964 --> 00:49:37,697
She’ll be separated
from us for the first time.

532
00:49:39,041 --> 00:49:41,307
Excuse me. I’m going to
get something upstairs.

533
00:49:41,332 --> 00:49:42,332
Okay.

534
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,158
Is that one good?

535
00:49:46,407 --> 00:49:47,407
You want?

536
00:49:47,697 --> 00:49:50,088
Are you going to live here?

537
00:49:51,065 --> 00:49:52,065
Yes.

538
00:49:52,119 --> 00:49:54,853
- Can I also live here?
- No way!

539
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:56,263
- Can I also live here?
- No way!

540
00:49:57,366 --> 00:49:59,088
You can’t leave us too.

541
00:49:59,874 --> 00:50:00,874
Just eat.

542
00:50:11,738 --> 00:50:15,366
Here is my remaining balance, five million.

543
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,091
Hey!

544
00:50:17,613 --> 00:50:19,037
Another five million!

545
00:50:21,011 --> 00:50:22,707
Do you want to count it?

546
00:50:22,862 --> 00:50:24,726
- No, it’s fine.
- No need.

547
00:50:24,751 --> 00:50:26,711
We trust you.
We’ll do it at home.

548
00:50:27,362 --> 00:50:28,362
Smells good.

549
00:50:31,025 --> 00:50:33,151
Stop that. It’s embarrassing
to our son-in-law.

550
00:50:33,176 --> 00:50:35,696
There’s nothing to be ashamed of.
Besides, he’s already our son.

551
00:50:35,721 --> 00:50:37,011
Am I right, Joaquin?

552
00:50:38,815 --> 00:50:40,768
I’m starting to miss you already.

553
00:50:41,566 --> 00:50:44,187
She’s our baby, alright?
Take care of her.

554
00:50:45,002 --> 00:50:47,324
Ma, I’m not a baby anymore.

555
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:50,480
Be sure to remember
everything I taught you.

556
00:50:50,707 --> 00:50:54,172
All the things I do to
your father, do those too.

557
00:50:54,197 --> 00:50:56,433
Hey, what are you saying now?

558
00:50:56,458 --> 00:50:58,371
- What’s wrong?
- We should get going.

559
00:50:58,457 --> 00:51:01,054
We’ll go ahead. I don’t
know what she’ll say next.

560
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:03,254
- Let’s go home.
- Not yet!

561
00:51:03,279 --> 00:51:04,279
I’ll take you home.

562
00:51:04,304 --> 00:51:05,699
No. There’s no need.

563
00:51:05,724 --> 00:51:07,710
- There’s no need.
- We can manage.

564
00:51:07,863 --> 00:51:09,796
Okay, then.
I’ll just get a bag.

565
00:51:11,351 --> 00:51:14,312
- I wanted to stay longer.
- You keep on talking nonsense!

566
00:51:14,636 --> 00:51:15,716
Remember what I taught you.

567
00:51:16,677 --> 00:51:18,262
- What?
- Nothing!

568
00:51:20,674 --> 00:51:24,871
Let’s put the money here.
We don’t want to get mugged.

569
00:51:28,147 --> 00:51:31,776
- Come on. Carry that.
- Let’s go.

570
00:51:33,611 --> 00:51:35,278
- We’ll go ahead.
- Take care of our daughter.

571
00:51:35,279 --> 00:51:36,948
- Take care.
- Okay.

572
00:51:37,164 --> 00:51:39,133
- Thank you, Joaquin.
- Take care.

573
00:51:39,158 --> 00:51:41,844
- Take care of our daughter.
- Will do.

574
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:50,977
- We can manage.
- Take care, okay?

575
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:53,750
We’re leaving.
Goodbye, Iris!

576
00:52:19,448 --> 00:52:21,648
I’ve been looking for someone
to be with me for so long.

577
00:52:24,011 --> 00:52:26,041
I’m glad my tire got flat
near your house.

578
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:33,325
This will be the start of
a new chapter of my life.

579
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:38,131
Let’s have lots of kids.

580
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:39,738
Okay?

581
00:52:40,012 --> 00:52:42,338
- To make our lives happy?
- Yes, to make us happier!

582
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,747
A dozen!

583
00:54:37,018 --> 00:54:38,417
I don’t want to do it here.

584
00:54:38,948 --> 00:54:40,388
What? Why?

585
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,634
I feel like someone is watching us.

586
00:56:18,194 --> 00:56:19,897
I want to tell you something.

587
00:56:20,022 --> 00:56:21,022
I know.

588
00:56:22,358 --> 00:56:23,634
Are you scared?

589
00:56:24,850 --> 00:56:26,086
Don’t worry.

590
00:56:26,593 --> 00:56:27,788
I’ll be gentle.

591
00:56:28,138 --> 00:56:29,138
Okay?

592
00:58:58,438 --> 00:58:59,774
You’re not a virgin!

593
01:00:26,053 --> 01:00:27,680
Shit!

594
01:00:31,815 --> 01:00:33,359
You fooled me!

595
01:00:34,318 --> 01:00:36,695
You fooled me!
I gave you everything.

596
01:00:39,948 --> 01:00:41,492
You fooled me.

597
01:05:24,188 --> 01:05:25,231
Get ready.

598
01:05:26,416 --> 01:05:27,416
The food is ready.

599
01:06:07,051 --> 01:06:08,051
Eat.

600
01:06:09,685 --> 01:06:11,388
I want to go back home.

601
01:06:12,248 --> 01:06:13,437
I’ll go home.

602
01:06:14,188 --> 01:06:15,232
You can’t go back.

603
01:06:15,896 --> 01:06:17,076
You’ll live here.

604
01:06:18,169 --> 01:06:19,474
We have a deal.

605
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,519
That’s what I paid for.

606
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:56,748
- We’re getting off.
- Give us a minute.

607
01:06:57,325 --> 01:06:58,325
Okay.

608
01:06:58,952 --> 01:07:00,245
Slowly, it hurts.

609
01:07:05,724 --> 01:07:06,724
There you go.

610
01:07:07,084 --> 01:07:08,294
Thank you.

611
01:07:08,974 --> 01:07:10,020
Anna!

612
01:07:10,045 --> 01:07:11,045
Come here!

613
01:07:11,263 --> 01:07:12,311
Hold this.

614
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:14,482
We bought electric fans!

615
01:07:17,832 --> 01:07:20,263
We brought lots of groceries too.

616
01:07:20,795 --> 01:07:23,154
- Give me that. I’ll carry it.
- I’ll carry this.

617
01:07:23,215 --> 01:07:24,631
- Where to put these?
- Inside.

618
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:27,990
I’ll carry this.

619
01:07:28,565 --> 01:07:29,565
Thank you.

620
01:07:30,622 --> 01:07:32,245
We got electric fans now.

621
01:07:32,270 --> 01:07:34,563
We can finally sleep well.

622
01:07:34,588 --> 01:07:35,654
That’s right.

623
01:07:36,007 --> 01:07:37,966
We can finally sleep tight.

624
01:07:37,991 --> 01:07:38,991
Yes!

625
01:07:39,578 --> 01:07:40,578
That’s right!

626
01:07:40,603 --> 01:07:42,787
We brought lots of groceries too.

627
01:07:42,812 --> 01:07:43,812
Look!

628
01:07:43,873 --> 01:07:46,832
- We can finally cook good food.
- Yes!

629
01:07:46,857 --> 01:07:49,248
- Hey! Wait for me.
- Oh, sorry.

630
01:07:49,729 --> 01:07:51,560
- Sorry!
- Slow down.

631
01:07:52,922 --> 01:07:53,922
Anna!

632
01:07:54,064 --> 01:07:55,375
Where’s your sister?

633
01:07:55,508 --> 01:07:57,076
Why isn’t she selling snails anymore?

634
01:07:57,833 --> 01:07:59,583
She got married.

635
01:07:59,869 --> 01:08:00,869
What?

636
01:08:01,582 --> 01:08:02,904
She got married?

637
01:08:03,409 --> 01:08:05,826
She’s living with her husband now.

638
01:08:07,849 --> 01:08:09,217
Who’s her husband?

639
01:08:09,473 --> 01:08:10,687
Joaquin.

640
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:13,646
He’s rich, with a big house.

641
01:08:14,356 --> 01:08:16,250
He bought my sister.

642
01:08:16,368 --> 01:08:17,707
He bought your sister?

643
01:08:17,841 --> 01:08:18,865
Yes!

644
01:08:18,890 --> 01:08:21,732
But they’re married.

645
01:08:21,896 --> 01:08:24,834
What was his name again?

646
01:08:24,884 --> 01:08:27,949
Joaquin. Joaquin Ignacio.

647
01:08:28,865 --> 01:08:31,037
Joaquin Ignacio...

648
01:12:12,822 --> 01:12:14,017
Deeper!

649
01:13:46,734 --> 01:13:49,712
- Your papa will get a prosthetic foot.
- That’s right!

650
01:13:49,737 --> 01:13:53,234
- Papa will really get a new foot!
- Yes!

651
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:55,574
Ma...

652
01:13:55,868 --> 01:13:58,273
Sienna came over earlier.

653
01:13:58,306 --> 01:13:59,992
She was looking for Iris.

654
01:14:00,017 --> 01:14:01,017
Did she say why?

655
01:14:01,100 --> 01:14:04,523
I told her she got married,

656
01:14:04,548 --> 01:14:06,554
and she’s living
with her husband now.

657
01:14:07,964 --> 01:14:08,964
Bene...

658
01:14:09,209 --> 01:14:12,164
Bene, let’s go visit Iris tomorrow.

659
01:14:12,189 --> 01:14:14,108
Let’s ask Paul to take us.

660
01:14:14,304 --> 01:14:18,732
Rosa, let your daughter be.

661
01:14:19,326 --> 01:14:21,911
Remember, she’s not
under our care anymore.

662
01:14:21,936 --> 01:14:23,520
She has her own family now.

663
01:14:23,545 --> 01:14:26,709
She has a husband.
She’ll probably have a child soon, too.

664
01:14:27,609 --> 01:14:31,154
The only thing is
she got married early.

665
01:14:32,653 --> 01:14:36,482
Don’t worry about her.
Let’s eat. Come on.

666
01:15:51,663 --> 01:15:52,838
Where are you going?

667
01:16:04,228 --> 01:16:06,401
Let me out of here!

668
01:16:34,511 --> 01:16:36,708
Let me out of here!

669
01:16:58,556 --> 01:16:59,556
Sienna!

670
01:16:59,744 --> 01:17:01,278
Oh, Jimbo!

671
01:17:02,099 --> 01:17:03,886
Why isn't your friend
showing up anymore?

672
01:17:03,934 --> 01:17:05,148
She got married.

673
01:17:05,419 --> 01:17:06,705
Didn’t she tell you?

674
01:17:06,865 --> 01:17:07,865
What?

675
01:17:10,063 --> 01:17:11,272
You’re kidding me.

676
01:17:11,504 --> 01:17:13,153
Why would I do that?

677
01:17:14,576 --> 01:17:16,110
Fine, who did she marry?

678
01:17:16,326 --> 01:17:17,779
I don’t know him.

679
01:17:19,357 --> 01:17:21,616
But her sister told me.

680
01:17:21,763 --> 01:17:24,013
I was surprised as well.
She said he’s a rich guy.

681
01:17:24,038 --> 01:17:25,412
He lives in the valley.

682
01:17:26,771 --> 01:17:27,794
Okay.

683
01:17:27,819 --> 01:17:28,819
Thank you.

684
01:17:34,539 --> 01:17:38,794
My friend Iris got married.

685
01:17:39,637 --> 01:17:41,458
To a rich guy.

686
01:17:42,193 --> 01:17:46,568
He’s got a big house in the valley.

687
01:17:47,125 --> 01:17:48,125
Anyway...

688
01:17:48,637 --> 01:17:51,410
Joaquin. Joaquin Santiago?

689
01:17:51,989 --> 01:17:52,989
No.

690
01:17:53,984 --> 01:17:55,326
Joaquin Ignacio?

691
01:17:56,105 --> 01:17:57,419
I’m sure it’s Joaquin.

692
01:17:57,646 --> 01:17:59,177
She’s so lucky.

693
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:03,568
You? Are you going to marry me?

694
01:18:03,593 --> 01:18:05,998
Didn’t you tell me
you’ll marry me?

695
01:18:07,347 --> 01:18:08,347
Come here!

696
01:19:34,217 --> 01:19:36,167
Your house will be
as big as this one day.

697
01:19:36,401 --> 01:19:37,401
I hope so.

698
01:19:38,514 --> 01:19:42,465
Ma, does Iris know
we’re visiting her?

699
01:19:44,763 --> 01:19:46,912
We’re here to surprise her.

700
01:20:24,811 --> 01:20:26,007
Your mother is here.

701
01:20:27,447 --> 01:20:28,447
Mama?

702
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:30,480
Get dressed.

703
01:21:21,066 --> 01:21:22,140
Joaquin?

704
01:21:22,799 --> 01:21:23,799
Iris?

705
01:21:25,162 --> 01:21:27,361
- Maybe they’re not here.
- Joaquin?

706
01:21:28,349 --> 01:21:29,349
Iris?

707
01:21:38,154 --> 01:21:39,182
Come in.

708
01:21:39,207 --> 01:21:40,791
Good morning, Joaquin.

709
01:21:40,816 --> 01:21:41,816
Good morning.

710
01:21:41,926 --> 01:21:42,926
Come here.

711
01:21:43,983 --> 01:21:45,600
Where’s Iris?

712
01:21:46,130 --> 01:21:47,130
Uh...

713
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:49,170
I’ll call her.

714
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:50,927
You dropped by.

715
01:21:50,952 --> 01:21:52,619
We’re on our way to Manila.

716
01:21:52,644 --> 01:21:55,355
We just thought to
drop by to see Iris.

717
01:21:55,909 --> 01:21:56,933
I see.

718
01:21:56,958 --> 01:21:58,627
I’ll go get her.

719
01:21:58,943 --> 01:21:59,943
Okay.

720
01:22:20,279 --> 01:22:22,291
- Why is he taking so long?
- I know.

721
01:22:24,585 --> 01:22:27,255
What’s wrong with them?

722
01:22:27,689 --> 01:22:28,689
Here he comes.

723
01:22:31,128 --> 01:22:32,128
There he is.

724
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:35,625
I’m sorry...

725
01:22:35,992 --> 01:22:39,369
Iris is still asleep.

726
01:22:39,394 --> 01:22:40,394
She’s still asleep?

727
01:22:40,419 --> 01:22:43,963
She stayed up all night
playing on the computer.

728
01:22:43,988 --> 01:22:45,197
That kid.

729
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:47,762
- Do you want to see her?
- Yes, if we can.

730
01:22:48,966 --> 01:22:50,590
- Come upstairs.
- Let’s go.

731
01:22:59,023 --> 01:23:00,023
Iris...

732
01:23:01,108 --> 01:23:02,568
Why are you still sleeping?

733
01:23:02,593 --> 01:23:03,593
Iris...

734
01:23:03,767 --> 01:23:06,560
- Iris, wake up.
- Rosa! Rosa!

735
01:23:06,585 --> 01:23:09,839
Let her sleep. She’s tired.

736
01:23:15,362 --> 01:23:16,446
Let’s go! Let’s go!

737
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:21,480
Rosa!

738
01:23:46,307 --> 01:23:47,307
Iris!

739
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:49,624
Iris!

740
01:23:50,780 --> 01:23:51,780
Iris!

741
01:23:52,485 --> 01:23:53,485
Iris!

742
01:23:55,464 --> 01:23:56,464
Jimbo!

743
01:23:59,488 --> 01:24:01,590
Help me!

744
01:24:01,723 --> 01:24:03,684
Open the door.

745
01:24:04,322 --> 01:24:06,199
He’s locked me inside.

746
01:24:06,257 --> 01:24:07,778
I couldn’t get in
from the front.

747
01:24:07,826 --> 01:24:10,121
He’s sleeping there.

748
01:24:10,762 --> 01:24:13,035
- Help me!
- Hold on.

749
01:24:15,762 --> 01:24:17,030
Help!

750
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:21,753
I can’t get in through here too.
Where else can I try?

751
01:24:21,778 --> 01:24:24,293
There’s another door at the back.

752
01:24:24,809 --> 01:24:26,076
Try opening that.

753
01:24:27,121 --> 01:24:29,707
Okay, wait for me there.
I’ll go around.

754
01:24:29,957 --> 01:24:31,329
I’ll be back. Wait for me.

755
01:24:31,448 --> 01:24:32,520
Wait for me.

756
01:24:54,566 --> 01:24:55,566
Iris?

757
01:24:55,611 --> 01:24:56,611
Iris?

758
01:24:58,871 --> 01:24:59,871
Iris?

759
01:25:05,579 --> 01:25:06,579
I’m here, Iris.

760
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:10,008
- Iris!
- Jimbo!

761
01:25:10,589 --> 01:25:11,589
Iris!

762
01:25:13,277 --> 01:25:14,470
Let’s go!

763
01:25:14,495 --> 01:25:16,549
He might wake up.

764
01:25:16,684 --> 01:25:17,684
Not yet.

765
01:25:18,173 --> 01:25:19,866
I missed doing it with you!

766
01:25:20,704 --> 01:25:22,788
What are you talking about?

767
01:25:22,813 --> 01:25:24,230
Let’s go!

768
01:25:24,255 --> 01:25:25,353
I’ll make it quick.

769
01:28:07,070 --> 01:28:08,511
You tricked me!

770
01:28:08,933 --> 01:28:10,463
You tricked me!

771
01:28:14,652 --> 01:28:16,387
Jimbo!

772
01:28:17,863 --> 01:28:19,754
- Iris! Run!
- No!

773
01:28:46,292 --> 01:28:47,392
Damn you!

774
01:30:37,861 --> 01:30:39,192
Help!

775
01:30:39,217 --> 01:30:40,452
Help me!

776
01:30:41,418 --> 01:30:42,419
Come here! Let’s go!

777
01:30:42,444 --> 01:30:44,613
Please take me to San Gabriel!

778
01:30:44,638 --> 01:30:45,638
Okay.

779
01:31:44,525 --> 01:31:45,525
Oh my god!

780
01:31:45,550 --> 01:31:46,550
Iris!

781
01:31:47,670 --> 01:31:50,641
Iris! What happened to you?
Why do you look like that?

782
01:31:50,666 --> 01:31:52,735
Come here. Come here.

783
01:31:52,760 --> 01:31:55,138
- Sit down!
- Calm down.

784
01:31:56,599 --> 01:31:57,866
What happened?

785
01:31:58,379 --> 01:32:01,427
- He killed Jimbo!
- Who?

786
01:32:01,888 --> 01:32:05,146
He shot Jimbo!

787
01:32:05,674 --> 01:32:07,826
Who shot him?

788
01:32:18,655 --> 01:32:22,199
- He locks me up.
- What?

789
01:32:22,224 --> 01:32:25,910
He won’t let me go.

790
01:32:25,935 --> 01:32:26,935
Why?

791
01:32:27,688 --> 01:32:28,688
Iris!

792
01:32:29,418 --> 01:32:30,418
Iris!

793
01:32:31,581 --> 01:32:32,841
Lock the door.

794
01:32:33,923 --> 01:32:34,923
Lock the door.

795
01:32:35,089 --> 01:32:36,206
Don't cry.

796
01:32:36,545 --> 01:32:38,496
Why did he do that?

797
01:32:39,825 --> 01:32:40,825
Iris!

798
01:32:41,277 --> 01:32:42,493
Open the door!

799
01:32:42,808 --> 01:32:44,418
Open the door!
Come out here!

800
01:32:45,064 --> 01:32:47,894
- Open the door!
- Leave!

801
01:32:50,538 --> 01:32:52,437
Bene! Bene!

802
01:32:52,462 --> 01:32:53,808
You tricked me.

803
01:32:54,285 --> 01:32:56,072
Your daughter is not a virgin!

804
01:33:01,253 --> 01:33:02,847
- Don't hurt my daughter!
- Move!

805
01:33:07,019 --> 01:33:08,019
Come with me!

806
01:33:08,374 --> 01:33:10,167
I already bought you. You’re mine.

807
01:33:27,539 --> 01:33:28,539
Get in!

808
01:33:33,731 --> 01:33:35,081
Iris!

809
01:33:35,895 --> 01:33:36,970
Iris!

810
01:33:38,143 --> 01:33:39,143
Hey!

811
01:33:56,067 --> 01:33:57,067
Bene!

812
01:33:57,809 --> 01:33:58,809
Bene!

813
01:34:00,139 --> 01:34:01,139
Where’s Iris?

814
01:34:09,706 --> 01:34:10,749
- Iris?
- Go check on Iris.

815
01:34:11,124 --> 01:34:12,124
Iris!

816
01:34:13,218 --> 01:34:14,920
Iris!

817
01:34:15,446 --> 01:34:16,446
Iris!

818
01:34:17,366 --> 01:34:18,366
Iris...

819
01:34:19,497 --> 01:34:20,497
Come here.

820
01:34:20,771 --> 01:34:22,481
Iris... Come here.

821
01:34:24,840 --> 01:34:25,840
Let’s go...

822
01:34:29,058 --> 01:34:30,058
Let’s go...

823
01:34:30,530 --> 01:34:32,283
Careful, careful.

824
01:34:46,304 --> 01:34:47,794
Their marriage is valid.

825
01:34:48,078 --> 01:34:49,663
Because she’s already of legal age.

826
01:34:49,941 --> 01:34:53,780
So, that means,
all their conjugal properties

827
01:34:54,018 --> 01:34:55,648
will go to Iris.

828
01:34:56,631 --> 01:34:57,631
What?

829
01:34:58,171 --> 01:34:59,192
Everything.

830
01:34:59,321 --> 01:35:00,585
The house and lot,

831
01:35:00,803 --> 01:35:03,210
- His sugar cane plantation in Negros.
- Plantation?

832
01:35:03,874 --> 01:35:05,916
- Yes.
- All of that will go to Iris?

833
01:35:05,941 --> 01:35:07,327
Yes, sixty hectares.

834
01:35:07,454 --> 01:35:09,069
And his money in the bank.

835
01:35:09,734 --> 01:35:12,507
256 million.

836
01:35:13,475 --> 01:35:14,556
Really?

837
01:35:14,581 --> 01:35:16,062
Is this really happening?

838
01:35:16,718 --> 01:35:17,788
Two...

839
01:35:18,233 --> 01:35:20,663
256 million?

840
01:35:22,294 --> 01:35:24,296
I’ll take care of
all the paperwork.

841
01:35:24,549 --> 01:35:27,634
Thank you so much.
Thank you, judge.

842
01:35:27,659 --> 01:35:31,746
I’ll give you some money.
Thank you so much.

843
01:35:31,771 --> 01:35:32,855
Thank you.

844
01:35:33,039 --> 01:35:34,916
256 million?

845
01:35:42,151 --> 01:35:44,612
256 million?

846
01:35:44,814 --> 01:35:45,814
Is this real?

847
01:35:46,116 --> 01:35:48,024
Iris, get me some water.

848
01:35:48,187 --> 01:35:49,821
- I think I’ll pass out.
- Drink this.

849
01:35:54,651 --> 01:35:55,651
Oh my...

850
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:01,421
But, ma...

851
01:36:01,629 --> 01:36:03,243
I don’t want to live there.

852
01:36:03,461 --> 01:36:06,101
- I’d rather live here.
- We’re not leaving our house.

853
01:36:06,712 --> 01:36:08,130
I love this house.

854
01:36:08,832 --> 01:36:10,829
We’ll just have this renovated.
