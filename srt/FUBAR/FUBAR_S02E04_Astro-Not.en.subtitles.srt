Sixty-four.

-Director Reed, I got your text.

17
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:57,640
-You wanted to talk in private?
-I did.

18
00:00:57,724 --> 00:00:59,267
I have a question for you.

19
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:01,603
Where were you when Greta Nelso escaped?

20
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,521
At a restaurant across the street.

21
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,191
-And the rest of your team?
-Same, sir.

22
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,984
So your father was alone with her?

23
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,320
-What are you implying?
-Not implying anything.

24
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,322
I'm straight-up questioning
your father's loyalty.

25
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,157
Then I'm questioning your sanity.

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,034
After everything
he's done for this country,

27
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,703
where do you get the right
to suggest that he--

28
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,289
I have both the right
and the responsibility.

29
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,458
We did a postmortem sweep
of Dot Okoye's home,

30
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:26,002
and we discovered documents
in her private safe

31
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,546
that hint that Luke and Greta's
relationship during the Cold War

32
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,048
was closer than Luke let on.

33
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:33,176
Inappropriate at best,
possibly treasonous at worst.

34
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,513
-I'm gonna need you to keep an eye on him.
-You want me to spy on my father?

35
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:39,808
I want you to treat him like you would
any teammate who might be compromised,

36
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:40,767
and we both know,

37
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,104
if you're being honest with yourself,
then you must have doubts as well.

38
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,647
Come on, you're too good not to.

39
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,233
I need you to scrutinize
his decision-making.

40
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:50,318
Might go so far as to try to gaslight you,

41
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,530
make you suspect others within the agency
so you don't focus on him.

42
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:55,657
Why would he think I would focus on him?

43
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,659
Because you know him better than anyone,

44
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,994
and if he's veering off-road,
you'll notice first.

45
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,831
Look, Emma, I know about
your application to Unit 9.

46
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,375
I also know that
what I'm directing you to do is tough.

47
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,793
But this is the job, Brunner.

48
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,836
And when you do it,

49
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,547
I'll make sure the Unit 9
button-pushers hear about it.

Anything important?

53
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:23,726
[Luke] Well…

54
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,522
when we land, I have to go to HQ.

55
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,108
There's more money now
connected to Dante Cress

56
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,485
that is linked to Farkas' accounts,

57
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,571
and Farkas is willing to talk.

58
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,615
-Farkas has been CIA a long time.
-[Luke] I don't know.

59
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,160
But if there's concerns
about any of us being corrupted

60
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,162
or compromised in any way,

61
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,540
I think we need to look into that,
no matter who it is.

62
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:48,126
-Yeah.
-You okay?

63
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,461

that almost everything was transmitted.

you should really talk to Mom.

-Yeah.
-Well, thanks again for saving me.

Oh, by the way, doctor, is Emma right?
I'm in deep trouble with Tally?

82
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:40,637
Let's just say that, uh, you're lucky
she doesn't have the authority

83
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,639
to throw you out of the safe house.

84
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,600
What did Greta give you, sodium amytal?

85
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,019
Well, don't be too hard on yourself.

86
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,730
That drug really makes you
let your guard down a bit.

87
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,983
You are just lucky that she didn't use
any of that new modern stuff.

to keep your mouth shut

she took a shot, and she failed.

-That's all that matters.
-No, not a shot.

92
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,038

Doctor, just tell me, what do you see?

00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,377
A future of very long HR meetings.

96
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,838
No, no. I'm talking about how many
injection points do you see?

97
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,131
She couldn't shoot you in the arm?

98
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:20,551
Well, there's one here on the right side,
high up, in the gluteus medius.

99
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,428
That's where she injected
the sodium amytal.

100
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,598
But there's one about five centimeters
down in the gluteus maximus.

101
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:27,183
-That's odd.
-No.

102
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,103
That was her plan.

103
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:34,190
Is this what you guys do
when we fall asleep on a plane?

104
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:36,109
Wake up. This is that dream you had.

105
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,280
Quick, take off your shirt.
I want to see your itchy chest.

106
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,031
I don't think it's a swine allergy.

107
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:44,242
Let me see?

108
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,453
Ah! Temporary hives.

109
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,872
Telltale sign of exposure to scopolamine.

110
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,542
She dosed you with SP-117?

111
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,044
Oh, that's the brand-new,
state-of-the-art super-truth serum.

112
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,338
Works much better than sodium amytal.

113
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,466
Screws with the impulse
and retention centers of your brain.

114
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,468
That's why
she didn't inject me in the arm.

115
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,470
She didn't want me to see
the two needle marks.

116
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:08,224
-And she knew I couldn't see my own ass.
-Consider yourself lucky.

117
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,477
She wanted me to believe
that I actually beat the sodium amytal

118
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,438
because she knows
I'm strong enough to do that.

119
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:17,233
But she'd already given you
the much stronger shot of SP-117.

120
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,693
You didn't even realize it

121
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:23,406
because it makes you forget what happens
under its influence almost immediately.

122
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,158
That clever little minx.

123

[dramatic music playing]

124
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,954
And I gave Greta
everything she wants and needs.

125
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:33,124
So she has all four points
of power-grid vulnerability.

126
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,752
[Luke sighs]

127
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,548
Because of me,

128
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,760
she can make everything go dark.

[light rock music playing]

130
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,138
The country's left in chaos.

131

[music ends]

134
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,191
Russians? In Estonia?

135
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,069
They use the paramilitary
to maintain deniability.

136
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,528
But from their weapons,

137
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,323
Luke thinks they were sent by
the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service.

138
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,992
-That they were there for Greta.
-I thought she was Stasi.

139
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,536
Stasi functioned as an arm of the KGB
during the Cold War.

140
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,830
The KGB are the ones who want Greta dead,

141
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,958
and there are former KGB
in Russia's SVR today.

142
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,211
To them, Greta's the one that got away.

143
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,089
Russians don't give up.
How'd they find her safe house?

144
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,008
The Russians must have known about it
through some old Stasi files.

145
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,303
But they wouldn't have had it
under surveillance after all these years.

146
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,181
So forget the safe house.

147
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,266
The bigger question is…

148
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,559
[dramatic music playing]

149
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,645
…how did they know Greta was in Estonia?

150
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,729
No idea.

151
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,691
Felipe, I have the next target. We'll be--

152
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,028
-[gun cocks]
-[Felipe moaning, panting]

153
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:48,950
[man over speaker] Hello, Greta.

154
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,369
Don't worry. My men are long gone.

155
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:53,287
It's just you and Felipe.

156
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,330
Dante Cress.

157
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,209
We had a timeline.
You've been in the US for days,

158
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,503
and things haven't progressed
as I'd hoped.

159
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:04,882
We hit a hiccup,
but now I have all four vulnerabilities.

160
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:08,302
Speaking of vulnerability,
the explosive device on Felipe's neck

161
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,805
is locked remotely
and has weight and balance sensors,

162
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,391
and if you try to free him,
if he moves as much as three inches,

163
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,809
it detonates.

164
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:18,271
Move back behind the X.
I need to protect my investment.

165
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,731
I can appreciate this is upsetting

166
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,359
because I know
what this young man means to you.

167
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,195
Felipe Costa, 22,
street mechanic you picked up

168
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,116
when he tried to steal your purse
in Porto Alegre when he was just 14.

169
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,284
Worked with you ever since,

170
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,704
B&Es, safe cracks,
anything requiring nimble fingers.

171
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,165
You put him anywhere
but in the line of fire.

172
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,793
-Hmm. He's a merc, like any other.
-[Felipe breathing shakily]

173
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,754
-[Felipe moans]
-I need them all to get the job done.

174
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,257
And that's why I'm giving you
the chance to save him.

175
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,508
Three questions.

176
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:49,969
You only need to get one right
to save his life.

177
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,387
This is not necessary.

178
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,723
According to Sun Tzu's Art of War,

179
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,100
what has no country ever benefited from?

180
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,143
What?

181
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:58,603
You heard the question.

182
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,105
-[Felipe panting]
-Answer it correctly, Felipe lives.

183
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,732
And I know you want that.

184
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,903
No country has ever benefited
from a lack of preparation.

185
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,363
-[collar beeps]
-[Felipe moaning]

186
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,781
Incorrect.

187
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,534
No country ever benefited
from prolonged conflict.

188
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,038
Your failures have prolonged
this conflict with the CIA.

189
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:18,706
That is a problem for me.

190
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:23,586
I get your point. I really do. Now just--
Just, please, turn off the collar.

191
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,004
Question two.

192
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,797
Finish this statement by Sun Tzu.

193
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,800
"Attack him when he's unprepared and…"

194
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,760
And…

195
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,638
prepare when it's unexpected.

196
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,680
[panting]

197
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,015
-[collar beeps]
-[Felipe moans]

198
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:36,974
Incorrect.

199
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:41,145
Attack him when he's unprepared
and appear where you are not expected.

200
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:44,690
You were clearly expected
at Beaumont Lake power plant.

201
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,069
The CIA surmised your plan,
and as a result you failed.

202
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,487
Final question.

203
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,740
You might want to say your goodbyes
to Felipe now, just in case.

204
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,910
Nothing is going to happen to you.

205
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,370
Nothing.

206
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,830
All warfare is based on what?

207
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,582
[breathing shakily]

208
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,751
[tense music playing]

209
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,836
A tenet of Sun Tzu

210
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,967
was that all warfare
was based on deception.

211
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,052
[breathing shakily]

212
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,766
[music building]

213
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,601
-[collar chimes]
-[music ends]

214
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,728
[breathing heavily]

215
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,938
That is correct.

216
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,941
Okay, please, turn off the collar.

217
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,193
-[collar explodes]
-[exhales, inhales]

218
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,695
Let the lesson be clear.

219
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,406
I do not like to be kept waiting.

220
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,907
[sinister music playing]

221
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:37,785
[music builds, ends]

222
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,246
This isn't like you
to let something like this happen.

223
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,455
What's done is done.

224
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:45,167
Yes, she has intel, but I have
my own inside information on her.

225
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:48,713
She had a dark past,
but she also has some good in her heart,

226
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,089
and that's how we beat her.

227
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,592
The woman who drugged you
and is trying to destroy the world.

228
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,760
You want to appeal to her better angels?

229
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,555
She told me herself,
she's been freelancing for years.

230
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:01,434
Alone, lonely,
always having to look over her shoulder,

231
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,853
not being able to trust anybody.

232
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,439
Then all of a sudden
she was offered the big money,

233
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,025
and she accepted it
from a very dangerous guy.

234
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:13,195
But Greta is smart enough
not to double-cross Dante Cress.

235
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,905
There's no way out for her

236
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,700
unless we offer her a way

237
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,286
Do you think she's gonna cut bait
on this grid plan?

238
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,079
She doesn't have any darkness
in her heart.

239
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:22,997
Come on.

240
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,666
What do you think? I'd have a relationship
with someone that's evil?

241
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,543
No, she's just misguided.

242
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,253
If we neutralize Dante Cress,

243
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,089
there'll be no reason for her
to continue with her attacks.

244
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,051
That is a lot of faith in a woman
who just kidnapped you.

245
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,595
I'm not asking you to have faith in her.

246
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:40,640
I'm asking you to have faith in me.

247
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,517
But…

248
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,314
Fine.

249
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,274
Good.

250
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,111
Now, Aldon, where are we
with the cracking the BlackBerry?

251
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:57,365
-This is our best lead to Dante Cress.
-Tina still has OTS working on it.

252
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:01,118
Okay. Then when you and Roo go back
to the safe house, follow up with her.

253
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,205
Until we have our finger on Dante Cress,
we have to focus on Greta.

254
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,165
We have to find out where her targets are

255
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:08,292
before she finds out
how to take them down.

256
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,503
We only have two of the four targets.

257
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,047
There's someone on the plane
that knows the other two,

258
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,132
and I know somebody who can make him talk.

259
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,550
In five minutes, we land.

260
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:21,764
Emma, Dr. Pepper, and me,
we're gonna visit an old buddy of ours.

261
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,642
[soft rock music playing]

262
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,025
This is where he lives? Seems so normal.

263
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,070
[Chips exhales]

264
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,947
Don't tug at it.

265
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:41,158
It's tighter than the collar I had
on my crown jewels.

266
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:45,621
Move more than 50 feet from this remote,
and that thigh cuff detonates.

267
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,999
Your femoral artery will shred,
and you'll bleed out in seconds.

268
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:53,629
This is a dangerous device,
so once again, don't tug.

269
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,839
[doorbell ringing]

270
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,133
[door unlocks]

271
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,175
[door creaking]

272
00:11:58,259 --> 00:11:59,343
Howdy, partners.

273
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,386
Norm.

274
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:02,680
You guys are so lucky
to get me on a Tuesday

275
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:06,684
'cause usually I have Canasta,
but Mrs. Turtletaub's gout flared up.

276
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,978
[chuckles] And so we had to postpone--

277
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,356
-Is that…
-Hello, mate.

278
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,275
[Norm] Chips!

279
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:16,610
Bloody hell good to see you, governor!

280
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,910
I don't follow
how two you know each other.

281
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:28,748
I got booked on a job to interrogate Theo
a few years ago in Nairobi.

282
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,375
They told me a surprise was coming.
How delightful that it's you--

283
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,753
Hold on a tick. How is this even possible?

284
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,796
How are you available?
It's Canasta Tuesday.

285
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,047
Mrs. Turtletaub.

286
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,299
No. The gout?

287
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,050
Again? What a bloody shame.

288
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,303
I know how much you look forward
to Canasta Tuesdays.

289
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,721
Unbelievable, don't you think?

290
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,765
Oh my God,
can we just wire him up already?

291
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,809
It'd be a waste of time wiring him up.
I wired him up in Nairobi.

292
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,604
Let me tell you. I put him through hell.
I did awful things to him.

293
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:52,646
Yes, he really did.

294
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,398
Know how much information
I got out of him?

295
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:58,360
-273.15 Celsius on the Kelvin scale.

296
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,904
Absolute zero.

297
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,322
Brilliant wordplay, old chap.

298
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,323
-Old chap.
-[Chips]Yeah.

299
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,283
I love it when he calls me English names.

300
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:08,412
He's Bruce Willis in the second
M. Night Shyamalan movie, Unbreakable.

301
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,372
But Nairobi was not
a complete waste of time

302
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,208
because I came back with a friend

303
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,919
who has hired me
for a whole bunch of jobs since then.

304
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,463
In fact, I think you still owe me
a punch on my loyalty card.

305
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:21,425
No, no. It's one punch per job,
not per interrogation.

306
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,136
We've talked about this, mate.

307
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,014
Well, guys, I'm sorry
you came over for no reason.

308
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:30,684
Theo, if you get out of this jam,
let's meet at Jazz Fest again this year.

309
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,437
-I'll see you in the Gospel Tent.
-There must be something we can do.

310
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,981
I can't torture him
if I know it's not gonna work.

311
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,025
What do you think I am, a sadist?

312
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,693
-Fine, I'll do it.
-Emma.

313
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:43,197
Looking at your lips and not being able
to kiss them, that's torture enough.

314
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,907
Okay, I'll do it.

315
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,576
-I thought you didn't like torture.
-There are exceptions.

316
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,663
Guys, that man does not crack.

317
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,206
But I do negotiate.

318
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:56,627
I'll give you the other two grid targets
as long as you provide me safe haven

319
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,256
whilst this whole
Greta-grid debacle blows over.

320
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,466
You see, if I'm out in the world,
she'll track me down

321
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,801
and gut me for my betrayal.

322
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,761
You'd turn on Greta like that?

323
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,681
Turn on the woman
who left me to her enemies

324
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:11,684
to be tortured, drugged,
and presumptively killed?

325
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,395
Yes, actually, doctor, I… I would.

326
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:17,064
Honestly, how hard would it have been
for her to get off your plane,

327
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,483
wave a gun around and say,
"Give me my man back

328
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,693
or I'll kill your dad"?

329
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,946
How do we know that we can believe
any intel Mary Poppins gives us?

330
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:28,450
It's actually easy to administer
a lie detector if the subject is willing.

331
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,786
Well, I guess I am getting paid today.

332
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,455
Now let's get those slacks off.

333
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,499
[taps screen]

334
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,463
[phone vibrating, ringing]

335
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,592
Aldon. You guys back?

336
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:46,218
Yeah. Yeah, we're back.

337
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,012
Tell me you have an update
on the BlackBerry.

338
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,471
Phone's still with OTS.

339
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,515
-They found nothing. It's a brick.
-Shit.

340
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,226
I… I was hoping you'd shine a light
on this Cress/Farkas mess.

341
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,979
[inhales] I still can't believe
Farkas stole all that money.

342
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,024
Yeah. Guess you just
can't trust some people.

343
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,859
Guess not. All right, thanks, Tina.

344
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,569
[phone beeps]

345
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,823
[dramatic music playing]

346
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,122
[upbeat music playing]

347
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:20,419
All right. We need to set a baseline.
I'm gonna ask some easy questions.

348
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,589
Oh, actually,
whilst you were, uh, setting up,

349
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,800
I took the liberty
of preparing some questions for you,

350
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,302
just to save some time.

351
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,557
Well, I just got a text from HQ.

352
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,101
I gotta bring you over
to the CIA after this.

353
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,437
-So let's get going.
-All right. Well, good news.

354
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,647
Lots of work for Norman.

355
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,190
Okay, here we go.

356
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:45,611
-Are these flamingos on roller skates?
-[Chips] No, those are the Flamingomez's.

357
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,280
They're a family
of Mexican flamingos, actually,

358
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,866
and they run this roller rink
down in Mexico, obviously.

359
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,953
And they have these adventures,
and hilarity ensues.

360
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,913
Where'd the inspiration for that
come from?

361
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:56,914
Voices.

362
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,334
Well, you know the drill.

363
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,795
If the needle's calm, truth bomb.

364
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,421
If the needle flies…

365
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,798
-Full of lies.
-That's right.

366
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,757
Here we go.

367
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,678
"Is your name Theodore Chips?"

368
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,429
-[Chips] Indeed.
-True.

369
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,014
"Is your favorite color blue?"

370
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,557
-Like the jay.
-This is true.

371
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,309
"Did you enjoy your… [clears throat]

372
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,686
…date with Emma?"

373
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,229
I cherished and adored it.

374
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,439
[Norm] All right, well, that's true. Okay.

375
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:26,068
"Have you ever seen… pure beauty?"

376
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,028
-Yes.
-Oh, for fuck's sake.

377
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,364
He's telling the truth.
All right. "Do you believe in--"

378
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,490
Come on, man.

379
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,743
"Do you believe in love at first sight?"

380
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,830
Norm, you ask one more question about me,
your slacks are coming off.

381
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,915
I have set the baseline,
so now we can get serious.

382
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,041
Great.

383
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,753
What are the final two points
of vulnerability for the power grid?

384
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,714
Sun Star Solar Farm in New Mexico

385
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,299
and the Carson Hydroelectric Dam
in Colorado.

386
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,259
Telling the truth.

387
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,553
I'm gonna have Reed
fortify those locations.

388
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,304
Fortifying will only buy you time.

389
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,681
You know better than anyone,

390
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,766
when Greta wants something,
there's no stopping her.

391
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,809
That's also true.

392
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,937
[sinister music playing]

393
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,605
[music fades]

394
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,649
-[Greta] Good morning.
-Same to you.

395
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,317
What can I do you for?

396
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:11,989
I need your largest commercial-grade,
industrial sump pump, please.

397
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:14,033
I'm sorry, did you call ahead?

398
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,161
I'm dealing with
a time-sensitive situation,

399
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,456
and I know that it can be
an inconvenience for you, so…

400
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,666
[man chuckles]

401
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:27,713
Yeah, the only model in shop
is already contracted out.

402
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:31,008
-Client's picking it up later today.
-Tell him to go somewhere else.

403
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:31,925
[tense music playing]

404
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,762
I can't do that.
We have a deal with the other party.

405
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,849
Don't be stupid, Monty.

406
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,895
I just put six months of your salary
on this counter,

407
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,105
so why don't you go in the back,

408
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,940
get some of your men,

409
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,902
and load the equipment I need
onto my truck?

410
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,739
Because, ma'am, I couldn't load
anything up even if I wanted.

411
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:54,823
The bay doors are locked.

412
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:58,368
My boss is the only one with the keys,
and he ain't here yet.

413
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,623
Monty, you really
should've taken the money.

414
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,333
[music intensifies]

415
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,795
Plan B.

416
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,296
[vehicle beeping]

417
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,804
Get to work.

418
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,013
[music fades]

419
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,352
-[soft rock music playing]
-[lie detector whirring]

420
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,897
[Norm] State your name for the record.

421
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,650
M. Arthur Farkas.

422
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,610
M? I thought your name was Arthur.

423
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,569
It's Marcus.

424
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,404
So your name is Marcus Farkas?

425
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,032
We don't need to do this.
I know why I'm here.

426
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,534
I stole the money.

427
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,451
True.

428
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:42,079
I can't believe this.

429
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,498
And I recommended you
for the regional director job.

430
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,459
Really? Well, that was a great idea

431
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:52,798
because no one is more of a patriot
than Marcus A. Farkas, America's son.

432
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:57,136
You stole millions of dollars
in confiscated money to buy toys.

433
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,012
-Collectibles.
-Toys.

434
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,556
Collectibles.

435
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:02,141
And I did it for my country.

436
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,353
How did this benefit your country?

437
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,647
I was tired of seeing
my teams go into the field

438
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,983
without having everything
they needed to be safe

439
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:12,526
and to win.

440
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,571
We're the ones who are supposed
to be protecting the world,

441
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,323
and we're underfunded? [laughs]

442
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,409
Our budget is three billion dollars.

443
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,453
Cash for Clunkers has
a three-billion-dollar budget.

444
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,664
For God's sake, just get to the point.

445
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,457
[clears throat]

446
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:33,005
Yes, I stole the money
from abandoned criminal accounts

447
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,632
and laundered it
through the sale of collectibles.

448
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,677
But all of it was siphoned back
into the CIA through a slush fund

449
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,346
that I operated to support our missions.

450
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,224
Weapons, armor, air support.

451
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,727
Not a penny of it was spent on myself.

452
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,439
And I didn't tell anyone about it
because it would make them an accomplice.

453
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:54,401
Bank certified documents indicating
that every cent went back to the agency.

454
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:58,822
Telling the truth.

455
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,743
Well, Farkas,
your heart was in the right place.

456
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,496
But you also understand
why Tina flagged this as suspicious.

457
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,874
You know, I don't trust that Tina.

458
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,461
She very quickly found intel on me,

459
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:16,798
right after I found her
rummaging through Dot's office.

460
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,426
What was she doing in Dot's office?

461
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,387
Ostensibly, dropping off flowers,

462
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:24,306
looking for a project
they worked on together.

463
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,683
But I think you need to look into her.

464
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,727
Why were you in Dot's office?

465
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,731
Reappropriating ergonomic equipment
due to my ADA-recognized sciatica.

466
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,066
Stealing a chair?

467
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,487
All right, I'm not wasting resources
on a wild-goose hunt

468
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,530
because you feel slighted.

469
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:41,865
I find it interesting

470
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:46,370
that all of this stuff
comes up about Dante Cress,

471
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:50,290
and then all of a sudden,
someone who we know very little about

472
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,417
comes marching in here trying--

473
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,002
-Farkas.
-[Reed] Oh, that's all right.

474
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,546
Clearly this man has nothing to do
with Dante Cress.

475
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,675
And seeing as he Robin Hooded
terrorist funds for the CIA,

476
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,261
I suggest we consider the matter
settled and between us.

477
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,345
[Luke] Mm-hmm.

478
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,888
[upbeat music playing]

479
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,016
So you're letting me go?
I'm not in any trouble?

480
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,729
We're the CIA.
We specialize in shady shit.

481
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,233
-So I'm still up for regional director?
-Fuck no.

482
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,528
Shred those. I didn't see them.

483
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,155
-Well…
-[door opens]

484
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,824
…my work here is done.

485
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,119
I thought I get two punches.

486
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,913
-[phone ringing]
-[sighs]

487
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,082
I'm glad we got that behind us.

488
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,336
You know, I don't like
when there's suspicion on one of our own.

489
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,713
I concur.

490
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,134
-So where you off to now?
-I'm gonna go back to the safe house.

491
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,094
Smooth things over with the missus?

492
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,471
Excuse me?

493
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,890
[dramatic music playing]

494
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,352
I found Dot's documents.

495
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,022
I know about
your and Greta's relationship.

496
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,232
I know it was improper.
I know it was dangerous.

497
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,776
I know it can get into your head
and affect your judgment.

498
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,697
It was totally personal.
Did not interfere in our business at all.

499
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,491
I know. I spent the day going through
your mission files, briefings,

500
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,327
and your post-action reports.

501
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,830
And if I found even a whiff
of suspicious activity on your part,

502
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,666
I would've pulled you off this mission
and out of the agency.

503
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,710
And I'll still do that
if I think for one second

504
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,963
that this case, this Greta woman,
any of it, becomes too much for you.

505
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,298
You understand?

506
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:24,676
Yes, sir.

507
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,595
[dramatic music intensifies]

508
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,558
[music fades]

509
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,561
[Luke] It's always the same.
You're such a drama queen.

510
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,313
Don't blow things out of proportion.

511
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:40,359
You were under truth serum,
professing your love for another woman!

512
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,612
But that was a former love.
You know the difference.

513
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,489
I mean, that's what I was admitting to.

514
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,782
[Tally muffled] I can't believe

515
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:49,451
we spent all that time
looking for you while you were just--

516
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,078
[Luke muffled] While I was just what?

517
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:53,747
-[Tally] Enjoying yourself!
-[Luke] I wasn't enjoying myself…

518
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:57,209
So, um, all four of Greta's targets
are under high alert

519
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,002
and surrounded by military personnel,

520
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,713
but still no indication
of where she'll strike first.

521
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,383
I don't get it. If you know the problems

522
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,302
with the four power plants or whatever,
why doesn't the government fix it?

523
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,054
It's weeks of work at best.
There's no time.

524
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:12,307
Okay, Chips is, uh, handcuffed
to a radiator in the guest room.

525
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,225
What'd I miss?

526
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:16,770
Just us pretending not to hear
your parents screaming about Greta.

527
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,689
You won't have to pick
who you wanna live with this time.

528
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,733
[Luke] …to spend our lives together.

529
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:25,404
Yes, I had once feelings for her,
but that was way before we ever met.

530
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,531
Oh, so, what?
All those feelings are suddenly gone?

531
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,409
Why are there always
more secrets with you, Luke?

532
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,411
They're none.
I mean, I told you everything.

533
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,121
There are no more secrets.

534
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,248
Are you okay?

535
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,458
Yeah. Greta injured my groin.

536
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,377
What? You didn't tell me about that!

537
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,254
I wanted to keep it a secret!

538
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:45,298
[in Italian] My God, being with this man
is going to kill me!

539
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:48,176
[in English] Dr. Pfeffer, this is not
the life I envisioned for myself.

540
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,553
It's abnormal!

541
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,013
It's not abnormal. It's just different.

542
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,974
[Hamsteak snorting]

543
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,517
Hamsteak. Oh… [chuckles]

544
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,810
[snorting continues]

545
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,646
Sorry. My little Hamsteak and eggs.

546
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,440
Oh, you wanna see what I taught him?

547
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,192
Hamsteak, what do you think of BLTs?

548
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,027
[squealing]

549
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,405
See? Huh? We don't like
eating little piggies, do we?

550
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,824
Okay, come here. Have some Mallow Cup.

551
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,493
-See how smart he is?
-Get out.

552
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,911
Okay.

553
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,288
Have a good sesh.

554
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,458
It's the team pig.

555
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,168
You see? [chuckles]

556
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,128
It's… it's a madhouse!

557
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,045
[exhales]

558
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,173
[hesitates] I can't take it anymore.

559
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,384
Tally, Greta is a world-class spy.

560
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,387
If we want to beat her,
I can't always just think about us.

561
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,182
[scoffs] Because "us"
always comes in second.

562
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,017
Doctor, tell her
that she's being ridiculous.

563
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,977
-Tell him he's being selfish!
-Okay.

564
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,854
Okay, everybody, let's take a breath.

565
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,732
I have something to say
that's going to be hard to swallow,

566
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,067
but you need to hear it. Simply put…

567
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,654
your relationship is over.

568
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,947
[dramatic music playing]

569
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:53,742
[music fades]

570
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:56,077
So the topography
of the solar farm is flat.

571
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,455
Greta would need to be camouflaged
to get in close.

572
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,917
-Guess what I just discovered online?
-Never been more afraid of an answer.

573
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,919
Carter's online comic book!

574
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,796
-No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
-[Donnie cackling]

575
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,757
Seems Manga Carter here

576
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,219
has been busy creating
the fictional world of the TIA,

577
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,054
Teacher's Intelligence Agency.

578
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:17,224
-Carter, what is this?
-Art therapy Dr. Pfeffer--

579
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,975
Oh, it is the story

580
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:22,687
of a brave kindergarten teacher
who secretly saves the world.

581
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,605
His name?

582
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,732
-Brock Hardman.
-[Carter] Oh my God.

583
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,317
His catchphrase?

584
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,153
"Hard times call for a hard man."

585
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,154
Oh boy.

586
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,447
His gal? Ella.

587
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,866
A little generous on the cleavage.

588
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,995
-[Aldon] Damn.
-Okay, um, it's coincidental. It's…

589
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,457
Why does this Anson character
always have stuff impaled up his butt?

590
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,376
-My butt? Hold on.
-[Roo laughing]

591
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:49,089
A beach umbrella
from a French Riviera bombing?

592
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,675
A bowling pin
from a bowling-alley explosion?

593
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,052
Uh, this is… this is art.
Those are metaphors.

594
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:56,471
What's the metaphor
for a pelican up my ass?

595
00:25:56,555 --> 00:26:00,517
[hesitating] The pelican represents,
you know…

596
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,852
I don't wanna hold
your hand through it, but…

597
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,563
You made out with my fiancée!

598
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,522
-That's--
-Fair point.

599
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,357
These characters look just like us.

600
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,651
There's a shootout
in the church with Toro,

601
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,319
and Carter saves the day.

602
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,238
Not quite how I remember it.

603
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,782
Carter, the Boro matter's confidential.

604
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,325
As is our location.

605
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,287
You got drawings of the town,
drawings of our street.

606
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:25,333
Dr. P told you to express your feelings,
not expose our location, dumbass.

607
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,168
And why are my boobs so big?

608
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,587
You put this on the Internet?

609

-[Tally] I've had it!

I can't take this anymore!

612
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:38,054
Oh, very, very mature, Tally.
This lamp was paid for by the CIA.

613
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:41,266
God forbid you should offend
your precious CIA.

Whoa, uh… No.

[Tally exhales]

617
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,856
I can't believe I ever wanted you back.

00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,859
-I can't believe I wanted you back.
-This reconciliation is over.

619
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,360
-Good riddance.
-Great.

00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,823
Does this leave an opening for the kid?

00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,034
No, Donnie, no.

How could you write that comic book?

631
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,773
You know how much danger
you could put us in?

632
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:32,651
I know. I took it off of Reddit
five hours after I posted it.

633
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,944
Only three people downloaded it.

634
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,906
I'm embarrassed.
I will find a different form of therapy.

635
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,244
Why did you make yourself a super spy?

I apparently

637
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,084

following the shootout at the church.

639
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:52,712
Like what?

Even your mother fought back against Boro,

641
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,467
and she's a civilian.

642
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:00,303
-I hid in a confessional.
-Carter, you did the right thing.

643
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:03,390
You got out of the way so that
trained officers could do their job.

644
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:07,227
Yeah, I know. I just…
I didn't know how to protect you.

645
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:11,064
And all I wanted was to protect you
because I was in love with you.

646
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:14,567
And I am still in love with you. [exhales]

Oh.

648
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:19,447
-Really?
-Oh, yeah, a lot. A lot.

649
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,824
Even more so now.

[gentle music playing]

651
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,869
You know, I understand now and appreciate

652
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:28,456
the pressure that comes
with the very specific job that you do.

653

when you kissed Anson.

-Aldon.
-Aldon.

655
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:37,465
Aldon. The point is,
people make mistakes, okay?

656
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,009
I'm saying I understand
that people make mistakes.

657
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:42,178
But our relationship was good,
and it was worth it,

658
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:44,055
and it was strong enough
to withstand that,

659
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,598
but I messed it up.

660
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,935
I had to let my ego get in the way.

661
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:52,564
And I… lost my train of thought.

662
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,775
Do you have any thoughts about any
of the words that came out of my mouth?

663
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,860
Yes, you're right.

664

Our relationship was
really good and strong.

And I will always love you.

So are you gonna answer the man?

670

[Barry] Emma, we got something.

00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,431
We'll talk-- We'll talk about this later.

-Okay.
-Okay.

That's my laptop.

-Check out the security cam still.

Why does she have a boner for these pumps?
She could get 'em somewhere else.

681
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:52,791
Industrial sump pumps are very large,
and they're not easy to move around.

682
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:55,043
Greta wanted pumps
from that specific wholesaler

683
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:58,171
because she wanted to use them
to attack someplace close to that seller.

684
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:01,549
-Barry, pull up the maps of that area.
-[Barry] Here's the landscape.

685
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,803
And here's the overlay of major utilities
and government buildings

686
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,262
so we can find a potential target.

687
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:08,723
That's a pretty substantial
water-purification plant.

688
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:12,977
Greta is targeting the power grid,
not trying to poison the water supply.

689
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,855
Well, there's a federal
railroad service yard over here.

690
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,691
Maybe. But what effect
is this gonna have on the power grid?

691
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:19,859
There's a military base.

692
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,152
[computer chiming]

693
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:24,113
Greta's not crazy enough
to take on a whole military base.

694
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,407
Is she?

695
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:28,952
The contractor said

696
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,621
that the corrupted sewer lines
ran underneath our server room.

697
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:34,123
I assure you,
we're just dealing with backed up toilets.

698
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,417
Hey, Barry, get into the server system.

699
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,420
[soldier] That's not necessary
or even legal.

700
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,464
All they did was come in
with some scanner,

701
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,049
found a blockage under the floor,

702
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,134
said they were coming back
to cut through the floor.

703
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,929
Yeah, that's not a contractor,
and they're not coming back.

704
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,597
They seemed legit, ma'am.

705
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,558
Let me guess.
They had a truck with sump pumps

706
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,142
and breezed right onto the base.

707
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,770
Found something
in the satellite-monitoring readouts.

708
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,064
You're not supposed to enter that system.
It's sensitive.

709
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,524
That's what my doctor said.

710
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,651
Now what the hell is that?

711
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,194
That's also what my doctor said.

712
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,571
[dramatic music playing]

713
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,823
That is very bad news.

714
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,658
Sir, you need to go to your general

715
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:11,327
and tell him the CIA has confirmed
that there's a breach.

716
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,121
-Now!
-Shit.

717
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,038
Copy that.

718
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,040
What's going on?

719
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,126
That's their Tracking, Telemetry
and Control system.

720
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,377
It sets satellite paths.

721
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,381
I consulted on Loon's
Internet balloon project.

722
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,842
I got, you know,
pretty familiar with satellite tech.

723
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:29,679
-And?
-And red flashy-flashy means trouble.

724
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:32,098
So Greta somehow
clogged up their poop pipes,

725
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,310
posed as a contractor to get on the base,
and messed with the satellite.

726
00:31:35,393 --> 00:31:39,022
Likely, one of their satellites is offline
and won't respond to commands.

727
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,231
But what if it's a glitch?

728
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:44,485
Its orbital path goes directly over
Litchfield power plant in Massachusetts,

729
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,404
one of the four points of vulnerability.

730
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,697
Definitely not a glitch.

731
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:52,160
Guys, that is a military satellite
whose core is powered by nuclear material.

732
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:54,203
If Greta manipulates its path
back into Earth

733
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,540
and it falls at 50,000 miles per hour,
smack into a power plant?

734
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,083
Smell you later, power plant.

735
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,085
But doesn't this shit burn
in the atmosphere?

736
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,712
No, it has a reinforced core.

737
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,672
But the plant is surrounded
by the soldiers,

738
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,341
so she can't attack from the ground.

739
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:08,217
But she can attack from above.

740
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,553
That's the out-of-the-box thinking
she's known for.

741
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,472
This is fluffing brilliant.

742
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,724
Cool, Dad.
Your terrorist friend is amazing.

743
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:17,018
Want me to grab your autograph book
for when we catch her?

744
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,394
How long do we have?

745
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,731
Uh, based on the satellite's speed,

746
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:25,652
its orbital path,
and the rotation of the Earth,

747
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,946
-it'll hit about 6:00 p.m. today.
[phone vibrating]

748
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,199
Work the problem.

749
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,661
[door creaking]

750
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,165
This better be important.

751
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,668
I couldn't find anything
tying Reed to Dante Cress,

752
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,587
but Tina has numerous cash anomalies.

753
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,674
I normally would hang up right now
and forget this phone call ever happened.

754
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:48,841
[Farkas] No, just listen.

755
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,636
On Tina's salary,
she should be way overextended,

756
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:56,391
but she's got a condo with no mortgage
and $403,000 in savings.

757
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,059
Tell me you're seeing what I'm seeing.

758
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,894
What I see is
someone that's very desperate

759
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,604
trying to get back at a fellow officer

760
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:04,273
that caught you
with your hand in the cookie jar.

761
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:06,025
So stop it. That's an order.

762
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:14,158
Do any of you think it's weird
how my dad seems to admire Greta?

763
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:16,494
You gotta admit, her plan is next level.

764
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,579
Well, he just seems to be
a bit off his game.

765
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:20,206
I mean, at first he gets kidnapped…

766
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,625
Greta got the jump on him.
That can happen to any of us.

767
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,961
He spilled government secrets

768
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:27,046
while professing
his love to her in Estonia.

769
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,589
That's a little harder to explain.

770
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,759
Then, today, he breaks up with my mom.

771
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:34,971
I mean, she's upstairs
being consoled by Carter right now,

772
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,681
and my dad barely blinks over it.

773
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:37,598
[Donnie] Hmm.

774
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:40,685
Well, I think…

775
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:46,441
I think there's still a chance
I could be your new dad.

776
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,028
[groans] Shut up, Donnie.

777
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,905
[Roo] Yeah, I don't know
what's going on with your old man.

778
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,949
I'd totally do your mom.

779
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,744
-Whoa.
-I can't control where the blood flows.

780
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:01,789
-What are you suggesting, Emma?
-I think Greta may be affecting him.

781
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,667
I think she might be
compromising his judgment.

782
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,419
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

783
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,921
You just said
the second most offensive C-word.

784
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,965
Okay, I… I didn't say
that he's compromised.

785
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,761
I think his judgment might…
be compromised.

786
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,387
There's a huge difference.

787
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,973
That's a big accusation.

788
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,641
Is this something you're worried about?

789
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,851
It's been on my mind, yeah.

790
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:25,271
It hurts me to say this,
but you're a good officer.

791
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,483
And if your instincts are telling you
that something's off,

792
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:29,942
then maybe there's something to it.

793
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,611
So keep an eye out.

794
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:35,698
I mean, the odds are
Luke Brunner's on point, as always,

795
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,950
but it never hurts
to be a little cautious.

796
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,370
Thanks. I appreciate that.

797
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:44,248
You know, if you think about it,
I can understand how he'd be tempted.

798
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,958
It's not every day you meet someone

799
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,044
that you're physically
and mentally attracted to,

800
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,588
who also understands
the complicated world that you work in,

801
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:54,008
who'll fight alongside you,
risk their life with you.

802
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:57,011
That's the kind of person
you find once in a lifetime.

803
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:59,931
And if you get the chance
to be with that person…

804
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,227
then you have to take it. Right?

805
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:05,728
Absolutely not.

806
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,023
You think my dad
should be with that home-wrecker?

807
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:12,485
I'm sorry, what? You think I--
That's not exactly what I was saying.

808
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,195
-[Roo] Who were you talking about?
-I was…

809
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,364
What's our progress to the fix?

810
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,492
Um, we have to reprogram the satellite
to keep it from crashing,

811
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,494
but only if we can get it back online.

812
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:22,453
But we can't.

813
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,623
I'm trying to ping
remote capabilities. It's dark.

814
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,834
It's like Greta gummed up the works
and locked the door.

815
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,460
There's no way we can get back in.

816
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,879
But I found a loophole
in the military schematics.

817
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,632
If we get close enough to the satellite,
like a mile or so,

818
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,926
it'll read an onboard computer
via Bluetooth.

819
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,554
Then I can upload new commands,
regain control,

820
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,556
and put it back into proper orbit.

821
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,016
But how do we get a computer
within a mile of the satellite?

822
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,810
We go to the source.

823
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,354
[dramatic music playing]

824
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:51,399
[helicopter blades whirring]

825
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,943
You want a goddamn spaceship?

826
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:57,697
Well, Congress refers to it actually
as a high-atmospheric orbital drone--

827
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,657
That's my goddamn spaceship,

828
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,617
and I'm not letting you
take it for a joyride

829
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,369
because you don't like
the looks of the plumber.

830
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,787
[Aldon] Will you listen to us?

831
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:08,207
There's a nuclear-powered satellite
that's gonna crash into a power plant.

832
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,002
Not to mention we have footage
of that plumber, a known mercenary,

833
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,963
stealing the sump pump she used
to connive her way onto your base,

834
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,257
right after she sabotaged
your septic system.

835
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,178
So you get to pilot
the most expensive asset under my command

836
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,846
because my shitter breaks?

837
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,681
General, your satellite--

838
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:26,475
Is temporarily unresponsive.
It happens all the time. Look.

839
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,811
Look, Greta Nelso
broke into my server room,

840
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,313
but then she got cold feet.

841
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,857
Or she screwed up her plan,
or whatever the hell happened

842
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,859
because she left,
and nothing's gone wrong.

843
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:38,196
Now, if she comes back,
you got my word, we will shoot her.

844
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,865
We got an assload of guns,
and my boys are itching to use them.

845
