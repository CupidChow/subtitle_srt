[Carter grunting]

3
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,559
All right, warmed up.

4
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:19,352
Go all out now, okay? As hard as you can.

5
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,311
[wheezes] What?

6
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,230
[exhales]

7
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:25,483
[Carter sighs]

8
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:27,652
You really want to do this?

9
00:00:27,736 --> 00:00:29,612
You're the one who said
I had to fight for her.

10
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:33,116
I was speaking figuratively.
Aldon will kick your ass.

11
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,035
That's why I'm asking you to train me.

12
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:38,163
I know something's up,
and everything points to him.

13
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:42,083
Emma's always running off
at the last minute all around the world.

14
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,295
And I've got to assume that their company
also sends him on these trips.

15
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,632
Plus, how many times in a month
does someone need to get their car washed?

16
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,967
She likes a clean car.

17
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,928
She's… She's acting very weird, man.

18
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,764
-Speaking Swahili.
-She what?

19
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:57,766
And… romantically,

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:04,230
she's gotten quite adventurous as of late,
almost like she's making up for something.

21
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,566
-I don't need to hear that.
-Yeah, my bad. Fair enough.

22
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:09,319
I don't know why
I thought you should hear that.

23
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,362
I… I know something's going on.

24
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,572
If I listen to my gut,

25
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,576
my gut tells me I gotta confront that guy,
even if I have to fight him.

26
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,787
Even if it means I get my ass kicked.

27
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,121
For Emma.

28
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,665
Emma is worth fighting for.

29
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,584
[slow piano music playing]

30
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:25,502
I love her.

31
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,087
You're a good young man, Carter.

32
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,799
Now you're standing here
with boxing gloves on, for Pete's sakes.

33
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:32,717
And, uh…

34
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,638
Oh… And what?

35
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,932
Uh, nothing.

36
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,935
No, something. Something's upsetting you.
You're just not saying it.

37
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:43,728
You had the same look on your face
when I told you

38
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,147
that I was on my high school cheer team.

39
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,650
It's probably worse.

40
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,402
[spluttering] Please, Mr. Brunner,

41
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,279
what aren't you telling me?

42
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:57,575
[somber music playing]

43
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:59,619
I saw Emma and Aldon kissing.

44
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,330
Carter,

45
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,207
please,

46
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:06,835
talk to Emma.

47
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,212
Maybe you can work things out.

48
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:24,519
Hey, it's the fiancé.

49
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,773
[mouthing]

50
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,070
-What's up with him?
-Oh, he's tired from the training.

51
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,114
He wants to get into wedding shape.

52
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,532
So how is Romi?

53
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,534
Better every minute.
The docs couldn't be happier.

54
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:42,036
-She'll be home in a few days.
-Thank God.

55
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,248
I come with more good news.
My app is gonna be launching at Ralph's.

56
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:49,210
Ralph's is one of the biggest chains
on the West Coast. How did you land that?

57
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,005
Not that Ralph's.
Ralph Moskowitz's bodega.

58
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,507
-Oh.
-It's a beta run to show how it works.

59
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,926
I was hoping you could go check it out.

60
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,511
-I'll download it for you.
-No, it's--

61
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,470
I got it.

62
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,641
And Donnie's investment let me add
new features like a barcode reader.

63
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:07,687
It advises you on coupons,
allergens, nutrition.

64
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,230
Any data in the barcode's revealed.

65
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,067
MyAisles is gonna revolutionize
the grocery store experience.

66
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,069
You grab an apple. You pay for the apple.

67
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,030
You don't need a revolution for that.

68
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:18,781
Check it out.

-[phone beeping]
-[light rock music playing]

70
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,535
It works.

71
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,038
It says the app is a bad idea.

72
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:28,833

[glass clinking]

74
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,021
-The kiss was a mistake.
-I'm so glad that you said that first.

75
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,731
Good. Okay.

76
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,608
Okay, so friends then?

77
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,443
Yes, ma'am. Friends. Absolutely.

78

[speaking French]

90
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,100
Did you just say "let's go to a motel"?

91
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,935
Or a hotel. I've got miles.

92
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,022
-If we go to a hotel, we have sex.
-That's the idea.

[both panting]

94
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:34,899
What?

Okay I… No, I, um… I can't do this. Um…

96

Carter.

97
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,367
I… I can't do this to Carter.

98
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,786
My heart is telling me,
"No, stop, this is wrong."

99
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:48,579
Okay. But what is your groin saying?

100
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,791
'Cause mine's saying
we should definitely go to a motel, right?

101
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,835
[Emma clears throat]

102
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:57,046
Okay. All right, no, you're right.

103
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,590
You're right. This is messed up.
You're engaged.

104
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,802
I've been a lot of things in my life,

105
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:05,805
and an intentional home-wrecker
has never been one of them.

106
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,224
-So…
-Intentional?

107
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,934
Well, they don't always wear rings.

108
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,065
[footsteps departing]

109
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,407
Box seats behind the dugout?

110
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:25,867
Just got them.

111
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,037
-Paid through the nose.
-Mm-hm.

112
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,079
[Roo] Ah.

113
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,290
What's the occasion?

114
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:34,000
I think Emma needs a break.

115
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,587
Between us losing Boro
and everything that's going on with Romi,

116
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,173
I think it'd be good
to have a day just to talk.

117
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,591
So no occasion?

118
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:44,927
[Luke] When she was nine,
I missed her gymnastics championships.

119
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,638
To make up for it,
we did family day in the stadium.

120
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,932
I carried her around on my shoulders.

121
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:50,850
We had hot dogs.

122
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,226
The perfect day.

123
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,646
She even got
an autographed baseball from Jeter.

124
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,359
I remember family day
at Fishkill Correctional.

125
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,527
Buzzie The Strangler gave me a tissue.

126
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,029
It had his mucus on it.

127
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,450
-At least, I thought it was mucus.
-[footsteps approaching]

128
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,369
Hey, Emma, check this out.

129
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,621
Bronx Bomber family day.

130
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,081
Just like old times?

131
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:13,998
Surprised?

132
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,042
Oh Dad, wow, that's great.

133
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,418
I… I would love to, really,

134
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,421
but… I need to spend
the weekend with Carter.

135
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,049
I've been away a lot,
and I think it's getting to him.

136
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,718
-Rain check?
-Sure, yeah.

137
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,261
We just do it some other day.

138
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,223
As long as we get some time
to talk a little bit, okay?

139
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,349
Sure. Yeah.

140
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,398
Greetings, chief.

141
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,198
[uptempo instrumental music playing]

142
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:51,411
Sit down and listen.

143
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:57,417
So, Langley thinks they know why Boro
took such risks to get his weapon back.

144
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,711
-Um, to sell it?
-If he did, he'd be out of inventory.

145
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:03,840
Now that he has the stolen waste
from the Kazakh train,

146
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,383
and he has the suitcase back,

147
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:08,386
we believe he will utilize
the suitcase's nuclear core

148
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:11,431
to re-irradiate the waste
and make another half dozen nukes.

149
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,349
Remind me again why we didn't torture him

150
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,768
instead of giving him
exactly what he wanted?

151
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:18,896
Respectfully.

152
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,400
Well, can't we find Boro
by scanning for the radiation signature,

153
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,026
like we did in Greece?

154
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,320
We've been trying, but no luck. Tina?

155
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,115
My pals at NSA have picked up chatter

156
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:32,743
that Boro could have his weapons
ready for sale in ten days or less.

157
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,996
NSA also intercepted conversations

158
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,249
about a high-stakes card game
taking place two days from now

159
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:40,710
at an oligarch's mansion outside Moscow.

160
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,464
Exclusive annual event
with a 200-year history.

161
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,299
Game's a little shady.

162
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,427
Super rich from all over the world
pay a fortune to attend.

163
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,845
It's a status thing.

164
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,514
Some of the players
are underworld characters.

165
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,269
Sources tell us that Boro's
right-hand man, Cain, will be there.

166
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:02,023
So Cain gets a day off
from side-kicking and bootlicking.

167
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,317
When he's done,
we follow him back to Boro.

168
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,276
[Dot] Not that simple.

169
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,862
Since escaping Guyana,
we believe Boro and his team

170
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,364
have been traveling exclusively
in private aircraft

171
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,158
with radar-deflecting capability.

172
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:15,953
Not to mention, they're most likely
moving in and out of unfriendly nations

173
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,205
that don't provide us intel.

174
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,750
However, we have ascertained
that during the game,

175
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,127
cell phones are locked in a box
to prevent cheating.

176
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,795
We get operatives into the game

177
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,340
with data rippers
disguised as cell phones.

178
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,884
They'll extract data from other phones
they're locked in with.

179
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,678
And from that
we can access Cain's GPS data

180
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,556
and learn where he's been,
which will give us Boro's location.

181
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,016
And the location of the nukes.

182
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,392
[Aldon] But therein lies the rub

183
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:41,562
because Cain already knows
all of our very attractive faces. [laughs]

184
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,897
Not all of them.

185
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,609
-There's gotta be a better option.
-What he said.

186
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:49,111
The Boro operation
has been designated need-to-know.

187
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,113
The game's less than 48 hours away.

188
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,784
There's no time to get clearance
and fully read in two new operatives.

189
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:58,704
Barry and Tina will get their cover IDs.
CIA will bankroll the five million buy-in.

190
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,498
[Roo] The CIA's got it like that?

191
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,667
Why am I still shopping at T.J. Maxx?

192
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,086
'Cause you like name brands
at no-name prices.

193
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,798
We'll need to clone every phone in the box

194
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:10,716
since we have no way of knowing
which is Cain's.

195
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,926
That's a lot of data.

196
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:14,595
[Dot] That's why we need two players,
each with their own data ripper.

197
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:18,099
Director, as much as I'd love
to put myself in danger again,

198
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:22,103
even though I'm not a field operative,
as clearly delineated in my contract…

199
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:26,524
-I don't know how to play cards.
-You won't have to. You'll cheat.

200
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,901
Cheaters never prosper.

201
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,531
Concur.

202
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:38,327
[inhales] So how do we get these two
into an exclusive oligarch card game?

203
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,121
Clock's ticking. Figure it out.

204
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,456
[phone vibrates]

205
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,299
I gotta deal with something.

206
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,301
Aldon, you're senior.

207
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:57,638
Emma has the most Boro experience,
so work together.

208
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,850
The two of you… should be good at that.

209
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,064
[Emma clears throat]

210
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,318
[Tally]
Those weird brothers sent it to me.

211
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,694
There were three people.

212
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:14,655
The smaller one went inside quickly
before I could make him out,

213
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,451
but I know that's Emma's friend
from work, Aldon,

214
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,785
and he's with Kyle,

215
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,954
and Kyle's clearly been kidnapped.

216
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,249
I just want the truth, Luke.

217
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,921
[Luke] Remember when I told you

218
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,924
that we had to convince Kyle
to make the right decision?

219
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,426
That's how we convinced him.

220
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,677
And Aldon helped me.

221
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,721
Because at the engagement party,
he told me

222
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,390
that he needed a little side job
to make some extra money,

223
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,143
so I gave him this job
and paid him a couple of bucks.

224
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,519
But it was for a good cause.

225
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,146
Romi was really sick.

226
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,856
And we didn't hurt Kyle.

227
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:52,360
We just scared him…
to make the right decision.

228
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,531
I guess you did what you thought
you needed to do for Romi.

229
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,451
Fine. But the Twinning Formula guys say

230
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:02,870
you've been faking sales figures
to win awards.

231
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,706
And they wanna see the books,
or they'll start making noise.

232
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,334
I poked around, Luke, and they're right.

233
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:13,255
Something… Something shady
is going on at Merry Fitness,

234
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,716
and I need to know what it is.

235
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,095
[sighs]

236
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,971
[birds squawking]

237
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,481
You deserve to know the truth.

238
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,528
Barry has a gambling problem.

239
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:39,323
Bartholomew Tiberius Putt, a gambler?

240
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,409
He owes a lot of money
to some really bad people,

241
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,993
and I'm trying to help him.

242
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,537
That's why I'm working all the time.

243
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:48,541
We're using the marketing money
to pay off the gambling debt.

244
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:53,003
And yes, we are fudging the sales numbers
because we want to win the sales awards.

245
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:55,339
And the awards
get your name out there for free.

246
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,257
Yes.

247
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,759
The more customers that come in,
the more money comes in,

248
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,845
the more we can go and give to the bookie.

249
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,222
It's a vicious cycle. It's a mess.

250
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:06,600
You know, I swung by Barry's the other day

251
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:08,561
to drop off some Tilapia Veracruz

252
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,646
because he's eating
so much crap all the time.

253
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,022
He wasn't home,

254
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,025
but I could see through the window
that all his toys were gone.

255
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,945
Is that-- Is that because of all this?

256
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:21,407
He sold everything
to pay off the gambling losses.

257
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:26,203
But, please, don't give any of this
information to those bozo brothers

258
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:29,582
because they will shut us down,
and Barry could really get hurt.

259
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,542
I will figure something out.

260
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,753
Not like what you did to Kyle, right?

261
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,629
No, we won't touch them.

262
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,466
Now let me ask you something.

263
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,218
I mean, we could have met anywhere,

264
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,888
and I invited you many times.

265
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:47,183
What made you finally decide
to come on board?

266
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,268
I don't know. [chuckles]

267
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,521

[instrumental music playing]

269
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,442
I didn't know what you did,

270
00:12:56,525 --> 00:13:00,738
but I knew you did something for Romi
to save her.

271
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:02,698
I just…

272
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,287
I wanted to do something for you too.

273
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:12,333
Now, everything you've been
going through because of Barry,

274
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:17,463
you make it real hard
to stay mad at you, Luke Brunner.

275
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,969
I haven't always been perfect,

276
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,641

the right thing for our family.

[woman] This is an automatic shuffler

279

00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,579
We will use it to cheat.

281
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,711
It has a pinhead camera
to confirm a standard 52-card deck.

282
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:58,879
It's also hackable.

283

You'll hear us, but no one else will,

and we will hear and see

[Dot] An AI program will guide your play,

290
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,580
so you'll remain in the game long enough
to complete the spoofing of Cain's phone.

291
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,039

[Dot] Not an issue.

of the card game's alternate list.

345
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,877
So how do we get them to the table?

346
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,422
We can wait for my dad, but he did leave
Aldon and me to run point, so--

347
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:31,050
Throwing Papa under the bus. Classy.

348
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,054
-We can break down what we put together.
-Proceed.

349
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,347
It's a five-player game.
We take out two of the players.

350
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,974
They have to replace them
with two of our guys.

351
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,726
We chose a couple, the Biryukovs.

352
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,979
Their place is a fortress
with top-of-the-line security.

353
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:47,357
Five guards. Two out back,
two at the gate, one inside.

354
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,275
We start in the back.

355
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,111
They're ex-Aussie Special Forces
working private sector.

356
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,029
We can't kill 'em,

357
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:55,699
but a pair of 13-caliber tranquilizer
dart rifles will do the trick.

358
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,951
-Why two?
-[Roo] Air guns don't have the range,

359
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,537
and from that close,
the shots have to be simultaneous.

360
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:03,415
-Pretty boy will do it with me.
-That's me. I'm pretty.

[uptempo instrumental music playing]

362
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,304
[both grunt]

363
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,100
Pair at the front gate is more difficult.

364
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,186
We have to assume the house guard
has access to a monitor.

365
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,063
If he sees 'em go down, it's over.

366
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:29,608
So we need a van and 30 balloons.

367
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,611
[door closes]

368
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,243
What's going on?

369
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,495
One of the poker buddies
sent good-luck balloons.

370
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,414
And a big box, back of the van.

371
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,458
Check it out.

372
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,839
Sign here, please.

373
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,938
Good night, mate.

374
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:09,606
[grunts]

375
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,369
[Dot] Four down, one to go.

376
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,371
How do you take out the guard
in the house?

377
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,999
Easy. Joy buzzer.

378
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,086

-Seem to be shocked to see me.
-[grunts]

383
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:52,900
We're in.

384
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:56,904
[in Russian] We're both under the weather.
We're sorry to miss the game too.

385
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,530
Thank you.

386
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,990
Maybe next time.

387
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,245
[in English]
And Barry and Tina take their place.

388
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,623
We hit the old coots with some darts.
They go nighty night.

389
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,458
When they wake up, we're long gone.

390
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,918
Easy as Sunday morning.

391
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,504
Don't worry. It's just a sedative.

392
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:16,423
You can't give us sedative.

393
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,675
It could kill us.

394
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,260
We have COPD.

395
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:24,014
You said you wouldn't hurt us
if we made the call. Please.

396
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,933
I think they're telling the truth.

397
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,561
So? There's like a 5% chance
something happens to them,

398
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:33,357
but 100% chance we don't get Boro
if they alert anyone to what we're up to.

399
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,275
So let's stick 'em and get out of here.

400
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,945
They're not spies.
They're just card players.

401
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,947
They'll like the risk. They're gamblers.

402
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,907
Emma's right. We can't shoot them.

403
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,868
Aldon and I will sweep the house.
You keep watch.

405
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:11,103
Borscht is in the bowl?

00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,406
[in Nigerian accent]
Of course. My pleasure.

410
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:23,865
Voilà, monsieur.

411
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,202
Follow me.

412
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,873
What the heck was that accent?

413
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,083
Wakanda.

414
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,127
It was the only study material
I could find.

415
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:38,171
He only took your side
because you're his daughter, by the way.

416
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,216
-He took my side because I'm right.
-[scoffs] Whatever.

417
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,260
Well, you're not much
of a sports fan, huh?

418
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:45,971
-I was an NCAA athlete.
-NCAA?

419
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,598
What sport? Asshole Olympics?

420
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,017
I'm not engaging.

Not that it's your business,

426
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:03,947
but I'm having some relationship issues
that I need to tend to this weekend, okay?

427
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,700
Yeah, he knows that,
and he's worried about you.

428
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,619
That's why he wanted to take you
to a ball game and talk.

429
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,622
-Really? That's why he wanted to go?
-Yep.

What an inconvenience
having a dad who cares.

431
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:21,089
The only sporting event my dad took me to
was a cockfight in an abandoned Del Taco.

If the guards wake up
and we're still here,

we go straight for the gulag.

00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,810
Okay, is it just me,
or is it getting unbearably hot?

504
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,979
Well, that's 'cause the ventilation's
shutdown too.

505
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,647
We won't have to worry about prison

506
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,900
'cause the CO2 scrubber is not working,
and this place is vacuum-sealed.

and Tina take a sip.

All hands accounted for.

AI's calculating strategic play.

514
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,063
Okay, caught a break on the first hand.

515
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,982
Barry's sitting pretty with three eights.

516
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,360
No one else has anything,
and nothing's coming up in the draw.

517
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:57,073
They'll bet conservatively,
or if they're smart, just fold.

518
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,045
What's he doing? He's only got a pair.

519
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,631
-I thought he was a card player.
-Apparently a bad one.

520
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,425
He plays like this, he'll be out
of the game and gone with his phone

521
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:17,010
way before we're done copying it.

522
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,762
Okay, new plan.

523
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,805
We cheat to help Cain.

524
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,893
I already feel like I can't breathe.

525
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,812
-You okay, Cool Breeze?
-[exhales] I don't like feeling confined.

526
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:31,024
I read about this German guy
that lived in this tiny house,

527
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,817
and he died on his own farts.

528
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,279
Oh God, Ruth is feeling
a little hot underneath the collar.

529
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,197
Who's Ruth?

530
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,574
She's Ruth. Roo is short for Ruth.

531
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,993
I thought it was a nickname
because you drive a Subaru.

532
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:44,412
I drive a Subaru 'cause I'm gay.

533
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,540
So you never bothered
to learn my real name?

534
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,584
Nice kid you raised there, boss.

535
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,463
Come on, open up,
you Soviet-era piece of garbage!

536
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:55,674
You're not helping.

537
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,676
[Roo] No shit!

538
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,177
[groans] I'm wasting oxygen.

539
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,388
Six people in a room this size,

540
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:04,224
normal CO2 output and O2 consumption,

541
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,309
we've got two hours tops.

542
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,106
Tell us about the bunker.

543
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,982
It was here when we bought house,

544
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:17,404
left over from when we thought
nuclear war was inevitable.

545
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,447
-[can opens]
-We thought it was kitschy.

546
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,449
I told you not to eat that crap.

547
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,868
I need some sugar,
or I'm gonna crash. [slurps]

548
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:24,953
Crash.

549
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,121
That's it.

550
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,582
Emma, check the computer
when it was fired up the last time.

551
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,711
[Emma] Um.

552
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,880
According to its clock, October 8th, 1989.

553
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,006
[Luke] Okay, hear me out.

554
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:41,261
This computer is vulnerable
to crashing from the Y2K bug.

555
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,721
Nothing happened with Y2K.

556
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:44,931
Because we knew there was a problem,
so we fixed it.

557
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:48,935
I mean, from '97 to '99,
Y2K was just about all I worked on.

558
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,061
And this helps us how?

559
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:53,273
The computer runs the entire
bunker system, including the door.

560
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:56,860
So when the clock flips forward
to the year 2000, which is double zero,

561
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,529
the computer thinks it's 1900 and resets.

562
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:02,115
And upon resetting, it opens the door.

563
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:05,660
But it's not gonna think
it's the year 2000 for another 11 years.

564
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:09,748
So I'll speed up the CPU,
so it'll cycle through the dates faster.

565
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:11,583
We'd do this
in our high school computer lab

566
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,042
to make video games go faster.

567
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,544
It's not that hard.

568
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,175
Cain has a pair of tens.

569
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,428
Barry, Tina, stand pat,
so Cain gets the next card.

570
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,637
Another ten's coming.

571
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,348
[in Nigerian accent] Like Gandhi said
every day of his hunger strike,

572
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,726
"Nothing for me, thanks." [chuckles]

573
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,728
-[in French accent] I'll stand.
-Three.

574
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,155
[tense music playing]

575
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:45,867
Bets?

576
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,539
Okay, everybody in.
Please show your cards.

577
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:55,668
Mm. Mm.

578
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,631
I win again.

579
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,634
[laughs]

580
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,137
Yes, very lucky today, Mr. Khan.

581
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,139
Quite unusual for you.

582
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,557
[footsteps approaching]

583
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,358
Excuse me, sir,
but your associate has arrived.

584
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,070
Boro?

585
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,116
Son of a bitch.

586
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,955
Barry, Tina,
our target is right there with you,

587
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,123
and you are going to kill him.

588
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:39,295
[Cain clears throat] One moment, please.

589
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,759
What are you doing here?
Is everything okay?

590
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,302
We'll see.

591
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,303
I received a call

592
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:50,223
from a contact in the SVR
I've done business with before.

593
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:54,143
He says he has information for us
about our troubles in Guyana.

594
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,022
The host of your game
is a government friendly.

595
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,608
Thought this would be
a good spot to speak privately.

596
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,863
I just heard from
our mutual associate in Moscow.

597
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,281
They will be here shortly.

598
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,658
If you like, it would be my honor

599
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:11,494
to deal you in
with half-a-million house marker.

600
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:15,290
Thank you, but a man does not gamble
and wish for good fortune.

601
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,041
A real man takes what he wants,

602
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,710
creates his own.

603
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,753
Very good, then.

604
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:27,760
Okay, you know,
I can run extra power to overclock this,

605
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:30,054
but I don't know
what kind of processor this is,

606
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,723
so I could melt the chip.

607
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,933
[Luke] There's a barcode.

608
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:35,268
Oscar's app.

609
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,524
-[phone chimes]
-Okay, does this help?

610
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:46,195
It's an Intel i386 knockoff, 12 meg.

611
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,822
Says it overclocks to 40.

612
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,115
[chuckles] That'll do 'er.

613
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,408
[chuckles]

614
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,368
Aldon, do you know
what the squiggles mean?

615
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,912
On it.

616
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:55,622
[computer beeping]

617
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:03,880
Yes! It worked.

618
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,425
Hopefully, this thing's calendar expires
before we do.

619
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:10,428
Dad, you said you wanted
to talk about something. We have time.

620
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,014
Time, but not the place.

621
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,808
-Let's do it when we get out of here.
-Suit yourself.

622
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,687
You know you can't make calls
from in here, Einstein.

623
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,272
I'm checking that message from Carter.

624
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:24,359
If I die in here, hopefully his last words
to me were something nice.

625
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,944
Don't listen to it, sweetheart.

626
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,737
I mean, this is stinking thinking.

627
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,906
Look, let's just stay positive.

628
00:32:29,989 --> 00:32:32,700
Then when we get out of here,
you can talk to him in person.

629
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,286
-Uh, I appreciate that, but I'm good.
-No, don't.

630
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,125
You told Carter I kissed Aldon?

631
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,752
You kissed the princess?

632
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,003
-Sack tap.
-[groans]

633
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,172
I'll see your 80,000.

634
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:51,094
[Dot] Listen,
I have no idea why Boro's there,

635
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,178
but the bottom line is…

636
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,096
[man] Straight.

637
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,556
…you cannot let him walk out alive.

638
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,808
[man] What do you have?

639
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,020
[tense music playing]

640
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:07,902
[Tina chuckles]

641
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,279
That's impossible.

642
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,031
How do the Americans say, huh?

643
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,784
Winner, winner, chicken dinner. [laughing]

644
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:18,287
No. The only reason we invite you
to this game is because you're terrible.

645
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,665
-Ah.
-You're not winner. You're cheater.

646
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:23,918
Hey, hey! Don't you call me a cheater.
[speaking Spanish]

647
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,713
[in English] Why is he here?
He's not playing. They could be colluding.

648
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,423
[Cain] You insult that man, I'll kill you.

649
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,465
Stop this now.

650
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,300
There will be no fighting!

651
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,345
This game is beyond reproach.

652
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,640
In our history,
there has been but one cheater,

653
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:41,394
Rasputin, the unscrupulous magician.

654
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:43,229
And what did our forefathers do?

655
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:46,607
They poisoned him
and drowned him in Neva River.

656
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,652
That is what happens to cheaters,
and we all know it.

657
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,864
[in French accent] Gentlemen,

658
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,825
I think we could all use une petite pause

659
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,201
and a drink, no?

660
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:58,870
A proper drink?

661
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:01,622
One that doesn't come from a yak's penis?

662
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,832
[chuckles]

663
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,961
Monsieur, do I detect
a Central American accent?

664
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:12,717
Let me make you a rum ponche
with, um, a hint of sweet vermouth.

665
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,554
One sip and you'll think you died.

666
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,682
Smart kid.

667
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,478
-[Barry] What the hell are you doing?
-[whispering] Taking Boro out.

668
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,605
-With rum punch?
-With this.

669
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,148
Give me a tumbler.

670
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:30,401
[chuckles]

671
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,778
[in Nigerian accent] Here you go.

672
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:33,821
Did you find the liquor
you were looking for?

673
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,782
[Tina in French accent] Not yet.

674
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,367
Ah!

675
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:41,162
Here it is. [chuckles]

676
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,456
[in normal accent] Uh, fill me in, please.

677
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,709
Ethylene glycol is found
in most household cleaners.

678
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,961
Glycol will mix
with the mugwort in the vermouth.

679
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,798
-Do you know what mugwort is?
-Only from Harry Potter.

680
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:52,882
[chuckles]

681
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:54,509
Mugwort is toxic

682
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,470
when mixed with high doses
of certain accelerating agents.

683
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:58,971
Like Ethel Merman-al?

684
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:03,226
The alcohol will cause
slow and steady absorption.

685
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,936
Boro will start to feel sick,

686
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,312
and in 30 minutes,

687
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,147
he'll be dead.

688
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,819
Dot, how much longer
until Cain's phone's been copied?

689
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,363
We still need to find
that nuke after Boro's gone.

690
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,115
We're at 78%.

691
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:18,783
About 30 minutes.

692
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,493
[Barry] That's cutting it close.

693
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,078
We can't leave without the phones,

694
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,038
and if Boro dies
before we're out that door…

695
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,666
-They'll know we did it.
-Do you know what they'll do to us?

696
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,293
They made us drink yak sperm
when they were being friendly.

697
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,963
-It was kind of spicy.
-Why was it so spicy?

698
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:34,006
[host] Good evening, comrade.

699
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:35,800
Welcome to my home.

700
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:39,178
I have an area prepared
for you and Mr. Polonia

701
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,763
where you can speak privately.

702
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,685
What the hell's going on?

703
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:49,564
[Emma] How could you tell him?

704
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,567
It was the best for him and you.

705
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,445
Oh my God, this is what you wanted
to talk to me about.

706
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,781
This is why you wanted to take me
to the game, to ease your guilt.

707
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,576
The one that should feel guilty is you.
You kissed Aldon.

708
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:05,288
Carter, he knew there was something up,
so I just confirmed his suspicions.

709
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,206
It is not your place to confirm anything.

710
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,501
I thought you and I were past this.
Why do you always have to invade my life?!

711
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:12,545
[Roo] Are you shitting me?

712
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:16,174
Are you really complaining
that your dad is too up in your business?

713
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,802
You are such a spoiled,
unappreciative brat.

714
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:23,347
I've really had enough of you today.
What? What is your problem with me?

715
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:27,810
My problem is that you have everything,
and you appreciate nothing.

716
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,314
This guy chases you around,
desperate to connect,

717
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:35,568
works with you, takes you to ball games,
worries about you nonstop.

718
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,403
You know when I hear from my old man?

719
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,781
Every five years when he needs
a letter for the parole board.

720
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,284
Meanwhile, you have Dad of the Year.

721
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,328
-Thank you, Roo.
-Shut up.

722
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,079
You're as pathetic as she is.

723
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:51,125
Chasing her around like you chase
her mother, you punk-ass bitch.

724
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,293
[Aldon laughing]

725
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,421
Oh, don't you laugh, you sorry asshole.

726
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,006
The one woman in the whole world

727
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,799
you knew I wouldn't want you
to hook up with,

728
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:01,135
and you did it anyway.

729
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,762
What kind of best friend are you?

730
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,139
Weak sauce, man.

731
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,225
Weak sauce.

732
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:10,436
It was not your best decision-making,
sweetheart.

733
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,521
I warned you that Carter could get hurt.

734
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,899
And seriously, Aldon?

735
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:19,195
Oh my God! It was just a kiss
in the heat of the moment, okay?

736
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,739
He's a himbo in nice clothes,
and he helped Romi,

737
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:24,158
and I had a moment of weakness.

738
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,036
I fell for his stupid, cute face.

739
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,164
Doesn't matter. It won't happen again.
It meant nothing, absolutely nothing.

740
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:33,334
Would you stop saying that?
Because it meant something to me.

741
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,049
Shit.

742
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,551
[dramatic music playing]

743
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,763
[man]
Apologies for the last-minute request,

744
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,182
but when we learned
you were in our country,

745
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,976
we wanted to seize the opportunity

746
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,436
to speak to a man
that we have long admired.

747
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,064
[Boro] How did you know I was here?

748
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:58,192
We are SVR.
We know what you had for breakfast.

749
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,403
[Boro] Why are you here?

750
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,657
It is our understanding
you're looking for a man named Finn Hoss.

751
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,327
-How did you know that?
-We are SVR.

752
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,288
We also know what you had for lunch.

753
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:16,544
We have had a mole embedded in the CIA
for some time now, Songbird.

754
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,588
We believe Songbird
will be able to ferret out

755
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,590
the identity of Finn Hoss for you.

756
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:24,385
Because you have long admired me,

757
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,430
or because you want something in return?

758
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,265
You call off the auction.

759
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,727
All of the weapons that you make are ours.

760
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,813
We will, of course, pay fair market value

761
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:38,566
and give you the man you're looking for.

762
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,655
Finn Hoss and Danielle DeRosa.

763
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,325
Deliver them,

764
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,619
no one else buys what I'm selling.

765
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,248
Is there any way
either of you can angle yourself

766
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,751
so I can get a better look
at who he's meeting with?

767
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:03,507
[Tina] Oops.

768
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,884
[speaking French]

769
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,803
-[in English] Excuse me.
-[in Nigerian accent] Allow me, madam.

770
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:08,721
Thanks.

771
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,732
Volek. Why is he having
a sit-down with him?

772
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,903
Merci. [chuckles]

773
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:27,406
Señorita, um, this is not rum punch.

774
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,075
It is too sweet.

775
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,786
[in French accent]
I'm Indian. We like our sweets. [chuckles]

776
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:37,375
And you are sweet. Maybe after game,
I can show you how sweet I can be.

777
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,126
Thank you, but no.

778
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,630
Well, if you're not going to have it…

779
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,176
Sir? The cards?

780
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,970
-[agent] Pass. Let Cain have the Jack.
-I'll stand.

781
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:51,889
I'll stand as well.

782
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,474
Two.

783
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,529
I'll bet 500,000.

784
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,781
[chip rattles]

785
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,700
You bet out of order. It's bad form.

786
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:14,995
But I'm in.

787
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:15,996
[chip rattles]

788
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:22,962
[chuckles]

789
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:23,963
Son of a bitch!

790
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,590
-Yes, yes, yes!
-Hey! My drink!

791
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,008
You've had more than enough.

792
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:29,718
[agent] That's a problem.

793
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,679
The shuffler shorted out.
Can't read the cards.

794
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,765
Okay, well,
Cain is up a pretty decent amount.

795
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:37,101
We just need him in the game
for another 25 minutes or so

796
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,185
till his phone is spoofed.

797
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,395
We should make it, right?

798
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,939
The guy just bet half a mill
and barely won with our help.

799
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:43,149
This is an issue.

800
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,736
The shuffler is broken.

801
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:52,366
I hope I am trusted enough
to finish out the game dealing by hand?

802
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,912
This guy spills my drink,

803
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,331
does not even have courtesy enough
to get me a new one.

804
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:02,835
Ah.

805
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,175
No, that's for our guest.

806
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,472
It's mine now.

807
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,724
[Dot] Okay, that's not good.

808
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:20,978
All right, guys,
let's just focus on ripping Cain's data.

809
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,938
How do we keep Cain
in the game long enough

810
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,191
to finish copying his phone
without the shuffler?

811
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,358
[Dot] I'll figure something out.

812
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,069
But we've gotta get them out of there
before he dies,

813
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,197
or they'll die too.

814
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,407
[Aldon] I don't know how it happened.

815
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,868
Kind of felt something
since we were in Moldova.

816
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:39,788
Well, you're… You're interesting,
and I just like talking to you,

817
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:43,459
and… I don't know. You're alluring.
You allured me.

818
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:46,045
-I'm gonna be sick.
-Well, how do you think I feel?

819
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,881
I want to take Emma away from
the nicest, sweetest guy in the world.

820
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,966
-What does that make me?
-A dude with shit taste?

821
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,302
-[Aldon] It was a rhetorical question.
-Smoke.

822
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,137
[Roo] Oh man.

823
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,932
[groans] The fan's wiring is overheating.

824
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,893
-It's running too fast.
-And?

825
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,144
And if we lose the fan,

826
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,230
the CPU gets too hot,
and the whole thing burns out.

827
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,356
And we all die in here.

828
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,401
Everyone look for replacement wiring
in a radio or a walkie-talkie.

829
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,111
Anything that can conduct.

830
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:22,122
You sure sounded disappointed
that your daughter would stoop so low

831
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,666
as to take an interest in me.

832
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,501
-I thought we were friends.
-Don't get me wrong.

833
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,710
You're a great guy's guy.

834
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,462
But no one wants to have
their kid involved

835
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,673
with a $10,000-suit-wearing gigolo.

836
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,007
You know what I mean?

837
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,804
Do you want to know why I dress nice?

838
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:41,684
We were so poor growing up
that I wore nothing but hand-me-downs.

839
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,852
Whatever fit and didn't have holes.

840
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,063
Do you know what it's like
going to middle school in Dothan, Alabama,

841
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,399
wearing your sister's
Backstreet Boys T-shirt?

842
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,779
When Jane Dautrieve
asked me to the Fall Fling…

843
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,197
[exhales]

844
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,949
…I was so excited.

845
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,159
Then she asked
in front of the whole school

846
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:00,911
if I was gonna wear
my brother's dress shoes

847
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,289
'cause she heard that
we could only afford one pair.

848
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,456
Everyone laughed at me.

849
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,333
And my mom cut my hair,

850
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,795
and, uh, we couldn't afford
to go to the dentist.

851
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:13,674
But when I got hired by the CIA,

852
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,342
I got my teeth fixed.

853
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,677
I went to the salon.

854
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,305
I bought expensive clothes
because I could.

855
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:23,058
Yeah, I've slept with a lot of women
because they finally wanna sleep with me.

856
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,852
But I've never had feelings
for any of them.

857
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,062
I never wanted to see them every day,

858
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,607
and I never thought about them
as soon as I woke up.

859
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,318
But now that I do… [chuckles]

860
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:36,071
…what, it's eighth grade all over again,
and suddenly I'm not good enough?

861
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,908
-Screw both of you.
-Aldon.

862
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:40,868
Nope.

863
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,707
What do you got there, Roo?

864
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,668
A crate's worth of kick-ass
if your kid wants some.

865
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,378
[Luke] No, I'm talking about in your hand.

866
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:55,507
It's a can of fruit cocktail.
An aluminum lid is a decent conductor.

867
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:57,968
So let's fight later. Fix the damn fan.

868
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,305
[melancholic music playing]

869
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:11,690
[music ends]

870
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,609
Got your text.

871
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,736
Your ace in the hole is here.

872
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:16,820
[Dot] All right.

873
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,199
Cain's already dropped over three million
in just five hands.

874
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,617
He'll be out of the game in minutes,

875
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,703
and we need him and his phone
to remain where they are

876
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,456
for ten more minutes
till we get all his data copied.

877
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,291
Mm-hm. All right.

878
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,460
Let me get a good look at the players,

879
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:34,672
and I'll be reading them
like a copy of Psychology Today.

880
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,924
Good Lord. What's up with that guy?

881
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,967
Tina accidentally poisoned him.

882
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:41,679
See what happens
when you bring me in late on things?

883
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,556
Raise… one million.

884
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,601
He's not bluffing.

885
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,019
How are you so sure?

886
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:52,606
Well, take a good look
at the poor bastard.

887
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,526
Thousand-dollar suit, $300 haircut.

888
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:58,529
Before he got dosed,
he was very neat and anal,

889
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,572
but he just splashed the pot.

890
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:03,575
He's so excited he's got a good hand
he got messy.

891
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:04,493
Out.

892
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:07,579
[Dr. Pfeffer] Guys, fold like laundry,
or you're out of cash.

893
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,581
[in Nigerian accent] I'm out.

894
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:10,541
[speaking French]

895
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,052
I call.

896
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,513
[Dr. Pfeffer] Not a good move, Cain.

897
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,393
[ominous music playing]

898
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,488
Seems your luck
continues to change, Mr. Khan.

899
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,615
Just like famous cocktail,

900
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,951
cream rises to top
with this white Russian.

901
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,288
You have enough for one more hand,

902
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:54,293
and then… you leave… like a loser,

903
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,795
just like you came.

904
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,716
[Dr. Pfeffer] His speech is off,
but it's more than just the alcohol.

905
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:04,052
Look at his fine motor skills.
He can barely pick up the chips.

906
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:06,889
This guy's gonna drop dead in minutes.

907
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,809
His liver will expel all the toxins.
He'll turn purple and bloat.

908
00:46:10,893 --> 00:46:13,353
-They'll know he was poisoned.
-Mm.

909
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:14,938
[groans]

910
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,733
[host] No!

911
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:19,610
[grunts]

912
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,780
[in Nigerian accent]
You know what they say about yak sperm?

913
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:25,365
You don't buy it, you rent it.

914
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:31,914
It's working fine.
It's getting close though. [groans]

915
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:35,125
Am I the only one getting lightheaded?
[exhales]

916
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,919
No. No, me too.

917
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,713
I sure as hell
don't wanna die with you people.

918
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:42,299
Yeah, I don't blame you.

919
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:46,053
Aldon, I'm sorry for what I said.

920
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,888
I was a jerk.

921
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:51,558
And for what it's worth,
so was Jane Dautrieve in eighth grade.

922
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,644
[Luke] I'm sorry too, Aldon.

923
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,646
I should've chosen my words more carefully

924
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:58,398
because you would make
a wonderful boyfriend to any girl.

925
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,567
It's just that
when it is your own daughter--

926
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,110
Dad, stop.

927
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,904
When will you learn?

928
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:07,825
Where do you get off commenting
on anyone else's relationship?

929
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:10,661
Roo was right. You've been
chasing after Mom for 15 years.

930
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,538
Take the rejection and move on, okay?

931
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,414
It's pathetic and embarrassing.

932
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:17,084
-Oh, is that so?
-Yeah.

933
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:20,796
Funny because… I was not rejected.

934
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,381
What do you mean?

935
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:25,050
You ever think about
why I didn't make the ops briefing?

936
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:27,261
[Roo] Oh shit.

937
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,595
[laughs] My man.

938
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,514
No.

939
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:33,976
On the ship.
Your mommy swabbed the deck with me.

940
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,645
-No, this is not happening.
-She made me her first mate.

941
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:39,523
Then we relaxed a little bit,
had some orange juice,

942
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:42,192
and then she made me
her second mate if you catch my drift.

943
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:43,986
God, why would she do that?!

944
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,447
After all you put her through!

945
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,992
After I went out of my way
to get Donnie to ask her out--

946
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:51,493
Excuse me?

947
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:53,579
What did you say?

948
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:55,038
I told you she was the worst.

949
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,082
Betrayed by my own daughter?

950
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:59,418
Yeah, that's right. You wanna know why?

951
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:03,755
Because every time I went to Mom's office,
I saw how Donnie looked at her,

952
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:07,259
how he talked to her, made her feel good.

953
00:48:07,342 --> 00:48:10,470
So I told him what flowers she likes,
what food she likes,

954
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,722
movies she likes.

955
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:13,807
Foamed the runway straight to Mom's heart.

956
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:14,933
And her noo-noo.

957
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:17,519
I thought that we were finally
getting along much better,

958
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,605
and you double-crossed me.
That's it, and that's all.

959
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:20,981
Will you quit saying that?

960
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,025
You didn't make it up.
It's from Throw Momma from the Train.

961
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,944
One, I never saw that movie,
so I did make it up,

962
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,821
and two, I cannot believe

963
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,532
that you thought your mother
would be better off with someone else.

964
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,075
Oh, I still do.

965
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,369
The only mistake bigger than Mom
getting back together with you

966
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,913
was marrying you in the first place.

967
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:38,165
Oh!

968
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:41,793
[door beeps]

969
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,198
You should apologize to Father.

970
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:13,241
Oh, now you say something.

971
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:17,496
I will let you know
when we have the information you desire.

972
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:19,790
Until we speak again.

973
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,837
You must go now. I will call your car.

974
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,589
Cain, we're done here.

975
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:30,133
[Dot] We're at 98% downloaded.

976
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,010
You cannot let them leave.

977
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,220
Stop them.

978
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:36,473
I finally start to win,
and you want me gone. It's bullshit.

979
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:41,311
-How many drinks has he had?
-Three or four at least.

980
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,981
Three or four drinks? For a Russian?

981
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:45,107
Doesn't make sense.

982
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,986
[Barry in Nigerian accent] Get up.
You've embarrassed yourself

983
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,570
and disrespected the game.

984
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:54,282
You are lucky
I don't take you outside and thrash you.

985
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,619
[Tina in French accent] What are these?

986
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,121
[uptempo music playing]

987
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,581
He was cheating the whole time.

988
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,668
99%.

989
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,378
Dimitri does not cheat.

990
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:08,588
Dimitri Malakhov,

991
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:13,010
you have sullied
the integrity of our game and my home.

992
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,554
You will now, like Rasputin,

993
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:19,891
suffer the ultimate punishment
for your indiscretion. Guards!

994
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:25,772
[speaking Russian]

995
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,734
[in English] 100%.
You have all of Cain's data on your phone.

996
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:31,069
All losses are hereby refunded.

997
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,780
The money will be wired
into your accounts.

998
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,450
You all have my deepest apologies.

999
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,876
[in regular accent] After we get
our phones, should we try to follow Boro?

1000
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:49,337
Remember the last time
you tried to follow Stan Lee at Comic-Con?

1001
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,631
I won't be able to bail you out this time.

1002
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,675
He'll just go to his plane and fly off.

1003
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,138
We came for the data. We got the data.
Let's go.

1004
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,807
How'd you know about the poison?

1005
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,559
'70s movies, remember?

1006
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,519
A lot of James Bond.

1007
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:07,939
-How'd you get the aces up his sleeve?
-Five summers of magic camp.

1008
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,816
[both laughing]

1009
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,618
OTS is still cracking Cain's phone data.

1010
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,912
We'll have something
on Boro's location soon.

1011
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:24,998
Can't believe how close we were to him.

1012
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,291
We're gonna get him.

1013
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,293
It's just a matter of time.

1014
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,754
We gave 10% of the buy-in
to the Biryukovs.

1015
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:34,674
They believe you're foreign affiliates
of the Russian mob, so they'll be quiet.

1016
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,302
They were pretty upset.

1017
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:40,931
Something about a missing pet lizard.
Know anything about that?

1018
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,391
Yeah, I think maybe you do.

1019
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:49,856
Got a call from Customs
thanking you for some info you fed 'em.

1020
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,442
Took 'em to this fella
in a container of gym equipment

1021
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,527
shipped into Brooklyn.

1022
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,363
The owners of the company,
Twinning Formula,

1023
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:59,157
were indicted
for smuggling endangered wildlife.

1024
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,325
Assets frozen,

1025
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,619
business license pulled, computers seized.

1026
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:06,414
I got some intel from some sources,
then passed it on.

1027
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,709
-Are you telling me everything?
-Everything you want to know.

1028
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,965
Is that fruit cocktail?
That stuff isn't healthy.

1029
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,383
[chuckles] You're telling me.

1030
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,261
Neither is a team that hates each other.

1031
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,680
-What happened in that bunker?
-Don't worry.

1032
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,598
My team will take down Boro.

1033
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,144
The Russians are making overtures to Boro.

1034
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,603
All I do is worry.

1035
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,734
[light instrumental music playing]

1036
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,035
[sighs]

1037
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:45,745
Dad, I'm sorry--

1038
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:53,503
[Barry] Tina, there's something
I need to tell you.

1039
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,755
A secret I've been keeping.

1040
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,174
That you're a nerd?

1041
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,759
You went to magic camp.

1042
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:02,012
Your accent was from a comic book movie,

1043
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:06,349
and you have a T-shirt of one of
my favorite French-Canadian superheroes.

1044
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,227
You know Matter-Homme?

1045
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,353
[speaking French]

1046
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,148
[both laughing]

1047
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:16,359
[in English] Yeah, but…

1048
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,865
that is just scratching the surface.

1049
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,868
[rhythmic music playing]

1050
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:31,875
[music ends]

1051
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:40,675
[chuckles]

1052
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:48,058
[knocking at door]

1053
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:52,520
Dad.

1054
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,272
Come in.

1055
00:53:58,777 --> 00:53:59,694
What's up?

1056
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:01,488
I brought you something.

1057
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,156
A check?

1058
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:04,783
[scoffs] What for?

1059
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,243
MyAisles.

1060
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,580
I used it the other day,
and it was really helpful,

1061
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,375
so I want to invest in it.

1062
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,168
[gasps] Wow.

1063
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:18,255
This is a lot of money. I… [chuckles]

1064
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,589
I don't know what to say.

1065
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,676
I promise you
a great return on your investment.

1066
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:26,680
Oh, I don't care about the return
or the investment in MyAisles.

1067
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:28,723
I'm investing in you.

1068
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,308
[soft piano music playing]

1069
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:36,398
You said something the other day
that really bothered me.

1070
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,692
Emma is the daughter I always wanted,

1071
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,486
and you're the son I always hoped for.

1072
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,072
I'm proud of you.

1073
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:47,158
Now maybe
I'm not mentioning it often enough,

1074
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,953
so if you're frustrated
or angry about anything,

1075
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:52,247
just come and talk to me.

1076
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,543
But don't bottle it all up
and then one day just explode at me.

1077
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,838
Um… sure, Dad. Yeah.

1078
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,465
[Oscar inhales sharply]

1079
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:07,304
[sentimental music playing]

1080
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:17,397
[door opens]

1081
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,026
[Roo] Hey, old man.

1082
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:24,070
Rumor has it
you're sitting on some Yankee tickets.

1083
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:26,406
You're short a kid tonight,

1084
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,867
and I've been short a dad my whole life,

1085
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,828
so… what do you say we catch a game?

1086
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,624
-Let's do it.
-All right. Come on.

1087
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,084
[Luke] What a surprise.

1088
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,377
[both laughing]

1089
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,171
Mm.

1090
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,007
You know, if you were my daughter,

1091
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:47,385
I would call you
more than once every five years.

1092
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:49,846
-Sack tap.
-[groans] Ow.

1093
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:52,182
[Roo] That's what you get
for being sentimental.

1094
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:54,351
Let's go. You're buying the beer.

1095
00:55:54,434 --> 00:55:55,977
[closing theme playing]

1096
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,597
