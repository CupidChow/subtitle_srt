Cease fire, you goddamn morons!

00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,603
You're shooting at $3 billion!

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,773
Somebody's piloting that thing
from mission control.

Well, move your asses, take 'em down!

8
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,697
Shit. Hey, Luke, Emma, there's a squad
of space mates headed our way.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,782
Very armed and very angry.

10
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:33,700
On it.

Hang on, Barry.
Your ride is about to get a lot smoother.

Leaving the atmosphere
in a matter of seconds.

15
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:48,673
I don't wanna leave the atmosphere!
I like the atmosphere!

16
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:51,259
I've spent my whole life
in the atmosphere!

17
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,554
Oh sweet. Here comes the big guy.

[Olmstead] I got off the horn

00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,278
about some AWOL officers under his charge.

35
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,988
He is 12 shades of pissed,

36
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,366
and he is, through me,
giving you an order.

37
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,077
Unless you all want new careers
making license plates,

38
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,079
you will stand down now!

[Luke] No.

41
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,584
Dad, we're going to prison.

42
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:10,880
Look, once we stop Greta, there's no one
that's gonna file charges against us.

43
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,298
What if this goes sideways,

44
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,509
and they think we sent a satellite
into the power plant?

45
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,052
Well, maybe it was a bad idea.

46
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,472
I can't believe that Greta
might outsmart us again.

47
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,182
Okay, mute your comms.

48
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,433
[comms rattle]

49
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,769
What's the privacy all about?

50
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,689
-You do wanna stop Greta, right?
-That's a ridiculous question.

51
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:30,066
What's ridiculous is breaking up with Mom
at the same time

52
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,694
that you're trying to assure me
that Greta is good at heart,

53
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,946
and you keep talking about
how brilliant she is.

54
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:37,866
Someone that brilliant could be
manipulating you without you knowing it.

55
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,952
The only one that I think
is getting manipulated here is you

56
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:43,079
because I am not dating Greta.

57
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,499
Okay, I went on a date with Chips
to find you.

58
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,625
Didn't mean anything.

59
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:48,710
Does Chips know that?

60
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,379
I mean,
I've listened to the lie detector test,

61
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,338
and I saw you blush.

62
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,967
-You're insane.
-Look, I know that Chips is handsome.

63
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,468
And he has this accent,

64
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,054
and that's a very, very good
combination to have.

65
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,098
Believe me, I know it firsthand.

66
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,934
Greta has an accent.
Is that enough to do it for you?

67
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,145
Let me guess.
Did Chips open up on your date,

68
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,022
so there's a better understanding,

69
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:12,025
because both of you kind of grew up
with a very famous spy father?

70
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,902
Because that's what I would have done.

71
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,197
Look, sweetheart,
all I'm trying to do is just be helpful.

72
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,616
No, sweetheart, I'm trying to help you.

73
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,659
-[feedback]
-[Olmstead] Surrender,

74
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,329
or we will not hesitate
to use deadly force.

75
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,540
Barry, G.I. Joe is getting pissed.
Where are we with the satellite?

76
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,835
I'm within Bluetooth distance,
but the satellite isn't linking.

00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:33,963
Oh man.

79
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,633
Looks like a bullet penetrated
the external hardware on takeoff.

80
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,885
-What do we do now?
-We need to pivot to plan B.

81
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,221
If you can't connect
with the satellite digitally,

82
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,931
you'll have to connect with it physically.

83
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,557
What? No way you'll bump me
into the satellite

84
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,476
like I'm some kinda
spaceship shuffleboard!

85
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,895
-It'll be more like bumper cars.
-Not better!

86
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:49,896
Strap in, dude.

87
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,190
I need to do some recalculations. Here.

88
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,900
Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.

89
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,610
Oh my.

90
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,904
I don't like plan B. What is plan C?

91
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,656
[Aldon] Barry, you have nothing
to worry about, my friend.

92
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,783
You're in the hands
of the king of Rudy's Pizza.

93
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,743
Brace yourself. [exhales]

94
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,454

[music ends]

98
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:12,335
Nothing happened.

99
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:15,129
-Well, this is broken.
-I thought you had this, Pizza King.

100
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,756
No, the drone won't respond.

101
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,718
It must have anti-collision software
to stop it from smashing into space junk.

102
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:23,638
We need a manual override.
Barry's gonna have to pilot that thing.

103
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,765
Okay, Bar, I got good news for you, pal.

104
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,810
You are about to live your wettest
of dreams and fly a spaceship.

105
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,645
[sighs] What's the bad news?

106
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,313
There is no bad news.

107
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,817
Can you just hang on
while we, uh, pull up the schematics?

108
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,193
[ominous music playing]

109
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,611
There is an assload of bad news.

110
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,863
First of all, that drone wasn't supposed
to go anywhere today.

111
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:44,158
We sent him up there
with barely enough fuel to get back home.

112
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,785
If he misses the satellite,

113
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:50,373
not only will it level the power plant
in a fiery nuclear crap-gasm,

114
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,875
Barry will shoot past it out into space.

115
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:56,671
By the time he tries to pull a U-turn,
his gas tank will be on E.

116
00:04:56,754 --> 00:05:00,633
He'll drift off into the galaxy
until he's frozen and useless forever,

117
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,510
just like my Aunt Karyn's eggs.

118
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,928
[Barry] I can hear you!

119
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,014
I always forget to hit mute.

120
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,517
Uncle Barry, your heart.
You have to stay calm, please.

121
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,852
I'm gonna call Dr. Pfeffer.

122
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,520
[phone ringing]

123
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,938
Oh, seventh floor.

124
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,857
Someone get in touch with Dr. P for Barry.

125
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,025
I got to take this.

126
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,235
-Yeah, what's going on?
-Luke, it's Farkas.

127
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,778
Farkas, you son of a bitch.

128
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,114
Hiding out on the seventh floor
so I take your phone call?

129
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,658
I wouldn't have to do this
if you didn't block me.

130
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,952
I just finished the asset eval of Tina.

131
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,079
There are numerous transfers
going into her account

132
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,540
that may have originated in Moscow.

133
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,959
Look, I don't have time
for your paranoia right now.

134
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,544
I'm in a goddamn tank!

135
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,879
-[line disconnects]
-Uhâ€¦

136
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,714
Oh come on.

137
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,466
[dramatic music playing]

138
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,220
Okay, Barry, are your eyes closed?

139
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,638
Eyes are closed.

140
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,390
Breathing in.

141
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,808
[Barry inhales]

142
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:52,060
[exhaling] Breathing out.

143
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,771
For the last time,
because I don't know if you heard, doc,

144
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,898
but I'm gonna die in space!

145
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,107
No, Barry. Stay with me.

146
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,275
Stay positive.

147
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:01,652
I really don't think
that these breathing exercises

148
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,738
are cutting it for our patient, doc.

149
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:07,158
Thank you for your insight.
And it's not "our" patient.

150
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,576
Get your shit together, mate.

151
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,871
For the last time, the mic is not on.

152
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,998
Let me do my work.

153
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,418
Barry, we're going to do
a simple distraction technique.

154
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,295
Can you recite the alphabet backwards?

155
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:20,838
Barry?

156
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,215
Barry?

157
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,257
Talk to me, Barry.

158
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,717
I'm so tired.

159
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,761
What the hell is going on with Barry?

160
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,514
You know how in life or death situations
there's flight or fight?

161
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,724
-Well, there's actually a third F.
-Fucked.

162
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,059
No, freeze!

163
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:36,562
-[tense music playing]
-Rocket launcher's almost assembled. Dad?

164
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,356
Luke, Barry looks up to you.

165
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,358
-Perhaps you can talk to him.
-[Luke] I'd love to.

166
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,486
But right now,
I have an anti-tank rocket aimed at us.

167
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,199
Please tell me
this tank has a missile jammer.

168
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:51,577
Look, this tank is 40 years old.
Probably just gets used for parades.

169
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,830
Did he just say "anti-tank rocket"?

170
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:54,914
Is that what he just--

171
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,833
'Cause I have experience with that.

172
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:01,587
Come on. I can't just sit here and allow
the love of my life to just blow up.

173
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:07,677
Luke, Emma, you're on open mic with Chips.
He claims he can help.

174
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,097
And while he's doing that,
I will get somebody that can help Barry.

175
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,224
Emma, darling, can you hear me?

176
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,184
Uh, yes.

177
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,187
I need for you to find
the tank's shortwave radio.

178
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,981
You wanna stop a rocket with a radio?

179
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,525
I may have dabbled in the theft
and the black-market resale

180
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,902
of a few anti-tank missiles in my time.

181
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,990
You see, they share a common flaw
in their radio guidance systems,

182
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:32,785
and if you disrupt the signal,
you will divert the missile.

183
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,122
If you die, then I die as well, my love.

184
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,498
Oh for fuck's sake.

185
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:39,667
-Okay.
-No, no, no. Wait a minute.

186
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,879
How do we know he doesn't want
to get us killed and eat that rocket?

187
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,922
You heard the guy. He's in love with me.

188
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:48,759
[Barry] â™ª Twinkle, twinkle â™ª

189
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,180
â™ª Little star â™ª

190
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:57,727
â™ª How'd I wander out so far â™ª

191
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,729
[breath trembling]

192
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,646
[Tina] Barry?

193
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,064
[gentle music playing]

194
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,774
-Tina?
-Yeah.

195
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,985
Just the woman who loves you saying hello.

196
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,946
Dr. Pfeffer told me
you could use a pick-me-up.

197
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,158
No, I could use a put-me-down,
like put me back down on Earth!

198
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,160
[Barry inhales sharply]

199
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,787
I wish I could've seen you
just one last time.

200
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,707
We're going to see each other again
because you can do this.

201
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,501
We can do this together.

202
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:24,045
Okay, co-pilot,
then you better get his head in the game

203
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:26,255
'cause I just shut down
the anti-collision protection,

204
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,466
and I'm sending the coordinates
to the drone now.

205
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,426
If Barry can keep that ship
on the flight path,

206
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,386
he'll knock that satellite
right off course.

207
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,640
Hear that, Barry? I need you to be
the hero that I know you are.

208
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:37,433
I'm with you.

209
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:39,227
I'm right in there with you.

210
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,356
[inspirational music playing]

211
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,651
I got this.

212
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,699
[Emma] Found it! [exhales]

213
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,244
[Chips] Dial all the way down to zero
and bottom out.

214
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,205
Then go anti-clockwise, but slowly.

215
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,416
Between 13.21 and 13.22 kHz.

216
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,001
-On it.
-Good. Now talk me through it.

217
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,461
[Emma] We're at a thousand,

218
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:08,256
1,200, 1,300.

219
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,799
Just a little more, but careful.

220
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:11,425
[Emma] I got it.

221
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,386
Plug it into the PA system. Do it fast.

222
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,387
PA's a go.

223
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,721
Turn it up, full blast.

224
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,266
This is for my car, you son of a bitch.

225
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,726
-Fire!
-[radio whirring]

226
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,687
-[Emma gasps]
-[missile explodes]

227
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:25,690
Goddamn! That's my office!

228
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,942
-Reload!
-[dramatic music playing]

229
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,153
They're reloading.
Okay, do everything exactly the same.

230
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,072
Wait. I can't.

231
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,408
Oh God, the radio's too old.

232
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,867
It fried.

233
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,411
We're sitting ducks.

234
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,829
They're lining up their shot.

235
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:40,955
Ready!

236
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,833
No, no, no, don't fire!

237
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,128
Now the PA system is fried too.

238
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,254
Aim!

239
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,216
-I love you, Dad.
-I love you, Schatzel.

240
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,428
[music builds, ends]

241
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,429
[rock music playing]

242
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:58,931
-[music ends]
-Oh.

243
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:01,767
[megaphone feedback]

244
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:03,769
[Olmstead] Oh,
this is your goddamn lucky day.

245
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:07,189
We just got word that a moving satellite
pinged our monitor.

246
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:10,318
Collision projections show it hitting
the Litchfield Energy Center

247
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,819
in Massachusetts.

248
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,992
I told you.

249
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,537
According to Roo's math,
you should be really close.

250
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,706
We're T-minus two minutes
to engaging thrusters.

251
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,207
You can do this, Uncle B.

252
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,501
Evacuation of the power plant
is in progress.

253
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,211
[computers beeping]

254
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,715
What? In case he shits the bed.

255
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,967
-You suck.
-You really do suck.

256
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,469
[alarm blaring]

257
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,971
Let's go! Keep moving out!

258
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,223
Get away from the building! Let's go!

259
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,900
Oh boy. I got eyes on the satellite.

260
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,153
Great. Remember, you just wanna tap it
and send it off course.

261
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,363
[Luke] You got this, Barry.

262
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,781
Plum is in the pudding.

263
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,157
Barry's on the blitz.

264
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,951
[Roo] Okay, satellite's
about to enter the atmosphere.

265
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:05,873
You want an approach angle
of 37 degrees at two meters per second.

266
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,542
No, Barry, you need to make contact
at 2.2 meters per second.

267
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,127
[Roo] Are you shitting me, Tina?

268
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,338
Barry, I have done the calculations.

269
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,090
It's simple Newtonian physics.

270
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:18,094
If you hit this thing too hard,
it doesn't just get nudged off course,

271
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,804
it breaks up into a million pieces

272
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,473
and nuclear fallout
rains all over the Midwest.

273
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,684
And some of the pieces
stay on their current trajectory

274
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,477
and still hit the power plant.

275
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,480
But if you hit it
at exactly 2.2 meters per second,

276
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,940
everything will be fine.

277
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,608
You've gotta trust me, Barry.

278
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:35,569
If you don't hit it hard enough,
the satellite won't be knocked off course.

279
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:38,155
If he hits it too hard, he'll die.

280
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,657
I wouldn't let that happen, Barry.

281
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:41,909
I'm going with Tina.

282
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:44,620
I'm turning off my targeting computer
and using the force.

283
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,249
Barry, I am gonna force my foot
up your ass.

284
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,709

285
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,423

286
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,049

-One.

290
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,268
[Emma] He pushed the satellite off course.

291
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,854
-What about Barry? What about his plane?
-Barry?

292
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,313
Are you there, buddy?

293
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,858
Barry, please answer me.

I'm alive!

-[Roo] Oh my God!

-[Aldon] Yes! [cheers]
-[triumphant music playing]

299
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,245
-All right!
-[Roo] Man.

300
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,621
Give me some, right here.

301
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,040
You're a bummer.

302

[Roo] Engaging autopilot now.

303
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,087
Okay. We gonna bring you home, buddy.

304
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,173
[Emma] How's it feel
to be a hero, Uncle B?

305
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,341
It just feels good to be in one piece.

306
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,135
[exhales sharply]

307
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,303
[exhales]

308
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,555
You okay, Roo-boo?

309
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:48,058
I just can't shake that my math was wrong.

310
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,393
It's never wrong.

311
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,480
And how did Tina know it was off?

312
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,731

[helicopter blades whirring]

316
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,907
That was really good work today.

317
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,325
You too.

318
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:08,162
Now you don't have to smoke this
just to impress me.

319
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,705
You can toss it if you want.

320
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,168
Thank you.
I mean, it's like Frenching an ashtray.

321
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,336
[Luke laughs]

322
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,172
And sorry about our argument.

323
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:21,300
I think it's good that you challenge me
whenever you think it's necessary.

324
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,844
I mean, I don't have to agree, right?

325
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:24,845

Thank you.

00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,145
You really want that, huh?

330
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,023
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

That's impossible.
I knocked that satellite to Neptune.

Southern Massachusetts, as well as parts
of Connecticut and New Hampshire

widespread blackouts today.

that power will be restored shortly,

00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,113
as nearby plants are in the process
of picking up the load.

347
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,531
How?

when we borrowed the drone.

349
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,994
Greta knew we'd do everything
in our power to stop the satellite.

350
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:33,122
And that the power plant would be
evacuated out of an abundance of caution,

351
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,333
so she took advantage, got inside,
and planted explosives.

352
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,419
But she only got one point
of vulnerability.

353
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:42,047
She still needs three to overload
the power and to wipe out the grid.

354
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,175
When she makes her move, we will be ready.

Ah.

358
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,486
Perfect timing.

359
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,571
It's taken me ages,

360
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:10,576
but I have just built an exact replica
of Buckingham Palace.

361
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:15,080
-It's perfect.
-Okay. I really just came by to--

362
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,540
Warn me not to escape?

363
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,419
No need. Deadly thigh cuff is here

364
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,421
and has delivered the message
loud and clear.

365
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,966
Well, at least you're not handcuffed
with a gun pointed at your face.

366
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,219
Consider that a thank you
for saving my life.

367
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,763
Mm-hmm. And?

368
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,140
-And my dad's.
-It wouldn't be the first time, would it?

369
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,852
If you're keeping track, which I am.
I'm keeping track. Let's see.

[inhales sharply]

371
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,272
I saved your dear old dad from Greta,

372
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:44,234
and I kept both of you
from blowing to bits in that tank,

373
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:45,152
didn't I?

374
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,946
You've been helpful at times.
I'll give you that.

375
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,364
What choice do I have?

376
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,199
It wouldn't be a very romantic date

377
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,993
if you're a mist
of blood and brain matter.

378
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,495
It might be an improvement.

379
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:57,289
You know, you may not
currently have feelings for me,

380
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,335
but I will prove to you, Emma Brunner,
that I am a decent man.

381
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,213
Yes, I've been confused for a while now,

angry over my father's death,

383
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,842
and maybe I have some issues.

384

But come on, who doesn't?

385
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:14,431
But I'd never let you get hurt though,
not as long as I can help it.

You realize most of today
was caused by things you set in motion?

You didn't let me finish. Startingâ€¦ now,

when there's a smile as bright as this
within its borders.

My God, you're cheesy.

After all this do-gooding and life-saving,

00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,755
I think I've earned a nice drink

-I don't know.
-Come on.

The longer we stall, the more likely it is
that Donnie's gonna finish all the liquor.

-Okay, I'll grab a couple of whiskeys.
-Yes.

I'll just be here
getting drunk off your beauty.

Oh, be careful at the back wall.

406
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,565
You're out of range of the remote.
I wouldn't want you to explode.

You there?

Are you calling to gloat?

413
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,627
Because it's been a long day, Greta.

414
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:30,049
Yes, we do have a habit
of tiring each other out.

415
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:32,259
Remember Vienna?

416
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,720
Yeah, of course. How can I forget?

417
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,181
-That's where you stole my blueprints.
-[floor creaking]

And I spent all night

419
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,186
making it up to you.

420
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,480
You admitted it in Estonia.

421
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,356
We were in love.

422
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,152
I said that because I was under
the influence of a truth serum.

423
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,864
Emphasis on the word "truth."

424
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,367
Let's not lose more decades
as you lie to yourself.

425

If you still have feelings for me,

426
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,330
just say so.

427
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,999
I don't hear a denial.

428
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,505
We're a perfect match, Luke.

429
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,091

I love how we're always
out-thinking each other.

433
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,560
When I heard

434
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:27,940
that you were going to upend
my satellite with that drone,

435

I wasâ€¦ I just was so impressed.

436
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,820
How did you know

437
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,322
about the satellite's increased mass?

438
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,908
Do the Russians know you're onto them?

439
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,952
I don't know what you're talking about.

440

Mmm. Don't be coy.

441
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,915
The spy equipment
that the Russians put on the satellite

442
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:47,000
added a little bit more weight to it.

443
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,129
You had to factor that in to calculate

444
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,214
how to knock it off course.

445
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:56,760
I love how you pulled that off.

It just got my heart pounding.

447
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,309
I had one of my team members do the math.

448

Well, they must be well-connected.

449
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:11,900

a Luke Brunner team would perform so well.

[music fades]

462
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:50,314
So Tina knew about
the Russian spyware on the satellite

463
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,107
'cause she's a double agent?

464
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,066
Apparently so.

465
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:54,610
But she's such a magoo.

We're running checks
on our other seven DSCS satellites

467

since our best drone
was just recently damaged.

469
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,412
Okay, so Tina, what do we know?

470
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:10,375
Well, we assume she was brought to the NSA
probably to monitor how we gather intel,

but her transfer to the CIA
for the Boro matter

Thankfully, you found her now
and not in five years.

-Mm-hmm.
-Are we really about toâ€¦ mix universes?

Oh, we're about to mix everything.

minimum.

556
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,937
Now, if you cooperate,
the government could reduce the time.

557
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,398
Or I can reduce
the number of teeth in your mouth.

558
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:48,945
Look, the CIA
is combing through your office

559
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,947
and through your apartment right now
as we speak.

560
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,950
So the question is, what will we find?

561
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,286
What have you sent to the Russians?

562
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,747
You better answer me

563
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,834
because very soon you're gonna get
a lawyer that will tell you to stay quiet.

564
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,002
And trust me,

565
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,922
that is the worst thing you can do

566
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,675
because then it becomes adversarial
instead of cooperative.

567
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,762
So understand
that this might be the last time

568
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,472

Oh, I can make sure of that.

00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:30,904
You should be ashamed of yourself,
of what you did to Barry.

Listen, I knew you'd be a real bummer,

586
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:06,898
so I decided to get you a comic,
'cause you're nerdy.

587
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,483
Yeah, that looks pretty fun.

588
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,570
I got a Playboy for ya
'cause you're horny.

If you're looking to scratch
both of those itches,

I found some adult comics.

These are pretty good.
We got, uh, Penthouse Mouse, huh?

592

That's titties in space. They float.

How you doing, Uncle Barry?

598
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,141
Junior officers and I
turned Tina's office upside down,

599
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,517
and guess what we found?

00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,477
The BlackBerry we picked up in Kolkata.

601
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,647
She had it in some stash space,
but she never gave it to OTS.

602
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,774
What a piece of shit, right? Sorry, Barry.

603
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,485
She obviously wanted to hold onto it,
use it as a bargaining chip

604
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,820
in case she gets caught,

605
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,280
charges are filed against her.

Too bad for that shitbag,
we got to it first. Sorry, Barry.

this guy was playing Russian nesting dolls
with a Moscow mole?

609
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,581
He was in the dark about Tina
just like the rest of us.

610
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,792
I don't wanna hear it.
This kind of crap is why HQ is asking me

611
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,419
to take the "interim" off my title.

612
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,088
-What?
-I put Roo up for regional director.

613
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:15,592
I'm fully aware, but this Tina thing
makes you all look very bad.

614
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,553
And our bosses have had it up to here
with your team's bullshit.

615
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,264
They don't want a monkey running the zoo,
and I don't blame them.

-That's not fair. I can do this job.
-The seventh floor isn't so sure.

617
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,562
Speaking of jobs,
as of now, Officer Putt, you're suspended.

618
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,898
-That's horse shit.
-This is not Barry's fault.

619
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:33,068
He was tricked
by a shitty temptress. Sorry, Barry.

620
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,112
The CIA has questions for you
about your relationship with Tina Mukerji.

621
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,406
Legally, you're allowed a lawyer
during questioning.

622
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,575
-Questioning?
-But he did nothing wrong.

623
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:43,453
-Remains to be seen.
-I waive my right to an attorney.

624

-Uncle Barry.
-I have nothing to hide.

625
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,165
-I'm going in with him.
-You a lawyer?

626
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,626
I have a paralegal degree
from Gaston Community College.

627
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,585
Jealous?

628
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,503
Fine.

629
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,755
We start in 20.

00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,423
Oh, before I forget.

00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,176
A cleared video message
from your granddaughter.

632
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,969
I expect protocol to be followed.

633
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,806
-Thanks.
-I'm not a total asshole.

[door creaking]

635
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,770
Hi, May-me, PeePaw,
Aunt Em, and Uncle Barry. It's me.

636
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,147
Dad said I could show you
my birthday dress.

637
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,440
See? Flowers.

638
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,901
I really wish you could come
to my birthday party.

639
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,736
I'm going to get pizza shoved in my face.

640
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,155
I love you. I miss you.

641
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,573
I miss you too, baby. [sniffles]

642
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:22,492
It's okay.
You're gonna see her again very soon.

643
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,618
[softly] Yeah.

644
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,911
She's gotten so big.

645
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,288
[Emma] What matters is she's safe, Mom.

646
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,331
Yes.

647
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:31,626
-What are you doing?
-It's protocol.

648
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,130
That video was the only contact I've had
with my granddaughter in months.

649
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,215
We could have at least watched it again.

650
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:40,927
I know we all want to watch it again,
but, I mean, I promised it to the CIA.

651
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,346
Oh, and God forbid
the CIA ever comes second.

652
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,683
The same organization
keeping our family apart

653
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,268
and prosecuting Barryâ€¦

654
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:51,438
[spluttering] and making me cook
for terrorists.

655
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:55,608
That's what's most important to you?

656
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,362
I don't even know who you are anymore.

657
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:02,365
[speaking Italian]

658
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,075
She made me an eggplant Parmesan.

659
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,536
It was dry.

660
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,247
[alarm ringing]

661
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:12,500
What is that?

662
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:16,171
I don't know. It's been going off
all morning. I think it's a fire alarm.

663
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:20,759
Well, if you know it's a fire alarm,
why didn't you check it out?

664
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,719
Why didn't you
keep your hands off my fiancÃ©e?

665
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,345
[sighs] Come on.

666
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,598
Sometimes, we don't do the things
we're supposed to do.

667
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,767
[alarm continues]

668
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:38,026
[ominous music playing]

669
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,196
[Emma] Looks like a flag on a message
posted on the dark web this morning.

670
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:46,075
$10 million offer for an expedited
retrofit to a particular style of drone.

671
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,621
Barry must've set up an alert for any
big-money offers to black-market traders

672
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:52,874
once we found out that Dante Cress
was funding this whole operation. Smart.

673
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,836
That original offer was pulled.
Must've found someone to do the retrofit.

674
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,924
Big money, fast turnaround,
complicated technology.

675
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,136
-That sounds like Greta.
-[groans]

676
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,889
We got to get in touch
with whoever filled that order

677
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,474
as quickly as possible.

678
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,600
How's your Turkish?

679
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,312
[in Turkish]
Excellent. Stronger than their coffee.

680
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,773
[in English] Okay, get in touch
with the US Embassy in Turkey.

681
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,983
Do whatever you can
to get the Great Dane on the phone.

682
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,778
Even if he's in solitary confinement,
I don't care.

683
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,571
We got to get in touch with him

684
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:26,282
because he would know
which one of his competitors

685
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:30,870
will fulfill a strange order
of a retrofitted drone that quickly.

686
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,205
[Aldon] Copy that.

687
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:33,832
[music ends]

688
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,960
Officer Putt,
these are Officers Martinez and Yang.

689
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,628
They're counterintelligence,

690
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,964
but you need to think of them
as your mother.

691
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,800
They'll wanna know where you were,
who you were with, what you were doing.

692
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,885
If they don't like your answers,
you'll be grounded.

693
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,805
-For life.
-[door opens]

694
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:51,349
Sorry I'm late.

695
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,434
This is a closed-door meeting, Pfeffer.

696
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,271
Then it's a good thing
I got in before the door closed.

697
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,856
And it's "Dr. Pfeffer."

698
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,566
I've been treating Officer Putt
for months,

699
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,443
which makes me responsible
for his mental health and well-being

700
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,071
while he is in hiding
due to the Boro incident,

701
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:08,157
a task designated to me by the CIA.

702
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,993
Your presence isn't needed here.

703
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:14,163
That is a medical determination
you're not qualified to make, sir.

704
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,749
But if my presence is an issue,
feel free to call Langley

705
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:19,586
and explain you want to contradict
their direct orders.

706
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:23,715
[Reed grunts]

707
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,134
Let's get started then, shall we?

708
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:35,852
Mr. Putt, tell us about the first time
you met Tina Mukerji.

709
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:40,607
[hesitates] I thought she was
the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen,

710
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,276
and I'd do anything to have her love me.

711
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,611
-Uh, objection.
-To what?

712
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,321
His really stupid answer.

713
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,072
You're not helping yourself.

714
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,074
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

715
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,993
We won't be able to get
the Great Dane on the horn

716
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,412
because he got paroled earlier today.

717
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,247
Ah, scheisse.

718
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:59,500
Wait, that drone wasn't obtained
by one of the Great Dane's competitors.

719
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,668
He fulfilled the order.

720
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,671
And Greta bought his way out of prison
in exchange for it.

721
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,341
I bet he went home to visit his son.

722
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,970
We need a jet. Okay?
And you keep an eye on Chips.

723
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:11,888
[Aldon groans]

724
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,599
Oh man, I love hanging out with the Dane.

725
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,600
[sighs]

726
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,768
[softly] Scheisse.

727
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,646
[doorbell chiming]

728
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,773
â™ª Whistling' and a singing'â€¦ â™ª

729
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:22,690
Dane!

730
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,610
Hi! What a surprise!

731
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:30,490
Come on in. Come on in. This is a little
"celebration of freedom" party. [laughs]

732
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,200
This is gonna be weird.

733
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,994
Come, hang out.

734
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:40,041
This is my beautiful, patient,
forgiving wife, Gertrude.

735
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,501
-Hello.
-Hello.

736
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:45,213
-Can I get you anything to drink?
-Water, thanks.

737
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,465
Yeah, water will be fine, thank you.

738
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,258
Thank you, Gertie.

739
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,762
-Don't you guys have a toddler?
-Yeah, Gunther.

740
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,931
He sleeps through everything.
Can I get you something?

741
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:57,600
-I got Bagel Bites, I got Pop-Tartsâ€¦
-What are you, 12?

742
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:01,312
No, I couldn't smuggle all of the foods
I loved when I was in prison,

743
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,064
so when I got out, I got all my favorites.

744
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,525
I gotâ€¦ I got Fudge Stripes, Dunkaroos.

745
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,193
I got some Cherry Cheese Pop'ems,

746
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,404
which is a weird thing
to have cherry and cheese,

747
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:12,532
but when you pop them,
you'll understand. [laughs]

748
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,741
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

749
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,411
I'll let you three talk.

750
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,413
Thank you, Gertie.

751
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,748
I'm sorry about that.

752
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,208
That was very tense.

753
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:27,880
The mismatched napkins?
That's a Canadian "fuck you."

754
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,258
Gertrude does not appreciate
my line of work,

755
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,886
and she does not appreciate me
talking about my line of work,

756
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,347
and you two reek of spy.

757
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,682
Well, she should be concerned

758
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,934
because we're not here
to celebrate your release.

759
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,352
We're here to talk business.

760
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,439
We need to know about a job
you recently did for Greta Nelso.

761
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,566
It involves a piece of equipment
that she's gonna use

762
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,777
to kill the US power grid,
and countless people as a result.

763
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:53,865
I did not know about that last part.
I'm notâ€¦ I'm not that type of guy.

764
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:57,035
Well, yeah, that's why we're here
talking to you, not kicking your ass.

765
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,620
All I did was hook her up with someone
that could retrofit a drone

766
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,080
to withstand high pressure.

767
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,999
-That's all.
-High pressure?

768
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,710
She's not gonna use the drone
to attack from above again.

769
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,963
She's gonna attack the next power plant
from under the water.

770
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,299
It has to be
the Kodiak Island nuclear facility,

771
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:13,217
the one that's in the Gulf of Alaska.

772
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,304
It's the only one of the four points
of vulnerability that makes sense.

773
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,057
Okay, look, Kodiak Island
sends all its nuclear power

774
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,350
through 1,500 miles of underwater cable

775
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,686
to something called
a coastal load center in Seattle,

776
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,898
which then distributes the power
across the Pacific Northwest.

777
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:30,568
Wow, everything is so exciting
with you guys.

778
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,155
Do you ever have, like, just a boring day?

779
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,409
[phone ringing]

780
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,496
Security, Lambert speaking.

781
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,664
[Luke] Yeah,
Officer Luke Brunner from the CIA.

782
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,917
Your facility is in great danger.

783
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,960
Is there anything unusual going on
over there?

784
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,045
No.

785
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:52,632
Look, uh, CIA and DOE alerted us
to the possibility of an attack

786
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:53,549
a few days ago,

787
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,926
but, uh, nothing's come up.

788
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,595
FDF's stationed outside around the clock.

789
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:01,140
So nothing inside,
equipment, computer system?

790
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,017
Because the attack could come
from anywhere.

791
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,477
We're fully operational.

792
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,772
We also complete a daily diagnostic check
every day at 2 p.m.

793
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:09,649
It scans our systems for malware

794
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:12,652
and updates with any security patches
to prevent hacks.

795
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,445
I'll keep my eye out, but I assure you,

796
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,281
as a nuclear facility,
we take every precaution we can.

797
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,158
Very good. Thank you very much.

798
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,286
Well, the Kodiak Island
hasn't been attacked yet,

799
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,456
so we have a chance
to stop Greta before she strikes.

800
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,833
[Emma] So I've been researching.

801
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,793
Underwater cables are usually buried,

802
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:32,046
but Greta didn't have the Great Dane
source any excavation equipment,

803
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,758
so I'm betting she's targeting the cable
somewhere where it isn't buried.

804
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,511
There is a 100-meter stretch
near the Gutierrez Trench

805
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,596
that's apparently all firm bedrock.

806
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,724
They must've just run the cables over it
to avoid the cost of blasting.

807
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,184
That has to be where she's going.

808
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:47,228
[phone vibrating, beeps]

809
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:48,521
-Yes?
-[Luke] Hey, it's Brunner.

810
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:51,941
I need you to send the Navy
and the Coast Guard to the Gulf of Alaska.

811
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:55,153
If we can act fast,
we may even catch Greta in the act.

812
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,488
The Gulf of Alaska
is almost 600,000 square miles.

813
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,906
I'll need something more specific.

814
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,617
Well, then send the ships
to the Gutierrez Trench

815
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,245
with a submersible
that goes all the way down to the bottom.

816
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:08,166
We have reasons to believe that
that is where Greta will strike.

817
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,625
I'll see what I can do.

818
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:10,751
[line disconnects]

819
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,671
He has to make phone calls.

820
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,717
You know what? While we wait,
you guys wanna see something awesome?

821
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,219
You ever seen anything so beautiful?

822
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,429
[Luke chuckles softly]

823
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:25,224
I used to dream I was sleeping next to him
when I was in prison.

824
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,852
Now I can see him
whenever I want. [laughs]

825
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,521
Sometimes, I'll just sneak in here
and hold his little hand

826
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,772
and just stare at him.

827
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,232
Is that weird?

828
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,234
-No.
-Kinda.

829
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:39,030
[sighs] It's such a precious time
when they're that little.

830
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,323
[gentle music playing]

831
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,200
And then they grow up so fast.

832
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:46,204
Then all of a sudden, one day you wish,

833
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,707
and you would do anything
to have them be little again.

834
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:55,546
Guys, if this kid wakes up and sees us
standing here, he's gonna shit.

835
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,756
-Yeah, let's go.
-Okay.

836
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,217
[phone ringing, vibrating]

837
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,427
-Oh.
-[phone beeps]

838
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,387
-Yep.
-[Reed] It's a no-go.

839
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:04,889
Things are tense with the Russians,

840
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,767
and having the Navy or the Coast Guard
mobilize off the coast of Alaska

841
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,851
will rattle some nerves.

842
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,938
They cannot risk a provocative action
unless there's proof

843
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,231
Kodiak Island is in trouble.

844
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:16,692
What are you talking about, "proof"?
Can only have proof after her attack.

845
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,403
-Then it's too late.
-Well, there's nothing I can do.

846
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,030
I am a regional CIA director.

847
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,657
-I am not the president.
-[phone beeps]

848
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:26,953
I can't believe this.

849
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:30,081
I mean, at first when we were in the tank,
he was not very helpful,

850
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,582
and now he doesn't want to do this.

851
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,959
Are you getting at something?

852
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,044
For someone that says
he wants to stop Greta,

853
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,921
Reed is not very helpful
in stopping Greta.

854
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:40,883
And then he comes out of nowhere
and takes over this director gig

855
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,511
because the guy
that was supposed to replace Dot,

856
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,722
his wife conveniently
gets into a car accident.

857
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:49,100
Are you trying to convince me
that someone within the agency

858
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,559
is working for Dante Cress?

859
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,103
Working for? No.

860
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,479
Is Dante Cress.

861
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,189
Knowing the way Cress operates,

862
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:59,318
it makes total sense that he's actually
part of the intelligence community.

863
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,530
Dad, you have no direct evidence.
It's speculation at best.

864
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:06,158
Shouldn't we just focus on trying
to stop Greta while we still can?

865
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,704
How? I mean, the last time I checked,
we don't have a high-tech submersible

866
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,957
that takes us all the way
to the bottom of the Gulf of Alaska.

867
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,210
No, but we do have

868
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,046
the very best black-market trader
in the world.

869
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,965
No, no, no. Iâ€¦ I just got back.

870
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:24,552
I know you didn't do it on purpose,
but you did help Greta.

871
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,471
You really want that on your conscience?

872
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,308
-[intriguing music playing]
-All right, fine.

873
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,476
I will call my friend James Cameron.

874
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,730
He owes me a favor,
and he's got more subs than a Blimpie.

875
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,481
-You know James Cameron?
-[Great Dane] Yes.

876
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,483
And if he wants me
to keep getting him that fabric

877
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:43,279
for his non-EPA approved
little blue uniforms

878
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:46,282
with the ping-pong balls all over it,
he'll play ball,

879
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:49,952
and there will be a high-tech submersible
in Alaska when we touch down.

880
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,954
My wife is right behind me, right?

881
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,372
[Great Dane inhales sharply]

882
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,751
Look, I have to go, but it won't be
for three years this time, I promise.

883
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,336
We're out of ice.

884
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,338
[music fades]

885
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,842
Sorry you had to see that
and it got so heated.

886
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,803
You're OTS. You're supposed to be good
at this tech stuff.

887
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,306
-It is a BlackBerry. It's not Fort Knox.
-[shredder whirring]

888
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,600
All right? Justâ€¦ just get it done.

889
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,895
All right, thanks. Keep me posted.

890
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,396
[phone beeps]

891
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,570
What's going on in here?

892
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,282
Oh, uh, well, embarrassingly,

893
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:33,120
I had printed copies of TIA
for personal consumption,

894
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:35,915
but, uh, I'm just gonna destroy them.
Better safe than sorry.

895
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,083
Yeah, that's a real shame,

896
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,876
especially after
all that colorectal research

897
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,169
you had to do on my character.

898
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,129
Yeah, this thing is so stupid.

899
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,798
This book is so stupid.

900
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,424
Let meâ€¦ let me help ya.

901
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,926
I wanna feel good about myself,

902
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:50,846
and if that's the case, I have to go
and do something great in the real world

903
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,266
and not just be
a hot, ass-kicking comic-book character.

904
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,810
Well, I hate to break it to you, man,

905
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:58,854
but being hot and ass-kicking in real life
doesn't always get you the girl.

906
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:00,898
[Chips] Well, maybe not for you, chaps.

907
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:08,155
-What the hell is that supposed to mean?
-It means that Emma will be mine.

908
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:12,535
And then you'll be stuck with your doodles
and you with your swine.

909
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,536
[snorts]

910
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:17,039
Carter and I might not end up with Emma,
but it won't be because you're with her.

911
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,375
Yeah, it's 'cause she likes
good people like me

912
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,461
and not bad people like you.

913
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,838
[Chips] Haven't you heard?

914
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,131
I've turned over a new leaf.

915
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,591
You can sell Emma whatever you want,
but I'm not buying it.

916
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,676
Yeah, me neither.

917
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,220
Why don't you let me prove to you
what a good guy I am?

918
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,138
Go on.

919
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:35,349
About half an hour ago, Mrs. Brunner
left the house with a wrapped present.

920
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,267
-What?
-What?

921
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,103
Yep. I tried to stop her,
but I'm all tied up.

922
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:42,148
I called out to you. You were out back
on your phone, as you are now,

923
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,817
and Carter, you were with that shredder,
so you couldn't hear me.

924
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,694
Lots of people have been
sneaking out of here

925
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,530
for a place that's got five CIA agents.

926
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,074
I'm just saying.

927
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,367
She's not answering.

928
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,619
She probably took out her SIM card
so we can't track her.

929
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:56,787
She had a present.

930
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:01,375
She's gone to celebrate Romi's birthday
at Penny Possum's Pizza Place,

931
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,003
where they shove pizza in your face.

932
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:07,298
On the video, Romi was saying,
"They're about to shove pizza in my face."

933
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,925
That's the slogan
of Penny Possum's Pizza Place.

934
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,553
When you're a kindergarten teacher,
you learn the birthday hotspots.

935
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,388
-I'm gonna go get Tally.
-I'll go with you.

936
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,265
-Nope.
-She won't wanna leave.

937
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:17,558
Okay, what are you gonna do?

938
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:21,770
Are you gonna physically manhandle
Luke Brunner's ex-wife into a car?

939
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:26,525
What would your boss think of that?
Listen, I've known her for years.

940
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,736
I'm sure I could convince her to leave.

941
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,488
Shit. Okay, fine.

942
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:34,450
You know, I'm up for a lad's night out.
You know, change of scenery would be nice.

943
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,868
You're not going anywhere.

944
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,661
Well, actually, you know,

945
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:41,665
do we really wanna leave him
with the post-invasion Saddam Hussein?

946
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,667
Fine.

947
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:48,506
But if you try anything, you're losing
a leg along with 90% of your blood.

948
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,423
Okay.

949
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,383
Ah!

950
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,301
Lovely.

951
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,969
-Okay, Hamsteak.
-Don't touch my pig.

952
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,471
[Chips exhales]

953
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,516
Hey, Donnie, would you look after
Hamsteak, please?

954
00:41:59,016 --> 00:41:59,850
Yeah.

955
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,519
What's a Hamsteak?

956
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,229
-[Hamsteak snorts]
-It's my pig.

957
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,814
[softly] You guys see that pig too?

958
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:08,067
Okay, Hamsteak's coming with. Let's go.

959
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,693
Let's roll.

960
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,905
Maybe bring back a pizza.

961
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:13,864
[door closes]

962
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:18,786
Okay, Mr. Putt, can you please explain
the meaning of this text

963
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,913
that you sent several months ago?

964
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,666
"Sorry for the issues last night."

965
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:27,795
"My staff wasn't operating
at full capacity after all the mead."

966
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,216
Who is the staff that you mention?

967
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,469
Who did you have
working under you and Tina?

968
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,763
-Well--
-You know what? I'm gonnaâ€¦

969
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:38,973
I'm gonna take this one.

970
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:42,518
So he wanted Tina working under him,

971
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:46,230
but the staff, AKA his donger,
wasn't up to the task

972
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,566
because he had
one too many tankards of mead

973
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:51,360
at the nerd-tastic Renaissance Faire.

974
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,321
Oh.

975
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,115
I see. Yeah.

976
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,617
My patient has a heart condition,

977
00:42:58,701 --> 00:43:01,912
so perhaps a short break so we can get
a glass of water and a beta blocker.

978
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,038
I don't want it.

979
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,290
-You sure?
-You should get it.

980
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:05,457
I'm fine with dying.

981
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,585
Oh my God.

982
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,211
[dramatic sting]

983
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,466
-How deep is this trench?
-About 3,000 feet.

984
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,302
We should be hitting the bottom anyâ€¦

985
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,511
-[clanging]
-[Great Dane] Oh!

986
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,096
â€¦uh, second now.

987
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:23,392
Okay, there's the cable.
Lifting up a bit, moving forward.

988
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,477
Keep your eyes peeled for anything off.

989
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,729
There. Right there.

990
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,565
All right, let's just get a little closer
and take a look.

991
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,361
What is that?

992
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,948
Someone cut open the cable
and put some kind of a device on it.

993
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:41,785
Well, this has to be Greta.
But hold on, this doesn't make any sense.

994
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,495
According to the schematics,

995
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:46,957
that device isn't attached to the cable
carrying the nuclear power from the plant.

996
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,252
It's attached to the fiber optic
telecommunications cable.

997
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,379
Oh my God, is it a bomb?
It looks like a bomb.

998
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,131
No, no, if you want to blow the power,

999
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:56,717
then you would put a bomb
on the power line.

1000
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,554
And if you wanna screw with the data,
you put something on the telecom line.

1001
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,556
What the hell is Greta up to?

1002
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,142
It has to be
some kind of a computer virus.

1003
00:44:05,225 --> 00:44:06,602
Something like the Stuxnet.

1004
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:09,730
Mm-hmm. And what's that
for the non-CIA super geniuses?

1005
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:13,484
Stuxnet was a virus
targeted at Iran's nuclear facilities.

1006
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,819
It made the centrifuges
all spin out of control.

1007
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:19,406
I mean, a virus like that would be
disastrous to the Kodiak Island plant.

1008
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,033
It'd definitely force it to shut down.

1009
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:23,118
But if Greta has already
sent over the virus,

1010
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:25,371
then why did they say
there is nothing wrong

1011
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,998
over there at the plant when we called?

1012
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,500
Because nothing's wrong yet.

1013
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:33,045
Didn't that security guy say they do
daily diagnostic checks and reboots?

1014
00:44:33,128 --> 00:44:33,962
Yes.

1015
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,173
That's when the virus will be activated
in the system.

1016
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,633
It's like an iPhone update,

1017
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:40,260
except Greta's new feature
is gonna cause nuclear meltdown.

1018
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,596
The diagnostic check
is in less than an hour,

1019
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,974
so we have to get to the top
and warn them not to reboot.

1020
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:48,310
Okay, but first we need to get the device
off the cable

1021
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,854
so Greta can't just send the virus
to the plant again.

1022
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,856
The submersible has this robotic arm.

1023
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,274
[Emma exhales, inhales]

1024
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,442
Let me justâ€¦

1025
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:58,612
Whoa.

1026
00:45:06,328 --> 00:45:07,454
[Emma sighs]

1027
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,998
It's like the most high-stakes game
of Operation ever.

1028
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:11,333
[Great Dane chuckles]

1029
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,835
[robotic arm whirring]

1030
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,046
A little bit more to the right.

1031
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,591
Shit. You know what? Yeah. Be my guest.

1032
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,177
Okay.

1033
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:23,929
-Now see?
-[robotic arms whirring]

1034
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:29,184
Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.

1035
00:45:29,685 --> 00:45:33,647
I just have to get this off
without touching the power cable.

1036
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,693
[alarm rings]

1037
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:43,115
-[Emma] Is there a problem, Dad?
-[Luke] Oh shit.

1038
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,242
[Tally] Hey, princess.

1039
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,412
I know May-me's not supposed to be here,

1040
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,914
but I just missed you so much.

1041
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,751
-[vehicle approaching]
-[tires squealing]

1042
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,335
No.

1043
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,503
-No.
-[Aldon] Hey, Tally--

1044
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,213
-We're just here to talk.
-Wait, Mrs. B.

1045
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,131
-Wait.
-[Tally] No.

1046
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:02,176
I was gonna drop off the gift before
they got here, but they came in early.

1047
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:06,472
Look, I don't wanna scare Romi,
but now I just have to see her, please.

1048
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:09,475
I know, but you can't be out of the house.
It's dangerous for any of us.

1049
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:10,601
[Tally] This is ridiculous!

1050
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,812
-[engine revving]
-[tires squealing]

1051
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,608
-Come on. Please, let me go.
-Uh, gents?

1052
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:19,109
Gents?

1053
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,820
-Dropping off a gift won't hurt anybody.
-Gents?

1054
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:22,946
[tense music playing]

1055
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:28,160
I hope I'm just seeing things again here.

1056
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,245
[Aldon] Shit.

1057
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,123
It's the goddamn Swedish mafia.

1058
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,292
There's a Swedish mafia?

1059
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,377
[closing theme playing]

1060
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,412
[closing theme ends]
