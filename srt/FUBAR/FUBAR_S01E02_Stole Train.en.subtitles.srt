All due respect, Director,
this is a huge mistake.

He doesn't listen to me.
He doesn't respect me as an officer.

But now he's in the wind,

00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:09,082

She really could be

But she's your kid,

82
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:24,681
so that means she also takes stupid risks,
she's hot-headed, thick-headed,

to getting the nuke out of there.

179
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:56,244
And what if he's a creep
that wants to harm Tally?

180
00:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,039
Okay, let's KGB him.

181
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,585
Hey, Oscar. What's up, kid?

182
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,504
Why is my son calling this schmuck?

183
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,506
I am 100% serious.

184
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:11,467
I think MyAisles is a fantastic idea,

185
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,221
and I just hope my investment
will help you get it off the ground, pal.

186
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:17,932
He's investing in my son's stupid app?

187
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,017
I mean,
this guy is dumber than I thought he is.

188
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,104
He's not dumb.
He's scoring brownie points from Mrs. B.

189
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,023
-He's trying to cuckold me.
-That's definitely not what I was saying.

190
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,192
Well, he's trying to use my son
to cuckold me.

191
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,819
I don't think it means what you think.

192
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,112
It comes from the cuckoo bird.

193
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,531
When one bird takes over
another bird's family.

194
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,742
There are a thousand online videos
that would definitely disagree with you.

195
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,370
Okay. See you at family dinner tonight.

196
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,330
I wasn't even invited to the dinner.

197
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,832
I mean, he's trying to replace me.

198
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,293
He's cuckolding the entire family.

199
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,336
Please stop saying that.

200
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,963
[phone chimes]

201
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,926
Meeting has been moved up.
We have to go to HQ. Let's go.

202
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,846
We're dropping these
at Donnie's mailbox on the way.

203
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,223
[in German] Goody two-shoes.

204
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,725
-[in English] What?
-Nothing.

205
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,982
So the doctor said,
yeah, got full range of motion

206
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,026
and probably shouldn't even scar.

207
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,944
[Carter] That's great.
I'm glad you're okay.

208
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,362
Here's my question.

209
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:16,407
How the heck did a donkey kick that high?

210
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,325
It's…

211
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:19,827
-I don't know. Hell of a kick though.
-Mm.

212
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,662
-Giants should sign him.
-[chuckles]

213
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,416
Well, listen, I've got the perfect
R & R day set for you.

214
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,877
This kid here made my mother's gazpacho,

215
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:32,381
and I also just downloaded
some very, very rare Lee Fields tracks

216
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,675
that were recorded out in a church.

217
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,760
That sounds amazing.

218
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,262
-Agreed.
-That's… so fun.

219
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:41,182
-Um, I had an idea.
-Lay it on me.

220
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,226
Okay. So I heard about this escape room

221
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,063
where they hook up
small battery packs to you,

222
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,358
and if you don't get out in time,
they send you a little shock.

223
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,193
But it doesn't hurt. It just--

224
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,278
I don't know,
It just makes it so much more…

225
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:55,237
Terrifying.

226
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,033
I don't know if that seems like
an "us" activity, maybe.

227
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:03,829
Um, but speaking of us,
I'm teaching my kids about Rube Goldberg,

228
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:07,750
and I enlisted their aid,
got them to help me build…

229
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:08,668
Oh!

230
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,129
…something for us.

231
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,091
-Ta-da.
-[laughs] This is amazing.

232
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,593
Crazy, eh? So here, um,

233
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,429
put the marble in the funnel.

234
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,347
[Emma chuckles]

235
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,767
In-- In here? Okay. [chuckles]

236
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:26,977
[Emma gasps]

237
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,897
[Carter] Yeah.

238
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,692
-Yeah, yes. And…
-[laughing]

239
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,071
-[bell dings]
-Yeah!

240
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:38,864
-Yeah!
-I love it.

241
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,491
I love you.

242
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:44,286
Your father.

243
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,499
-Not what I'm thinking about right now.
-No, I just saw your father.

244
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,000
[phone chimes, vibrates]

245
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:52,169
Probably just dropping off gym equipment.

246
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,547
It's work. I gotta go.

247
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,258
Okay. Um, what time do you wanna
pick me up tomorrow?

248
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,801
For what?

249
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,219
Antiques Roadshow.

250
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:02,972
Oh yeah. No, I'm sorry, um,

251
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,765
I lost track of days.

252
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:07,852
Um, tomorrow.
Can we talk about it tonight?

253
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,479
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay. Okay.

254
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,232
-It'll be so great. I'm really excited.
-Yeah, same.

255
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,275
-All right.
-Love you.

256
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,735
All right, bye-bye. See ya.

257
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,573
All that work
for just that… three seconds.

258
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,032
[suspenseful music playing]

259
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,288
Premium wax.

260
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,000
[scanner beeping]

261
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,878
[upbeat dramatic music playing]

262
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:37,173
[phone chimes]

263
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,597
[lever disengages]

264
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:57,151
[radio beeps]

265
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:58,903
[woman] Identities authenticated.

266
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,030
Welcome, Officer Luke Brunner.

267
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,990
Welcome, Officer Bartholomew Putt.

268
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,867
You are currently 0.4 miles

269
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,037
from the CIA regional office
subterranean entrance.

270
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:13,042
Hey, what were you two doing
in Donatello's neighborhood?

271
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,503
-Well, good morning to you too.
-Answer the question.

272
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,297
Keeping up our cover,
delivering gym equipment.

273
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,465
In your car?

274
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,675
Why? It was just a box
of resistance bands.

275
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,927
I don't need a truck for that.

276
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,888
Is that true, Uncle Barry?

277
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,140
It's absolutely true.

278
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:40,528
You don't need a truck
to deliver a box of resistance bands.

279
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:44,532
-How about that? Oh.
-Oh, the pugilists have entered the ring.

280
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,786
This is my seat.

281
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,037
Since when?

282
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,498
Since every briefing
I've ever had in this room.

283
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:53,791
Well, me too.

284
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,377
Take Your Daughter to Work Day
is going well.

285
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:58,963
[Luke groans]

286
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,675
[Dot] Sit. Everyone.

287
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,803
Now.

288
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:15,938
Oh, did Luke Brunner just back down?

289
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,357
I don't think I like this young lady.

290
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,236
After you took the nuclear device
from Lape Pa Lanmo,

291
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,904
they scattered like roaches.

292
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,324
We tracked Boro's seaplane
taking off from Port Georgetown,

293
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:30,536
but we lost him when he flew into a storm
west of Puerto Rico.

294
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,788
So Boro sleeps with the fishes.

295
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,582
-No.
-That's what he wants us to think.

296
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,292
He figured we'd track his plane.

297
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:39,503
-He intentionally flies into a storm.
-[Emma] Then turns his transponder off.

298
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,171
[Luke] So that we'd believe he crashed.

299
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,507
Knowing we'd know an airplane that small

300
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,302
wouldn't leave a debris field big enough
for us to find him.

301
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:50,389
Like the CIA, Boro hires the best pilots.
He's still alive.

302
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,849
We think so too.

303
00:14:56,186 --> 00:15:02,818
Based on the average rate of speed
of a single-engine aircraft,

304
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,029
its fuel consumption,

305
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,866
factoring in weather conditions

306
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:13,662
that increase drag
and reduce aeronautic efficiencies,

307
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,998
his first refuel
would have been in this area.

308
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,959
And if he wanted to avoid the storm,
which was moving westerly,

309
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,754
he's headed in this direction here.

310
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,175
It's simple math and a wiener.

311
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,511
[air hissing]

312
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:31,764
[handle clanking]

313
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,808
-You just have to pump it up.
-I am pumping it.

314
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,310
You have to pump it harder.

315
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,312
That's what she said.
That's the name of my porno.

316
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:39,730
That's what I told my doctor.

317
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:42,983
Monet had his watercolors,
you have your double entendres.

318
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,652
-[Emma] Dad, I've got it.
-I can fix it.

319
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,779
-I know what I'm doing.
-Almost there.

320
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:49,073
-[air hissing]
-[Luke sighs]

321
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,118
May we continue?

322
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,455
-Sorry.
-Sorry, Director.

323
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:59,041
We've been working with our allies
in an attempt

324
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,877
to find and free Lape Pa Lanmo's
substantial assets,

325
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,796
to cripple their ability to operate.

326
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,255
We have to do more than that.

327
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,218
It's very clear that Boro's driving need
is to live up to his father's legacy.

328
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,053
He even told me that himself
at the compound.

329
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,304
Wrong.

330
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,723
This is all about ego.
Boro can't lose face.

331
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,351
Can't lose even a drop
of the power he's amassed.

332
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:20,062
Not everything a child does
is about their father.

333
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,691
Well, whatever his motivation,
Boro is moving forward.

334
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,818
-Tina?
-[Tina clears throat]

335
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:29,363
This is Tina Mukerji,
an analyst on loan from the NSA.

336
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,032
First of all,
an honor to be working with you.

337
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,242
Kiss-ass.

338
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,159
[Tina clears throat]

339
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:39,248
Well, we've been picking up some chatter
that, uh, Boro's nuke auction is still on.

340
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,250
But we have the device.

341
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,794
That's right. So we can only assume--

342
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,672
He's gonna make a new one… and do it fast.

343
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:49,299
His ego won't let him sit
on a loss for long,

344
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,510
especially with all of Lape Pa Lanmo

345
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,721
waiting to see what he does next
after Guyana.

346
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,723
But how can he possibly accomplish this?

347
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,683
Fissionable nuclear material
is well protected

348
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,977
and extremely difficult to come by.

349
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,396
It's not like you can get it
at a Duane Reade.

350
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,064
Boro will find a way.

351
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:06,066
-He's very tenacious.
-Obsessed.

352
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,194
If he cannot find anything fissionable,
he will pivot.

353
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:11,113
Steal something less protected.

354
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,990
Like radioactive waste, maybe.

355
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,825
That's a possibility,

356
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,245
but how does he assimilate that
into a suitcase nuke?

357
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,163
Who knows?

358
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:22,332
But I've seen him work.
He's a brilliant problem solver.

359
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,375
Wharton-trained.

360
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,922
Yeah. I'd hate to be the guy dumb enough
to have paid for that education.

361
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:33,594
Following up on Roo's theory,
if he's heading in this direction--

362
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:36,764
We focus on Eastern Europe
and Central Asia.

363
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:40,184
They have less regulations
for how radioactive waste is handled.

364
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,019
[Luke] Former Soviet Bloc countries.

365
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:45,731
Places difficult for us to get to
and places where he feels safe.

366
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,940
Tina, you're on it.

367
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,277
Yes, Ms. Mukerji will be joining us.

368
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,280
NSA's been hunting Boro as well,
and we're pooling resources.

369
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,365
-Man.
-Okay, that's it.

370
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,450
You're dismissed,

371
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,329
unless your name is Brunner.

372
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:04,958
[Roo sighs]

373
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,628
Can't believe we have to work
with the NSA.

374
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,755
NSA, Never Solve Anything.

375
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,340
Nerds Suck Ass.

376
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,133
I don't know. She seems okay.

377
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:20,516
Don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

378
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,233
You can't just give him authority
over my case.

379
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,152
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the hell are you talking about?

380
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,488
I've been working undercover for 40 years.

381
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,823
No one gives me anything.

382
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:38,700
I get it the old-fashioned way. I earn it.

383
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,911
Your father has more
field experience than you.

384
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,955
He's the logical choice
to command the team.

385
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,126
I told you, he treats me like a child.

386
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,919
How are we supposed to work together?

387
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,547
That's a reasonable question.
Here's your answer.

388
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:55,342
Operational psychologist,
Dr. Louis Pfeffer.

389
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,971
I called him in from D.C.
to be in-house analyst on the Boro matter,

390
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,515
and to work with the two of you
in particular.

391
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:05,561
He will be conducting your mandatory
joint therapy sessions.

392
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,813
-Absolutely not.
-No. No way.

393
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,189
[Dot] It's not up for debate.

394
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:13,569
The two of you spent most of your time
in Guyana at each other's throats.

395
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,154
You barely got out of there alive.

396
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:20,159
If the two of you are gonna work together,
you need to be able to work together.

397
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,787
And I don't mean some of the time.
I mean all of the time.

398
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,707
I know you're not thrilled,
but I assure you, you need my help.

399
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,584
Please, you don't even know us.

400
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,586
[laughs] Sure about that?

401
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,630
I knew neither of you would back down
over the faulty chair I planted.

402
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:38,260
Also knew that your pathologies
would play out exactly as they did.

403
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,804
You wouldn't accept help from your father
even though you needed it.

404
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:43,140
And you were so intent
on solving the problem,

405
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:46,185
you didn't listen to her telling you
that she needed to solve it herself.

406
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,770
You both complement each other
incredibly well.

407
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,190
I just saw the two of you
break down scenarios rapid fire.

408
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,441
You're both of the same mind

409
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,359
because you're drawn in
by the facts of the case

410
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,153
when you forgot about egos.

411
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:59,239
Your dynamic is written about extensively
in my predictive paper.

412
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,120
Oh.

413
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,833
Now "Pfeiffer," isn't the correct
German pronunciation Pfeffer?

414
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,253
When my grandparents came over,
they Americanized it.

415
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,296
-Oh.
-Mm.

416
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,382
Well, then in English,
it would actually be called "Pepper."

417
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:20,010
So maybe you should be called Dr. Pepper.

418
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,888
Yes, and I've heard all the jokes.

419
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:27,267
I'm not gonna make jokes about your name,
but we're gonna crush the therapy session.

420
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,479
Together, I think we can climb
this mountain. Do you?

421
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:31,813
I see what you're doing.

422
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,566
You're inserting soda names
into the conversation.

423
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,110
I have no idea
what the hell you're talking about.

424
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,948
You must be fanta-sizing.

425
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,576
Shasta.

426
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,792
This will be difficult.
They're both dickheads.

427
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,254
Yeah, we've seriously
never missed an episode.

428
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,755
It's true. We play along.

429
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,548
How do you play Antiques Roadshow?

430
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,050
-Guess the appraisal.
-Oh.

431
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,719
Yeah, it's basically like
a thinking man's Price is Right.

432
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,013
You learn history, art, science.

433
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,516
I… I actually use it to teach my students.

434
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,600
Very innovative, Carter.

435
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,686
-Those kids are lucky to have you.
-[doorbell rings]

436
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,187
-Thank you.
-I got it.

437
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,606
So how long is the show in town for?

438
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,816
[splutters] One day only.

439
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,526
I'm gonna take my Nana Pat's clock.

440
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,612
It needs to be re-stained,
but aside from that, it's perfect.

441
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,697
[woman] Hm.

442
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,032
[light instrumental music playing]

443
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,743
What are you doing here?

444
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,370
I needed to get something.

445
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,664
Uh, yeah, a clue.

446
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:33,375
You can't just barge in here,
especially now, given our situation.

447
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,502
If any of them
were to pick up on anything--

448
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:38,338
No one is gonna pick up anything from me.
I'm a professional.

449
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,425
For the record,
I told him this was a bad idea.

450
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,302
[Tally] Do I hear Luke?

451
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,099
Daddy's here. [giggles]

452
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,101
-[Romi] Oh yay.
-Well, hello, family.

453
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,811
-[Romi] Hi.
-Oh.

454
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:54,229
-Hi, Tally. How are you?
-Hey.

455
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,939
[Luke] So good to see you.

456
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:00,694
-Donald.
-Donatello, actually. But Donnie's great.

457
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,112
Been a while.

458
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,324
That's quite a handshake you have, Luke.

459
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:07,784
I knew you sold gym equipment,
didn't know you used it.

460
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:10,370
Gotta get on a program myself. [chuckles]

461
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:14,041
Well, just come by the shop.
I'll put you through the wringer.

462
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,877
-Donnie. It is good to see you again.
-[Donnie] Barry.

463
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,046
This reminds me. I got something for you.

464
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,298
What are you doing here?

465
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,925
Just borrowing the table saw.

466
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,218
Sandy, how are you?

467
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,970
-[Sandy] All good.
-It's so good to see you.

468
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,264
-[Sandy] Good to see you.
-Oh, look at this. Oscar.

469
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,851
Hello, my darling.

470
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,145
-Hi, Pee-Pa.
-Hey.

471
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,022
You're not finishing your food?

472
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,399
This is Grandma's special lasagna.

473
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,861
Yeah, she's just beat from school.
Kid comes home wiped out, don't ya?

474
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,322
I'm fluffin' tired.

475
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,573
[Carter laughs]

476
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,451
-What?
-I'm sorry, what did you say?

477
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,204
Oh, nothing. It's just that
I jammed my toe the other day,

478
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,039
and I said, "My fluffin' toe."

479
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,959
It's just I didn't want to say
the other word in front of her, you know?

480
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,003
They shouldn't grow up with bad language.

481
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,589
I hate when young ladies… curse.

482
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:06,760
Kind of late in the day, isn't it?

483
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,097
So weird you need a table saw right now.
[chuckles]

484
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,473
Well--

485
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,642
Actually… [clears throat]

486
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,143
…I need it.

487
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:19,940
I am building a life-size… Boba Fett lamp.

488
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,733
Oh.

489
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:22,651
Big.

490
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:26,405
Speaking of building things,
Oscar, how's your app coming along?

491
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,740
Great. Don's investing.

492
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,534
If you stay on the sidelines,
you'll miss out.

493
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,911
Yeah, bankruptcy.

494
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,414
Okay, Barry, here you go.

495
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,916
Ice cream cupcakes with crunchies.

496
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,710
-Seriously?
-Yeah. I--

497
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,964
I was at the supermarket the other day.
I saw them and thought of you.

498
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,716
I said, "I'll pop 'em in the freezer
till the next time you come over."

499
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,053
Well, Barry actually has
a heart condition,

500
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,598
and this would kill him.

501
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,727
Don't worry, there's a homeless guy
living right down the street from me.

502
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,104
He's always hungry.

503
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,689
Luke, can I talk to you?

504
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,233
-Of course.
-[Tally] Good. Come.

505
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:05,318
[Barry]
It's the thought that counts, right?

506
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,031
Would you wanna stay?

507
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,616
[chuckles] Are you kidding me?

508
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,535
I love your lasagna.

509
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,329
Fine. Then just be honest

510
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,874
and admit you didn't come here
for the table saw.

511
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:24,296
[light instrumental music playing]

512
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,218
[garage door closing]

513
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,899
Son of a bitch
is cuckolding my entire family.

514
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:46,693
Now he's using your stupid cupcakes
to cuckold you too.

515
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,863
When you look it up online,
you gonna be really upset with yourself.

516
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:52,240
[bushes rustle]

517
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,452
Man…

518
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,370
Just put the tracker on his car.

519
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,333
[mumbling] "Put the tracker on his car."

520
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:02,792
[music ends]

521
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:07,672
Put these on.

522
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:11,134
-What kind of a therapy is this?
-The mandated kind.

523
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:14,429
My techniques are untraditional
but effective. Trust me.

524
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,269
Good.

525
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,188
Zip.

526
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,273
You have to zip it.

527
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,025
All the way.

528
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,611
Wonderful.

529
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,530
Now hug each other.

530
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,741
If I don't sign a paper

531
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,118
saying you completed this session
to the best of your abilities,

532
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,954
you'll both get a desk in the basement

533
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,122
responding to
Freedom of Information requests.

534
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,040
Now hug.

535
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,508
[Emma grunts]

536
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,679
-[Emma grunts]
-[Dr. Pfeffer chuckles]

537
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,930
You can't, can you?

538
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,598
Electromagnets in the vest.

539
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,934
Like polarities are repelling you.

540
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,936
I'm gonna need to see your diploma.

541
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:05,313
I have a PhD from Yale
and a BS from Stanford.

542
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,607
Well, we can guess what the BS stands for.

543
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,276
The vests are a metaphor.

544
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,444
You're both stubborn and intractable.

545
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,738
Your like personalities are repelling you.

546
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:16,491
But if you just let all that go…

547
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:17,409
[Luke grunts]

548
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,579
Stuck together like tacos and Tuesday.

549
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,372
This is beyond stupid.

550
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,957
This is your homework.

551
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,959
I want you to wear the vest
for ten minutes a day.

552
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,877
Look into each other's eyes,

553
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:30,547
and listen to what each other has to say.

554
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,215
There's no getting away.

555
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,842
There's no avoidance.

556
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,343
Start now.

557
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,179
[phones chime, vibrate]

558
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,725
Tina found something.

559
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,518
[grunts] Yep, gotta go.

560
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,564
Thank you. I feel so much better.

561
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,025
Don't forget to sign the paper.

562
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,737
Turns out Central Asia's the play.

563
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:55,071
Tina?

564
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,533
A source spotted Boro's
right-hand man, Cain Khan.

565
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,909
I can't hear you.

566
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:00,994
[clears throat]

567
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,081
Cain Khan, uh,
he arrived in Kazakhstan yesterday,

568
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:09,002
two days before nuclear waste
from the AHTR reactor

569
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,630
is scheduled to be moved via train
to long-term storage.

570
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:12,922
What's the material?

571
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,424
Cesium 137.

572
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,843
-Oh boy.
-How much are we talking about?

573
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,511
Tanker-car full.

574
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,181
Enough to make a major city
glow in the dark for a few dozen years.

575
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,308
And they're transporting it by rail?

576
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:27,395
High-speed maglev to be precise.
We helped them build it.

577
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:31,566
Congress sold it as a friendship train
to repair relations between our countries.

578
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,859
And how did that go?

579
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,361
Well, they still hate us.

580
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,528
Fluff them.

581
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,906
Barry told us.

582
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,992
[Aldon] They're putting nuclear waste
on a bullet train?

583
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,786
[Roo] Actually it's safer.

584
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,580
Maglev trains
are nearly impossible to derail

585
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:46,915
because of the repel factor.

586
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,918
Further the train moves from the track,
the stronger it's pushed back,

587
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,753
creating a consistent stasis.

588
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:55,090
Assuming Boro's guys are gonna hit it,
how would they do it?

589
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,218
Security is tight loading and unloading.
It'll have to be en route.

590
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,844
Okay, so the great bullet train robbery.

591
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,180
How do you stick up a train
that's going 150 miles per hour?

592
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,390
You don't.

593
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,433
You stop it.

594
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,396
Right here at this bend
through the Kazakh hills.

595
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,189
A perfect choke point.

596
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,440
Stop the train,

597
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:16,069
suck the waste into a tanker truck,
and they're gone in minutes.

598
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,696
Okay. Okay.

599
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,657
So to prevent that from happening,

600
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,160
we'll put Luke and Emma undercover
as passengers on the train.

601
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,663
Passengers on a train with nuclear waste?

602
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,165
It's not uncommon.
Britain does it all the time.

603
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,379
Conductor in the front, tanker behind,
passenger cars the rest of the way.

604
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:35,422
Miss Russell and I?

605
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,173
There's a depot at the end of the line.

606
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,718
The train's emergency shutoff
is located there.

607
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:42,512
That's how we think Boro
might get the train to stop.

608
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,723
Good chance with an inside man.

609
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,100
So you will go on as US inspectors.

610
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:50,186
Part of the deal with giving them
the train is periodic oversight.

611
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,104
Copy that.

612
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:55,108
So Barry and Tina
will quarterback from Merry Fitness.

613
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:58,319
The rest of you, grab your covers,
grab your gear, head to the plane.

614
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,530
Wheels up at 9:00 p.m.

615
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,532
9:00 p.m.

616
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,159
9:00 p.m.

617
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,412
[percussive music builds, ends]

618
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,834
How's your cover?

619
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,669
[Emma] Anna Fettisov,

620
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,673
a Kazakh student studying literature
at the Suleyman Demirel University.

621
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,133
Dmitriy Gorchev,

622
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,554
taking the train
to visit my sister in Nur-Sultan,

623
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:27,640
and gonna go fishing also.

624
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,851
That gum will get you killed.

625
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,272
This is the gum of choice in Kazakhstan.

626
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:37,192
It was until wildfires
disrupted the supply chain

627
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,985
of the root that's used
to make black licorice,

628
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,988
which drove the price of a pack sky-high.

629
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,284
Only government-connected people
or the very rich would have it.

630
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,368
Get rid of it.

631
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,455
Well, thanks.

632
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,248
That was a great catch.

633
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,584
You're welcome.

634
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,379
[phone ringing]

635
00:29:58,463 --> 00:29:59,839
I'm gonna take this.

636
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,382
Hey.

637
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,343
Are you on the red-eye yet?

638
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,387
Uh, about to take off. How'd Roadshow go?

639
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,349
Well, Nana Pat's clock's a piece of shit.

640
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,309
It's a reproduction made in the '60s.

641
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,310
[groans]

642
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,562
I'm sorry, babe.

643
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,398
But, you know,
you weren't gonna sell it anyway.

644
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,316
Yeah, fine,

645
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,861
but she always said it was an antique
passed down through generations.

646
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,030
I mean, it's weird she'd lie about that.

647
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,825
Well, maybe she just wanted
to make it more special for you.

648
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,159
I mean, I guess.

649
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:31,162
I just-- I don't know,
being lied to by somebody I love,

650
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:34,749
it's a weird combo meal
of sucky and surprising.

651
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,627
Anyway, good luck in Libya. Love you.

652
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,421
[splutters] Yeah, love you too.

653
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,347
[bass guitar music playing]

654
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,350
[Roo] Are you shittin' me?

655
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,060
What?

656
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,022
Every time, every single time,

657
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,359
you always look like
you stepped out of James Bond's closet,

658
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,487
while I get the Hillary Clinton
Walmart collection.

659
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,656
Oh, come on. You look very sharp.

660
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:08,199
Thanks, Grandpa.

661
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,869
You got any Werther's Originals
you wanna spare?

662
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,370
[Aldon] What about you, huh?

663
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,081
Think I look sharp?

664
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,420
[speaking Kazakh]

665
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,465
[in English] That's Kazakh for,
"Why the long face, super lady?"

666
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,844
I feel bad. I blew off my boyfriend again.

667
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:32,265
Well, you know who's upset when I leave
for an op at a moment's notice?

668
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:33,933
Nobody.

669
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,895
Only way to do this job
is to don't get attached.

670
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,314
I didn't ask for any advice.

671
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:40,690
No, it's not advice.

672
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,984
Like casual hookups, they work.

673
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,111
But relationships, CIA is tough on 'em.

674
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,577
Tell me about it.

675
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,037
[dramatic music playing]

676
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,725
[tense music playing]

677
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:42,919
Barry?

678
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,755
Bat's in the belfry?

679
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,215
[Luke] Honey's in the hive.

680
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,301
Operation Training Day is a go.

681
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,678
Anyone else online yet?

682
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,681
-Ain't nobody here but us chickens.
-[Luke] Good.

683
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,975
Just want you to multitask, okay?

684
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,769
And keep an eye on Operation Don Juan.

685
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,813
What's Operation Don Juan?

686
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,400
Um, that's classified.

687
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,527
Classified,
or secret 'cause it's about Donatello?

688
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,279
I have other cases besides this one.

689
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,616
Happens to be a Don Juan
who's a gun runner from San Juan.

to buy something for Carter.

Well, that's nice. What did you get him?

696
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,300
It's need-to-know.

00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,261
Do you have to be that sassy?

Oh, just do a sweep.

I mean,
Boro maybe has an agent on the train.

702
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:46,983
Check her out. Combat boots
don't exactly go with the outfit.

703
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,444
But they're terrific
for the cold and the mud.

704
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,070
Maybe she's just practical.

705
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,780
How about the case behind you?

706
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,242
There might be a weapon in there.

707
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,619
Copy that. What about him?

708

-Let's take him out.
-No.

713
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,053
He might be an immigrant.

714
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,930
Or he could be a Boro plant.

715
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,016
Could be, but we have to make sure.

716
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,562

What's the Chinook helicopter's top speed?

Uh, 188 miles per hour.

810
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:35,104
If the train goes faster than that,
they'll have to detach the helo.

811

Otherwise,
they'll spin out of control and die.

861
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,696
About a stupid clock and a stupid show?

862
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,073
He was looking forward
to doing something with you,

863
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:53,492
and you ditched him for work again.

864
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,745
Honey, you don't wanna end up
like your dad and me.

865
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,040
I'll smooth it over when I get home, okay?

866
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,126
Good. Good, I hope so.

867
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,961
How's the job going?

868
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,380
Uh, you know, just dodging bullets

869
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,632
and trying to keep the whole thing
from blowing up in my face.

870
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:11,260
Yeah, I love you too, Mom.

871
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,345
Okay. Say hi to Donnie. Bye.

872
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,682
Hey, Barry, I need an update
on Operation Don Juan.

873
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:17,850
Urgent.

874
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,395
Ew.

875
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,688
Ready to flood the system?

876
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:23,689
[Luke] Affirmative.

877
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:26,025
[Roo] Careful!
Too much coolant means too much speed.

878
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:29,153
Too much speed, you can't stop the train
before it crashes into the depot.

879
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:31,197
Not enough,
Boro gets what he needs to make a bomb.

880
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,159
Gotta Mama Bear this thing.
Not too hot, not too cold, just right.

881
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,036
[groans] We have our comms in.

882
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,871
Why did we need these
as part of our disguise?

883
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,080
What are you talking about?

884
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,624
What are we, train inspectors

885
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,043
that are making hands-free phone calls
to our moms?

886
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,504
What? These are so cool.
Tony Robbins wears these.

887
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,380
How many coolant valves do I need to open?

888
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,508
My girl's calculating that now.

889
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:52,343
Four?!

890
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,515
-All right, I opened all four.
-[Aldon] What?

891
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,475
-Why did you open four?
-Because you said four.

892
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,435
I didn't say anything. Barry said four.

893
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,187
I was talking about Donatello!

894
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,897
He just took four Viagras!

895
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,441
I knew you were spying on him.
You're such a liar.

896
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,236
Four? Sounds like Donnie Boy's
going on a Tally rally.

897
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,987
I told Dot this would happen.

898
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,405
You always have to control things,

899
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,200
and now you put the mission at risk
so you could stalk Mom's boyfriend.

900
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,160
[Luke] It worked.

901
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,663
The chopper disconnected.

902
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,331
It couldn't keep up.

903
00:42:22,831 --> 00:42:25,292
No way they got enough material
to make a bomb.

904
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,503
[computer beeping]

905
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,797
Uh-oh. Speedometer's blowing up
like Donnie's chinos.

906
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,257
You overcooled the magnets.

907
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,300
The train is going too fast to stop.

908
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,386
When it reaches the depot in Nur-Sultan,

909
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,846
everyone on board
and half the town will be killed.

910
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:41,433
Congratulations, Dad.
You made the world's largest dirty bomb.

911
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,477
[music builds, ends]

912
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:44,728
[closing theme playing]

913
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:45,599
[closing theme ends]
