[dramatic music playing]

2
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,598
I said, who do you work for?

3
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:18,768
Be cool, Nik.

4
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:21,396
Impulsivity never works for anyone.

5
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:22,355
Move!

6
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:24,774
Whoa there. You can't go all Liam Neeson.

7
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,901
-You're gonna put Emma and you in danger.
-[grunts]

8
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,279
-[sighs] Come on. Hey, buddy.
-[car starts]

9
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,533
Best thing you can do…

10
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:36,828
is just let me leave.

11
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,373
-You'll never see me again.
-Hey, what are you doing?

12
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,292
I'm getting dressed.

13
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,254
Your hand's shaking 'cause you're nervous.

14
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,048
You're nervous
because you know you're screwed.

15
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,591
I'm the one with the gun.

16
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,176
[Emma] You're a pencil pusher.

17
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,095
Do you know how to get rid of a dead body
without getting caught?

18
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,725
Can you explain to your comrades
how I got in here and stole state secrets?

19
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,854
All after you approved the trip
that got Dr. Novac kidnapped.

20
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,147
Oh, Nicky.

21
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,107
At best, you're fired, at worst…

22
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:08,526
you're dead.

00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,487

Emma.

28
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,374
What are you doing here?

29
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,751
Saving you.

30
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,294
What about the guard?

31
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,924
-He feels a little run-down.

Get in. Moldo po-po are on the way.

34
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,728
I need your wallet and your gun.

35
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,980
Shake your money loser, old man.

36
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,149
Here we go.

37
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,151

-[Aldon] Mm-mm.
-[Luke] Mm.

00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,042
-[Roo] Mm.
-[phone chimes]

[exhales]

44
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,631
Tina just intercepted
Moldovan police transmissions.

45
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,093
They found the guard,
no wallet, no weapon.

46
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,304
They're gonna treat the whole incident
as a robbery gone wrong.

47
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,640
Boro has no idea we have his to-do list.

48
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,475
We'll know his next move soon enough.

49
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,685
Bring it in, guys. Come on.

50
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:24,769
-Let's go.
-Boom.

51
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,488
-Hey, you sure you don't wanna partake?
-I'm good, thanks.

52
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:40,368
All right, well,
maybe we, uh, grab a drink another time.

53
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:44,956
I won't have to get punched in the face,
and you won't have to wear hooker shoes.

54
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,792
Yeah, maybe. As friends.

55
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:51,379
-The Drakkar Noir stays home.
-[Aldon] Okay.

56
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,756
And of course as friends, obviously.

57
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,593
Ew. You think I wanna be
more than friends with you? [laughs]

58
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:57,886
You're-- You're ugly.

59
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,430
Anyway, you did great tonight.

60
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,599
Nik never stood a chance.

61
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:06,561
[chuckles]

62
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,734
So you are competent
at hiding your true self, Phony Stark.

63
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:14,611
Tina has no idea you're a nerd boy.

64
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,529
You know,
unless she looks at you for too long.

65
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:19,115
Yeah, but I might've
looked at her too long.

66
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,619
Her eyes are like the tractor beam
from Star Wars,

67
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,162
just pulls me in.

68
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,791
[Roo] She's there, isn't she?

69
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,211
All right, next move.

70
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:34,255
Tell her you're getting a late bite
and invite her to go along.

71
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:36,007
If she goes, that's a good sign,

72
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,634
and if not, no harm, no foul.

73
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,014
Don't you wuss out on me.

74
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,935
-[Emma] Hey.
-[exhales]

75
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:50,063
Mom texted. She wants us
to come over ASAP. Didn't say why.

76
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,606
[Luke] Okay.

77
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:56,819
You should not have unilaterally
disconnected the comms.

78
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,156
You put yourself
and the entire team in danger.

79
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,950
Okay, I… I guess, but

80
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:07,622
I couldn't exactly do what I had to do
with an audience that included my dad.

81
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,415
It's kind of gross.

82
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,584
Very much so.

83
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,838
And I shouldn't have rushed up
to the dormitory like that.

84
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:20,009
Protocol calls for Roo and Aldon
to first secure the perimeter,

85
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:21,052
and then I move in.

86
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,972
If we continue working together like this…

87
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,142
I have to get it through my head that, uh,

88
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,522
you're not anymore the little girl
that I always see in front of me.

89
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:35,024
You're now a really fantastic operative.

90
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:39,070
I mean, you had a gun to your head today,
and you walked out alive.

91
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,239
I'm so proud of you,

92
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,784
and you should be proud of yourself.

93
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,205
[slow instrumental music playing]

94
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,958
Then why do I feel so bad?

95
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:56,838
[sighs]

96
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:02,135
Don't give Carter a gift.

97
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:07,348
Because if you give him a gift
for no reason, it screams of infidelity.

98
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,183
And if you smell from cologne,

99
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,227
then just come up with an excuse,

100
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,522
like there's some crazy guy
in the office that is a hugger.

101
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:17,900
Always smelling like a fresh shower
is more suspicious,

102
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,403
and so is leaving the room
answering your texts.

103
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,657
And never feel bad… about doing your job.

104
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:26,909
Plus… [scoffs]

105
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,661
…you didn't cheat on Carter.

106
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,749
All the times I did whatever it took
to get the job done,

107
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,002
but I never was unfaithful to your mother.

108
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,963
-You said you never had an affair.
-I didn't.

109
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,174
An affair is a connection of the heart.

110
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,763
Your mother owned my heart
from the time we met.

111
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:51,267
When I needed to, I did my job,

112
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:55,855
and today, you did yours.

113
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,150
The job destroyed you and Mom.

114
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,405
But it's what I'm best at.
I love it like you loved it.

115
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:08,284
But I saw what it did to you guys,
to all of us.

116
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,919
I can't be with Carter and do this job.

117
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,258
[sighs]

118
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,056
What the hell is this?

119
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,183
This does not look good.

120
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,363
[doors close]

121
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:47,573
[Emma chuckles]

122
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,159
It's not Valentine's Day.

123
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,037
[Emma] Hi, Mom.

124
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,455
Hi, Tally.

125
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:56,749
-[Carter] Ha!
-[gasps]

126
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,960
-Hi there, Emma.
-[Emma] Hi.

127
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:02,213
-Hi.
-[Carter] So this… this is for you.

128
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,761
Carter, this is… this is way too nice
an instrument.

129
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,388
That-- It's expensive.

130
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,181
-What the hell is going on?
-Shh. Wait. Wait.

131
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,267
I've been saving for it
since our first date

132
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:18,229
when you told me it was your dream
to own a Raffaele Carmalini, so…

133
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,606
-You remember that?
-Of course.

134
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:26,446
I… remember everything
about the night that my life changed.

135
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,574
I remember that you said
you never wanted a diamond,

136
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:30,992
so…

137
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,244
[Carter breathes deeply]

138
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,329
Oh shit.

139
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:40,918
It's a violin string.

140
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:41,961
[Carter] Yeah.

141
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,379
[exhales]

142
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:47,925
Uh, Emma Brunner, will you marry me?

143
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,603
Yes. [chuckles]

144
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,730
[Carter] Yes! Yeah, good.

145
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,148
[Emma] I--

146
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,862
-[Carter clears throat]
-[Emma chuckles]

147
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,780
[uptempo rhythmic music playing]

148
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,701
[Tally chuckles, exhales]

149
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,371
[birds squawking]

150
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,633
Boy, we… we are really far out, aren't we?

151
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,057
You know when you said you wanted
to show me the boat,

152
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,768
I thought you meant the marina, not a--

153
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,479
It's not a boat. It's a ship.

154
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,941
Right, okay.

155
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:48,236
Hey, what does somebody do
if you get stranded out here? [chuckles]

156
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,613
Die.

157
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,667
What were you thinking
when you were proposing to Emma

158
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,294
without my blessing?

159
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,881
Well, um, you know, sir,

160
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:13,886
um, I guess I just always felt that was
kind of an old and outdated notion,

161
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:18,266
treating women like chattel
to be kept or given away.

162
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,561
So you're saying I'm old and outdated?

163
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:24,230
No. No, not… not at all what I meant.

164
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,942
I guess I just--
I… I wanted to be respectful to Emma.

165
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:33,197
What if you would have asked me
and I would have said no?

166
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,959
I love Emma… with all my heart…

167
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,380
so, with all due respect, Mr. Brunner,

168
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,508
I'd marry her
with or without your permission.

169
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:04,937
Good answer.

170
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:05,896
[exhales]

171
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,232
Now get me a beer.

172
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,317
Yeah, you got it.

173
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,613
[gentle piano music playing]

174
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,584
What?

175
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,086
You don't like lobster?

176
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,257
Perhaps, you prefer
to have your dessert before dinner.

177
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,800
We have arcimboldo,

178
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,262
a fresh fruit aspic with edible primrose.

179
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,639
I had it made special.

180
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,142
Oh, speaking of flowers,

181
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,020
did you notice the dog roses,

182
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,522
the national flower
of your homeland of Moldova?

183
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,651
[sighs] Speaking of which,

184
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,819
when can I go home?

185
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,238
[chuckles] Oh.

186
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,824
Make no mistake,

187
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,826
you are home,

188
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,747
for as long as it takes
for you to spin my proverbial straw

189
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,123
into nuclear gold.

190
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,459
So where are we?

191
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,253
Okay.

192
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,425
The cesium waste you obtained will work,

193
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,513
but its nuclear capacity
has been significantly diminished.

194
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,933
So to revive those components,

195
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:27,061
a small controlled nuclear reaction
is necessary--

196
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,479
Tell me what you need.

197
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,190
An MNR.

198
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,528
[splutters] A miniature nuclear reactor.

199
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,445
Fine.

200
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,907
-I'll get you one.
-No, no. You don't understand.

201
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,535
It's not something
you just find on the street.

202
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,664
I found you on the street.

203
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,417
You worry about the science.

204
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,502
Let me worry about
getting you what you need.

205
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,507
There's a seven-figure painting
in your room.

206
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,760
I know people
who are very good at acquiring things

207
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,721
when… the price is right.

208
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,903
[bass guitar music playing]

209
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,408
Emma's gonna have
the most attention on her,

210
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:24,702
but everyone has got to have
their role down pat.

211
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,662
Working true names helps.

212
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,498
Aldon C. Reese
will just spread his charisma everywhere.

213
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,041
And HPV.

214
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,420
-[clears throat] That was never confirmed.
-Oh sweet.

215
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,464
Ocean's 8 in the house.

216
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,008
I am finally wearing something cool.

217
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:43,471
Come on.
Disguises knows I can't wear these.

218
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,600
Sir? Are you sure I should be on this op?

219
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,686
I've never done anything like this before.
I don't wanna mess it up.

220
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,271
She should definitely be there, right?

221
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,774
[Luke] You're gonna be fine, Tina.

222
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,027
The more of us we have,
the better we can sell Emma's cover.

223
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:58,986
And let's not forget,

224
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:02,990
we're dealing with people
that can smell the bullshit a mile away.

225
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,659
They even caught me in lies before.

226
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,455
-Mom?
-Oh no, let your work friends eat first.

227
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:13,876
But set aside some for Oscar and his brood
for when Romi's feeling a bit better.

228
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:14,877
Okay.

229
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,171
Why bother? No crunchies.

230
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,173
Come on.

231
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:22,259
It's so nice to finally meet
some of Emma's coworkers.

232
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,677
I'm her supervisor.

233
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,180
She's a solid B-plus.

234
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:30,100
Still looking for that second gear
we know is in there somewhere. [chuckles]

235
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,978
[chuckling]

236
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,397
-So good to put a face to you, Carter.
-Yeah?

237
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,816
Everyone at work's been wondering

238
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,151
about the kind of man
that could take Emma off the market.

239
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,487
[Carter] Yeah, that's…
That's quite a grip you got there.

240
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,614
[Aldon] You can tell a lot about a man
from his handshake.

241
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,242
-Yeah, I can tell you love handshakes.
-[laughs]

242
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:50,579
Emma, the more your fiancé
talks to our people,

243
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,248
the greater the chance we get caught.

244
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,916
Yeah, I'm already on it.

245
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:56,335
Is that gonna be the extent
of our conversation today?

246
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,546
-You giving me orders?
-Meaning?

247
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:02,299
Meaning you haven't said more than
a few words to me since the proposal.

248
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,134
[scoffs] Well, what's the point?

249
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:07,429
I mean, I do the talking,
you pretend like you're listening,

250
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,223
then you're going off
doing something stupid,

251
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,934
like saying yes to a guy
with a fiddle and a string ring.

252
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,519
I mean, what were you thinking?

253
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,813
I'm thinking I'm done
with this conversation.

254
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:19,441
[sighs]

255
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,277
[Emma] Sorry, I'm gonna steal away
the groom.

256
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:22,987
Can you believe it?

257
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,406
Our baby's getting married.

258
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,200
There's a ton of things
I can't believe about this engagement.

259
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,494
Oh, come on. I've had a rough few days.

260
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:33,038
This engagement is the only thing
that's made me happy.

261
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,832
What's so rough?

262
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,293
[exhales] I quit my job.

263
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,210
[Luke] Oh.

264
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:42,006
[Tally] And I got into HR to help people
when they get pregnant or injured,

265
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,884
not to convince them to accept
crap severance packages.

266
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,303
Sweetheart, why don't you work for me?

267
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,096
[Tally] What?

268
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:53,309
My bad.

269
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,689
-I can't. That's crazy.
-Barry and I, we're always traveling.

270
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,858
We need someone
to keep up with the inventory,

271
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,318
to take care of the phones.

272
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,194
Someone that we can trust.

273
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:06,280
But you're retiring soon, right?

274
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,033
Well, that would take a year
to unwind the company.

275
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:12,119
In the meantime,
Barry needs someone to keep the books.

276
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:14,038
Well, I am kind of over HR,

277
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,790
and I did sales after college.

278
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,793
It won't get weird?

279
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,211
We're never there.

280
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,422
Try part-time, please.

281
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,924
I really need you there.

282
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,550
[chuckles]

283
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,637
Okay, why not?

284
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,597
If it's okay with Barry.

285
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,726
[chuckles] A-okay.

286
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,728
[Luke] There you have it. [laughs]

287
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,771
[Tally] Great.

288
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,481
Grazie, grazie!

289
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,941
I'm gonna go tell Donnie.

290
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,067
-Oh yeah.
-Yes.

291
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,154
Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

292
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,822
It was a great idea.

293
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:52,326
How am I supposed to provide strategic
support with Tally ten feet away from me?

294
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,827
How am I supposed to do my job?

295
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,830
Well, when she's at Merry Fitness,
you work out of HQ.

296
00:15:56,914 --> 00:16:00,626
But the best thing about it is,
every minute she's working for us,

297
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,586
it's one minute away from Don--

298
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,671
[Donnie] Luke!

299
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:05,381
My man! [laughs]

300
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,675
Donnie, my wife's boyfriend.

301
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:08,759
[Barry] Mm-hm.

302
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:13,472
Like the end of Back to the Future II,
all of this to be continued.

303
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,642
-[chuckles]
-Tally told me the news,

304
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:20,187
and I just wanna say,
I know what you're doing.

305
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,690
I hired a top employee.

306
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,275
I mean, I'm so excited about this.

307
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,319
I'm sure you are. That's not what I meant.

308
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,863
I know you're trying to win her back,
and it's not gonna work.

309
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:33,367
Actually, it's already working.

310
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,292
[Carter] Mm-hm. Mm.

311
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,504
-I'm so glad you said yes.
-Of course I did.

312
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,506
-It's gonna be great.
-[chuckles]

313
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,258
-It's the right decision.
-Yeah, okay.

314
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,759
[speaking Swahili]

315
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:53,387
-[in English] What?
-It's "be with me, my darling" in Swahili.

316
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,304
Just go with it.

317
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,557
Okay. Whoa, what are you--
What are you doing?

318
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,559
Everybody's right there.

319
00:16:58,642 --> 00:16:59,977
-What is--
-Right there, I know.

320
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:00,894
[doorbell rings]

321
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,979
-It's dangerous.
-Yeah.

322
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,148
-It's kind of exciting.
-Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

323
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,232
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

324
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:06,400
[speaking Swahili]

325
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,985
[in English]
They've been working together for years.

326
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,320
Oh, so you're a gym equipment salesman?

327
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,823
-Mm-hm.
-See if you practice what you preach.

328
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,826
Oh! That's very impressive.

329
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:16,869
[Barry and Tina chuckle]

330
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,579
I practice what I preacher curls.

331
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,539
[laughing]

332
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,499
It's hot in here. Are you hot?

333
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,168
-I--
-The thermostat must not be working.

334
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,795
-[Tally] No, it's working--
-I have a question about ellipticals.

335
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,673
-[Tally] Oh, he's the man.
-Oh great.

336
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,758
Will you excuse us?

337
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,509
-[Tally] Sure, no problem.
-Oh, thank you.

338
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,427
All right.

339
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,308
Why are you wearing
this Garanimals-ass shirt?

340
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,102
I specifically told you
not to look or act like you.

341
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,146
This is Matter-Homme,

342
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,608
a French-Canadian superhero who can bend
the laws of physics to his will.

343
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,942
Number one law of physics:

344
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,445
no one who quotes
laws of physics gets laid.

345
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,408
There. I just airdropped you
recon on Tina.

346
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,286
Online purchases,
Spotify playlists, Netflix history.

347
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,247
It turns out
she has a nostalgia erection for the '70s.

348
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:05,042
Sucks for you
because men back then were men.

349
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,461
Steve McQueen, Paul Newman,

350
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,962
and you ain't them.

351
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:11,715
I don't know, we grabbed
late-night tacos the other day,

352
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,759
and she just complimented my muscles.

353
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,219
It's 'cause we're undercover.

354
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:17,888
You think she's really interested
in your linguini arms?

355
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,057
You've gotta recruit her
like a foreign asset.

356
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,433
Step one, spot.

357
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,685
You spotted a woman
who caused blood flow to your down low.

358
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,938
Great. Two, assess for vulnerabilities.

359
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:29,316
She talks to you, so she's clearly lame.
That's a vulnerability.

360
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,568
Three, develop.
The best way to develop a relationship

361
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:34,071
is to learn about everything she's into,
hence the file.

362
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,365
Four, recruit.
Get her to go on a real date with you.

363
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,574
And five, handle.

364
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,285
You wanna handle her bing bongs,
and you want her to handle your nuggets.

365
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,372
For that to happen, cover your shame
and do your homework.

366
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,416
[Aldon exhales]

367
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,129
[Aldon] So Carter's parents.

368
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,131
Oh, thank you. [chuckles]

369
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,801
So tell me, how did
you two very special people meet, huh?

370
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,720
Oh, well, I was working
at Morgan and May in New York.

371
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,180
-Partner track by 30.
-[chuckles]

372
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,015
And at our corporate retreat,

373
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,768
there was a yoga session
taught by none other than--

374
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:06,395
Me. It was me.

375
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,938
I would have never guessed.

376
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,107
Ford change my life.

377
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,901
He taught me that
the rat race is for rats.

378
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,321
And we're humans, part of the human race.

379
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,323
[Ford] And we should help our fellow man.

380
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,617
-Yes.
-That's why we developed this.

381
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:22,161
Coochie Coo.

382
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,289
Unisex, pain-free bikini wax.

383
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,416
-Take a sample.
-Okay.

384
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,751
-[Aldon grunts]
-[Ford] Now with CBD.

385
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,047
Luke, don't be shy.

386
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,966
We're family now.

387
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,385
-We have a saying at Coochie Coo.
-[woman] It's nice.

388
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:39,303
Mm.

389
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,221
There's nothing to lose but unwanted hair.

390
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,433
[sighs] And your dignity.

391
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,644
-[laughing] Watch this guy.
-[woman laughs]

392
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:48,729
He's a pistol.

393
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,650
What is it with their names anyway?

394
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,152
[Luke] Ford? Carter?

395
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,821
Weren't they some of the worst presidents
we've ever had?

396
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:01,867
Not to mention the Perlmutter men.
I mean, they're lady-killers.

397
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,995
They kill the ambition
of smart and talented women.

398
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,330
That's so unfair.

399
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,956
I mean, look at his wife.

400
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,375
I mean, she started out
as a Wall Street mogul,

401
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,587
and then she ended up
as a crack-wax woman.

402
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,130
You know, where they wax down below?

403
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,924
I don't want that for you.

404
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,675
I don't want your future
to be controlled by--

405
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,510
By anyone but you?

406
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,262
Thank you.

407
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:23,931
He doesn't seem to understand

408
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,058
that I can make my own decisions
about my own life.

409
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:27,851
[laughing]

410
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:32,606
I've been telling her for years
that Carter is the wrong guy.

411
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,983
We had a wonderful conversation
on the airplane.

412
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,361
We communicated,
just like you recommended.

413
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:41,448
She even said to me
that she preferred the CIA over Carter.

414
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:44,201
-That--
-An hour later, they were engaged.

415
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:45,994
I mean, this is insanity.

416
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,080
[exhales]

417
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,540
Emma, it's a hard choice.

418
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:53,293
Work over love.
Do you feel split?

419
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,796
The CIA version of you

420
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,631
and the version
the rest of the world sees?

421
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:01,176
Did CIA Emma speak the truth about Carter,

422
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,679
but once you were inside
your parents' house,

423
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,431
back into the role of perfect daughter,

424
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,767
you did what everyone expected
you would do.

425
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,644
You said yes.

426
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:14,648
'Cause you don't want to hurt Carter.
You don't want to disappoint your mother.

427
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,989
No. I'm in complete control of my life.

428
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,116
I love Carter, and I realized I was wrong,

429
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:26,660
and I am going to make this work.

430
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,288
You can't. Look what happened
to your mother and to me.

431
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,332
I'm not gonna prioritize work
over my marriage the way you did.

432
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,625
A marriage that is doomed to fail.

433
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,921
-No--
-Okay, guys, let's hit the pause button.

434
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:40,924
We're doing these sessions
so you can work together more effectively,

435
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,011
but you can't do that
if we can't communicate.

436
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:49,182
But I have something that just might help.

437
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,691
That's supposed to be us?

438
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,776
Pretty good likenesses, right?

439
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,363
Those are like
Sesame Street-quality Muppets.

440
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,116
Mm-hm. Courtesy of the US taxpayer.

441
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:10,203
Since the only thing
you both want to hear right now

442
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,122
is the sound of your own voices,

443
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,582
we're going to try this again.

444
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:16,960
But you're going to speak
with each other's voices.

445
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,132
Yeah, uh, I don't think
this is gonna be a good idea.

446
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,802
[imitating Emma] My daddy is a fossil.
He knows nothing about anything.

447
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:29,431
I mean, because he was born before 1992.

448
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:32,142
So he should shut up
and let me ruin my life.

449
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,311
You're playing a dangerous game, old man.

450
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:36,688
That doesn't sound like Luke.

451
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,691
[imitating Luke] I'm Luke Brunner.

452
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:44,738
I ruined my own marriage,
but I'm the expert on everyone else's.

453
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,573
I have muscles,

454
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,117
so that means I know everything.

455
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,786
And I'm from Austria,

456
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,746
where life is hard
and everything costs a nickel.

457
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,498
[imitating Emma]
You know what costs more than a nickel?

458
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,209
Gymnastics classes and orthodontists,

459
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,378
and a wedding I know is a big mistake,

460
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,754
but my Daddy has to pay for it anyway.

461
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,298
[imitating Luke]
The only thing I can't lift is my own ego

462
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,800
'cause it's so big.

463
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,677
[imitating Emma] I've been lying
to my parents my whole entire life,

464
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:11,640
but I pretend to be an angel. [chuckles]

465
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:14,101
[in normal voice]
You see the hostility, Dr. Pepper?

466
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,311
-[in normal voice] Oh, I'm hostile?
-Brunners, please!

467
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:18,146
[phone rings]

468
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,649
Oh, looks like Dot needs you.

469
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,526
-[Emma scoffs]
-[Luke] Yeah, okay.

470
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,992
You see? That's what I'm talking about.

471
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:33,370
[door closes]

472
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:37,416
[sighs]

473
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,293
Thanks for trying your best.

474
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,462
[imitating Luke]
Sorry I called you Dr. Pepper.

475
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:46,842
The Army Corps of Engineers
has analyzed Dr. Novac's research

476
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,469
and determined that
everything that Boro needs

477
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,264
to turn his nuclear waste slurry
into a bomb

478
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,432
is readily available.

479
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,183
Save for one item, an MNR.

480
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,478
Miniature nuclear reactor.

481
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,815
Fortunately, MNRs
are rare and highly regulated,

482
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:05,235
used by only a handful of private
industries and research institutions.

483
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:06,361
Few years back,

484
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:09,531
a medical glass manufacturer
in Duluth went bankrupt.

485
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:11,950
They abandoned their processing plant

486
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,161
and left the MNR in the basement.

487
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,246
Local cops found it a few months later,

488
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,665
upon discovering
that kids had snuck in there

489
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,334
and were using it as backstop
for their stickball game.

490
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,503
-Oh!
-[Dot] Fortunately, the NRC confiscated it

491
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,005
before anyone got hurt.

492
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:28,008
So… the MNR is bait.

493
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,802
We lure Boro into meeting with us

494
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,764
then we grab him
and hold onto him like an Alabama tick.

495
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,934
Okay, great, but how are we gonna
get in contact with him,

496
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,102
let alone meet him?

497
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,770
He's been on high alert since Kazakhstan.

498
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,522
He'll only meet with someone
he knows and trusts,

499
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,733
and someone he thinks
could get their hands on an MNR.

500
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,319
Then, of course,
it has to be someone we trust too.

501
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:49,821
She's right.

502
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,449
[tense music playing]

503
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,578
We need the Great Dane.

504
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,163
Yes. Yes!

505
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,165
I love the Dane. [claps, laughs]

506
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,501
-Good idea.
-No, no way.

507
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,835
-No, no, no.
-[Aldon] Yes.

508
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:04,961
Who's the Great Dane?

509
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:08,256
He's the best at what he does,
and what he does is what we need.

510
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,382
[Aldon] Also he's just a chill guy,

511
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,219
very laissez-faire,
totally que será, será.

512
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:13,929
All about the c'est la vie.

513
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,723
He has cornered the market
on cool foreign phrases.

514
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,100
No, no, no!

515
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:20,852
You're gonna love him.

516
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,104
I'll have our people
look into his whereabouts,

517
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,732
but you all need to be prepared
to move fast on this.

518
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,359
[Roo groans]

519
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,276
[Aldon laughs]

520
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,361
[door opens]

521
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,572
Hello. Welcome to Merry Fitness,

522
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:35,158
where being in shape
never takes a holiday.

523
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,036
You work here?

524
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,997
I thought it was just
the Schnitzel King and his sidekick.

525
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:42,666
I'm new.

526
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,960
Anything I can help you with?

527
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,713
What, you don't recognize
your biggest competitors? [chuckles]

528
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:54,177
We're the co-owners and titular twins
of Twinning Formula Fitness Supply.

529
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,346
Right, right. I've seen your commercials.

530
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,558
You don't look like twins.

531
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,144
Shawn's still on his fitness journey.
It's okay, buddy.

532
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:07,816
[spluttering] Of course. I just meant,
well, I've never seen you in the ads.

533
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,442
Shawn's a behind-the-scenes kind of guy.

534
00:26:09,526 --> 00:26:12,320
I'm the face of the outfit,
but he does the books.

535
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,449
Which is how I know there's no way
that Merry Shitness is outselling us,

536
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:18,660
and that those "awards" back there…

537
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:20,787
are bogus.

538
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:25,208
We're the exclusive distributor to all
Planet Fitness in the Eastern Seaboard.

539
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,169
We eat, sleep, and breathe
Twinning Formula

540
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:33,717
and still somehow lose all regional
sales awards to, uh, Merry Fitness.

541
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:35,719
I don't think so.

542
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,222
Those accoulements should be ours.

543
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:41,683
-Those what?
-Accoulements.

544
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:44,144
When you get credit
for doing a good job. Come on.

545
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,187
Are you combining
"accolades" and "accoutrements"?

546
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,398
Look, you're new,

547
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,443
so you might not know what the guys
who own this place are up to.

548
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,279
Show us your books.
We keep it our secret, huh?

549
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,780
How about I show you the door…

550
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:58,950
or I call the police?

551
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:01,620
Let's go.

552
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,752
You just made very powerful enemies
in the fitness supply industry.

553
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:13,715
[door opens]

554
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,508
[door closes]

555
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,803
Hey now.
Come on, quit sulking over the Dane.

556
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,473
Is he really that bad?

557
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,726
-[Barry] Honestly, he is a solid guy.
-[Aldon] Mm-hm.

558
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,728
[Barry] As solid as
a black-market middleman can be.

559
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:30,440
He doesn't sell weapons
and always holds up his end of the deal.

560
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:33,818
In the '90s, he smuggled
100,000 Beanie Babies into Russia

561
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,196
in the hay bales of the Moscow circus.

562
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:40,367
I heard he strapped waterproof bags
of microchips to migrating sea turtles

563
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,702
to get them from Cancun to Halifax.

564
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:43,828
Ever seen the Mona Lisa?

565
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,288
-Yes.
-Nope.

566
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,291
You haven't because it's hanging
in a sheikh's bedroom in Dubai,

567
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:49,959
thanks to the GD.

568
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,506
The son of a bitch shot my toe off.

569
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,757
-Oh shit!
-[Barry gags]

570
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,760
Oh God. I'm eating.

571
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,595
I'm gonna have nightmares. [groans]

572
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,222
[Emma gags, wretches]

573
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,139
Wait.

574
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,312
Does your stump… Does it have a toenail?

575
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,107
The doctors call it spontaneous regrowth.

576
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,359
My niece calls it monster foot.

577
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,278
I sent a picture to Ripley's,
they chose "not,"

578
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,489
said it looked like a buffalo cauliflower.

579
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,408
Flip-flops are a pipe dream.

580
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,410
There's nothing to hold 'em in place.

581
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,537
They're just flop-flops.

582
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,538
[Aldon] Well, sorry.

583
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,332
[chuckles]
Big mission overrules little piggy.

584
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:30,959
[huffs]

585
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,896
Good news, we've located the Great Dane.

586
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:55,775
Bad news, he's in a Turkish prison
under an assumed name,

587
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,861
two years into a four-year stint.

588
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,446
The State Department's
doing what they can,

589
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,865
but the Turkish government
has no reason to do us any favors.

590
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:05,368
Good. Got what he deserved.
Moving on to plan B.

591
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,453
[Dot] No plan B.

592
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:07,704
He's our only option,

593
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,706
so we have to break him out.

594
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,834
Polat penitentiary.

595
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:17,255
Intel tells us there's a visual head count
every morning at dawn.

596
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,174
So once we extract the Great Dane,

597
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:21,885
we need to meet with Boro
before the next count.

598
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,845
If our pal is identified as missing,

599
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,847
Europol will push his mug shot

600
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,433
to every police force
on the continent within minutes.

601
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,561
Fake name or not, the Great Dane
is very distinctive looking.

602
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,729
[Emma] It won't take Boro long

603
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:36,357
to figure out that the guy selling him
an MNR is supposed to be incarcerated.

604
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:38,151
He'll know it's a setup
then we're back to square one.

605
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,779
The other problem is
we can't leave the cell empty.

606
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,490
End of the day, guards collect
all the meal trays to prevent vermin.

607
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,284
If a tray isn't pushed through the slot
in the bottom of the door,

608
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:47,869
then the guards will enter, and then--

609
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,579
They find out that our man is gone.

610
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,080
Once again, the word goes out

611
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,334
and Boro will figure it all out
that it's a setup.

612
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,796
So someone has to stay in the cell
to push out the tray.

613
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:58,838
[grunts]

614
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:02,550
[Dot] Roo, Aldon, we need you at the meet.

615
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,553
Closest you've come to Boro
is shooting at him from a helicopter

616
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,430
from 100 feet up in Guyana.

617
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,598
He doesn't know your faces,

618
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:11,768
so you'll act as associates
of the Great Dane and provide backup.

619
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,895
Luke, Emma, you know Boro best.

620
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,064
You need to be there
in case things go sideways.

621
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,441
You know how he thinks, how he'll react.

622
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,945
Why don't you get Salazar?
He just did a prison job in Cameroon.

623
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:22,862
[Dot] On an op.

624
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:27,158
So is Finelli, Jackson,
McMahon, Chang, Roland…

625
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:29,661
We are stretched thin,

626
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,871
and I need you on a plane ASAP.

627
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,124
I'll do it.

628
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:36,793
I'll go in.

629
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,336
[dramatic music playing]

630
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,254
What?

631
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,341
-Why not?
-Uncle Barry, it's not safe.

632
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:47,136
[Luke] You have a heart condition,
and you're ill-equipped to do the job.

633
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:54,018
[Roo] Wait, why can't Barry do it?

634
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:57,564
I mean, he hung from that helicopter too,
saved you and Princess.

635
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,900
His job now is basically
sitting in a room all day.

636
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,194
I mean, that's what this is.

637
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,195
[Dot] I like it.

638
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,031
Dane's savvy enough
to stay out of prison once we spring him,

639
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,534
but he also knows
that if he's caught escaping,

640
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:10,785
the punishment's death.

641
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,121
He will only jump the wall
with someone he trusts,

642
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,914
and he's worked with Barry before.

643
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,333
-Director, I don't think that--
-It's settled.

644
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,794
Barry goes to prison. Wheels up in 35.

645
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,340
This is a bad idea.

646
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:33,266
So trying to be a macho '70s guy for Tina?

647
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,810
Well, that was the idea.

648
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,063
-Thanks for sticking up for me.
-Don't thank me.

649
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,649
This goes wrong,
you're cell block prom queen.

650
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,783
Hey, Aldon, I wanna talk to you
about the engagement party.

651
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:53,703
The prolonged eye contact
and the inappropriate touching.

652
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,289
I didn't go near Emma at the party.

653
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,207
Not talking about Emma. Carter.

654
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:00,209
I saw you staring him down,

655
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,754
and your handshake
was five seconds too long.

656
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,714
If you would've been a meerkat,

657
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,591
you'd have pissed all over him
to show your dominance.

658
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,343
And don't deny it.

659
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:12,430
I did exactly the same thing
trying to win my wife back from Donatello.

660
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:13,598
Ex-wife.

661
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:17,602
Don't push me.

662
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,355
Luke, I like Emma.

663
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,106
She's smart, she's gutsy.

664
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,192
But that's it. It's just "like."

665
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:28,404
And if you believe I would get between
two people that are about to get married,

666
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,282
it's good to know
you think so little of me.

667
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:39,248
[rock music builds, ends]

668
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,797
Well, the reactor's still secure.
It's all good.

669
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,508
[phone ringing]

670
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,467
Excuse me.

671
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,846
How is my employee of the month?

672
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,973
[Tally] I'm good. I'm good.

673
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,432
It's been pretty quiet.

674
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,852
Except, um,
the Twinning Formula guys came by.

675
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,521
The guys from the TV commercial?

676
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:04,190
Yeah, they were complaining
about your sales awards.

677
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,275
They wanted to see your books.

678
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,695
Oh, they're just jealous.

679
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:10,947
I mean, wait until they find out

680
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,282
all my new deals with Planet Fitness.

681
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,368
We're selling a bunch
of Pilates machines to them.

682
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,829
Matter of fact,
I'm prepping now for the meeting,

683
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:20,039
so if you don't mind,
I'll call you back later.

684
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,499
[Tally] Yeah, of course. [chuckles]

685
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,417
It's funny though.

686
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,588
Twinning Formula said they had
an exclusive contract with Planet Fitness.

687
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,798
[Luke] Well… [scoffs]

688
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,675
…it's not a done deal, believe me.

689
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:35,513
Remember, 90% of the sales
is all positive thinking, all right?

690
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,723
I gotta go now.

691
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,099
Bye.

692
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,851
Okay, thanks. Bye.

693
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,561
Bye.

694
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:42,895
[phone beeps]

695
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:45,815
[sighs]

696
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:47,692
[Luke] I'm sorry.

697
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:51,195
Must be really weird for you
to listen to me lie to your mother.

698
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,281
It's the job.

699
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:54,991
[Luke] Yeah.

700
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,493
But it doesn't have to be your job.

701
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,079
I mean, if you really want
to get married to Carter,

702
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,416
you should think about maybe a desk job,

703
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:06,169
or doing logistics or something like that.

704
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,796
I'm telling you,
it'd be much better for both of you.

705
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,050
So if you could go back
and do things differently, you would?

706
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,678
Yeah, I don't believe that.

707
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,014
[man] Minute out. Prepare for jump.

708
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,392
[Roo exhales forcefully]

709
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,853
Barry, why are you still sitting there?

710
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:27,774
-How could you let me agree to do this?
-Then why would you volunteer?

711
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:31,069
Oh, little Miss NSA
turns Barry's junk into a zipper-ripper.

712
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,153
Ooh, attaboy.

713
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,655
Whenever you like somebody,
you start getting all nervous,

714
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:35,990
and then you do stupid things.

715
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,451
Easy, you don't want
your last words to Barry to be mean.

716
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:41,287
-Last words?
-Uncle Barry, come here. Just…

717
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,628
Look, if you really don't wanna
go do this, I can take your place.

718
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,298
-Yeah?
-Please.

719
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,966
It's okay. You're good.

720
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,677
Go.

721
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,387
No! Get me out of this!

722
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,264
-Good old bait and switch.
-I didn't see that coming.

723
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,599
-I did.
-Relax.

724
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,684
Think of it like a BabyBjörn, huh?

725
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,354
I mean, I carried Emma
around in it all the time

726
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:07,897
and I only dropped her once.

727
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,816
You seem to have dropped me a lot.

728
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,443
-[Luke] Good.
-Good.

729
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:13,528
-Just relax.
-[Barry] No!

730
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:19,242
-Go! Showtime!
-No, no, no, no! [screaming]

731
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,744
Wow.

732
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,454
Well, that was undignified.

733
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,289
All right, comms in.

734
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,751
Tina, uh, drop team's a go.
You got eyes on them.

735
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:33,589
Copy that. They're descending
at 195 kilometers per hour, on target.

736
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,133
How'd Barry seem?

737
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,175
[Roo] Raring to go.

738
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,427
I'm just worried he won't fit
in the prison ductwork

739
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,721
because of his giant balls.

740
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,016
[Barry whimpering]

741
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,518
[dramatic music playing]

742
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:46,519
[screaming]

743
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,855
[Luke grunts]

744
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,612
Harness off, comm in.

745
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,489
Copy that, Tina?

746
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:00,158
Puppy's in the pound.

747
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,035
Sorry, I… I hope I'm not overstepping.

748
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,038
I've heard you and Barry do that,
and I just wanted to try.

749
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,415
[Luke] Pumpkin in a pie.

750
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,041
Okay.

751
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,585
[Tina] Looking at blueprints.

752
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,254
There should be a round vent
with a domed fan grate.

753
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,344
[Barry grunts]

754
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,846
There's a drop of about eight feet,

755
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,472
then the shaft turns horizontal.

756
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,017
Remind me why you can't do this?

757
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,730
Because your skinny, malnourished body
will squeeze through it like cookie dough.

758
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:44,577
Be safe.

759
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:51,334
[Barry grunts, yells]

760
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,130
-[Tina] You good?
-Uh-huh.

761
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,843
You've been out of the duct work
for about 20 yards.

762
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:03,179
You should be coming up
on another short drop.

763
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,388
[Barry screams]

764
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:05,306
[body thuds]

765
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,308
[groans]

766
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,101
That wasn't that short.

767
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,561
[groaning]

768
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,563
[Tina] Hang in there.
Keep your eyes on the prize.

769
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:13,898
Everything's gonna be all right.

770
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,900
You know it's not that bad

771
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:18,903
when you think of it
as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

772
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,490
Congrats, you're there.

773
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,411
[dramatic music playing]

774
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,520
[bricks scraping]

775
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,731
[Barry] Hey, GD.

776
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:56,941
How you been?

777
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,736
It is so good to see you.
You look fantastic.

778
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,947
-Thank you.
-Right off the bat. Fit as a biscuit.

779
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,156
-Thank you.
-Oh God.

780
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,076
-Well, you look great too.
-Oh stop. Don't even do that to me.

781
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,161
-I have put on some.
-Stand right here.

782
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,621
Look at those shoulders.

783
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:13,874
Yeah, well, I know. I've been working
a little bit on my upper.

784
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,918
I was feeling
so bad about myself in prison

785
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:18,629
that I just kind of fed that
with food, you know?

786
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,549
They say no sugar and carbs, then what do
they serve you? Sugar and carbs.

787
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,758
Is that a beacon?

788
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,260
And an industrial bungee cord,

789
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:27,471
and a hook, and very soon a plane.

790
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,016
-Okay.
-[plane approaching]

791
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,935
All right. And expect a little yank, okay?

792
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,439
A little yank. Got it.
Wait, what-- [screams]

793
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:47,241
So how are the new digs?

794
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:50,369
Prison-y.

795
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,998
Found the Dane's contraband under the bed.

796
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,167
Anything we should requisition?

797
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:00,880
[Barry] Just a few magazines
and a bottle of White Lotus by Liz DuVray.

798
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:04,342
-Hm.
-And a box of Reggie! bars. [chuckles]

799
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,803
They haven't made these things since 1980.

800
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,181
I guess the Dane really can get anything.

801
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,140
[banging at door]

802
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,017
[door slot opens]

803
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,560
Gotta go.

804
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,562
[Roo] Don't screw it up, sweet cheeks.

805
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,120
[Tina] No issues with the tray?

806
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:34,497
Tina.

807
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,207
Hey.

808
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,792
I dropped us into a private channel

809
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,252
so we don't have to hear
Luke and Emma go at it.

810
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,172
I heard them screaming at each other
through Dr. Pepper's wall.

811
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:47,551
Yeah, they got more issues
than Sports Illustrated.

812
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,594
[Tina chuckles]

813
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,680
Well, if you need anything, I'm here.

814
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,641
Well…

815
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,061
I could use some company.

816
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,979
Then I'm not going anywhere.

817
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,404
Oh my God! [laughs]

818
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,906
-Hello.
-I thought you were Danish.

819
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:09,824
[Great Dane] I am, yeah.

820
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:12,952
I went to boarding school in Andover.
I'm fluent in English, Danish,

821
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,454
and 'cause it's in Andover, Massachusetts,
Moron,

822
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,581
'cause everyone
from Massachusetts is like,

823
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,833
"Tom Brady must have a huge hog,"

824
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,793
or however they sound. [chuckles]

825
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:23,337
What's up, dude? [laughing]

826
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,673
[in Danish]
You're the sweetest Danish in the world.

827
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:27,341
[in English] Come on. You're nuts.

828
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,427
[in Danish] I should dunk you in coffee.

829
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,719
[in English] You're nuts. You're nuts.

830
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,263
-[Roo] Hug this, creep.
-Oh!

831
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:36,225
-[Emma] Oh god.
-God, that is… vile.

832
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:39,019
I have not seen anything that bad
in a… in a long time,

833
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,022
and I have been in a Turkish prison
for two years.

834
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:45,025
-What happened to your toe?
-What happened to my toe?

835
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,820
You shot it off on the Borneo job.

836
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,280
-Right. Right.
-It was you.

837
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,115
When my gun misfired.

838
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,659
[splutters] I don't like using guns.

839
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:56,370
It's why I was handing her the gun.
Technically you shot your own toe off.

840
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,122
[spluttering] And I feel horrible.

841
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,708
Worse than someone
with nine toes and ten toenails?

842
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,710
Roo, holster your four-shooter.

843
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,129
Hey, Dane, we have an offer for you.

844
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,465
We want you to sell something
to Boro Polonia.

845
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,551
And in exchange, you'll stay free,

846
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,636
and you get to see the son
you've never met before.

847
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,597
What do you say?

848
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,933
Wow.
It's the only time I got sloppy, ever.

849
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:19,935
I was rushing home
'cause Gertrude was in labor.

850
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,480
I got caught at the border
with fake passports and contraband.

851
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,899
It was just, you know, amateur hour.

852
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,944
But… being free to me would mean
meeting my son for the first time.

853
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,070
-I am in.
-[Aldon laughs]

854
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,198
-Okay.
-[Aldon] Yeah, baby.

855
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:33,824
-That's the Dane.
-[Luke] You're the man.

856
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,202
[dance music playing on TV]

857
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:38,871
[scoffs]

858
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,212
[man on TV] Do you hate the beach,

859
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:50,090
because instead of a hot body,
you've got a not body?

860
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,384
Twinning Formula Fitness Supply

861
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,763
outfits not only the finest hotels,
spas and resorts…

862
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,641
[speaking Spanish]

863
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:00,809
[sighs]

864
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,981
[uptempo instrumental music playing]

865
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,200
[line ringing]

866
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,703
Hello. This is Tally Brunner
from Merry Fitness.

867
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:25,000
Yes, I see your hotels purchased
26 of our machines last year,

868
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,126
and I just, uh,

869
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,046
I wanted to make sure
they were all working okay.

870
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,756
[woman] Oh, that is so sweet.

871
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:34,385
Well, uh, I'll have to reach out
to the branch managers individually,

872
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,012
but our main office
hasn't heard any complaints.

873
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:40,140
But I surely do appreciate the follow-up.

874
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,601
And if you ever need to call again,

875
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,562
you just ask for Tammy Parsons.

876
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,688
[Tally] Okay, thank you.

877
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:46,939
-Hm.
-Bye now.

878
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,482
[line disconnects]

879
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,858
[phone dialing]

880
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:55,864
This is McKinnon. Is home office aware
that Officer Luke Brunner's ex-wife

881
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,199
is employed at his cover?

882
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,244
Yeah, well she is. She just called me.

883
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,830
[phone beeping]

884
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,666
This could be a problem.

885
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:09,795
[in Scottish accent]
Off-kilter CrossFit. This is Fiona.

886
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,047
[dramatic music playing]

887
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,934
-I did a sweep. The place is clean.
-Belts and suspenders.

888
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:25,603
Please. This is about Diana.

889
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,022
[Emma] Who's Diana?

890
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:28,939
[Aldon] Um…

891
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,399
[hammering continues]

892
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,443
A few years ago,
I was stationed in Greece,

893
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:34,945
and I had a very passionate fling

894
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:38,907
with a beautiful NIS officer named Diana,

895
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:42,328
but, uh, we had to break it off.

896
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,912
-Two-boink rule.
-Two-boink rule.

897
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,165
What is the two-boink rule?

898
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,250
Any CIA officer

899
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,211
engaged in more than
two close or continued contacts

900
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,504
with a foreign national

901
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,214
has to report the relationship.

902
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,550
I mean, it's…
it's like a lot of paperwork.

903
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,135
And Diana was crushed.

904
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,054
She became obsessed with me.
I don't blame her.

905
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:01,889
A lot of women become obsessed with me.

906
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:05,809
But I can tell you, this safe house
has Diana written all over it.

907
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,936
Vase of dianthus flowers.

908
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,648
There's a fridge full
of my favorite Greek beer.

909
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,359
Dianthus flowers
are everywhere in the Mediterranean,

910
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:16,278
and your favorite beer
happens to be the most popular in Greece.

911
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,905
Uh, narcissism much?

912
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,658
Then why is this safe house
directly across the street

913
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,451
from the same flea-ridden motel

914
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,870
where Diane and I
made sweaty Grecian love for 12 hours?

915
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,664
[Great Dane] Twelve hours?

916
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,957
I thought you said
you were only allowed to do it twice.

917
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,003
-[gun slide racks]
-[Luke] Can we just focus?

918
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:36,590
We have a limited amount of time left
to complete this mission.

919
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,093
If we screw up, then Boro stays at large,

920
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,553
and Barry becomes our new prison pen pal.

921
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:44,640
-So is the place clean or not?
-I already said it was.

922
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:45,849
Well then, let's get to work.

923
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:52,147
You make the call to Boro
and make the meeting as early as possible.

924
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,817
Yeah, just gotta dip into my address book.

925
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,235
You have a bad-guy address book?

926
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,987
My clients… use a secure phone service

927
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,490
that changes their number every three days

928
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:04,034
based on an algorithm
that works off the date.

929
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:07,079
Only me and a few very other
important people know said algorithm.

930
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,497
I like math.

931
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,249
That's great, but no way.

932
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,459
If the secret of the algorithm gets out,

933
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,837
then I'm out of a job,
and then I can't afford diapers.

934
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,965
And you need them,
'cause you're a big stupid baby.

935
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:20,426
So the code is entered, and now we wait.

936
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,553
Hopefully not too long.

937
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,433
Two-boink rule, huh?

938
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,476
You know, in Denmark they give you four.

939
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,519
-[Aldon] Come on.
-Mm-hm.

940
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,937
Scandinavians.

941
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:36,024
Hey, could I maybe take this opportunity
to grab a shower

942
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,901
and change into some civilian duds?

943
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,737
I'm just, um, I reek of Turkish prison.

944
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,113
-Hey, just focus, okay?
-Yep.

945
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,699
-[phone rings]
-Oh hey, here we go. Hello?

946
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,284
[Boro] Great Dane.

947
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,661
Where have you been hiding, you wild man?

948
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,912
[tense music playing]

949
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:51,874
I am in Greece. Aloha.

950
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:56,128
Anyway,
I have a, uh, miniature nuclear reactor

951
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:57,671
that I've heard you are looking for.

952
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,631
Always with your finger on the pulse.

953
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,425
That's why I love you.

954
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:02,843
[Great Dane] That's why everyone loves me.

955
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,762
Uh, it's unanimous across the board.

956
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,055
I've never met one person
that doesn't love me.

957
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,308
Anyway, I got your MNR.

958
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:12,186
If you can meet me within the next
ten hours by the Turkish border,

959
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,188
my going rate on this is five million.

960
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,481
[Boro] That's more than fair.

961
00:46:15,564 --> 00:46:17,858
I'll need to put a lot together
in a short window.

962
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,359
Say, 7:00 a.m.

963
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,030
That sounds-- That's perfect. Thank you.

964
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,407
[Boro] I'll be in touch with a location
that works for me.

965
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,409
You always come through, GD.

966
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:28,994
We'll speak soon.

967
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,122
[music intensifies]

968
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,293
[music ends]

969
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,296
[Barry] I know I'm supposed to say
The Conversation,

970
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:42,216
but give me Play Misty for Me
any day of the week.

971
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,551
[Tina] Oh my God,
Eastwood is so great in that movie.

972
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,678
You are literally naming all my favorites.
[chuckles]

973
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,638
[man screaming]

974
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,056
[ominous music playing]

975
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,098
[breathes heavily]

976
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,270
You… You hear that scream?

977
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:59,525
-[screaming continues]
-[Tina] Yeah, uh… you hanging in there?

978
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:02,653
Honest?

979
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:08,075
I'm terrified… of tight spaces,

980
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:10,202
damp spaces, dark spaces,

981
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,912
locked spaces.

982
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,625
I did this for you.

983
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,670
Uh… For me?

984
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:22,339
[Barry] You know,
as the newbie on the team,

985
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,759
I wanted to impress you
as your more senior operative.

986
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:31,765
Barry… you didn't need to throw yourself
in prison to impress me.

987
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,977
You're a top CIA handler
with a case record that I'd kill for.

988
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,313
Not to mention smart, funny,

989
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:40,607
sweet.

990
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,693
You're gonna be fine.

991
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:46,572
Just… pretend I'm there with you, okay?

992
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:47,489
Okay.

993
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:50,742
Tina?

994
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,413
Thanks.

995
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:58,125
[Luke] Up and in. [grunts]

996
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,042
[Emma groans] Shit.

997
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,420
[phone vibrates]

998
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,839
-[phone vibrates]
-[Emma sighs]

999
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:10,679
Schatzel, I don't want to get into
another argument with you,

1000
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:14,516
but that is just one of a million
future denied calls.

1001
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,686
One of a million lies
that you have to tell Carter.

1002
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:22,149
Can this wait till after we're done
transporting a nuclear device?

1003
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:25,402
Well, Dr. Pepper said
we should communicate,

1004
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,154
and I'm trying to communicate to you

1005
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:30,574
that I believe you're entering a marriage
that is totally based on deception.

1006
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,242
It's a big, big mistake.

1007
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,995
You're gonna regret it,
and Carter is gonna regret it.

1008
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:38,373
When Carter finds out the truth,
he will be devastated.

1009
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:42,252
You should have heard him
when he talked about you on the Tally-Ho.

1010
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:45,505
I mean, he loves you.

1011
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:50,093
-Why was Carter on the boat?
-It's not a boat. It's a ship.

1012
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:53,972
And we just went out on a… casual cruise,

1013
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,266
you know, to talk a bit,
get to know each other.

1014
00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:00,020
And… I just asked him

1015
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,147
why he didn't ask me
for permission to marry you.

1016
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,148
What?

1017
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,609
Why would he have to ask?

1018
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,277
You don't own me.

1019
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,987
I'm not something you give away.

1020
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,656
That's exactly what Carter said.

1021
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,075
-Oh my God.
-You know, that makes sense to me.

1022
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,118
And I agree with both of you.

1023
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:17,704
And I found that he is a really good man,

1024
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:21,249
but he's just not the right man for you.

1025
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,335
Not with the kind of life that you live.

1026
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:24,670
That's not the point.

1027
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,381
Come to me if you wanna talk about this.

1028
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,757
Not that it's any of your business,

1029
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,010
but I don't know if I am gonna marry him,
or not marry him. I--

1030
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,429
I just don't know,
but can't I get a minute to think about it

1031
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,640
-without you telling me what to do?
-[door closes]

1032
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,141
[tires screeching]

1033
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,228
[engine revs]

1034
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:48,276
You know,
we really shouldn't be working together.

1035
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,445
We are totally fluffed.

1036
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:52,406
[uptempo instrumental music playing]

1037
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:55,784
I want a complete rundown of all
the criminal activities in this area.

1038
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:59,162
Stolen-car rings,
joyride convictions, chop shops,

1039
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,331
anything that you can find, now.

1040
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,960
Tina, get in touch with DOD,
make them run an RDS sweep.

1041
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,170
Any radiation could come from our reactor.

1042
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,756
-Yes sir.
-Our MNR has uranium-237 in it.

1043
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,718
Home in on that signature,
and we can probably get pretty close.

1044
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,219
Guys, I've been thinking.

1045
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,764
-This could be Diana's work.
-[groans]

1046
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,600
We can't deliver a reactor to Boro
that we don't have,

1047
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,394
so we must postpone the meeting.

1048
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:25,230
Well I-- Boro's gonna be suspicious
of a last-minute change.

1049
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,314
I don't know what to tell him.

1050
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:29,317
Just say you were transporting
a bio agent for a client in Cyprus,

1051
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,778
but one of your guys got sick,
so you think there could be a leak.

1052
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,447
You're monitoring symptoms with a doctor,

1053
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,782
but you're waiting on a test
to see if you're contaminated,

1054
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:38,869
or if the symptoms you're experiencing
are just psychosomatic.

1055
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,788
Just buy us some time.

1056
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,749
A million future lies, huh?

1057
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:45,125
Think I'm gonna be okay.

1058
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,043
[music ends]

1059
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,507
I was just following up
about your needs this quarter.

1060
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,760
And please let me know
if I have the right number.

1061
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,970
The one on your invoice
just rang and rang,

1062
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,598
so I just called the one
on your hotel's website.

1063
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:00,599
Thank you.

1064
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,855
[phone ringing]

1065
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,193
Hello?

1066
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:17,365
Of course.

1067
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:18,992
[ominous music playing]

1068
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,702
I'll come right now.

1069
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,373
[music builds, ends]

1070
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:31,338
-He pushed the meet. Thirty minutes.
-That's it?

1071
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,548
He doesn't care that you could be
starting the next contagion?

1072
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:37,427
He said take two aspirin and get my pale
Dutch ass down there as fast as I could.

1073
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:41,014
Said he pulled a lot of favors
and dealt with a ton of logistics

1074
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:44,726
to set up the transfer of an MNR
over international borders,

1075
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,394
and he was actually quite rude about it.

1076
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,647
Maybe you should shoot his toe off.

1077
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,650
I don't know about this.
There's too many variables.

1078
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,111
By the time we find the reactor,
if we ever can find it,

1079
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:57,739
there's the early morning prison count,
and Barry's gonna be in deep shit.

1080
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,282
I'm gonna make the call here.

1081
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:01,618
I think we should pull the plug
on the whole thing

1082
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:02,828
and get Barry out of prison.

1083
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:04,287
Luke, no.

1084
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:08,583
There are over 900 prisoners in here,
and inspection is randomized every day.

1085
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,377
Chances are they won't get to my cell

1086
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,338
by the time you find the reactor,
meet with Boro, and come get me.

1087
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,423
I appreciate that, but enough is enough.

1088
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:18,510
You don't stop Boro,
that nuke could kill millions.

1089
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:21,179
The needs of many
outweigh the needs of the few.

1090
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,889
Finally you're talking like a man.

1091
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,226
That was Spock
from Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.

1092
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:28,103
Hurry up and get me out of here.

1093
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:32,232
This is more complicated than I imagined.
I'm getting a little queasy.

1094
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,317
Yeah. Yeah, you don't look so good.

1095
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,527
Here. It's over here.

1096
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:38,864
Just splash some water on your face
or something.

1097
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:40,657
Right there.

1098
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,911
We're not leaving Uncle Barry
in prison, right?

1099
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,079
[Luke] Of course not.

1100
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,957
As far as we know,
his cell will be the first one inspected.

1101
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:50,625
We got to get Barry out of prison.

1102
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,169
No man-child left behind.

1103
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:55,046
But if Uncle Barry's out
and his cell is empty,

1104
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,883
word could get back to Boro
before we're done with him.

1105
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:01,553
We break our word with the Dane
and put the Dane back in prison.

1106
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,638
I just got a boner.

1107
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,558
Roo will be in charge
of swapping Dane for Barry

1108
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:08,059
while we're searching for the reactor.

1109
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,895
How will we meet with Boro
if we don't have the Dane?

1110
00:53:09,978 --> 00:53:12,731
We pivot. You pose
as one of the Dane's consiglieres.

1111
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:13,940
A Copenhagen consigliere?

1112
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,609
90% of what we needed the Dane for

1113
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:17,444
was to set up the meet,
which has been done.

1114
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:20,530
So long as Boro shows and doesn't
catch wind of the Dane's escape,

1115
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:22,115
I think we can pull this off.

1116
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,536
-I'll have your back.
-It's the only choice we have.

1117
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,872
I can't wait to break the news to him.

1118
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,874
Break it off, Dane. We gotta talk.

1119
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:32,709
[Luke knocking] Dane?

1120
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,129
Dane!

1121
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:38,465
[Luke grunts]

[dramatic music playing]

1123
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,265
I really hate that goofy asshole.
