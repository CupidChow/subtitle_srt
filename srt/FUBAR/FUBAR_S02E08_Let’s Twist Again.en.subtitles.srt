00:00:08,466 --> 00:00:10,468
[dramatic music playing]

2
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,682
-I gotta call the White House!
-I thought DEFCON 1 was good.

3
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,685
DEFCON 5 is good. DEFCON 1 is Armageddon.

4
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:20,478
Barry, sitrep now.

5
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,355
The missile launch system
must have a failsafe.

6
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,483
It assumes if the nation loses power,
it's because we're under nuclear attack.

7
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:28,903
Moscow is going
totally völlig verrückt right now.

8
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:32,198
Their spy satellites
see that your ICBMs are primed

9
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,575
and will ready their own.

10
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:35,702
This was Cress' plan all along.

11
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,662
He never cared
about knocking out the power.

12
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,956
He… he just wanted to start
a nuclear Armageddon.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,626
This is Cress' radical reset
to wipe out 90% of the population.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,420
[Greta] Luke, you… you have to believe me,

15
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,797
I didn't know that any of this
was going to happen.

16
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,675
-I believe you.
-Why do you believe her?

17
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,552
She's the reason we're in this position.

18
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:54,095
Because I know her heart.

19
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,681
If we survive this,
I'm locking her ass up.

20
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:01,144
Reed, call Moscow right now
and let them know what's going on.

21
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,855
The White House and the Pentagon
cannot get through to the Kremlin.

22
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,483
Cress must be jamming
communications somehow.

23
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,360
The Russians aren't gonna sit around
and wait for our missiles to launch.

24
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,487
They're gonna strike first.

25
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,072
[Reed] Their ambassador said
the same thing.

26
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,699
He's giving us 30 minutes
before their patience and trust runs out,

27
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:15,784
then the fireworks start.

28
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,328
-What about NORAD?
-[Reed] They're running a system reset.

29
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:20,705
It'll take 'em an hour.
By then, we'll all be glowing.

30
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,625
So that's it?
I never got to see Shreveport.

31
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,920
-What's in Shreveport?
-Titties?

32
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:30,381
You said that you worked with my father
on the Y2K bug, right?

33
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,550
And he said that the United Kingdom,

34
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:36,012
they… they put in a backdoor
to the nuclear operation system,

35
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,807
just in case everything just went bonkers
at the turn of the century.

36
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,477
But the States, I mean, you must've
done something similar, surely.

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,395
We did. We created our own backdoor

38
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,731
so we can shut down the missiles
in case of an emergency.

39
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,359
There were four operatives
that were given the password.

40
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,820
-I'm the only one still alive.
-I'll patch you into NORAD now.

41
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:56,407
No, no. The password is keyed to my voice,
so it has to be done in person.

42
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,159
We don't have time to go to NORAD.

43
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,830
We just have to get to the closest silo
because they're all hardwired together.

44
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,790
Once I get into the backdoor,

45
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,459
I can go and stand down
all of the missiles.

46
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,212
I got 450 missile silos
within a five-state radius.

47
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:10,755
There's one 14 miles from there.

48
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,715
I'm gonna regret it,
but I'll get you clearance.

49
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,467
-Let's hit it. Come on.
-[Chips] Let's go.

50
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,052
Come on. Go. Go.

51
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,851
[music fades]

52
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,979
[Aldon] B, I'm just a few streets away.
You got an update on the address?

53
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,188
Um…

54
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,524
[melancholy music playing]

55
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,359
We should have an answer soon.

56
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,697
Tina just walked in.

57
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,158
Hang tight, bro. This one's gonna sting.

58
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,994
[exhales]

59
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,210
[keyboard clacking]

60
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,128
[computer beeps]

61
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,676
Foreign operative Mukerji,

62
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,597
we've tracked Dante Cress
via his IP address to this street.

63
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,933
Metadata from your cell phone says
that you've been in the vicinity before.

64
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,227
Which one of these houses is his?

65
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,063
Tell us, and we can see
what we can do about your charges.

66
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,775
Give me five minutes with her,
and she'll tell me everything she knows.

67
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,444
Oh my.

68
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:15,945
[melancholy music continues]

69
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:27,707
I know you say you don't love me
or care about any of us,

70
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,585
but I don't believe that you're so cold

71
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,754
that you're willing
to live through a nuclear winter.

72
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,672
Our missiles are primed to launch,

73
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,342
and Cress is jamming
our communications with Russia.

74
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,720
That's why we need to find him
and stop him from doing that,

75
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,890
so we can communicate to your homeland
that we are not about to attack them

76
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,476
so they don't preemptively attack us.

77
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:47,393
[music ends]

78
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:48,853
Please, Tina.

79
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,359
The house set back from the road.

80
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,988
[inhales] Aldon, did you get that?

81
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,366
[Aldon] Yeah,
the house set back from the road.

82
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:05,453
But my handler, Mikhail Volek,
will be there.

83
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,580
-[keyboard clacking]
-[ominous music playing]

84
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,418
-Your boss is Dante Cress?
-All I know is he's a liar.

85
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,506
He told me everything we did,
we did for Russia.

86
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,968
But it appears he was Cress all along.

87
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,552
He had me protecting him.

88
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,555
He ordered me to prevent the team
from tracking down Cress.

89
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,975
That's why I held on to the BlackBerry.

90
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,313
I came to America to gather intel,
not die here.

91
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,524
Sucks to be lied to, huh?

92
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,610
[laptop closes]

93
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,863
Aldon is never going to stop Cress

94
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,658
and open communication
with the Russians in time.

95
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,618
[hesitating] Uh, where are you going?

96
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,245
-If you must know…
-Yes.

97
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:48,579
To call the woman I love.

98
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,083
Hello, Mother, it's Marcus.
I've got some very bad news.

99
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,252
Hey, let's not get negative.

100
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,754
Luke's got this.

101
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,548
I can't remember the password.

102
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,174
-What?
-Are you joking me?

103
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,218
This is why I bought you fish oil.

104
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,178
Fish oil always makes
my burps smell funny.

105
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,179
Listen, old man,

106
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,765
I don't wanna die because your brain's
clogged with schnitzel

107
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:09,475
and World War II documentaries.

108
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,102
Don't worry, love.

109
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,062
We'll help you.

110
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:14,772
[Emma] Ugh.

111
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,569
[sighs] Look, I'm sure
that I will remember it

112
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,903
by the time we get to the silo.

113
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:21,946
You think so?

114
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,324
-Because we're here.
-[dramatic music playing]

115
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,366
Oh God.

116
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:26,993
Yeah.

117
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,293
Oh shit.

118
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,714
We're getting everything
set up for you, sir. Through here.

119
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,674
[tense music playing]

120
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,636
-We got eyes on the inside.
-Aren't ICBM facilities air-gapped?

121
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,306
Mission control, yes.
Security cameras, no.

122
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,974
[music intensifies]

123
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,527
That's a Titan II. I thought
they replaced that with the Minutemen.

124
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:04,530
Not all of them. This silo
hasn't been upgraded since the early '80s.

125
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,533
We're still using computers
with floppy disks in the control room.

126
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,078
Only NORAD has machines
with voice recognition.

127
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:12,080
That's why we're hacking into the missile.

128
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:12,997
[computer beeps]

129
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,832
Okay, Dad. It's showtime.

130
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,626
Dig deep. [exhales]

131
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,252
We need total recall.

132
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,757
-[music fades]
-[sighs]

133
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,133
-[Emma sighs]
-Ah, shit.

134
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,969
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey, mate. Look, you can do it.

135
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,098
Was it a numerical code?
Was it… was it a word?

136
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,891
[Luke] No, we were able
to just make it up.

137
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,561
I think it was in the zeitgeist back then.

138
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,773
It… it was something
that people said all the time.

139
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,817
-Was it "talk to the hand"?
-No.

140
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,984
-"Don't go there"?
-No.

141
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,362
-"The tribe has spoken"?
-"Tabasco my asshole"?

142
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,446
Nobody said that.

143
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,781
It was something visual.

144
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:49,367
-A movie. "May the force be with you."
-No.

145
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,827
-"I'll be back."
-No.

146
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,578
-"I'm the king of the world."
-No.

147
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,247
"Do I make you horny?"

148
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,541
A little.
But I'm trying to focus here, Mrs. B.

149
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:57,959
It's a commercial!

150
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,253
-"Got milk?"
-"I can't believe it's not butter!"

151
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,672
-"Where's the beef?"
-"Yo quiero Taco Bell."

152
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,006
No, it's none of that.

153
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,174
-[gun fires]
-[groans]

154
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,636
How about
"I've fallen, and I can't get up"?

155
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:09,846
[Roo] That was the '80s.

156
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:13,891
And you should focus on killing Cress
or Volek or whatever his name is.

157
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,393
We're running out of time here.

158
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,979
[Roo] Come on, big guy.
Just remember that shit,

159
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:21,232
I'll buy you a case of IPAs, and we can
celebrate saving the world together.

160
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:22,275
Beer!

161
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,570
It's a… it's a beer commercial.

162
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,280
I got it.

163
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,240
Just speak the password here, sir.

164
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,667
What's… up?

165
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,085
[airman] Have to say it louder, sir.

166
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,466
-What's up?
-Say it like you mean it, man.

167
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,176
Say it like the world is depending on you.

168
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:55,808
Whassup?!

All we need to do now
is just enter some basic commands,

174
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:17,497
and I can get us back to DEFCON 5.

175
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,333
What about the other 449 land-based ICBMs?

[Aldon] Hey, Barry,
what… what am I looking at here?

185
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,825
[Barry] Well, it looks like
satellite flight paths.

186
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,079
-Those are DSCS satellites.
-You know that?

187
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:02,333
Everyone in Russian intel knows
that we attach spy hubs to your sats.

188
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,545
That's how I knew about the extra weight
on the satellite Barry was trying to hit.

189
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:06,462
When you saved me?

190

When I saved the asset
I worked so hard to compromise, yes.

But Volek seems
to have reprogrammed the hubs

from spying on communications

With the little strength that I had left,
I fought back,

342
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,990
and I reached out, and I strangled him.

343
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:34,785
I strangled my hero to death
with my bare hands.

344
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:39,456
And we looked into each other's eyes
in disbelief that it was happening.

345
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,085
The rest of what I told you is true.

346
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:46,338
You know, it was a mission
to cover up a sex scandal,

347
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:50,134
which, it turns out,
my father knew about, by the way.

348
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:52,428
You know, he was willing to kill me

349
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,223
to protect some…
some wanker fucking politician

350
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,975
because the government
had given him orders.

351
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,727
You know I… [breathing heavily]

352
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,894
I loved him.

353
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,897
I worshiped him, and he…

354
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,151
I meant nothing to him.

355
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:11,238
You were betrayed and hurt.
You don't end the world over it.

356
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,158
No, no, no.
That's actually exactly what you do.

357
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,120
What kind of world do we live in
where a father murders his own boy,

358
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,165
a boy who adores him,
just to keep gossip out of The Mirror?

359
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:25,169
-Yeah, that's pretty fucked up.
-The world is a cesspool.

360
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:28,714
You need someone
to shake the Etch A Sketch.

361
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:30,257
Come on.

362
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,635
Shake it with me, baby.

363
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:35,054
One last chance.

364
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,222
[bullets ricocheting]

365
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,059
I'll take that as a no.

366
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,351
[tense music playing]

367
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,020
[exhales] Second stage tank is fueled,

368
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,564
but if we can shut it off
before the first stage fills,

369
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:46,690
that'll stop the countdown.

370
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,609
-How do we do it?
-Uh, that wheel.

371

[grunts]

372
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:54,531
It's stuck.

373
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,784
Hasn't been upgraded since the early '80s.

374
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,035
[Roo] If we live through this,

375
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,705
I'm gonna send a strongly worded letter
to my congressperson.

376
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,041
[grunts] Give me a hand.

[exhales]

Okay, remove red panel marked "caution."

396
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:07,187
These are my least favorite
kind of panels.

397
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,900
Are they trained in nuclear physics
or something?

398
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,527
[chuckles] No, Mrs. Brunner.

399
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:17,447
A conventional explosive device
starts the whole nuclear chain reaction.

400
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:22,703
It's just like that bomb that we disarmed
on that yacht in Monaco.

401
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,622
Afterwards, we were all alone on the boat,

402
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:29,126
and we made love
on the deck under the stars.

403
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:30,836
Sex on a boat.

404
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:32,671
Must be his thing.

405
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,756
[automated voice] Three minutes to launch.

406
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,342
There's a red and a blue.

407
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,554
Okay, I'll take the red. It's closer.

408
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,141
All right.

409
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,646

-[tense music plays]

414
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,323
We need to let Russia know
that we're shooting blanks.

415
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:03,577
Yes. Phone lines are open
and operators are standing by.

416
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,786
Calling it in now.

-This isn't over.
-Why not?

421
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,892
Let me guess,
the Russians didn't believe you.

422
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,769
It doesn't matter
we deactivated the warhead.

423
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,979
The Russians will think
it's an operable nuke.

424
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,482
The minute it leaves our airspace,
the Kremlin will retaliate.

425
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,193
What about Tina? She's one of them.
They'll listen to her.

426
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,404
She's in our custody. The Russians
will assume she's being coerced.

427
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:42,824
Gotta figure out something quick, boss.
This bird flies in 90 seconds.

428
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,536
Seconds, that's it. The second stage.

429
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,831
-I think I'm following you, Greta.
-What the hell is she talking about?

430
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,502
The missile, it has two engines.

431
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:57,631
The first-stage engine acts as a booster
and gets it airborne.

432
00:20:57,714 --> 00:21:01,218
After a few minutes, that stage falls off.

433
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,720
Then the second stage takes over

434
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,682
and flies the missile to its target.

435
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:10,269
The first stage of electronics
is too high up. It cannot be reached.

436
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,814
But the second stage of wiring
is just five feet above you.

437
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,900
Disable it,
and the missile will still launch,

438
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,610
but it won't leave our airspace.

439
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,364
It'll drop back to the ground
like a disarmed dud of a bottle rocket.

440
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,493
Seventy seconds.
Less verbiage, more sabotage.

441
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:29,454
It'll take at least 90 seconds
to disable it all.

442
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,956
Then I have to go on a ride.

443
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,457

-No!

but you're not in love with me.

You lied to me to save the world,
but you love Tally.

You've always loved her,
and you always will.

Hate to interrupt the goodbye,
but according to the lovely Airman Mendez,

467
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,648
at T-minus 15 seconds,
the blast doors will automatically close

468

will end up well done.

Sorry, I'm sorry to ruin the fun,

688
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,109
but I have news
that I think you'll all want to hear.

689
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,903
Got off the horn with the 7th floor.

690
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:35,823
Dante Cress has been officially classified
as neutralized, as has Greta.

691
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,618
The threat to the electrical grid
is no more.

692
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,079
I also have this.

693
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:42,914
Putt, if you will.

694
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,665
[phone ringing]

695
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:45,625
Thank you.

696
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,797
It was anonymously dropped off
this morning.

697
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,341
Forensics have been all over it,
but they found jack.

698
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,468
[computer beeps]

699
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,429
The individuals being killed here
have one thing in common.

700
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:01,808
Our intel shows they all purchased
your private information from Boro.

701
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,893
We don't know who's behind the killings,

702
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,770
but to get it done this fast
and efficiently,

703
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:08,439
they had to have connections
and a lot of money.

704
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,691
-Yeah, 500 million.
-Greta.

705
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,528
And now, I have one last thing for you.

706
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,571
[computer chimes]

707
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,740
Hi, Meemaw. Hi, Pee-Pa.

708
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,827
Someone else also wants to say hi.

709
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,911
My baby.

710
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:25,081
-Yes, thattaboy. Good boy.
-[Hamsteak snorts]

711
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:29,168
Thank you, Uncle Aldon, for Hamsteak.
I love him so much.

712
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,128
So do I.

713
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,672
[Hamsteak snorting]

714
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,589
Bye, pal.

715
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:38,136
Also, the man from Pee-Pa's work
says we can all go home now.

716
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,138
-[Barry] What?
-[Carter exclaims]

717
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:43,099
-[Carter] Back to normal!
-It's true!

718
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,225
[Carter] Back to normal!

719
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,602
-Hey!
-Hey, buddy!

720
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:47,979
Oh yeah.

721
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,022
-Ah.
-[Donnie laughing]

722
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:54,360
Hold up. Hold up. Unfortunately,
not everyone can go home.

723
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,736
We got a call from the FBI.

724
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,655
Mr. Luna, Mr. Perlmutter,

725
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:01,826
is it possible you did something to anger
the biker gang known as Azrael's Knights?

726
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,453
-No.
-We might have… killed one of them.

727
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,830
-What?
-[Carter] Was an accident.

728
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,790
-I was on PCP.
-I'm only human.

729
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:08,708
PCP?

730
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:12,420
Well, that guy is the nephew of a very
high-ranking member of that organization,

731
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,672
and now there's a million-dollar bounty
on your heads.

732
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,717
-The air conditioner fell on his head.
-Yes!

733
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,635
And I am not going back
to that safe house.

734
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,970
Well, you're in luck.

735
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,055
Azrael's Knights have chapters
in every state.

736
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,099
There's not a place in America
that's safe for you.

737
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,852
We've arranged for you to hide out
at a CIA listening post

738
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,729
in Saqqaq, Greenland.

739
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:33,232
We believe we can resolve the biker threat
within the next 48 months.

740
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,775
-Okay, we can do this.
-Yeah.

741
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,943
Four… four to eight months?

742
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,153
Forty-eight months.

743
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,280
Are you out of your fucking mind?

744
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,406
This is Reed.

745
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,367
Ooh! Forty-eight months?

746
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:45,745
You're gonna need this, my friend.

747
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,040
Space Juggs lead to space tugs,

748
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:50,750
so have fun.

749
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:54,545
Let's not end this on a downer.
I have a big surprise.

750
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,549
Come on in.

751
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,053
What's this?

752
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,013
[Luke] I'm gonna retire.

753
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,098
Again.

754
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:10,436
And Tally and I, we're gonna sail
around the world with my ship.

755
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,688
-[Tally exhales]
-[Luke chuckles]

756
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,940
Finally, right?

757
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,191
[Luke laughs]

758
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,776
Retirement?

759
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,403
-Are you sure?
-100%.

760
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,113
[Tally] I know, it's happening.

761
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,824
I'm not sure what this team
will be like without you.

762
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,370
I'm more worried about
what the team is gonna do without you

763
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:30,414
because I heard
you were accepted in Unit 9.

764
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,250
So congratulations.

765
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,335
Um, thanks.

766
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,963
Uh, I turned it down.

767
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,548
Why? That's what you always wanted.

768
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,842
Yeah. I mean, I… I thought so.

769
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,263
But this group, these guys…

770
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:48,516
I mean, they'll need at least one Brunner
to keep them in line.

771
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,517
Yeah.

772
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,602
[Barry] No crunchies?

773
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,729
They're for children.

774
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:56,899
-I hate you.
-Why don't you order it next time?

775
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,567
-Maybe I will.
-Well, will you?

776
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,485
Bad news.

777
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,321
We just learned the Great Dane
is in Russian custody.

778
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,240
He was picked up in Alaska
to see what he knows,

779
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,866
which now they realize is nothing.

780
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,452
-I could've told you that.
-They'll make a trade for Tina.

781
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,539
-They want their asset back.
-Could they just keep him?

782
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:16,210
Tally, this is my fault.
I should've made sure he comes home safe.

783
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,837
So I go and do the trade.

784
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,630
It's my last mission.

785
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,799
No one left behind.

786
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,051
Except me. I'm out of here.

787
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,054
I'm going back to Toledo
where I don't have to deal with yahoos

crashing a spaceship
and destroying multiple power plants,

789
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:35,187
and a, oh, yeah, nuclear Armageddon.

790
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,316
You're Roo's problem now.
She's your new director.

791
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,776
Yes! Fuck yeah.

792
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,736
Whoo!

793
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,821
All right, Farkas, go get my office chair.

794
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,239
Yes, ma'am.

795
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,993
Roo, you're the boss,
so you tell Luke he's not going anywhere.

796
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,036
[Roo] Mmm. Uh-uh.

797
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:51,245
Tally…

798
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,622
No. No, you just had a bullet
taken out of your arm.

799
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:54,915
We're gonna go home.

800
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,585
I'm gonna take care of you,
and you're gonna rest.

801
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:59,086
That's it and that's all.

802
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,214
-She's right, Luke.
-Hey, I can run it, big guy.

803
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,176
It's an easy prisoner swap.
No fuss, no muss.

804
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:08,512
Oh, so you all want me
to just blow off this mission

805
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:12,266
so that I get taken care of
and babied by my ex-wife?

806
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,267
Yeah.

807
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,145
Well, that doesn't bode well
with me, all right?

808
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:21,984

getting babied by my fiancée…

You know, I've never stopped
being in love with you,

811
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,534
and I'm not gonna mess it up this time.

812
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,037
So, Tally,

813
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,915
will you do me the honor

814
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:40,169
and be my wife, again?

815
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,671
[breathing shakily] Yes.

00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:14,823
[Barry] This is it.

860
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:17,785
You are leaving forever.

861
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,707
Tell me it all wasn't a lie.

862
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,463
Barry, I've got four other guys
in Europe just like you.

863
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,298
They all think I'm their true love.

864
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,592
You need to stop being a fool.

865
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,219
[dramatic music playing]

866
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:43,435
Hope you brought some 2-ply
'cause they only got single.

867
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,437
[Great Dane laughing]

868
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:46,522
What's up?

869
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,279
What up, dork?

870
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:54,238
Prisoner swap!

871
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,656
Prisoner swap!

872
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,366
Prisoner swap!

873
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:06,041
I'm so sorry this is happening, Carter.

874
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,711
This is not what anyone wanted.

875
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:12,006
But, you know, for what it's worth,
I think you're gonna be great out there.

876
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,799
Think of it as an adventure.

877
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,801
I wish I'd never met you.

878
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:19,013
Donnie, I'm really sorry
it turned out this way.

879
00:43:19,513 --> 00:43:22,266
I truly loved you, once.

880
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,935
You're the worst person in the world.

881
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,187
[fisherman] Stop gabbing.
This is a workin' boat.

882
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,772
Head below and grab your gear.

883
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:32,109
I-- You really couldn't
have got us an airplane?

884
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,027
Go!

885
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,405
Have fun. [chuckles softly]

886
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,748
Hey, the, uh, comrades filled me in
on the whole Tina situation.

887
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,459
And, you know,
just so you know, for what it's worth,

888
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:50,919
you don't need that red widow.

889
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,713
She's not even a good spy.

890
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,174
My sources said that half the intel
she gave her handlers

891
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,635
was inaccurate information.

892
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,471
-What do you mean?
-Like how you smuggled me into Greece?

893
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:03,223
Apparently, she reported to the SVR
that you were in Papua New Guinea.

894
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:04,808
[Aldon] That doesn't make sense.

895
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,269
She knew where we were.
She worked with Barry that whole mission.

896
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:10,272
She was also talking about
some honeypot in Uzbekistan.

897
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:12,566
We never went to Uzbekistan.
That was Moldova.

898
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:13,692
She loves me!

899
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,987
She was giving them
chicken feed to protect us!

900
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,656
Why did she say she never loved you?

901
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:21,450
So it wouldn't hurt when she left.
It still did though.

902
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,869
Like when Charlie told Bumblebee
she didn't want him around.

903
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:26,205
Why else would she
purposely give false intel

904
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,499
unless she really had become
a member of the team

905
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:32,419
and… had fallen in love?

906
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,171
[Great Dane] Un pequeño problema.

907
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:39,134
I might have reported Tina's discrepancies
to Rusti and Igor back there,

908
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,719
to kinda knock her down a few pegs.

909
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,221
I did do it for you, Barry.

910
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,889
Broskis before Ruskies.

911
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,101
[tires squealing]

912
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,769
[ominous music playing]

913
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,562
Do you have any idea what you did?

914
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,856
You just got Tina killed.

915
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,525
[music fades]

916
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:55,442
Whoops.

917
00:44:56,735 --> 00:45:00,280
Let's get rid of that plant
and one of the filing cabinets.

918
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,740
Keep the coat rack.

919
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:04,284
-On it.
-[phone ringing]

920
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:08,455
This is your new kick-ass director,
Roo Russell.

921
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:10,999
Press two for the shitty
outgoing director.

922
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:14,044
Roo Roo, Tina was on our side.
She's one of us.

923
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,838
We have to get her back
or they'll kill her.

924
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,006
-Crap on a kaiser!
-[dramatic music playing]

925
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:21,552
The 7th floor is never gonna authorize
a mission onto Russian soil

926
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:24,388
to retrieve a confirmed Russian spy.

927
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,598
Then we do it without permission.
We go rogue.

928
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:29,893
He's right, pal.
We have to break into Russia.

929
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:32,229
[exhales sharply] Good luck with all that.

930
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,522
[laughing]

931
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,652
-[upbeat music playing]
-[Roo sighs]

932
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,613
Well, madam, it looks like
you're in charge of this mess.

933
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:47,411
What's that military term
for when everything goes totally to shit?

934
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,371
[music builds, ends]

935
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,748
[Roo sighs]

936
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,750
[closing theme playing]

937
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,948
[closing theme ends]
