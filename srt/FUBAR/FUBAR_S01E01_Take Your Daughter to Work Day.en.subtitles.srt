Come on. I don't want my family
living above the garage forever.

187
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,615
That makes two of us.

188
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,451
I have a PowerPoint.
I'll… I'll go get it from the apartment.

189
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,579
I don't want to invest in your startup.
That's it, and that's all.

190

I'm sorry, I…

I'm so sorry I'm late,

200
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:55,446
but I had to borrow some wrapping paper
from my chatty neighbor from 3C.

It's no problem.

-Wow, that looks yummy.
-It is.

203
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,743
-Can I help you with anything?
-Sure.

204
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,828
-Just making some bruschetta. Here.
-Okay.

205
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,413
So how was your trip?

206
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,123
Oh, don't ask me.

207
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,334
No one wants to lift
heavy weights anymore.

208

Everyone wants to go biking
with their digital friends.

209

Can't wait to sell my half of the business
to Barry and to be done with it.

210
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,428
What?

211

I'm serious.

Now when is Emma getting here?

215
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,979
Soon. She had to go pick up Carter.

216
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,731

Luke, get it out of your system
before he gets here. I'm warning you.

She likes "Romi."

-Right.
-[Romi] Mm-hm.

229

-[Luke] I missed you.
-[Romi] I missed you too.

230
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,933
I brought you
a little gift from my trip, okay?

231
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,059
Okay.

-Wow.

233
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,941
[Luke] You hide this in your jewelry box,
and when you're 18 years old,

234
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,985
I'll get you a really beautiful gift,
okay?

235

-Love you.
-[Romi] Love you too.

236
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,700
That is a Congolese warlord's diamond.
It's supposed to go into evidence.

237
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:23,826
It was just one.

238

-[woman 2] Hey, there we are.

Now you're leaving.

I know,
but for even better reasons than before.

246
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,222
I lobbied the governing body
of La Guajira,

247
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,433
and I just learned
they accepted our program.

248
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,769
So fresh water
to five times as many Colombians.

-I'm sorry.
-I thought it was funny.

00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,127
-I laughed.
-Thank you.

It's one more reason
to be so proud of you.

But I have to tell ya,

276
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,460
I'm a little bit concerned
about this La Guajira.

277
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,380
-It's a very volatile area.
-How do you know about that?

I Googled it.

Um, actually, the Global Fund has them
in a very secure location, Mr. Brunner,

280
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:11,517
um, and, statistically, most kidnappings
tend to be of American men.

281
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,269
That's great. Then you should go with her.

[Luke] Hm.

I didn't get here by myself.

I have a great idea. I'll go to the store
and get some cupcake mix,

00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,500
Not him, his son.

350
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,668
Boro?

351
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,962
Seems Papa's death motivated him.

352
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,339
Dedicated his life
to finishing what Daddy started.

353
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:33,218
That's impossible. I got him into
a boarding school in London.

354
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,554
-I know.
-He was going to study business.

355
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,849
He was going to be different than his dad.

356
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,184
You got half of what you wanted.

357
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,144
Graduated high school at 16,

358
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,562
Oxford at 20,

359
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,272
MBA from Wharton at 22,

360
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:47,399
all geared towards funding,
continuing and growing

361
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,735
what's left of his father's
paramilitary organization.

362
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,529
Lape Pa Lanmo now has over 400 members,

363
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:55,824
many living on his compound,
completely devoted to Boro,

364
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,993
the son of their fallen leader,

365
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,788
and to his cause of augmenting
their wealth, power, and influence

366
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,247
through illegal arms sales.

367
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,335
Specifically, with this suitcase nuke.

368
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,713
Complete with the reflector beryllium
to reduce fissile material mass,

369
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:10,631
thereby making it…

370
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,550
A WMD that can be taken anywhere,

371
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,345
and now Boro pulled it off.

372
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,973
Parental murder seems to be
quite the inspirational tool.

373
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,768
It's not my fault that the kid went south.

374
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,645
I even waited for him
to get off the compound

375
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,730
before I threw his father off the cliff.

376
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,690
Trying to be nice.

377
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,901
Boro has a man Troy.

378
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,445
He's in Yemen
meeting a potential bidder for the nuke.

379
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,947
Seems Boro's gonna hold an auction,

380
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,573
where the world's biggest and baddest

381
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,826
are gonna try to get their hands
on his weapon.

382
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,370
Intel says Troy's ascertained
Panda as a plant.

383
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,038
-Then pull the officer.
-We can't.

384
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,373
We've lost communication,

385
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,168
and since Boro forbids calls
from the Middle East for security reasons,

386
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,713
we have 36 hours till Troy's back
in Guyana and exposes Panda.

387
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:54,133
We need someone Boro already trusts

388
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,801
to get in his camp immediately.

389
00:18:58,762 --> 00:18:59,847
We need Finn Hoss.

390
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,014
Oh, no way.

391
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,683
Boro doesn't know Finn killed his old man.

392
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:05,561
He'll welcome the rich European mercenary,

393
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,937
his childhood hero,

394
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,857
the man who looked out for him
with open arms.

395
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,858
I said no.

396
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,025
Whoa, wait.

397
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,195
You'll represent bidders who paid more
for the WMD than anyone else.

398
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,282
You zip in, extract Panda,
grab the WMD, zip on out.

399
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,493
You tell HQ I'm retired.
That's it, and that's all.

they needed to pull you back into Guyana.

00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,699
[thunder cracking]

870
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,993
[groans] Double-time. Rain'll slow us.

871
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,035
Hey.

872
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:01,495
I'm sorry I cursed.

873
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,331
Dad, I don't give a shit.

874
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,588
[birds chirping]

875
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:17,052
Nuke's kept here in the north acreage,
away from the rest of the compound.

876
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,055
Best way there is through this stretch.
No one will see us.

877
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,349
-Set up?
-Steel construction Quonset hut.

878
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:27,354
Four guards, one at each compass point,
rotate every five hours.

879
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,231
All have AKs and MP7s.

880
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:30,983
But I've got one too,

881
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:34,111
and they can't shoot like I can. [exhales]

882
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,156
They don't know I have this.

883
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,407
Where did you get that?

884
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:40,659
Black market in town.

885
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,245
I started skimming cash
as soon as they assigned me admin detail.

886
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,956
So Jacomo got killed
because you were stealing?

887
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,042
Apparently.

888
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,460
[scoffs]

889
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:52,338
What? Jacomo was helping Boro
sell illegal weapons.

890
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:58,427
-What's that?
-The Charter Arms Pink Lady.

891
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,513
Small, easiest thing I could smuggle in
when I first got here.

892
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,392
Well, I think I should have the automatic.

893
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,311
I set the marksmanship score for my class.

894
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:10,773
So did I. And who knows even
if you're gonna be sober?

895
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:12,858
I mean, is this how I raised you?

896
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,026
Alcohol?

897
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:15,736
Cigarettes?

898
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,280
-And a garish lipstick--
-That's not lipstick.

899
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,948
-[groaning]
-Oh my God.

900
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,701
-[spluttering] It's vibrating. My God.
-Kill me now.

901
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:23,619
Purell!

902
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:25,371
Stop touching my things. Oh my God.

903
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,872
Tidy up before your dad comes to visit.

904
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:29,166
I didn't know
you were gonna be here, remember?

905
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,877
Transport is gonna be
at the airstrip in 30.

906
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,712
Can we please just focus on the job?

907
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:34,630
Yes, please.

908
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,006
Good because we gotta get--

909
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:38,217
-My God.
-Oh my God.

910
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,551
It's still buzzing.

911
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:41,303
-Oh God.
-Jesus. Okay.

912
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,680
Okay. Okay.

913
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,015
It's off. It's off, okay? It's off.

914
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,893
God, why are you here?

915
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,112
I never knew you hated me that much.

916
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,197
[slow piano music playing]

917
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:04,284
I don't hate you,

918
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:07,204
but I have every right to be furious

919
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:09,957
now that I know that
what I suspected all along was right.

920
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,875
You suspected I was an operative?

921
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:15,671
No, that it was 100% your fault
you and Mom got divorced.

922
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:18,132
But, Schatzel, now you know
why I was gone so much.

923
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:21,927
I tried to convince myself, you know,
"Dad has to travel for work."

924
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,679
[chuckles] "He's a small businessman."

925
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:27,099
"Clearly a very bad small businessman,
but, you know…

926
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:30,728
he's doing his best."

927
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,524
I wanted to beg you to sell that company,

928
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:37,609
to stay home.

929
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:43,365
But, you know, family situation
was tense enough with Mom always so sad.

930
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,659
She was sad?

931
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,205
-I thought she was angry.
-You could have taken a desk job.

932
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,291
Analytics, logistics, training.

933
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,336
You could've been home.
But no, you didn't want a desk job,

934
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,548
you wanted to run around the world
doing cool, sexy cases.

935
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,925
-That's not true.
-Yes, it is. You know how I know?

936
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,136
Because I like doing cool, sexy cases.

937
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,804
Difference is, I don't have a family.

938
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,975
I did everything I could
to make you wanna stay with us.

939
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,144
Sports, violin…

940
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:14,438
[scoffs] …math competitions.

941
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,858
But you loved all of those things,
and you were so good at it.

942
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,902
I wasn't good. I was perfect.

943
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,779
I thought if I could do everything right,

944
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:24,323
then no matter what
was going on with you and Mom…

945
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,534
How could you leave a perfect kid?

946
00:46:31,163 --> 00:46:34,708
And now I'm an adult
still pretending to be perfect

947
00:46:34,792 --> 00:46:38,295
because… I just got so goddamn used to it.

948
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,172
But you know what? That's-- It's great.

949
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,590
I'm so glad you know about my job

950
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:44,134
because now I can maybe
stop faking it in front of you.

951
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,721
-Sweetheart--
-No. We gotta get the suitcase ASAP.

952
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:50,140
Boro is gonna wake up,
he's gonna wonder where Troy is,

953
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,434
and it's not gonna take him
a long time to do the math.

954
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,311
[Boro] Finn Hoss, get out here!

955
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,604
[tense music playing]

956
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:59,191
-What do you think that means?
-It means Boro's math homework's done.

957
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:04,780
[door closes]

958
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:05,948
Where were you last night?

959
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,451
Troy had an offer for our weapon
for millions, and now he's gone missing.

960
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:10,786
Who the hell is Troy?

961
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,079
[Cain] I am a card player.

962
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,455
If we've never had a cheat in the game,

963
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,792
and money starts to go missing
when the new man sits at the table,

964
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:17,960
who do you think we suspect?

965
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,295
Usually,
the one who's doing all the talking.

966
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,172
Right now, you won't shut up.

967
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:23,966
I saw you exit the woods together.

968
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,052
I took your advice about Dani.

969
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,304
She is a tomcat.

970
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,223
That's why we were in the woods.

971
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,140

[screaming]

973
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,571
Maybe no one goes down
to the rice paddies this time of the year

974
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:46,905
because of all the flooding.

975
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:48,448
[music intensifies]

976
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,242
Sounds about right.

977
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:51,952
[Boro] Move!

978
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,120
Move. Out of the way.

979
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,673
The cut on Marcos' neck,

980
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:06,550
is it vertical?

981
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,845
Finn!

982
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:13,098
Barry, we need an evac
at the airstrip now.

983
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:14,892
[Boro] Go! Find them!

984
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,894
They do not leave this compound!

985
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,730
You find him, and you bring him to me. Go!

986
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,773
They do not leave this compound!

987
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,873
No. I slipped a note under his door
before we went after Troy.

988
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,004
-What if he's a loyalist to Boro?
-He would've shot us already.

989
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,422
They're not coming with us.

990
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,590
We're not with Boro.

991
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:47,507
[engine revs]

992
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,426
They're getting close.
We've got to do this now.

993
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:52,137
I am so done doing things
just to please you.

994
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,432
I don't have my gun.

995
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,684
-I have to go hand-to-hand.
-No.

996
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:03,315
Barry, within 50 yards of our location,

997
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,192
there are probably
seven to eight cell phones.

998
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,278
The one with the weakest signal
will be wired to the nuke

999
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:10,155

1000
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,366

1001
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:13,617
[Barry] On it.

1002
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,701
What are you doing?

1003
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,370
Top of a hill,

1004
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:20,082
there are two bulls that are looking down
at a bunch of beautiful cows.

1005
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:21,833
The younger says to the older,

1006
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:24,795
"Why don't we just run down
and make love to one of them?"

1007
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,463
And the older one says,

1008
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,008
"Why don't we just walk down
and make love to all of them?"

1009
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:31,885
Know what it is about?

1010
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,012
It's about not rushing into things.

1011
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,264
Sounds like it's about cow rape.

1012

-Emma.
-I'm okay. Just take him out.

1022
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,409
We're bouncing all over the place.
I can't get a shot off.

1023
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:38,910
They were able to hit me.
