173
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,127
I appreciate the letter.

174
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,381
And for what it's worth, I was wrong.
You'd have made a great regional director.

175
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,176
-Thanks.
-Better than Reed, anyway.

[grunting]

178
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,983
[Chips] Yes, yes. Come on! Come on!

179
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,153
[panting]

180
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:52,323
-I don't think I can do this anymore.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

181
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,242
We're so close to getting this done.

182
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,952
No, no. Come on. You can't break down now.

183
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,954
-[alarm blaring]
-Let me relieve you. Come on.

184
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:58,913
All right.

185
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,292
[Chips inhales sharply, exhales]

186
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,961

-Let me get this.
-[grunts]

191
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,304
It's… it's stuck. It's…

192
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,265
You think-- I think it's just jammed.

193
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,561
-[Chips exhales sharply]
-[grunting]

194
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,854
I mean, I loosened it for you.

195
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,441
[Chips laughing]

196
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,945
-He's a real-life Hercules. Look at him.
-[Luke] It's speeding up.

197
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,447
[breathing heavily]

198
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,493
Water's rushing the turbine chamber.

199
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,329
[machine whirring]

200
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,914
-Get back! Get back!
-[Chips] Come on!

201
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,673
The water's back in.
We're refilling the energy storage depot.

202
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,008
That should give us a few hours.

203
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,343
What do you mean a few hours?
We fixed the problem.

204
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,054
Imagine an above-the-ground pool
with multiple holes in it.

205
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,098
You try to refill the pool
with buckets of water.

206
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,600
Yes, you're adding to the pool,

207
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,644
just like this one turbine
is adding to the storage depot,

208
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,772
but it will never make up for the amount
of water flowing out of the pool,

209
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,524
because this plant has
three defunct turbines.

210
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,486
So after everything that we've just done,
the whole thing is gonna shut down anyway?

211
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,863
You bought us a few hours.

212
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,073
Barry, did you hear all of that?

213
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,035
He's right. In a few hours,
the whole country's out of power.

214
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,370
And we'll descend into chaos.

215
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:26,417
Unless we unclog
the three turbines that aren't working.

216
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,461
Okay, so we use a jackhammer.

217
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,047
You jackhammer that polymer coating,
you destroy the hardware.

218
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,008
What if we can remove the polymers
without any damage?

219
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,426
Well, then you'd be a wizard.

220
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,887
[Barry] Or a guy who got an A-plus
in AP Chemistry.

221
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,015
I found this research paper
from Vanderbilt University.

222
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,267
It seems that if you mix
sulfuric acid with water,

223
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,227
you can create an exothermic reaction

224
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,313
that will eat away
at this specific polymer,

225
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,607
leaving the blades unharmed.

226
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,568
Based off the size of the dam,
the amount of water flow,

227
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,737
20 industrial barrels of acid will do it.

228
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,073
Where am I gonna get
20 barrels of acid? Come on.

229
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:59,241
I don't know, but I'm going to find out.

230
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,912
[panting] Okay. Okay. I… I can't…

231
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,915
-I can't run anymore. [panting]

[Donnie groans]

235
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:19,845
I just got a look at myself.

236
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,392
I was on the altar.

237
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,394
I had my suit on, the music was playing.

238
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,021
-Tally looked gorgeous.
-Oh.

239
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,024
I always wanted a family.
With her, I was gonna get an instant one.

240
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,902
Two grown kids and a grandchild.

241
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,948
Everything I ever wanted.

242
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,409
Things were actually
working out for old Donnie.

243
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,412
And then… [mimics explosion]

244
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,665

[inhales sharply, exhales]

246
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,169
Okay.

247
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,171
Them's the breaks though, right?

248
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,759
Well, that sounds like heavy stuff.
Do you wanna keep talking about it, or…

249
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,386
-No.
-Why not?

250

Oh man, there's no way we're getting
out of here without them seeing us.

258
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,279
Wait. The PCP I've been hiding
in my prison wallet.

259
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,989
You stole their PCP?

260
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,532
-[Donnie] I snagged some.
-What the--

261
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,826
-Uh…
-[laughing]

262
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,745
Donnie, that is like

263

in your hands right now.

264
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,706
I'll do a little.
Supposed to give you super strength.

265
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,082
-No way.
-Just a bump.

266
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,751
Like they do on cop shows, right?

267
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,003
Dip my pinkie in it,
rub it on my gum, say it's pure.

Barry, you better come up
with a solution now.

365
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,859
Think I got something.
There's a quarry 1.1 miles from there.

366
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,361
They use commercial-grade sulfuric acid
to leach copper.

367
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,572
But you're gonna need
hundreds of gallons of that stuff.

411
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,068
And if you send us to jail,
they likely have contacts in there,

412
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,361
and we will be killed.

upon proof of your death.

492

If I don't deliver this proof,

493
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,433
then Cress will kill me
and my whole family!

-Like on TV, huh?
-That's not a thing.

498

Next time I'll hear from him

499
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:08,029
is when I get paid for sending proof
that you are in the ground,

500
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,992
or when he sends assassins for me
because you are still alive.

501
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,036
So either I get paid today, or I die.

like a normal person.

00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,083
Brunner. Big guys
always get the lookers, don't they?

518
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,961
Anyway, you get your money
into one of these slots

519
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,379
at the bottom of the game.

520
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,756
That's the bank.

521
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,966
Dante sends the money
from a slot at the top,

522
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,677
but there's not a straight line
you can follow back up.

523
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,931
It bounces off a million tiny pins
on the way down.

524
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,601
Dante sends 75 separate deposits
that add up to the amount owed.

525
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,187
And remember that disc?
It breaks off into five different discs.

526
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,607
Some are invisible, some are made
of steam, some bounce backwards.

527
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,818
It's a maze inside of a puzzle
inside of an escape room.

528
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,529
No one can tell what's going on.

529
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,697
No one can track
this amount of data simultaneously.

530
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,533
That's bullshit, and you know it.

531
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,702
You were able to manipulate
all those bank transfers

532
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,454
when you were stealing money from the CIA.

533
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,165
And you were able to track
and expose Tina.

534
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,500
Sorry about that.

535
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:44,626
My point is,

536
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:48,171
if there's anyone that can help us
figure out a way around this Plinko mess…

537

[intriguing music playing]

538
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,299
…it's you.

539
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,302
All right.

540
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,892
Looks like it's up to Farkas
to save the world.

so many times.

00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:07,899
Ew.

Local PD.

547
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:11,945
I better go explain to them

548
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,905
why you made me kill
all those people out there.

549
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:14,864

Yeah. Uh, I tased a cop.

00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,569
-He has to get to the hospital.
-Yeah.

564

You can't be here

I don't know what the hell you did,
but it looks real fucking bad.

It's actually a lot worse than it looks.

568
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,288
Dump the cop car here.
I'll blame it on the guys I killed.

-I killed eight guys.

do you know when Emma lands?

00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:42,369
I don't like that whirlybird.
They had mechanical issues in Kuwait.

She should be on the ground very soon.

I see what's going on.

You have an interest for my daughter.

I just want you to know,
don't waste too much time

591

because you have no chance.

592
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:01,805
Why do you say that?

593
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,599
Because you're unstable,
and, uh, you're all over the place.

594
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,059
You're kind of like a loose cannon.

right now in her life.

Cress gave you.

Soon as the payment's sent,

00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,893
the algorithm should trail it
back to Cress' location.

-[computer beeps]
-I got a hit!

639
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,892
What the hell? The deposit
went into some kind of FinSec hub.

640
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,102
-A what hub?
-[Farkas] FinSec hub.

641
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,563
A financial security hub? Anyone?

642
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:19,275
It operates on the dark web.
It's like a giant digital washing machine.

643
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,778
I didn't think we'd run into something
like this after the Plinko board.

644
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,988
It's like having padlocks
on top of your deadbolts.

645
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,407
Yes, but what the hell is it?

646
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:32,372
Every money transfer
has a 32-digit transaction ID.

647
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,207
When a security hub is in play,

648
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,753
it takes all those transactions
and gives them a new code to clean it.

649
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,256
Then the new code
goes through the big Plinko machine

650
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:44,092
before getting deposited
into Nonna's account,

651
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,720
which means all the data we traced
back here leads us to a dead end.

652
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:51,057
Because all of the information
that could lead us to Cress' location,

653
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:55,353
like his, uh, IP address for example,
we no longer have.

654
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,855
So, shit!

655
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:57,856
[softly] Hey, hey.

656
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,109
So, what do we do now?

657
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:04,779
If we get Cress to send another deposit,
I can stop it from being scrubbed.

658
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:08,575
But only for like a split-second delay,
so that I can read the real data

659
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,702
before it gets sent off
and is changed permanently.

660
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,037
Except Cress isn't making
any more deposits.

661
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,456
The hoses are ready. Send in the acid.

662
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,543
Okay, we deal with Cress later.
Right now we have to save the grid.

663
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,295
Here we go.

-[Greta] Liebling!
-[guns cocking]

665
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,091
I can't let you do that.

666
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:30,430
Look, whatever you're thinking of doing,
it's a bad idea.

667
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:33,057
I'm thinking I don't want to blow you up
along with that tanker,

668
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,268
so please, step aside.

669
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,353
[Reed] How the hell
did she get the drop on us?

670
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:41,065
She dressed the part. You can get anywhere
with confidence and the right outfit.

671
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,650
Luke, you can't let her fire.

672
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,653
We need the acid to unclog the turbines
before time runs out.

673
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,989
Look, Greta, just relax.

674
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:50,325
Okay? And then you and I talk.

675
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,161
-All right?
-There's nothing to talk about.

676
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,996
You shoot me or my team,

677
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:58,249
and our fingers twitch,
and it's bye-bye tanker.

[helicopter hovering]

679
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,544
There's no way you're saving this dam.

680
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,547
Friends of yours?

681
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,965
[epic music playing]

682
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,980
Drop your weapons.

683
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:23,900
Roo, Emma, stand down.

684
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,610
Chips, you too.

685
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,363
-I can take her.
-Emma, don't do it.

686
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,739
[music fades]

687
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,700
I love her.

688
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,910
[mellow music playing]

689
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,122
Did he just drop the L bomb?

690
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:41,834
[Tally inhales sharply]

691
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:42,752
[music fades]

692
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,253
If you really wanna get back at him,

693
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,214
you can look me up
in the employee directory,

694
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,757
Marcus A. Farkas.

695
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,387
All of the feelings that I had for you,
they came back.

696
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,513
Are you shitting me?

697
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:57,141
I tried to fight it, but I just… can't.

698
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:59,185
Chips told me how you felt.

699
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,105
I feel the same way.

700
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,399
I've always known
we were meant to be together.

701
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:07,485
And I always knew you that were better
than the people you work for.

702
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:12,281
Greta, you're a wonderful person.
You would never harm any innocent people.

703
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:17,203
So let's just stop all this madness,
and you and I go off together.

704
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:19,580
Boss, I will cut off your dick-stick.

705
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,501
I need to see this through.
You know how Cress operates.

706
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,211
He already paid half the money up front.

707
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,923
So either I shut down the grid,
or he'll kill me, or worse.

708
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:34,053
I need you to move. Now.

709
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,930
I don't want to have to shoot you.

710
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,307
I love you too.

711
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,059
[Reed] This is such bullshit.

712
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,603
-Emma, take the shot.
-[Emma] What about the finger twitch?

713
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,064
She's in love with him.
She won't pull any triggers. Do it.

714
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,817
Wait. Farkas, you said
if Cress makes another payment,

715
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,193
we could track his location.

716
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,989
Can the Green Lantern
recharge his power ring using his lantern?

717
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,241
None of us know that,
because we've all had sex.

718
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,493
[Luke] Now hear me out, Greta.

719
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:01,289
We turn off the power, then Cress
will make another payment to you.

720
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:05,209
And then Farkas can track his payment,
which will lead us directly to Cress.

721
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,170
Then we can turn the power back on again.

722
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:10,923
Cress will know that I betrayed him.
I'll be signing my death warrant.

723
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,885
-Not if we get to Cress first.
-[Farkas] Cress uses offshore accounts.

724
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:17,305
The power's only going out in the US,
so his bank won't be affected.

725
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,307
Even if he's in the U.S.,
he can use a sat phone.

726
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,976
-What about right here?
-The CIA has backup generators.

727
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,936
Look, this is a win-win for you.

728
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,190
Cress will be under arrest,
therefore he cannot harm you anymore,

729
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,483
and you get the money.

730
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,652
And then we can run away together?

731
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,155
Wherever we want to go.

732
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,282
[Greta] We'll alI lower our guns on three?

733
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,533
Are you all insane?

734
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:40,036
No, we're not putting
the US power grid down for even a second

735
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,580
just so Hansel and Gretel can live
on a Bora Bora beach house.

736
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,665
Luke Brunner, you are relieved of command.

737
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,210
Emma Brunner, you are CEO.
Now pull the damn trigger,

738
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,087
or kiss Unit 9 goodbye.

739
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,963
My daughter would never
listen to you over me.

740
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,674
Oh yeah? Well, she says she believes
your judgment is compromised.

741
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:57,804
Emma?

742
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:01,224
[Reed] Your decision-making is affected
'cause of your feelings for Greta.

743
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,810
She also asked
to be put in charge of the team.

744
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,438
Schatzel, did you turn me in?

745
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:10,316
Can you blame me?

746
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:14,821
No.

747
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,950
-But you must trust me in this.
-[Reed] Don't listen to him.

748
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,869
Sweetheart, look me in the eyes.

749
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,164
You know your father
would never do anything to hurt you.

750
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,792
Emma, this is your chance
to leave your dad's shadow.

751
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,589
-Am I really in command?
-[Reed] Damn right you are.

752
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,590
All right.

753
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,300
[breathing heavily]

754
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,218
Then as CO…

755
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,428
we're backing my dad.

756
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:41,931
Son of a bitch!

757
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,891
[Tally inhales, exhales]

758
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,934
This better work.

759
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:47,687
You're out of your mind if you think
we're getting on Cress' shit list.

760
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:48,813
Oh shut up.

761
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,568
You know, this is a little bit awkward,
but I haven't been paid

762
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,903
my last paycheck for the last week.

763
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,447
-[alarm blaring]
-[dramatic music playing]

764
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,449
-[computer beeping]
-That was the last one.

765
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,285
Acid worked, sludge dissolved.

766
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,536
All turbines back online.

767
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,621
So I guess all that's left to do
is to turn them off.

768
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,123
Right there.

769
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,794
All right. Are we ready, team?

770
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,546
Autobots ready to roll out?

771
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:17,049
-Goonies never say die.
-[Greta] Do I actually need this thing?

772
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:20,178
I don't understand a word they're saying,
but somehow I know it's lame.

773
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:24,098
Well, sadly, you get used to it.
All right, we shut down the power. Now!

774
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,352
-Don't look at me.
-[scoffs] I'm not doing it.

775
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,812
What? This thing?

780
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,289
Huh. Fits good.

Hey, baby.

[Nonna] It wasn't.

00:36:56,797 --> 00:37:00,384
[man on TV] I've got a great job this week
of announcing the Star Baker.

786
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,179
And this week's Star Baker is…

787
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:04,931
[TV powers down]

788
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:07,850
All bets stand
until the power comes back on.

789

Mrs. Turtletaub,
if you look up the winner,

790
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,730
-I'm gonna fuck you up.
-[dramatic music playing]

791
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,233
Shouldn't I be out for this?

792
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,945
Well, we're still flushing PCP
out of your system, so we've gone local.

793
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,155
But relax, you're in safe hands.

794

Scalpel.

795
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:23,783
Okay.

796

-[blood splatters]
-Whoops.

797
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:29,956
-[phone chimes]
-I just got the payment.

[tense music playing]

[Farkas] AI algorithm is running.
There it is.

A $250 million transaction.

801
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,714
Pulling the transaction data
and just got the IP address.

802
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,633
-And sending it to Barry.
-Got it.

803
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:43,177
Running a trace
on the IP address. Yahtzee!

804
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:47,223
Cress made a payment from a location
on Killermont Street in Port Jarvis.

805
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,308
-That's pretty far from us.
-[Aldon] But not from me.

806
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,103
-Nonna, gotta go. Bye.
-[Hamsteak snorting]

Okay.

Backup's on the way, Aldon.

809
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,694
What? Farkas, what?

810
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:03,281
There's something about that town.
Port Jarvis. Sounds familiar.

811
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,827
Tina. When OTS dumped her phone,

812
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,870
it showed that Tina
had visited Port Jarvis.

813
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,790
Sir, I know you're not on board
with all of this,

814
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:16,168
but you have to authorize having Tina
transferred so we can question her.

815
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,838
She's a captured spy
being held under the Espionage Act.

816
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,923
I'm not pulling her out
without an okay from Langley.

817
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,634
-There's no time for that!
-Then she'll stay where she is.

818
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:26,178
Well, then I'll just get her down here
on some medical pretense.

819
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,764
-I'll be right back.
-You'll find her in the infirmary.

820
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,725
-What?
-I put her there.

821
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,602
So, Emma, I… I don't want things
to be awkward between us.

822
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:36,814
-I may be your new stepmom someday.
-Oh God, kill me now.

823
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,857
Power's back on.

-[Chips] Ah.
-[Roo exhales]

825
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,735
Finally, I can unclench.

826
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:44,155
You know, it's funny,
us Brits actually pronounce it "unclench."

827
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,240
[Barry] Uh, Luke? Bit of a problem.

828
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,993
The grid's back up, but the DEFCON scale
dropped down to level one.
