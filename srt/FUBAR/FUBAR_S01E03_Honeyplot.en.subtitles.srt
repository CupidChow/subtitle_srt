[tense music playing]

2
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,475
I have a heart condition.

3
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:24,691
-And I'll be a--
-Hey, we'll figure this out.

4
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,359
-It'll be okay.
-[Roo] Will it, new girl?

5
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,029
From here, it looks like
the train's gonna radiate our nuts.

6
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,739
Au contraire, mon frÃ¨re,
don't make that move.

7
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,157
I have to cut power to magnets.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,534
The train will drop from the tracks
and detonate like a dirty bomb,

9
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,411
destroying your country's ability
to grow food.

10
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,455
I'm no farmer,
but I'm pretty sure famine's bad.

11
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,750
My wife and son are asleep
five minutes from here.

12
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,252
I have to derail it
before it reaches Nur-Sultan.

13
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,504
-Our friends are on that train.
-Screw everyone else.

14
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,173
We're in the path of that soul train,

15
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,176
so I have a vested interest
in stopping it too, just not this way.

16
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,345
You are not inspectors.
You could be with terrorists.

17
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,847
We're undercover CIA.

18
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,515
Then show me your identification.

19
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,726
Do I really have to explain
"undercover" to you?

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,189
-You move, I'll shoot!
-Then my hand will fall on the switch.

[tense music playing]

22
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,818
I have an idea, but it's dangerous.

23
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,362
More dangerous than an out-of-control
nuclear bullet train?

24
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,655
Good point.

25
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,199
If cooling the magnets
speeds the train up,

26
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,534
then warming them
would slow it down, right?

27
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,661
If I could just
pump something hot in there.

28
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,372
-That's what Donnie's thinking.
-Nuclear sludge. It's warm.

29
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,708
Yes. Open the window to the tanker car,

30
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,919
I'll go up, grab the hose,
and feed it through.

31
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,463
No. The train is going too fast.
It will blow you off.

32
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,298
If I don't try, we could all die.

33
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,342
Well, if you do try,
you'll definitely die.

34
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,927
We can't do nothing.

35
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,389
I might have a plan.

36
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,891
[tense music continues]

37
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,147
If we move real closely together,
this should work.

38
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,607
I can't believe you brought these.

39
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,567
Thought we could use them in our downtime.

40
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,945
Okay, here's the plan. I go outside,

41
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,114
and you anchor me
through the aluminum roof.

42
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,658
I'm half your size.
Less surface area for the wind to grab me.

43
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,118
I can't let you go out there.

44
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,578
-Chief, only Emma's way works.
-What could possibly happen?

45
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,498
She could fly off and hit the rock
at a hundred miles an hour.

46
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,708
There's a downside,
but we need to get this done.

47
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,793
I can do thisâ€¦

48
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,131
but I need your help.

00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,752
I'm almost there.

54
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,466
-This thing is all over the place.
-[Aldon] You have to wrestle it down.

55
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,427
We're running out of track fast.

56
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,888
-Just be careful.
-[Emma] Dad, I can't reach it.

57
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,765
You gotta let me go so I can leap for it.

58
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,684
No, that's too big of a risk.

59
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,770
If I don't get this thing,
we all die anyway.

60
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,022
I said no.

61
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,734
When I was little,

62
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,696
you used to toss me in the air
and then catch me.

63
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,656
You never missed.

64
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,782
I trust you.

65
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,034
I missed once.

66
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,204
You bounced off the ottoman,
and your mother was really pissed off.

67
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,331
I don't wanna be that guy,
but ticktock, Luke.

68
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,416
Dad, I did what Dr. Pepper said.

69
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,001
I asked you for help.

70
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,878
Now it is your turn.

71
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,796
You have to listen to me.

72
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,632
Please, just let me go.

I got you, baby.

81
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,245
I got you.

82
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,791
You gotta pull the hose
back into the conductor's booth

83
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,293
and attach it to the fuel valve
next to the nitrogen tank.

84
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,338
[Tina] It's uniform with the tanker valve,
so the hose should fit into place.

[Emma breathes deeply]

86
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,674
Flip the pump switch next to it.

87
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,098
-Magnet's already warming.
-We have steady deceleration.

88
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,266
[Emma] We're slowing.

[triumphant music playing]

90
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,477
I think we did it.

91
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,064
I think we did.

[exhales]

93
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,818
It's stopped. It's over.

94
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,656
-You're not part of this, Borat.
-Yeah, you're not part of it.

[light rock music playing]

96
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,330
But the bottom line is,
we didn't catch Boro,

97
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,082
and Boro didn't get what he needed.

98
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,084
So, for now, a tie is as good as a win.

99
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,378
What are you, my daughter's soccer coach?

100
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,338
I want Boro on a plate.

101
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,009
Also wanna know how Kazakhstan
almost turned into a nuclear wasteland.

102
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,136
-Oh, uh--
-A technical glitch.

103

Static on the comms.

104
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,473
We misheard the number of valves to flood.

105
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,683
Really?

106
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,686
Get some rest while you can.

107
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,187
I've already got a dozen operatives

108
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,107
sweeping every digital signal
on the planet looking for Boro.

109
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,693
Once we get a bite,
you're off the sidelines.

110
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:19,694

111
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,362
[Luke sighs]

112
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,283
Appreciate you covering for me.

113
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,952
I appreciate you
listening to me on the train.

114
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,705
[exhales]
It wasn't easy letting you go like that.

115
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,416
Never has been.

116
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,461
All surveillance of Donnie stops,

117
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,339
or I narc you out to Dot and Mom.

118
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:41,758
Right.

119
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,468
Hey, Barry,

120
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,429
shut down Operation Don Juan.

121
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,016
And I googled "cuckolding."

122
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,019
I owe you an apology.

123
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,020
[Barry] Copy that.

124
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,064
Satisfied?

125
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,065
For now.

126
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,902
If you don't mind, I need to make a call.

127
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,739
[door closes]

00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,242

Butt.

131
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,750
Hey, hey!
You're, uh, already back at the office?

132
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,128
Hey. Um, yeah, I should be done
in the next few hours.

133
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:23,883
Look, I was thinking about
this whole Nana Pat situation.

134
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,969
I know you hate being lied to,

135
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,263
especially by somebody who loved you,

136
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,017
but maybe she lied to you
because she loves you.

137
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,019
I mean, she didn't have much, right?

138
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,731
Then she gives you this clock
and tells you this whole story

139
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,150
because she knows
it's gonna make you happy. And it did.

140
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,652
Until I learned the truth.

141
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,279
Exactly. Maybe the truth is overrated.

142
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,742
I mean, maybe lying isn't always so bad.

143
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,703
That's the exact opposite
of everything I teach my students,

144
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,249
but, uh, yeah, I guess I could
cut Nana Pat some slack.

145
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,208
Cool.

146
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:02,130
Hey, umâ€¦ I was thinking

147
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,842
maybe we could play
some of those Lee Fields songs

148
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,429
and, I don't knowâ€¦ have a wild night

149
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,889
sanding and staining that clock.

150
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:16,060
I bought some top-shelf wood stain

151
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,062
from the hobby store down the street.

152
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:18,980
Is that Russian?

153
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,107
The guy said it's the best.

154
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,443
All right. That sounds good.
I'll make up a cheese plate.

155
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,569
I love you.

156
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,028
And thatâ€¦ is no lie.

157
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,364
-I love you too.
-[knocking at door]

158
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,118
Hey, Roo and I are gonna go grab
a "post-save the world" lager. You in?

159
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,954
I-- I can't. I have plans.

160
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:35,955
[Aldon] Next time then.

161
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,582
I mean, after what you pulled off today,

162
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,209
I'm sure there'll be
other opportunities for celebrations.

163
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,378
Amazing work, seriously.

164
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,588
Ciao, bella.

00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,557
I put the table saw in the garage.

168
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,643
You could have held onto that.
No one but you ever needs it.

169
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,854
I don't have any room for it.

170
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,857
Umâ€¦ lookâ€¦

171
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,526
I don't need the table saw.

172
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,740
It's just thatâ€¦ Donald is the first guy
that you've gotten serious with,

173
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,742
and so it's really weird

174
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,745
when another man has family dinners

175
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,788
with my family.

176
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:21,250
So if you ever have
an extra spot for me at the tableâ€¦

177
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,463
I would love to get an invite.

178
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,049
How about right now?

179
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,885
I can throw
some leftover lasagna in the oven.

180
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,303
I would love it.

181
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,221
Good.

Boro.

185
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,411
Hello, William.

186
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,122
You may have escaped Guyana,
but you can't escape me.

187
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,624
-[groans]
-Shh!

188
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,627
Let me explain.
You had a job interview yesterday.

189
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,878
[groans]

190
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,088
I hope it went well.

191
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,132
Anyway,

192
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:12,635
you were leaving the buildingâ€¦

193
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,345
A man got out of a truck.

194
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:17,890
And we sprayed you with chloroform, andâ€¦
here you are.

195
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,559
[whimpers]

196
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,520
Now, I assume you'd like to go home
to your wife and child?

197
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,021
Oh, please.

198
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,900
Wellâ€¦ all you have to do

199
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,945
is tell me everything you know

200
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:33,864
about Finn Hoss and Danielle DeRosa.

201
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,452
What did you learn
when you were all betraying me together?

202
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,705
I-- I don't know.

203
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,415
Iâ€¦

204
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,419
[whimpers] I don't know.

205
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,796
What did they say?!

[tense music playing]

207
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,716
What did you hear?!

208
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,134
Where were they going?!

209
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,885
I don't know! We were being shot at!

210
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:57,388
-What did they tell you?!
-Nothing!

211
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,016
They were arguing. I couldn't hear.

212
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,060
He called her Emma!

213
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,438
[music ends]

214
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,189
-Emma?
-Yeah.

215
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,233
Finn called her Emma.

216
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,611
And she plays the violin.

217
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:16,032
I heard him say something about
her hurting her violin arm.

218
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,825
Emma. Violin.

219
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:21,329
That's all I know, Boro! I swear it!

220
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,122
[William whimpers]

221
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,041
Okay.

222
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:27,877
Emma.

223
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,588
Violin.

224
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,050
Good job, Will.

225
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,556
Cut off his leg,
in case there's something else he forgot.

226
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,474
[William] No!

227
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:46,479
[William screaming] Wait! No! Please!

228
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,939
No!

229
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,025
[saw grinding]

230
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,281
This man said his name was Finn Hoss.

231
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,993
He said he was my father's friend

232
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,454
and my friend.

233
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,667
All lies.

234
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,961
He murdered my father.

235
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,756
He's an evil man

236
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,509
intent on doing evil things.

237
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,221
He's dangerous,

238
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,474
and he needs to be stopped
before he hurts others.

239
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,939
The only way this will happen
is if you help me find him.

240
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,860
What I have told you and this photograph

241
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,071
is all I have to go on.

242
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,324
[tense music plays]

243
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:44,078
Finn Hoss is affiliated
with an untrustworthy American

244
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:47,998
who goes by Emma and plays the violin.

245
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,127
All we know

246
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:52,920
is "Emma"â€¦

247
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,464
and "violin."

248
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,760
Find her.

249
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:02,972
Find Finn.

250
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,808
Whoever does

251
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,853
gets one million US dollars.

-[Luke] Live it here.

-You too.

-[Roo] Cheers to that.
-Cheers.

264
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,675
And to the Tally-Ho.

265
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,555
-What's that?
-You're standing on her.

266
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,432
It's a gesture to win my wife back.

-You think that one through, chief?
-It's a British call to action.

268

To move forward.

It's the Tally-Ho.

270
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,781
Uh-oh. Shit.
I just had it painted on this morning.

271

At least the princess isn't here
to go tattle to Mommy.

Oh, you really--
Like, you really hate this guy, huh?

275
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:13,834
Is he, like, super handsome,
or rich, or something?

276
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,377
Yeah, or something. That's right.

277
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:17,338

Why'd you invite the NSA stooge?

285
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,522
She did good work on the train job.
I figured she'd wanna see a cool boat.

286
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:37,066
-[Luke] It's not a boat. It's a ship.
-[Roo] Ew.

-You have a crush on her.
-What?

You wanna get naked
and push your stuff together.

289
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,239
No. She is a co-worker.

290
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,157
Then why is your right temple pulsating?

it'd be buzzing like a bee's butthole.

No, I'm single as a dollar bill.

-Good.
-This is a bot alert that I set up.

300
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,387
Just for you, or maybe you wanna share?

301
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,556
Uh, well, I set up an algorithm--

302
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,099
-[Roo] What?
-Use your outside voice.

305
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,148

that might be just tangentially related

306
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,068

about a Moldovan scientist
who was kidnapped in Ireland.

313
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,292
His research focused
on repurposing radioactive waste.

314
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,793
Could be a coincidence.

315
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:38,752
Could be a lead.

-Couple hours.

You know, I can grab Emma on the way
if that makes things easier for you.

324
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,524
No, that's okay. I will pick her up.
We need to talk anyway.

at the car wash in two hours.

-Yes. Oh yeah.

but, you know, sometime.

00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,983
[splutters]
It'd be crazy for right now, right?

351
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,151
Orâ€¦ or that'd just be crazy?

352
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,905
Because, like, you--
You always said you wanted kids.

353
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,031
Yeah, yeah.

354
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,159
Yeah, in theory.

355
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,202
Butâ€¦ [sighs]

356
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,745
â€¦lately, I'veâ€¦ [chuckles]

357
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:41,417
I've been thinking about families
and how easy it is to screw them up.

358
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,503
Ye-- Yeah, it is.

359
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,838
But why would ours--

360
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,798
Our-- Ours wouldn't be screwed up.

361
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,174
No. No, it'd be great.

362
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,175
-It's just--
-Yeah.

363
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,304
We're putting the cart before the horse.
We're not even engaged. [chuckles]

364
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,933
No, um, but we will be soon enough, right?

365
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,270
And then, you know,
we're gonna want a family,

366
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,397
so, like, it can't hurt to talk about,

367
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,193
you know, how we'd wanna raise kids,
where we'd wanna raise them,

368
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,279
some sort of work-life balance.

369
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,782
What do you mean work-life balance?

370
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:15,951
Oh man.

371
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:20,330
Uh, just the balance
between work and life.

372
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,209
You know, uhâ€¦

373
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,587
[whispers] Shit.

374
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,214
Okay, we've both got jobs, right? Okay?

375
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,718
Yoursâ€¦ takes you away a lot.

376
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,053
Sorry, I'm confused.

377
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,388
Are you saying that

378
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,893
you aren't sure that I could be
a good mom because I work?

379
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,312
No. No, no, no. God, no. No.

380
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,648
I'm just saying that personally,

381
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,862
uh, I think I benefited from having
my mother at home when I was a kid.

382
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,655
-Unreal.
-What?

383
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,117
If the roles were reversed,
if I was a teacher and you had my job,

384
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,661
no one would even ask you
if you could handle it.

385
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,748
It would just be expected
that I would stay home with the baby.

386
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,793
Okay, that's-- That's not what I'm saying.

387
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,046
It's what you insinuated,
even if you don't realize it.

388
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,048
Let's not do this, okay?

389
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,801
We don't need to fight, um,
or whatever this is.

390
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,011
I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry.

391
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,763
I just, umâ€¦

392
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,850
You're right. You're right.
We're not even engaged.

393
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,061
-[door opens]
-[Luke] Knock, knock.

394
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,479
I'm sorry I'm disturbing.

395
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,524
I just wanted to check
if Emma is available for lunch.

396
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,734
Maybe at this new burger place
at the car wash.

397
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:36,281
Sure, Dad. Ifâ€¦ if Carter's willing
to keep an eye on Romi.

398
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,783
[smacks lips] Of course.

399
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,827
Yeah, I'll stay home with the baby.

400
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,832
-Were you eavesdropping?
-No.

401
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,376
I was just coming to pick you up.

402
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,962
Can't I see my own daughter
in my own house anymore?

403
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,797
Hasn't been your house for 15 years.

404
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,465
Tell this to my mortgage payments.

405
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,593
-Hey, guys.
-Hey. Perfect timing.

406
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,429
Look at this.
Who's the schlepper? Oh, it's Donnie.

407
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,848
-Hey, Luke. Emma, hi.
-[Luke] Yeah.

408
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,058
Hey, I have good news. I got the Oden.

409
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,810
-Your ship?
-Here.

410
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,395
[Tally] Wow.

411
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,647
It'sâ€¦ Wow.

412
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,649
-Wait until you go out on it.
-[Donnie] I wish.

413
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:14,153
But I can't. I got an ear thing.
Get seasick very easily.

414
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,321
Oh, that's okay. I didn't ask you.

415
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,742
That's a very sweet offer,
but work's crazy.

416
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,870
HR is overwhelmed downsizing.

417
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,247
It's terrible.
Good people losing their jobs--

418
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,126
Yeah, the firings are rough.
I keep telling her she'll get used to it.

419
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:32,921
-That's what I'm afraid of.
-But, Tally, you're kind, you're caring.

420
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,841
If anyone can make the co-workers
feel that there's still hope,

421
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,302
that things will work out
even in the darkest hours,

422
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,428
it's you.

423
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,138
You have a big heart.

424
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,931
Even when we ended our marriage,

425
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,393
you still made me feel that there's hope,
that things will work out.

426
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,438
I guess. Kinda.

427
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,983
And things did work out for you.

428
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,359
You're okay.

429
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,694
[gentle piano music playing]

430
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:56,653
Not yet,

431
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,989
but I still have hope.

432
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,035
-Okay, cool. Shall we go?
-Yeah.

433
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,119
Bye-bye. [chuckles]

434
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,163
You good, yep?

435
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,874
Bye, Donnie. So good to see you.

436
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,709
[door opens]

437
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,129
-[sighs] I'll be just a minute.
-All right, bud.

438
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,548
Oh, wow! Dude.

439
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,719
Bartholomew Putt died today
of terminal celibacy.

440
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,890
He is survived by millions of toys
and zero girlfriends.

441
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,934
They're action figures.

442
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,436
They're vagina repellent.

443
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,773
-I choose not to bring women here.
-Mm.

444
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,817
This is my Batcave,
my Fortress of Solitude.

445
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,695
Well, if your goal's solitude,
mission accomplished.

446
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,366
The only person that would be
turned on by this is Santa.

447
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,368
What is this?

448
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,786
I'm an aspiring oboist.

449
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:49,164
Good move.
Nothing drops panties like a woodwind.

450
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,459
-I'm getting a clean shirt.
-I'm just busting your chops.

451
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,627
Come on.

452
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,838
Listen, if you want a shot with Tina,
you gotta ditch all this stuff,

453
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,799
even if it just barely helps your odds.

454
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,885
"Never tell me the odds."

455
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,846
Han Solo.

456
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,556
-[winces]
-What did I just say?

457
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,724
Now go get changed.

458
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,519
And if you put on something
with a hobbit or something like that,

459
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,812
you'll get a fresh one.

460
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,729
Okay.

461
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,525
I'm doing this for you, okay?

462
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,819
I'm just trying to get some V for your D.

463
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,328
So just for the record,

464
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,414
I'm 100% on board

465
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,833
with the
"Don't have children with Carter" policy.

466
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,752
You were eavesdropping.

467
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,255
I'm a spy. Of course I eavesdrop.

468
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,757
I didn't say
I don't wanna have kids with Carter,

469
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,176
I just said I think we should wait a bit.

470
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,013
I love Carter very much, okay?

471
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,807
The CIA side of my life
is a little chaotic,

472
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,518
but he'sâ€¦ he's steady
andâ€¦ and predictable.

473
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,563
Steady and predictable is something
you want from your accountant,

474
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,064
but not from your life partner.

475
00:21:56,148 --> 00:22:00,319
Your mother still is the most exciting
and the most challenging person

476
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,486
that I've ever known.

477
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,657
You need to find somebody that can
stimulate your mind and your heart,

478
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,702
not some nerd that wants to do
artsy-crafty stuff with you.

479
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,079
Hey, I like doing artsy-craftsy stuff.
It's soothing.

480
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:16,126
Do I sometimes wish
he was a little bit more adventurous? Yes.

481
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,961
But-- You know what? Why--

482
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,130
Oh my God, you're the last person on Earth

483
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,632
I should be discussing
relationship stuff with.

484
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,093
I just watched you beg Mom
to get on your little boat

485
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,762
like a lovesick schoolboy.

486
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,473
One, it was just a casual invitation.

487
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,768
Two, it's not a boat. It's a ship.

488
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,936
Okay, well, that ship has sailed.

489
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,233
The kidnapping Tina stumbled onto

490
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,945
was of Moldovan applied physicist,
Dr. Karl Novac.

491
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:48,450
He was in Ireland on a goodwill tour
to pump up Moldovan scientific prowess.

492
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,286
First blush is,
disappearance seems insignificant.

493
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,331
But Dr. Novac authored a scientific paper

494
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,166
outlining a novel process

495
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:59,378
to extract and augment
fissile nuclear material

496
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,545
from nuclear waste.

497
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,965
So Boro grabbed Poindexter
to salvage something useful

498
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,967
from that little bit
he got from the train?

499
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,763
-That's the theory we're going with.
-But Boro basically kidnapped a chef.

500
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,681
I mean,
he still needs his kitchen utensils

501
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,975
to make his radioactive dish.

502
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,311
If we can figure out
what that hardware is,

503
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,939
maybe we can get to it first
and then catch Boro.

504
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,982
Possibly. But there's a speed bump.

505
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,985
We've only ever seen an abstract
of Dr. Novac's paper.

506
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,490
The official scientific research
explaining the extraction process

507
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,700
was blocked from publication
by the Moldovan government.

508
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,370
Instead, they labeled him a national asset

509
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,206
and moved him to a government dormitory
with a handler

510
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,793
to protect him from spies and IP theft
and prevent defection.

511
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:44,256
-The whole dormitory's air-gapped?
-No Wi-Fi, no landline, no way to hack in.

512
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,007
Except for this.

513
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,467
That's why we have Air-hopper.

514
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:51,096
It's an app that can suck
all the data from any nearby hard drive.

515
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:56,059
It's camouflaged in a shell
of a popular game Jam Slam.

516
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,145
But how is the team
supposed to get past security

517
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,439
to get into the dormitory
to even use the app?

518
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,066
The only way to get in is to be invited
by someone who lives there.

519
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,654
Fortunately, Novac's handler,
Nika Stalinovich, lives at the dorm.

520
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:12,701
So she will have to invite home
someone from our team.

521
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,202
Pooh Bear.

522
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,204
[chanting] Pooh Bear! Pooh Bear!

523
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:21,793
Pooh Bear! Pooh Bear! Pooh Bear!

524
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,628
What the hell is Pooh Bear?

525
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,340
Aldon's Pooh Bear on account
of all the honeypots he collects.

526
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,467
Gross.

527
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,594
Pooh Bear! Pooh Bear! Pooh Bear!

528
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,512
-All right, knock it off.
-Sorry.

529
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,555
Sorry, boss.

530
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,476
Stalinovich will have all
of Novac's research on her computer,

531
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,393
so Aldon willâ€¦

532
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,644
Pooh Bear.

533
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,231
â€¦use what little charm he has
to access her dorm

534
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,066
and download the paper using the app.

535
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,277
That should lead us to Boro's next move.

536
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,654
Great.
So, what does this lucky lady look like?

537
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,450
-[Dr. Pfeffer clears throat]
-[all] Boo.

538
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,493
[chuckles]

539
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,912
[clears throat]
There are no known photos of Nika,

540
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,289
as government handlers
are kept clandestine,

541
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:03,793
but I put together
a very interesting psych profile.

542
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,003
[Dr. Pfeffer clears throat]

543
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:09,466
Nika Stalinovich is a mid-level manager
suffering from low self-esteem

544
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,802
due to Novac's kidnapping
during a tour she signed off on.

545
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,056
Standard operating procedure
after such an incident

546
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,351
usually means the retraining
of all government handlers.

547
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:23,730
That would mean
a full day of re-education in a hotel,

548
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:24,648
The Bad Buffet.

549
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,900
[clears throat]

550
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:30,612
Luckily for us, just down the street
from the hotel is a bar.

551
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,906
After hours of public humiliation,

552
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,368
our backer, Nika,
will make her way across the street

553
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:39,621
where she will drown her sorrows
in some plum brandy.

554
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,999
So if Dr. Pepper is right,
the bar's our way in.

555
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,210
Pfeffer, like in "Michelle."

556
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,128
Dr. Pepper's theory
on Nika's state of mind

557
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,672
should make her open and vulnerable

558
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,716
to my very unique brand
of romanticâ€¦ persuasion.

559
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,012
Your plane leaves in 12 hours,
as Nika's retraining finishes in 24.

560
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,558
I'll make sure there's a friendly asset
standing by with transpo for you.

561
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,767
Okay, get going everyone.

562
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,185
-Let's go.
-[Roo] Okay.

563
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,069
[sinister music playing]

564
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,906
Is everything in place?

565
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,324
Just waiting for a few shipments.

566
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,495
These are daisies. I asked for dog rose.

567
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,497
Yeah, but daisies are in season.

568
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,169
I will get the dog roses.

569
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,338
Excellent.

570
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,549
I want it all to be perfect.

571
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:33,466
[music ends]

572
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,430
[Luke] You're gonna be checkmated
in no time.

573
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,889
-That's for sure.
-Seriously, Dad?

574
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,476
Could you have requisitioned
a more unflattering outfit for me?

575
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,938
Well, you can't be Aldon's backup
if everyone in the bar is hitting on you.

576
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,107
About time you got a taste of it.

577
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,152
They always make me look like
a Baltic washerwoman.

578
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,737
Yeah, I should probably get ready too.

579
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,614
I gotta have the right bait
to reel in the fish.

580
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,324
-[scoffs]
-Speaking of which,

581
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,493
I'm a little worried about
this "no photo of Nika" thing.

582
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,537
Everybody thinks
you always land a rainbow trout,

583
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,540
but every now and again,
a sea robin just plops on deck,

584
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,292
-or a blobfish.
-[laughing]

585
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,418
Don't laugh at that.

586
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,753
Quick question.

587
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,421
Did you participate
in one of these missions

588
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,631
when you were married to Mom?

589
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,384
-Did you ever have an affair?
-Oh!

590
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,095
I never once had an affair
while I was married to your mother.

591
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,808
Well, that killed the mood.

592
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,653
[door closes]

593
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,613
-I could've been indecent.
-You are indecent.

594
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,032
The way you speak is disrespectful to me

595
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:42,035
and every woman
you have seduced in the line of duty.

596
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,244
You know what? You're right.

597
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:47,290
I was just trying to be funny. It wasn't.
For the record, I respect women a ton.

598
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,792
Yeah, sure you do.

599
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,670
Hey, I'm just straightforward about sex
on or off the job.

600
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,213
I treat women as equals, okay?

601
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,923
We all have needs, right?

602
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,508
I make offers with physical engagement.

603
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,885
If it's a yes, then great,
we'll both have a fantastic time,

604
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,762
because I'm really, really good
at intercourse.

605
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,431
But if it's a no,
then hopefully we become friends.

606
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,684
-What's more respectful than that?
-So many things.

607
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:10,230
First of all, your order of operations,
sex first, then maybe friendship?

608
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:13,191
Clearly women have one function
in your book.

609
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,235
-Roo and I are best friends.
-Roo is gay.

610
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,862
You guys are buddies
because sex is off the table.

611
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,366
I've had sex off a table, on a table,
and under a table at a Sur La Table,

612
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,076
and no, the irony isn't lost on me.

613
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,829
Bottom line,
honeypotting isn't easy, okay?

614
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,122
It's an art and a science.

615
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:31,209
No, it's an excuse for
arrested development frat boy bullshit,

616
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,377
and you know it.

617
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,173
[door closes]

618
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,553
[percussive music builds, ends]

619
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,596
[gentle music playing]

620
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,974
Green light. Cameras are in place.

621
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:46,891
[Barry] Pool chalk,

622
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,476
operational.

623
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,519
Eraser,

624
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,396
operational.

625
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,397
Salt shaker,

626
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,234
operational. [slurps]

627
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,487
[car horns honking in distance]

628
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,490
[Luke]
People are filtering out of the hotel.

629
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,908
Retraining must be over.

630
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,536
We'll alert you
if we see anyone who could be Nika.

631
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,121
[Emma] Hope she has no sense of smell.

632
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,247
Caught a whiff of Aldon.

633
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,500
He's like a category four
Drakkar Noir tsunami.

634
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,044
Pop culture in Eastern Europe
is 30 years behind the US.

635
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,673
They're into Zima,
'90s emo rock, and Drakkar Noir.

636
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,258
Nika's gonna love it.

637
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,509
And if she doesn't?

638
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,094
Simple.

639
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,556
Shock and awe.

640
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:27,640
[Luke] We may have a hit.

641
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,477
Tall blonde, appears to be
coming out of the retraining.

642
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,563
Man, Aldon's got a horseshoe up his ass.

643
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,567
[Aldon exhales, chuckles]

644
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,486
I have the best job.

645
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,864
[in Romanian] Anya. What'll it be?

646
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,367
[in English] Well, that's a negative
on Nika Stalinovich. Damn it.

647
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,789
[in Romanian]
Thanks for ruining our day, Nik.

648
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,710
-[in English] Did he just say Nik?
-Could Nika actually be a Nik?

649
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,046
Nik is a very common name
in this part of the world.

650
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,215
[in Romanian] You're a real goatfucker,

651
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,341
Stalinovich.

652
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,302
[in English] Tell me there's a lot
of Stalinoviches in this region.

653
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,055
Apparently, Nika Stalinovich was a typo.

654
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,516
Our target is Nik A. Stalinovich.

655
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,850
-Shit.
-Shit.

656
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,852
-Shit.
-This is hilarious.

657
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,229
Hang on, don't panic.

658
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,033
-Okay, he's definitely straight.
-How do you know?

659
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,827
Well, he didn't want any of this.

660
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,287
-We have to pivot. I'll take the lead.
-[Luke] Absolutely not.

661
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,581
-We abort now.
-On what grounds?

662
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:37,460
On the ground that I carry a photograph
of her in pigtails in my wallet.

663
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,505
Wallet photos? How old are you?

664
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,841
-I can do this.
-[Aldon] Damn right you can.

665
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,927
Get to the bathroom and de-frump yourself.
I'll be back in a minute.

666
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,269
No, you shut it down. I'm senior officer.

667
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,396
Then you know it violates protocol
to abort a mission

668
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,981
for any reason other than imminent death

669
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,692
or severe bodily injury
to an officer or civilian.

670
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,236
You may experience severe bodily injury.

671
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,780
I will not let my daughter
do the honeypot.

672
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,032
This isn't a honeypot, it's a honey drop.

673
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,869
She just talks to the guy,
gets him to take her back to his place,

674
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:14,622
uses the hopper to record the data,
and then she's off with her pants on.

675
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,042
At worst, there'll be some heavy petting.

676
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,797
Luke, she is a good officer.

677
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,048
Let her do her job.

678
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,634
And I'm gonna go do mine.

679
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,930
Hey, ladies.

680
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,682
Let's make a deal.

681
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,191
Okay, good. That's already an improvement.

682
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,820
-Try these.
-Where'd you get those?

683
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,947
Just a little help from some friends.

684
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:49,949
[Emma] Got it.

685
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,368
-Yep.
-There you go.

686
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,786
Let me give you my shirt.

687
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,164
Nothing sexier
than a woman in a man's shirt.

688
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,790
Do not take off your shirt.

689
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,834
Aldon might still get a honeypot.

690
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,502
Luke, the shirt you gave her

691
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:04,088
looks like something from
the Little Women Abstinence Collection.

692
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,506
That's it. I'm coming in.

693
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,509
Bad idea. You cause a commotion,
Nik gets nervous and leaves.

694
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,303
-Play it cool.
-[Luke] Oh, shut up, Barry.

695
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:13,514
It's your fault that she's
in this situation in the first place.

696
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:15,600
You should've never
let the CIA recruit her.

697
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,852
My fault? You think the CIA
would've recruited her

698
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,437
if her last name wasn't Brunner?

699
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,647
This is your fault.

700
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,648
[groans]

701
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:25,109
I need a break from hearing people argue
about who's at fault for decisions I made.

702
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:26,235
That's a good idea.

703
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:28,863
Okay.

704
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,449
Here you go. I'm sorry for the sweat.

705
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:36,454
-And just leave a few buttons open--
-Yeah, okay, I got it.

706
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,831
-I know how to look hot.
-My bad.

707
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,418
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

708
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,504
-You sure?
-Yeah.

709
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,881
Uh-huh. Look, it's just us here.

710
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,257
Look, truth?

711
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,929
-I don't always love doing this, okay?
-[scoffs]

712
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,473
Sometimes it's weird and creepy
or just awkward and unpleasant.

713
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:59,560
A lot of times,
it leaves me feelingâ€¦ pretty awful.

714
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,355
[speaking Swahili]

715
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,316
[in English] That's
"be with me, my darling" in Swahili.

716
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:09,737
I've said that in three dozen languages
and, uh, never once meant it.

717
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,949
So yeah, laughing with the gang
can sometimes make it easier,

718
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,243
but if you don't wanna do this,
we can find a workaround.

719
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,244
End of story.

720
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,287
It's not that. It'sâ€¦

721
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,958
Iâ€¦ I've honeypotted
once or twice before. It's justâ€¦

722
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,295
It sounds stupid, but Iâ€¦

723
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:30,800
I've never so much as kissed anybody
since I've been with Carter.

724
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,511
I've never been unfaithful.

725
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,431
You're not being unfaithful.
You're simply doing your job.

726
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,600
Now I can't say I've ever been
in your exact position before

727
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:43,021
becauseâ€¦ I've never been
in a real relationship,

728
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:45,398
but you should know that
what you're doing is for Carter

729
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:46,941
and all the other
schoolteachers out there,

730
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:50,445
and their students, parents, podiatrists,
and everyone else in the world.

731
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,072
Because stopping Boro means saving lives.

732
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,408
You're doing nothing wrong, Emma.

733

734
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,746
It's actually good advice.

00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,956
Yeah, shallow waters run deep, right?

736
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,334
Okay, I'm gonna airdrop you

All right, you look great. You ready?

739
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,675
-Yeah.
-I'll be in that booth if you need me.

740
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,385
But you got this.

741
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:17,764
-I know.
-Oh, one last thing.

742
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,433
You can't ask Nik back to his place.
He has to invite you.

743
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:22,560
-Why?
-We don't wanna raise any suspicion.

744
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,064
And women like you never have to ask.

745
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:26,981
They only get asked.

746
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:30,151
Okay, you're on in one.

747
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:32,612

What a surprise.

752
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,546
[in Romanian] I don't speak Spanish.

753
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,716
Romanian? Russian?

754
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,427
[in accented English] Uh, some English?

755
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,720
I know English, yes.

756
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:00,681
[chuckles] Oh.
Then I'll ask again, bad night?

757
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,726
Well, my co-workers and boss,

758
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,771
they blame me for something
that wasn't my fault.

759
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:07,855
Oh. [sighs]

760
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,607
I know what that's like.

761
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:11,651
Your boss interfering with your work,

762
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,528
even if you don't need their help.

763
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:16,989
even if they're out-of-touch,
overbearing know-it-alls.

764
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,617
Seriously?
I mean, what did I do to deserve this?

765
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,410
She is the worst, right?

766
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,830
I mean, we should just dump her
from the squad,

767
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,748

My employer expects so much from me,

but then they put me up
in this tiny hotel with no hot water.

to find our lover boy's apartment.

We're not going anywhere

-Can you make that shot?
-It's geometry.

802
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,145
I can make that shot
with your eyes, old man.

803
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,774
The guard will hear the rifle crack,
and a silencer would affect accuracy.

856
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,245
[guard in English] ID.

857
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:37,041
What is the purpose of your visit,
Miss Flores?

858
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,085
Business or pleasure?

859
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,171
[chuckles] It isn't business.

860
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,547
-[Emma chuckles]
-[Luke sighs]

861
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,007
All good.

862
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,511
She's heading inside.

863
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:50,262
[exhales]

864
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,725
-Roo, what's the holdup?
-[Roo] Cut me a break.

865
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,019
There's a whole quart of goulash
up my crack.

866
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:01,065
[Barry] Better hurry, Roo.

867
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:04,568
We can't find a CCTV feed in the hospital,
so I have no eyes on the hallway.

868
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,405
Please. This whole country
is socialized medicine.

869
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,322
It'll be hours

870
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,574
-before some quack comes in here.
-[door opens]

871
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,034
[gasps]

872
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:13,744
What's up, doc?

873
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:14,912
[tense music playing]

874
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,623
[Emma] You weren't lying.

875
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:20,042
The flowers are beautiful.

876
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,877
And that flagpole,

877
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,296
how patriotic.

878
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,715
Looks brand-new, not a mark on it.

879
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:30,302
Everything okay?

880
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,513
Yeah.

881
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,100
Why can't I hear Emma on comms?

882
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:39,061
There seems to be interference.
Let me see if I can boost the signal.

883
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,983
I'm gonna get her.
That's it, and that's all.

884
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:45,609
[Roo] Negatory, boss.

885
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:48,195
Guard's got a PKM, 650 rounds per minute.

886
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,738
You'd be Swiss cheese.

887
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,449
Barry, can you get a connection?

888
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,992
I'm cycling channels.

889
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,994
-Anything?
-No.

890
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,455
Doesn't make any sense.
It's like we're sealed off.

891
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,081
Or maybe they are.

892
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,875
When Dr. Novac was nabbed in Ireland,

893
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,419
the Moldovan government
must've boosted security in the dorms

894
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,670
with a digital Faraday cage.

895
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,088
-A what cage?
-[Tina] Faraday.

896
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,299
A digital mesh
that no signal can even get through.

897
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,842
That's why we can't hear Emma.

898
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:10,885
I doubt she can hear us.

899
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,261
She's flying blind.

900
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,638
That's why Roo
needs to take the damn shot.

901
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,599
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

902
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:20,478
Listen, Dr. Zhivago, either I bash you
in the head until you're out cold,

903
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,730
or you inject yourself
with 40 cc's of night-night.

904
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:30,321
There you go, sleepytime tea.
Put it in you.

905
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:34,200
Come on.

906
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,868
[tense music playing]

907
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:42,917
Getting in position.

908
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,293
[window squeaking]

909
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,634
[Roo] I'm working my angles.

910
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,093
You mark the spot, boomer.

911
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,316
[whirring]

912
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,570
Did you hear something?

913
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,449
Noâ€¦ but I would love to.

914
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:19,203
What do you have that wouldâ€¦ set the mood?

915
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,039
Just the thing.

916
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,709
And we have video.

917
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:29,004
Thisâ€¦ is my favorite song.

918
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,590
["Lightning Crashes" by Live playing]

919
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,592
â™ª Lightning crashes â™ª

920
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,677
And audio.

921
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,096
'90s emo rock. [chuckles]

922
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,639
-Called it.
-[engine starts]

923
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,975
We have eyes and ears
on everything but the bedroom.

924
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,226
[Luke] We don't need the bedroom.

925
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:45,062
She collects the data
and get the hell out of there. That's it.

926
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:47,773
â™ª â€¦falls to the floor â™ª

927
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,158
[Barry] Emma's doing a great job
of getting data from Nik's laptop,

928
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:00,327
but the Faraday cage
won't let that data be sent to me.

929
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:03,455
I have no idea if she downloaded
Dr. Novac's research paper

930
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:04,707
or his grocery list.

931
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,083
Look, I know Emma.

932
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,461
She's not gonna leave before she knows
for sure that the job is done.

933
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:12,423
The only way she knows that
is if she gets our confirmation.

934
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:15,593
-So we must turn off the cage.
-[Tina] I'd advise against that, sir.

935
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,595
If they went through the trouble
of setting up that cage,

936
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,096
they definitely put an alarm on it.

937
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:22,391
Shut it off, the alarm sounds,
and then the dorm goes into lockdown.

938
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,435
Emma got past the guard
with her credentials,

939
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,353
but she'll get busted
if they do a deep dive.

940
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,855
Hold on. [snaps fingers]

941
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,524
You said the Faraday cage
is like a digital mesh, right?

942
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,984
-Mm-hm.
-Mesh comes in all sizes.

943
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,068
Tight like a screen door,

944
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,362
or loose and more revealing
like a sexy crop top.

945
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,655
And the point is?

946
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:39,992
The cage requires a ton of power,
meaning it'd have a dedicated line.

947
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,953
We tap into it, we can dim the power
without cutting it off.

948
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,121
We weaken the mesh

949
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:46,790
so we can get our comms through to Emma
without tripping the alarm.

950
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,959
The mesh is there
but provides no protection.

951
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:49,960
Exactly.

952
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,045
[Tina gasps]

953
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,046
Found the power line.

954
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,798
Now it looks like they dug a trench
and ran a conduit

955
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,009
to an electrical tower several miles away.

956
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,761
If it's standard PVC,
it won't be that deep,

957
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,929
so you should be able
to easily compromise it.

958
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,015
It's only ten yards west of you.

959
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,266
-Found it.
-[Barry] Get digging.

960
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:06,226
You'll need two holes, six inches apart.

961
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:07,686
[Nik clears throat]

962
00:44:08,979 --> 00:44:10,022
[Nik] Here you go.

963
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:12,524
Thank you.

964
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,735
[Nik clears throat] Yeah.

965
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,571
-Salut.
-Salut.

966
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,739
[Nik chuckles]

967
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:20,908
Mm.

968
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,164
[grunts] You're so aggressive.

969
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:40,761
[car door closes]

970
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,432
Start digging the second hole.

971
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,937
Yes. Okay.

972
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:58,320
This is very uncomfortable.
I took her to see the Jimmy Neutron movie.

973
00:44:58,404 --> 00:44:59,780
Man, she's a good kisser though.

974
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,533
I don't need to hear all this crap.
Is Emma in position?

975
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,077
She's in a position.

976
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,787
Is she close to Nik's device or not?

977
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:07,705
[Barry] From what I can see,

978
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:09,248
she just downloaded the last device
in the room,

979
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,542
but until that cage is down,
I have no idea what she got us.

980
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,462
[Nik] Whoa, whoa. Sorry.

981
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:20,551
I am, how do they say,
all of the thumbs, huh? [chuckles]

982
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:21,468
[Emma chuckles]

983
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,513
Oh,
I think you knocked your phone off the--

984
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:25,848
What is this?

985
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:28,517
Jam Slam?

986
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,518
[tense music ends]

987
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:32,730
I've heard of it,
but, uh, Western games are frowned upon.

988
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,815
Your phone sent you a memory.

989
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,110
Who is this?

990
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,450
That's my brother.

991
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,035
[splutters] He's a little slow.

992
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,747
Uh, why in English?

993
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,832
[crickets chirping]

994
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:59,214
He lives in Boston now.
There's a special school for him there.

995
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,175
Huh.

996
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,052
-I'm gonna freshen up.
-Oh yeah.

997
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:06,680
I'll just play for a bit while I wait.

998
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:07,931
Oh, okay.

999
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:16,690
[exhales]

1000
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:25,908
I'm sorry, Carter.

1001
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:31,997
Seriously?

1002
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,499
[Luke] I found the PVC pipe.

1003
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,629
Okay, we can see the power lines.
Now what?

1004
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,714
[Barry] You need to create a resistor,
a metal arch.

1005
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,884
Place its two ends into the hole
so that they touch the power line.

1006
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,302
Where are we?

1007
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:48,472
-I need a spare tire and an antenna. Now.
-Got it.

1008
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:53,769
Here we go.

1009
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:56,522
All right, grounded, and ready to connect.

1010
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:58,315
Sounds like my Tinder profile.

1011
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,068
[electricity buzzes]

1012
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,029
[Barry] Success.

1013
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,155
Faraday cage weakened,

1014
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,573
data is being accessed,

1015
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,617
signals are coming in and out of the door.

1016
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,412
Uncle Barry, where have you guys been?
Did we get Dr. Novac's research?

1017
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:13,831
Sorting through the data now.

1018
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:17,334
Uh, grant applications, expense reportsâ€¦

1019
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,585
[woman moaning]

1020
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:19,545
Oh boy.

1021
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,506
Why do I hear hanky-panky?

1022
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:23,632
Um,

1023
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,843
Nik has an assortment of spanking videos.

1024
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:27,678
-It's getting hot.
-Gross.

1025
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:31,390
-What? The antenna is getting really hot.
-[Barry] You're still holding on to it?

1026
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,225
It has thousands of watts
running through it.

1027
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,643
-Let go.
-[Luke] I can't.

1028
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:35,769
The holes are too big.

1029
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,230
If I let go, it tilts,
and it sets off the alarm,

1030
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,648
and Emma goes to the gulag.

1031
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,984
Let go, man.
It's starting to smell like Whoppers.

1032
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:44,945
No, I'm gonna hold on to it.
That's it, and that's all.

1033
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,655
Come on, help me pack the holes.

1034
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:50,242
Hate to pile on, guys,
but we've got bigger problems.

1035
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,035
Nik's gotta be
some kind of video game prodigy

1036
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,412
because he just reached level seven.

1037
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,539
You gotta stop him
before he beats level seven.

1038
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:59,001
After that, the game facade ends,
and it reverts back to spy software.

1039
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,002
What? Why?

1040
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,588
The app takes up lots of gigs.
We only had room for a few levels.

1041
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,299
[Aldon] Emma, listen to me.

1042
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,218
You gotta make him
not wanna look at that game.

1043
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,429
Shock and awe.

1044
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:11,930
Shock and awe.

1045
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,265
What's shock and awe?

1046
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,143
-Fluff me.
-What?

1047
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,271
That is shock and awe.

1048
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,691
[Aldon] Oh.

1049
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,776
[Emma] How's the game going?

1050
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,694
It'sâ€¦

1051
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:39,291
Great job, Emma. Just hang tight
till we figure out our next move, okay?

1052
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,001
[Luke] Almost done?

1053
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,879
-I can't hold on to it much longer.
-[Aldon] I got you. I got you.

1054
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:44,796
[Roo] Hold on.

1055
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,007
-[Aldon] We're packed pretty tight here.
-[Roo] Got it.

1056
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,467
We're ready to give it a shot.

1057
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,846
Okay, Barry, give me good news.

1058
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,766
Connection is stable,
but we still need Dr. Novac's paper.

1059
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:58,560
Nik must have a hard copy somewhere.
Probably in a safe?

1060
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,021
[Tina] Statistically, most people
keep safes in their bedroom.

1061
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,272
No, no. No way.

1062
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,650
Shall we take this to the bedroom?

1063
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,318
Yes.

1064
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:10,489
How's Princess supposed to find
a hidden safe in the bedroom

1065
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:11,406
with Nik in there?

1066
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,699
[Nik grunts]

1067
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,160
-[whimsical music plays]
-[Nik grunting]

1068
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:18,580
[Nik] Yes! Yes! Yes!

1069
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:19,915
-No!
-[Nik] Yes!

1070
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:20,999
No! No!

1071
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,125
[Nik] Oh yes!

1072
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,544
Yes! Yes!

1073
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,462
[Nik moans]

1074
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,715
New wainscoting.

1075
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:29,841
What did you say?

1076
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,636
-I didn't say you could talk.
-Okay.

1077
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:35,430
Since when do Soviet-era block buildings
get makeovers?

1078
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,182
It's gotta be the facade for the safe.

1079
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,142
Knock the guy out and break in.

1080
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,186
Then if he wakes up,
he knows he's been robbed,

1081
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:44,147
tells his superiors, word gets out
that Novac's handler's been ambushed,

1082
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,316
Boro finds out,
he knows that we're onto him,

1083
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,901
pivots, he's gone forever.

1084
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,779
Just stay tight, sweetie, okay?

1085
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,531
We're gonna come up with a plan.

1086
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,284
Emma?

1087
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,245
Emma?

1088
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,580
Barry, is the cage up again?

1089
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,581
No.

1090
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:06,294
Umâ€¦ it appears Emma has removed her comms.

1091
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:10,590
Communication has unilaterally been cut
just like she did in Guyana.

1092
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:11,967
Why would she take out the comm?

1093
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,135
Umâ€¦

1094
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,094
Hmâ€¦

1095
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,762
Why would Emma take out the comm?

1096
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,848
[suspenseful music playing]

1097
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,116
[suspenseful music continues]

1098
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,841
[whispering] I found the safe.
Nik's out cold.

1099
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,844
Please tell me that you poisoned him.

1100
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,529
[suspenseful music ends]

1101
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:17,949
[exhales]

1102
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,090
The paper, I've got it.

1103
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:35,717
[gun cocks]

1104
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,094
[tense music plays]

1105
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,141
Who do you work for?

1106
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,064
[closing theme playing]

1107
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,017
