00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,966
[tense music playing]

2
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:17,475
I have a heart condition.

3
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:24,691
-And I'll be a--
-Hey, we'll figure this out.

4
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,359
-It'll be okay.
-[Roo] Will it, new girl?

5
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,029
From here, it looks like
the train's gonna radiate our nuts.

6
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,739
Au contraire, mon frère,
don't make that move.

7
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:32,157
I have to cut power to magnets.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,534
The train will drop from the tracks
and detonate like a dirty bomb,

9
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,411
destroying your country's ability
to grow food.

10
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,455
I'm no farmer,
but I'm pretty sure famine's bad.

11
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:41,750
My wife and son are asleep
five minutes from here.

12
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,252
I have to derail it
before it reaches Nur-Sultan.

13
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,504
-Our friends are on that train.
-Screw everyone else.

14
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,173
We're in the path of that soul train,

15
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,176
so I have a vested interest
in stopping it too, just not this way.

16
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,345
You are not inspectors.
You could be with terrorists.

17
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,847
We're undercover CIA.

18
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,515
Then show me your identification.

19
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,726
Do I really have to explain
"undercover" to you?

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,189
-You move, I'll shoot!
-Then my hand will fall on the switch.

21
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,649
[tense music playing]

22
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,818
I have an idea, but it's dangerous.

23
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,362
More dangerous than an out-of-control
nuclear bullet train?

24
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:12,655
Good point.

25
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,199
If cooling the magnets
speeds the train up,

26
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,534
then warming them
would slow it down, right?

27
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,661
If I could just
pump something hot in there.

28
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,372
-That's what Donnie's thinking.
-Nuclear sludge. It's warm.

29
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,708
Yes. Open the window to the tanker car,

30
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,919
I'll go up, grab the hose,
and feed it through.

31
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:28,463
No. The train is going too fast.
It will blow you off.

32
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,298
If I don't try, we could all die.

33
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,342
Well, if you do try,
you'll definitely die.

34
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:33,927
We can't do nothing.

35
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:38,389
I might have a plan.

36
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,891
[tense music continues]

37
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,147
If we move real closely together,
this should work.

38
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,607
I can't believe you brought these.

39
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:49,567
Thought we could use them in our downtime.

40
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,945
Okay, here's the plan. I go outside,

41
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,114
and you anchor me
through the aluminum roof.

42
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,658
I'm half your size.
Less surface area for the wind to grab me.

43
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:58,118
I can't let you go out there.

44
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,578
-Chief, only Emma's way works.
-What could possibly happen?

45
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,498
She could fly off and hit the rock
at a hundred miles an hour.

46
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,708
There's a downside,
but we need to get this done.

47
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:06,793
I can do this…

48
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,131
but I need your help.

49
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,050

[grunts]

53
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,752
I'm almost there.

54
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:55,466
-This thing is all over the place.
-[Aldon] You have to wrestle it down.

55
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,427
We're running out of track fast.

56
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,888
-Just be careful.
-[Emma] Dad, I can't reach it.

57
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,765
You gotta let me go so I can leap for it.

58
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,684
No, that's too big of a risk.

59
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,770
If I don't get this thing,
we all die anyway.

60
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,022
I said no.

61
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:12,734
When I was little,

62
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,696
you used to toss me in the air
and then catch me.

63
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,656
You never missed.

64
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,782
I trust you.

65
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,034
I missed once.

66
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:24,204
You bounced off the ottoman,
and your mother was really pissed off.

67
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,331
I don't wanna be that guy,
but ticktock, Luke.

68
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,416
Dad, I did what Dr. Pepper said.

69
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,001
I asked you for help.

70
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,878
Now it is your turn.

71
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,796
You have to listen to me.

72
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,632
Please, just let me go.

73
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,054

80
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,368
I got you, baby.

81
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,245
I got you.

82
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,791
You gotta pull the hose
back into the conductor's booth

83
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,293
and attach it to the fuel valve
next to the nitrogen tank.

84
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,338
[Tina] It's uniform with the tanker valve,
so the hose should fit into place.

85
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,297
[Emma breathes deeply]

86
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,674
Flip the pump switch next to it.

87
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,098
-Magnet's already warming.
-We have steady deceleration.

88
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,266
[Emma] We're slowing.

89
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,309
[triumphant music playing]

90
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,477
I think we did it.

91
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,064
I think we did.

92
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:33,982
[exhales]

93
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,818
It's stopped. It's over.

94
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,656
-You're not part of this, Borat.
-Yeah, you're not part of it.

95
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,324
[light rock music playing]

96
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,330
But the bottom line is,
we didn't catch Boro,

97
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,082
and Boro didn't get what he needed.

98
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,084
So, for now, a tie is as good as a win.

99
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:55,378
What are you, my daughter's soccer coach?

100
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,338
I want Boro on a plate.

101
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,009
Also wanna know how Kazakhstan
almost turned into a nuclear wasteland.

102
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:03,136
-Oh, uh--
-A technical glitch.

103
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,263
Static on the comms.

104
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,473
We misheard the number of valves to flood.

105
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,683
Really?

106
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,686
Get some rest while you can.

107
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:13,187
I've already got a dozen operatives

108
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,107
sweeping every digital signal
on the planet looking for Boro.

109
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,693
Once we get a bite,
you're off the sidelines.

110
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:19,694
[computer beeps]

111
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,362
[Luke sighs]

112
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,283
Appreciate you covering for me.

113
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,952
I appreciate you
listening to me on the train.

114
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,705
[exhales]
It wasn't easy letting you go like that.

115
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,416
Never has been.

116
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,461
All surveillance of Donnie stops,

117
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:39,339
or I narc you out to Dot and Mom.

118
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:41,758
Right.

119
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:43,468
Hey, Barry,

120
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,429
shut down Operation Don Juan.

121
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:50,016
And I googled "cuckolding."

122
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:53,019
I owe you an apology.

123
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,020
[Barry] Copy that.

124
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,064
Satisfied?

125
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,065
For now.

126
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,902
If you don't mind, I need to make a call.

127
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:04,739
[door closes]

128
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,242
[grunts]

129
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,202
Sit…

130
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:10,828
Butt.

131
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,750
Hey, hey!
You're, uh, already back at the office?

132
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:19,128
Hey. Um, yeah, I should be done
in the next few hours.

133
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:23,883
Look, I was thinking about
this whole Nana Pat situation.

134
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,969
I know you hate being lied to,

135
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,263
especially by somebody who loved you,

136
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,017
but maybe she lied to you
because she loves you.

137
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,019
I mean, she didn't have much, right?

138
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,731
Then she gives you this clock
and tells you this whole story

139
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:41,150
because she knows
it's gonna make you happy. And it did.

140
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,652
Until I learned the truth.

141
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,279
Exactly. Maybe the truth is overrated.

142
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,742
I mean, maybe lying isn't always so bad.

143
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,703
That's the exact opposite
of everything I teach my students,

144
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:56,249
but, uh, yeah, I guess I could
cut Nana Pat some slack.

145
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,208
Cool.

146
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:02,130
Hey, um… I was thinking

147
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,842
maybe we could play
some of those Lee Fields songs

148
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:09,429
and, I don't know… have a wild night

149
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,889
sanding and staining that clock.

150
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:16,060
I bought some top-shelf wood stain

151
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,062
from the hobby store down the street.

152
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:18,980
Is that Russian?

153
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,107
The guy said it's the best.

154
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,443
All right. That sounds good.
I'll make up a cheese plate.

155
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,569
I love you.

156
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,028
And that… is no lie.

157
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:28,364
-I love you too.
-[knocking at door]

158
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:32,118
Hey, Roo and I are gonna go grab
a "post-save the world" lager. You in?

159
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,954
I-- I can't. I have plans.

160
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:35,955
[Aldon] Next time then.

161
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,582
I mean, after what you pulled off today,

162
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,209
I'm sure there'll be
other opportunities for celebrations.

163
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,378
Amazing work, seriously.

164
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,588
Ciao, bella.

165
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,714
[door closes]

166
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,055
[door closes]

167
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,557
I put the table saw in the garage.

168
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,643
You could have held onto that.
No one but you ever needs it.

169
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,854
I don't have any room for it.

170
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,857
Um… look…

171
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,526
I don't need the table saw.

172
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,740
It's just that… Donald is the first guy
that you've gotten serious with,

173
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,742
and so it's really weird

174
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,745
when another man has family dinners

175
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,788
with my family.

176

351
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,151
Or… or that'd just be crazy?

352
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,905
Because, like, you--
You always said you wanted kids.

353
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,031
Yeah, yeah.

354
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,159
Yeah, in theory.

355
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,202
But… [sighs]

356
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,745
…lately, I've… [chuckles]

357
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:41,417
I've been thinking about families
and how easy it is to screw them up.

358
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,503
Ye-- Yeah, it is.

359
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:45,838
But why would ours--

360
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,798
Our-- Ours wouldn't be screwed up.

361
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,174
No. No, it'd be great.

362
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,175
-It's just--
-Yeah.

363
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,304
We're putting the cart before the horse.
We're not even engaged. [chuckles]

364
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:57,933
No, um, but we will be soon enough, right?

365
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,270
And then, you know,
we're gonna want a family,

366
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,397
so, like, it can't hurt to talk about,

367
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,193
you know, how we'd wanna raise kids,
where we'd wanna raise them,

368
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,279
some sort of work-life balance.

369
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,782
What do you mean work-life balance?

370
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:15,951
Oh man.

371
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:20,330
Uh, just the balance
between work and life.

372
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,209
You know, uh…

373
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,587
[whispers] Shit.

374
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,214
Okay, we've both got jobs, right? Okay?

375
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,718
Yours… takes you away a lot.

376
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,053
Sorry, I'm confused.

377
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,388
Are you saying that

378
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,893
you aren't sure that I could be
a good mom because I work?

379
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,312
No. No, no, no. God, no. No.

380
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,648
I'm just saying that personally,

381
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,862
uh, I think I benefited from having
my mother at home when I was a kid.

382
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,655
-Unreal.
-What?

383
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,117
If the roles were reversed,
if I was a teacher and you had my job,

384
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:59,661
no one would even ask you
if you could handle it.

385
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,748
It would just be expected
that I would stay home with the baby.

386
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,793
Okay, that's-- That's not what I'm saying.

387
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,046
It's what you insinuated,
even if you don't realize it.

388
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,048
Let's not do this, okay?

389
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,801
We don't need to fight, um,
or whatever this is.

390
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,011
I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry.

391
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,763
I just, um…

392
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,850
You're right. You're right.
We're not even engaged.

393
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,061
-[door opens]
-[Luke] Knock, knock.

394
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,479
I'm sorry I'm disturbing.

395
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,524
I just wanted to check
if Emma is available for lunch.

396
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,734
Maybe at this new burger place
at the car wash.

397
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:36,281
Sure, Dad. If… if Carter's willing
to keep an eye on Romi.

398
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,783
[smacks lips] Of course.

399
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,827
Yeah, I'll stay home with the baby.

400
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,832
-Were you eavesdropping?
-No.

401
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,376
I was just coming to pick you up.

402
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,962
Can't I see my own daughter
in my own house anymore?

403
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,797
Hasn't been your house for 15 years.

404
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,465
Tell this to my mortgage payments.

405
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,593
-Hey, guys.
-Hey. Perfect timing.

406
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,429
Look at this.
Who's the schlepper? Oh, it's Donnie.

407
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,848
-Hey, Luke. Emma, hi.
-[Luke] Yeah.

408
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,058
Hey, I have good news. I got the Oden.

409
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,810
-Your ship?
-Here.

410
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,395
[Tally] Wow.

411
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,647
It's… Wow.

412
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,649
-Wait until you go out on it.
-[Donnie] I wish.

413
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:14,153
But I can't. I got an ear thing.
Get seasick very easily.

414
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,321
Oh, that's okay. I didn't ask you.

415
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,742
That's a very sweet offer,
but work's crazy.

416
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,870
HR is overwhelmed downsizing.

417
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,247
It's terrible.
Good people losing their jobs--

418
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,126
Yeah, the firings are rough.
I keep telling her she'll get used to it.

419
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:32,921
-That's what I'm afraid of.
-But, Tally, you're kind, you're caring.

420
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,841
If anyone can make the co-workers
feel that there's still hope,

421
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,302
that things will work out
even in the darkest hours,

422
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,428
it's you.

423
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,138
You have a big heart.

424
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,931
Even when we ended our marriage,

425
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,393
you still made me feel that there's hope,
that things will work out.

426
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,438
I guess. Kinda.

427
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,983
And things did work out for you.

428
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,359
You're okay.

429
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,694
[gentle piano music playing]

430
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:56,653
Not yet,

431
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,989
but I still have hope.

432
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,035
-Okay, cool. Shall we go?
-Yeah.

433
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,119
Bye-bye. [chuckles]

434
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,163
You good, yep?

435
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,874
Bye, Donnie. So good to see you.

436
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:10,709
[door opens]

437
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,129
-[sighs] I'll be just a minute.
-All right, bud.

438
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,548
Oh, wow! Dude.

439
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:20,719
Bartholomew Putt died today
of terminal celibacy.

440
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,890
He is survived by millions of toys
and zero girlfriends.

441
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,934
They're action figures.

442
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,436
They're vagina repellent.

443
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,773
-I choose not to bring women here.
-Mm.

444
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,817
This is my Batcave,
my Fortress of Solitude.

445
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,695
Well, if your goal's solitude,
mission accomplished.

446
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,366
The only person that would be
turned on by this is Santa.

447
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,368
What is this?

448
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,786
I'm an aspiring oboist.

449
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:49,164
Good move.
Nothing drops panties like a woodwind.

450
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,459
-I'm getting a clean shirt.
-I'm just busting your chops.

451
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:53,627
Come on.

452
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,838
Listen, if you want a shot with Tina,
you gotta ditch all this stuff,

453
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,799
even if it just barely helps your odds.

454
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,885
"Never tell me the odds."

455
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,846
Han Solo.

456
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,556
-[winces]
-What did I just say?

457
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,724
Now go get changed.

458
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,519
And if you put on something
with a hobbit or something like that,

459
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,812
you'll get a fresh one.

460
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:12,729
Okay.

461
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,525
I'm doing this for you, okay?

462
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,819
I'm just trying to get some V for your D.

463
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,328
So just for the record,

464
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,414
I'm 100% on board

465
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:32,833
with the
"Don't have children with Carter" policy.

466
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:35,752
You were eavesdropping.

467
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,255
I'm a spy. Of course I eavesdrop.

468
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,757
I didn't say
I don't wanna have kids with Carter,

469
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,176
I just said I think we should wait a bit.

470
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:46,013
I love Carter very much, okay?

471
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,807
The CIA side of my life
is a little chaotic,

472
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:51,518
but he's… he's steady
and… and predictable.

473
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,563
Steady and predictable is something
you want from your accountant,

474
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,064
but not from your life partner.

475
00:21:56,148 --> 00:22:00,319
Your mother still is the most exciting
and the most challenging person

476
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:01,486
that I've ever known.

477
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:05,657
You need to find somebody that can
stimulate your mind and your heart,

478
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,702
not some nerd that wants to do
artsy-crafty stuff with you.

479
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,079
Hey, I like doing artsy-craftsy stuff.
It's soothing.

480
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:16,126
Do I sometimes wish
he was a little bit more adventurous? Yes.

481
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,961
But-- You know what? Why--

482
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,130
Oh my God, you're the last person on Earth

483
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,632
I should be discussing
relationship stuff with.

484
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,093
I just watched you beg Mom
to get on your little boat

485
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,762
like a lovesick schoolboy.

486
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,473
One, it was just a casual invitation.

487
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:32,768
Two, it's not a boat. It's a ship.

488
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,936
Okay, well, that ship has sailed.

489
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,233
The kidnapping Tina stumbled onto

490
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:43,945
was of Moldovan applied physicist,
Dr. Karl Novac.

491
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:48,450
He was in Ireland on a goodwill tour
to pump up Moldovan scientific prowess.

492
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,286
First blush is,
disappearance seems insignificant.

493
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,331
But Dr. Novac authored a scientific paper

494
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,166
outlining a novel process

495
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:59,378
to extract and augment
fissile nuclear material

496
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,545
from nuclear waste.

497
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,965
So Boro grabbed Poindexter
to salvage something useful

498
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,967
from that little bit
he got from the train?

499
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,763
-That's the theory we're going with.
-But Boro basically kidnapped a chef.

500
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,681
I mean,
he still needs his kitchen utensils

501
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,975
to make his radioactive dish.

502
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,311
If we can figure out
what that hardware is,

503
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:18,939
maybe we can get to it first
and then catch Boro.

504
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:20,982
Possibly. But there's a speed bump.

505
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,985
We've only ever seen an abstract
of Dr. Novac's paper.

506
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,490
The official scientific research
explaining the extraction process

507
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:30,700
was blocked from publication
by the Moldovan government.

508
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,370
Instead, they labeled him a national asset

509
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,206
and moved him to a government dormitory
with a handler

510
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:39,793
to protect him from spies and IP theft
and prevent defection.

511
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:44,256
-The whole dormitory's air-gapped?
-No Wi-Fi, no landline, no way to hack in.

512
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,007
Except for this.

513
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,467
That's why we have Air-hopper.

514
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:51,096
It's an app that can suck
all the data from any nearby hard drive.

515
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:56,059
It's camouflaged in a shell
of a popular game Jam Slam.

516
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:58,145
But how is the team
supposed to get past security

517
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:00,439
to get into the dormitory
to even use the app?

518
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,066
The only way to get in is to be invited
by someone who lives there.

519
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,654
Fortunately, Novac's handler,
Nika Stalinovich, lives at the dorm.

520
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:12,701
So she will have to invite home
someone from our team.

521
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,202
Pooh Bear.

522
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,204
[chanting] Pooh Bear! Pooh Bear!

523
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:21,793
Pooh Bear! Pooh Bear! Pooh Bear!

524
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:23,628
What the hell is Pooh Bear?

525
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:27,340
Aldon's Pooh Bear on account
of all the honeypots he collects.

526
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,467
Gross.

527
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,594
Pooh Bear! Pooh Bear! Pooh Bear!

528
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:32,512
-All right, knock it off.
-Sorry.

529
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,555
Sorry, boss.

530
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,476
Stalinovich will have all
of Novac's research on her computer,

531
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:38,393
so Aldon will…

532
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,644
Pooh Bear.

533
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,231
…use what little charm he has
to access her dorm

534
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,066
and download the paper using the app.

535
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,277
That should lead us to Boro's next move.

536
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,654
Great.
So, what does this lucky lady look like?

537
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,450
-[Dr. Pfeffer clears throat]
-[all] Boo.

538
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,493
[chuckles]

539
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,912
[clears throat]
There are no known photos of Nika,

540
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,289
as government handlers
are kept clandestine,

541
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:03,793
but I put together
a very interesting psych profile.

542
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,003
[Dr. Pfeffer clears throat]

543
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:09,466
Nika Stalinovich is a mid-level manager
suffering from low self-esteem

544
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,802
due to Novac's kidnapping
during a tour she signed off on.

545
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:16,056
Standard operating procedure
after such an incident

546
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,351
usually means the retraining
of all government handlers.

547
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:23,730
That would mean
a full day of re-education in a hotel,

548
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:24,648
The Bad Buffet.

549
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:26,900
[clears throat]

550
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:30,612
Luckily for us, just down the street
from the hotel is a bar.

551
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,906
After hours of public humiliation,

552
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:36,368
our backer, Nika,
will make her way across the street

553
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:39,621
where she will drown her sorrows
in some plum brandy.

554
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,999
So if Dr. Pepper is right,
the bar's our way in.

555
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,210
Pfeffer, like in "Michelle."

556
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,128
Dr. Pepper's theory
on Nika's state of mind

557
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,672
should make her open and vulnerable

558
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:51,716
to my very unique brand
of romantic… persuasion.

559
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:56,012
Your plane leaves in 12 hours,
as Nika's retraining finishes in 24.

560
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,558
I'll make sure there's a friendly asset
standing by with transpo for you.

561
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,767
Okay, get going everyone.

562
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,185
-Let's go.
-[Roo] Okay.

563
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,069
[sinister music playing]

564
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,906
Is everything in place?

565
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,324
Just waiting for a few shipments.

566
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,495
These are daisies. I asked for dog rose.

567
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,497
Yeah, but daisies are in season.

568
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,169
I will get the dog roses.

569
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,338
Excellent.

570
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,549
I want it all to be perfect.

571
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:33,466
[music ends]

572
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:38,430
[Luke] You're gonna be checkmated
in no time.

573
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,889
-That's for sure.
-Seriously, Dad?

574
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:43,476
Could you have requisitioned
a more unflattering outfit for me?

575
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,938
Well, you can't be Aldon's backup
if everyone in the bar is hitting on you.

576
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,107
About time you got a taste of it.

577
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,152
They always make me look like
a Baltic washerwoman.

578
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:53,737
Yeah, I should probably get ready too.

579
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,614
I gotta have the right bait
to reel in the fish.

580
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,324
-[scoffs]
-Speaking of which,

581
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,493
I'm a little worried about
this "no photo of Nika" thing.

582
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,537
Everybody thinks
you always land a rainbow trout,

583
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,540
but every now and again,
a sea robin just plops on deck,

584
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,292
-or a blobfish.
-[laughing]

585
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,418
Don't laugh at that.

586
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,753
Quick question.

587
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,421
Did you participate
in one of these missions

588
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:12,631
when you were married to Mom?

589
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,384
-Did you ever have an affair?
-Oh!

590
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,095
I never once had an affair
while I was married to your mother.

591
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,808
Well, that killed the mood.

592
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,653
[door closes]

593
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,613
-I could've been indecent.
-You are indecent.

594
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,032
The way you speak is disrespectful to me

595
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:42,035
and every woman
you have seduced in the line of duty.

596
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,244
You know what? You're right.

597
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:47,290
I was just trying to be funny. It wasn't.
For the record, I respect women a ton.

598
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,792
Yeah, sure you do.

599
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,670
Hey, I'm just straightforward about sex
on or off the job.

600
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,213
I treat women as equals, okay?

601
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,923
We all have needs, right?

602
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:56,508
I make offers with physical engagement.

603
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:58,885
If it's a yes, then great,
we'll both have a fantastic time,

604
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,762
because I'm really, really good
at intercourse.

605
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,431
But if it's a no,
then hopefully we become friends.

606
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,684
-What's more respectful than that?
-So many things.

607
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:10,230
First of all, your order of operations,
sex first, then maybe friendship?

608
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:13,191
Clearly women have one function
in your book.

609
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,235
-Roo and I are best friends.
-Roo is gay.

610
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,862
You guys are buddies
because sex is off the table.

611
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,366
I've had sex off a table, on a table,
and under a table at a Sur La Table,

612
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,076
and no, the irony isn't lost on me.

613
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:25,829
Bottom line,
honeypotting isn't easy, okay?

614
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,122
It's an art and a science.

615
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:31,209
No, it's an excuse for
arrested development frat boy bullshit,

616
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,377
and you know it.

617
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,173
[door closes]

618
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:41,553
[percussive music builds, ends]

619
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,596
[gentle music playing]

620
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,974
Green light. Cameras are in place.

621
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:46,891
[Barry] Pool chalk,

622
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,476
operational.

623
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,519
Eraser,

624
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,396
operational.

625
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,397
Salt shaker,

626
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,234
operational. [slurps]

627
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,487
[car horns honking in distance]

628
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,490
[Luke]
People are filtering out of the hotel.

629
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,908
Retraining must be over.

630
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,536
We'll alert you
if we see anyone who could be Nika.

631
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:08,121
[Emma] Hope she has no sense of smell.

632
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,247
Caught a whiff of Aldon.

633
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,500
He's like a category four
Drakkar Noir tsunami.

634
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,044
Pop culture in Eastern Europe
is 30 years behind the US.

635
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,673
They're into Zima,
'90s emo rock, and Drakkar Noir.

636
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,258
Nika's gonna love it.

637
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,509
And if she doesn't?

638
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,094
Simple.

639
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,556
Shock and awe.

640
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:27,640
[Luke] We may have a hit.

641
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:30,477
Tall blonde, appears to be
coming out of the retraining.

642
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,563
Man, Aldon's got a horseshoe up his ass.

643
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,567
[Aldon exhales, chuckles]

644
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,486
I have the best job.

645
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,864
[in Romanian] Anya. What'll it be?

646
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,367
[in English] Well, that's a negative
on Nika Stalinovich. Damn it.

647
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:50,789
[in Romanian]
Thanks for ruining our day, Nik.

648
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,710
-[in English] Did he just say Nik?
-Could Nika actually be a Nik?

649
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,046
Nik is a very common name
in this part of the world.

650
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,215
[in Romanian] You're a real goatfucker,

651
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,341
Stalinovich.

652
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,302
[in English] Tell me there's a lot
of Stalinoviches in this region.

653
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,055
Apparently, Nika Stalinovich was a typo.

654
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,516
Our target is Nik A. Stalinovich.

655
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,850
-Shit.
-Shit.

656
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,852
-Shit.
-This is hilarious.

657
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:14,229
Hang on, don't panic.

658
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,033
-Okay, he's definitely straight.
-How do you know?

659
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:28,827
Well, he didn't want any of this.

660
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,287
-We have to pivot. I'll take the lead.
-[Luke] Absolutely not.

661
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,581
-We abort now.
-On what grounds?

662
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:37,460
On the ground that I carry a photograph
of her in pigtails in my wallet.

663
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,505
Wallet photos? How old are you?

664
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,841
-I can do this.
-[Aldon] Damn right you can.

665
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,927
Get to the bathroom and de-frump yourself.
I'll be back in a minute.

666
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,269
No, you shut it down. I'm senior officer.

667
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,396
Then you know it violates protocol
to abort a mission

668
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,981
for any reason other than imminent death

669
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,692
or severe bodily injury
to an officer or civilian.

670
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,236
You may experience severe bodily injury.

671
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,780
I will not let my daughter
do the honeypot.

672
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,032
This isn't a honeypot, it's a honey drop.

673
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,869
She just talks to the guy,
gets him to take her back to his place,

674
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:14,622
uses the hopper to record the data,
and then she's off with her pants on.

675
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,042
At worst, there'll be some heavy petting.

676
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,797
Luke, she is a good officer.

677
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,048
Let her do her job.

678
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,634
And I'm gonna go do mine.

679
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,930
Hey, ladies.

680
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,682
Let's make a deal.

681
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:42,191
Okay, good. That's already an improvement.

682
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,820
-Try these.
-Where'd you get those?

683
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,947
Just a little help from some friends.

684
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:49,949
[Emma] Got it.

685
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,368
-Yep.

00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,648
and Emma goes to the gulag.

1031
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,984
Let go, man.
It's starting to smell like Whoppers.

1032
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:44,945
No, I'm gonna hold on to it.
That's it, and that's all.

1033
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,655
Come on, help me pack the holes.

1034
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:50,242
Hate to pile on, guys,
but we've got bigger problems.

1035
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:52,035
Nik's gotta be
some kind of video game prodigy

1036
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,412
because he just reached level seven.

1037
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,539
You gotta stop him
before he beats level seven.

1038
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:59,001
After that, the game facade ends,
and it reverts back to spy software.

1039
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,002
What? Why?

1040
00:48:00,085 --> 00:48:02,588
The app takes up lots of gigs.
We only had room for a few levels.

1041
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,299
[Aldon] Emma, listen to me.

1042
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:08,218
You gotta make him
not wanna look at that game.

1043
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,429
Shock and awe.

1044
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:11,930
Shock and awe.

1045
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,265
What's shock and awe?

1046
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:16,143
-Fluff me.
-What?

1047
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,271
That is shock and awe.

1048
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:22,691
[Aldon] Oh.

1049
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,776
[Emma] How's the game going?

1050
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,694
It's…

1051
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:39,291
Great job, Emma. Just hang tight
till we figure out our next move, okay?

1052
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,001
[Luke] Almost done?

1053
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,879
-I can't hold on to it much longer.
-[Aldon] I got you. I got you.

1054
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:44,796
[Roo] Hold on.

1055
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,007
-[Aldon] We're packed pretty tight here.
-[Roo] Got it.

1056
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,467
We're ready to give it a shot.

1057
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,846
Okay, Barry, give me good news.

1058
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,766
Connection is stable,
but we still need Dr. Novac's paper.

1059
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:58,560
Nik must have a hard copy somewhere.
Probably in a safe?

1060
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:01,021
[Tina] Statistically, most people
keep safes in their bedroom.

1061
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,272
No, no. No way.

1062
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,650
Shall we take this to the bedroom?

1063
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,318
Yes.

1064
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:10,489
How's Princess supposed to find
a hidden safe in the bedroom

1065
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:11,406
with Nik in there?

1066
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,699
[Nik grunts]

1067
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,160
-[whimsical music plays]
-[Nik grunting]

1068
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:18,580
[Nik] Yes! Yes! Yes!

1069
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:19,915
-No!
-[Nik] Yes!

1070
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:20,999
No! No!

1071
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,125
[Nik] Oh yes!

1072
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,544
Yes! Yes!

1073
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,462
[Nik moans]

1074
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:28,715
New wainscoting.

1075
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:29,841
What did you say?

1076
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,636
-I didn't say you could talk.
-Okay.

1077
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:35,430
Since when do Soviet-era block buildings
get makeovers?

1078
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,182
It's gotta be the facade for the safe.

1079
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,142
Knock the guy out and break in.

1080
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,186
Then if he wakes up,
he knows he's been robbed,

1081
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:44,147
tells his superiors, word gets out
that Novac's handler's been ambushed,

1082
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,316
Boro finds out,
he knows that we're onto him,

1083
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,901
pivots, he's gone forever.

1084
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,779
Just stay tight, sweetie, okay?

1085
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,531
We're gonna come up with a plan.

1086
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,284
Emma?

1087
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,245
Emma?

1088
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,580
Barry, is the cage up again?

1089
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,581
No.

1090
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:06,294
Um… it appears Emma has removed her comms.

1091
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:10,590
Communication has unilaterally been cut
just like she did in Guyana.

1092
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:11,967
Why would she take out the comm?

1093
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,135
Um…

1094
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,094
Hm…

1095
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,762
Why would Emma take out the comm?

1096
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,848
[suspenseful music playing]

1097
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:36,116
[suspenseful music continues]

1098
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:52,841
[whispering] I found the safe.
Nik's out cold.

1099
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:55,844
Please tell me that you poisoned him.

1100
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,529
[suspenseful music ends]

1101
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:17,949
[exhales]

1102
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,090
The paper, I've got it.

1103
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:35,717
[gun cocks]

1104
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:37,094
[tense music plays]

1105
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,141
Who do you work for?

1106
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,064
[closing theme playing]

1107
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,017
