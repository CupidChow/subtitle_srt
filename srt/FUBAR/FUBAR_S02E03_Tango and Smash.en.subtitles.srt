Norm and I work differently.
You and I are just going to talk.

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,418
And by the time we're finished,

177
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,796
I'm confident you'll want to tell me
where Greta is taking Luke.

178
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,132
Why on earth would I do that?

179
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,091
Because I believe

180
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:52,180
that even the most disturbed minds
have at least a shred of humanity left,

181
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,599
and we're going to find yours together.

182
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,685
It's a bit nippy in here, isn't it?

183
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,062
Mind if I borrow your cardigan?

184
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,191
I'm sure we can find a blanket
or something around here for you.

185
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,359
You don't want me wearing
something of your father's?

186
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,696
-Excuse me?
-That cardigan belonged to your father.

187
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,824
I can tell by the stitching
it was made in 1978.

188
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:13,659
The old stain on the cuff, tobacco.

189
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,205
But not pipe tobacco. No, chewing tobacco.

190
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,415
Yes, your father was blue-collar.

191
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,002
Your accent, Toronto,
but with a hint of Michigan.

192
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,837
Detroit more specifically.

193
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,131
As a child,
your father took the family there

194
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,217
to find work in the auto plants
on the line,

195
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,221
but you didn't like mechanical things,
did you, doctor?

196
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,515
Working with your hands
wasn't your predilection.

197
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,682
You were cerebral.

198
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,978
Your father didn't understand that,
and that caused frustration.

00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,023
He'd hit you sometimes, didn't he?

201
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,025
After a six-pack of Ballantine's

202
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,902
and when the Tigers
blew the lead in the ninth.

203
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:51,239
Not because of something you'd done,
just 'cause you were there.

204
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,908
And that's when the belt came off.

205
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,078
How's that make you feel, doctor?

206
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,039
I got this sweater last month at Target.

The stain is spilled tea.

209

My family is from Annapolis, Maryland.

210
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,797
My father was a podiatrist,
an Orioles fan.

211
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,382
He's my best friend.

212

How'd it go?

00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,380
In my professional opinion,
that man is the mayor of Ding Dong City.

Are you giving up?

229

Did Josef Breuer
give up on Bertha Pappenheim?

00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:57,138
Oh, well, I don't know.
Was she bad in bed or something?

231

All right,

Unfortunately, it dropped under deck
and disappeared before they could confirm,

241
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:24,332
but I just got a report on another hit
on an unidentified aircraft

242
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,584
from an air traffic controller in Dresden.

243

And?

All right,
are Luke and Greta on that plane?

[Barry] It's unlikely.

Thermal shows the engines have cooled.

252

They'd have refueled and been gone
if they planned on taking off again.

They're in Tallinn.

was at her place in Estonia,

The KGB might have the building
staked out just in case.

They had access to my files at the Stasi,

so they could have known
the alias I bought the apartment under.

-I think he got the point.
-"I think he got the point."

520
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,599
[both laughing]

521
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,600
Oh. [exhales]

522
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:02,774
I hate to admit it,
but I'm not the woman I once was.

523
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,026
[Greta sighs]

524
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,070
Could have fooled me.

525
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,744
-Now what?
-[exhales]

526
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,707
Gonna stick me again
with another sodium amytal needle?

527
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,624
[Greta] Mmm.

528
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,503
Too much too close together
could be dangerous.

529
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,340
Maybe while we wait, we could

530
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:31,887
just keep talking like the old days.

531
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,806
I'd like that.

532
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,976
[intriguing music playing]

533
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,941
Somebody took a long lunch.

534
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:49,905
[exhales]

535
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,043
[exhales]

536
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,588
[line ringing]

537
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,132
Anything on Luke's location?

538
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,177
[Tina] No, I'm sorry.
Nothing but dead ends on that front,

539
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,014
so I went back
to looking into Dante Cress' accounts,

540
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,475
following the money trail
that was siphoned out.

541
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,394
I know what that cash was spent on.

542
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,230
Please do not say a nuke.

543
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,814
Collectibles.

544
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,358
The most recent purchase

545
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:30,403
was a graded 9.9 copy
of Incredible Hulk 181.

546
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,364
The first appearance of Wolverine.

547
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:35,325
Farkas is the only CIA forensic accountant

548
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:38,161
that worked all 18
of the recent Dante Cress cases.

549
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,330
And he's a comic-book collector.

550
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,748
Farkas can be a real jerk,

551
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:45,085
but I can't imagine he'd steal millions
just to build up his collection.

552
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,087
That's the thing. He didn't.

553
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:51,174
I found evidence that he's been selling
the collectibles, often at a loss.

554
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,468
He turns them over very quickly.

555
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,596
He's not adding to his collection.
He's laundering the money.

556
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,056
This looks bad, Barry.

557
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,474
[sighs]

558
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:02,894
You really think Farkas is Dante Cress?

559
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,187
Maybe.

560
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,273
Or maybe he's working for him.

561
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:09,609
I don't know, but there's a connection.

562
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,529
Emma's gotta keep her head
in the game in Tallinn.

563
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,823
So, there's nothing she could do
from there anyway,

564
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,909
so I'll hold off telling her
until her and Luke are together.

565
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,579
But you've gotta tell
Interim Director Reed.

566
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,290
Already did.

567
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,877
[Farkas] Oh, thank you, Farkas.

568
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,754
Without your fiscal planning,

569
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,507
Gotham's budget
would've never been balanced.

570
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:37,053
Oh, it was really quite simple.
It's just a matter of spreadsheets.

571
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,263
I've got some sheets--

572
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,764
-Farkas.
-[Farkas clears throat]

573
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,310
I'm Miller. This is Davis.
Security Protective Service.

574
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,855
Regional Director Reed would like
a word with you. Come with us, please.

575
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,189
No.

576
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,190
[pen clicks]

577
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,526
[Miller] Excuse me?

578
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:55,697
I've done nothing to warrant Reed sending
two glorified mall cops to retrieve me.

579
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,324
It's wholly improper.

580
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:01,119
Why don't you go back to your entrance
metal detectors and wand each other?

581
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,164
Because I am not
getting out of this chair.

582
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,542
[upbeat music playing]

583
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,793
This is ridiculous.

584
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:11,504
I will take this all the way to the OIG.

585
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:18,428
When I'm done with you,
you will rue the day you crossed Farkas!

586
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,474
[music ends]

587
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,477
[Chips] 'Cause there's
all kinds of lovely names.

588
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,604
Percival, Silas,

589
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:31,399
Maximillian, Redwald, Ethelwulf…

590
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,026
-"Ethelwulf"?
-[Chips] Ethelwulf.

591
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,569
-"Ethelwulf"?
-[Chips] Yes, Ethelwulf.

592
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:38,281
It's a perfectly respectable name
for a British gentleman.

593
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,033
Hey, Emmsie, would you be opposed

594
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,619
to our firstborn
being called Ethelwulf Chips?

595
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:45,622
You could call him Fuckface Johnson
for all I care.

596
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,332
You're not having
that little shit with me.

597
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:49,918
[Aldon] Okay.

598
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,629
Not Givenchy or Manolo Blahniks.

599
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,631
-[Chips] Oh.
-But it'll do.

600
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:59,761
We got ourselves some fancy
going-out clothes as well, as you can see.

601
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,680
-You like?
-Is this a BabyBjörn?

602
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,598
And you said you didn't want to have kids.

603
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:07,644
-It's for Hamsteak.
-[Hamsteak snorts]

604
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,396
All right, I'm gonna get dressed.

605
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,774
-We got you something too, Mr. Chips.
-[Aldon clears throat]

606
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,150
-For me?
-[Roo] Mm-hmm.

607
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:18,571
To keep you in line since we can't exactly
hold you at gunpoint in public.

608
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,407
[upbeat music playing]

609
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,826
A dog-training shock collar?

610
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,744
[Aldon] We're not just gonna zap you
if you run.

611
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:28,123
If you get handsy,
if you are so much as crass or rude,

612
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,625
if you are anything
other than a total gentleman…

613
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,586
[inhales sharply] …well,
we're gonna hit the remote.

614
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,630
And if you're not looking
to draw attention,

615
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:39,217
then I can't walk into a restaurant
with that thing strapped around my neck.

616
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,219
Oh, this isn't going around your neck.

617
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,055
Right around your dick titties.

618
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,557
[Hamsteak squealing]

619
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,810
And then he bit down on his fake tooth

620
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,855
and broke open
the suicide pill inside, and kaput.

621
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,357
[both laughing]

622
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:57,152
I just wanted to punch him, not kill him.

623
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,153
[Greta] He deserved it.

624
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,114
Spying on you for us.
Spying on us for you.

625
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,491
-I mean, triple agents suck.
-The worst.

626
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,911
-I mean, pick a side. [laughs]
-Yeah, that's for sure.

627
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,831
[Greta laughs] I need a drink.

628
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,499
How about some wine?

629
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:12,876
Hmm?

630
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:17,130
-[music playing]
-[glasses clinking]

631
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,673
Our wine list, sir.

632
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,008
[in Estonian] Thanks.

633
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,092
[in English] Right.

634
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,470
-Okay.
-We're drinking water.

635
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:26,431
Hardly sounds like a date,
which was the deal.

636
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,435
Fine. That one.

637
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:33,354
An excellent choice, madam.

638
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,609
You getting all this, Barry?

639
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,027
[Barry] Live in living color.

640
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,989
Checking all diners and staff
against all known international criminals.

641
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:45,116
-So far, no alarm bells.
-[computer beeping]

642
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,912
Maybe Chips is so cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs

643
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,580
because it really isn't a trap.

644
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,918
Maybe he actually
just wants a romantic dinner.

645
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:55,877
Fantastic.

646
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,921
[Roo] If it does turn out to be a trap,

647
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,131
he's getting cooked plums for dessert.

648
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,050
[Dr. Pfeffer] If it does turn out
to be a trap,

649
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:04,260
I'll be a lot more use there than here.

650
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,845
This is degrading.

651
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,390
-I am a CIA officer just like you.
-[Hamsteak snorts]

652
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,850
Just like us, doc?

653
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:12,852
Pigs need to be watched, Dr. P.

654
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:15,104
How's my little fella doing?

655
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,272
He's flatulent.

656
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,398
So is my roommate.

657
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,442
Look, we'll bring you a doggy bag.

658
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:22,195
Tell Hamsteak that
Daddy will bring him something tasty too.

659
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:24,030
Pork tenderloin looks good.

660
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,031
Not funny.

661
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,701
[music continues]

662
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,122
I love this one.

663
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,546
[Chips snapping fingers]

664
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,755
Stop.

665
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,510
-Where's the waiter?
-Come on. Let's not rush the evening.

666
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,471
You might discover
that you actually enjoy my company.

667
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,390
After all, we… we have a lot in common.

668
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,599
Please.

669
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,102
[Chips] We both followed our fathers
into the family business,

670
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,354
legendary figures in the espionage world,

671
00:30:56,437 --> 00:31:00,066
who gave us much to live up to,
perhaps too much.

672
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,569
Who knows better than I
what you've been through,

673
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:04,195
what you're going through now?

674
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,825
When you were growing up,
did you know your father was a spy?

675
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:12,328
Yes. He groomed me from childhood
to follow in his footsteps.

676
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,080
Then we aren't alike at all.

677
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,331
Do you really believe

678
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:18,084
that because you didn't know
what Luke Brunner did for a living

679
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:21,129
that you had any more choice
in your future than I did?

680
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,757
Tell me you didn't excel in academics
and sports just to please him.

681
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:27,802
Tell me the CIA didn't recruit you
because of him.

682
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,513
Tell me that you don't know what it's like
to want more than anything

683
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,973
not just to be the best,

684
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,768
but to be perfect
at absolutely everything that you do

685
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:39,188
to honor your father's legacy,
while simultaneously fearing deep down

686
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,482
that you might never live up to
his legacy to begin with.

687
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,444
If you were supposed to end up
like your father, how did you go so wrong?

688
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,947
You're a traitor to your country,

697
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:17,268
and in his last moments,
he has this crushing realization

698
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,938
that he was a mere pawn
sacrificed in a game

699
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,898

long before he was in it,

without him long after he was dead,

there was hope.

just slipped back into the same old chaos.

I think that the only good thing
that came out of what I did in '89

was that it allowed you

with your true soulmate.
