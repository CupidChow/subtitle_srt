00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,663
Six? I only count five.

177
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,249
-No, in the kitchen.
-There's no one in there, mate.

178
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,667
What? Call you back.

179
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:22,752
-[Tally] You okay?
-Yeah.

180
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,587
I'm gonna be in the car, all right?

181
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:29,217
Pardon me, I'd like to make
a whimsical purchase, please.

182
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,429
Shit.

183
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,599
Where the hell did he go?

184
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,892
[sinister music playing]

185
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,393
Take me to Luke Brunner.

186
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,978
[engine revving]

187
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,565
Oh bollocks.

188
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,442
[spluttering] We got a runner!

189
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,777
-Son of a bitch!

[Chips exhales sharply]

197
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,675
Oh shit.

198
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,301
His leg thing is beeping.

199
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:13,761
Throw it!

200
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,724

00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,185
[Chips exclaims]

203
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,603
-Very good.
-Thank you.

204
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:24,939
You saved my life.

205
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:29,569
Has anyone ever told you that
you look like a young Sigourney Weaver?

206
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,486
[chuckles]

207
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,613
Okay, now she likes him too.

208
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:36,325
A three-quarter socket head, please.
The one that looks like a hollow cylinder.

209
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,078
-I know what a damn socket head is, Dad.
-[Luke] Yeah, of course.

210
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,540
-Hey, Dane, give me the lighter.
-What's mine is yours, compadre.

211
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,334
There, we got it.

212
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,377
[torch ignites]

213
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,129
All right. Here.

214
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,050
[Young Emma] Rivets heat the rods
that connect to the bolts

215
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,468
that hold the weights.

216
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,138
The bolts get hot, disintegrate,

217
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,765
weights fall off, sub should rise.

218
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,227
[intriguing music playing]

219
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,771
This is working. We're rising.

220
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,231
We'll be topside soon.

221
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:10,026
We'll call Kodiak Island,
tell them to kill the diagnostic check.

222
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,778
-Greta's not winning this one. Yeah.
-[laughing]

223
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,113
[all laughing]

224
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:16,198
Look how beautiful you look
with your hair.

225
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,533
My hair? [giggles]

226
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:18,951
[Luke] Yeah.

227
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,871
You look adorable too. So smiley.

228
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:26,375
And when you get excited, it's funny
because your arms go like this. [laughs]

229
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,377
[Luke laughing]

230
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,715
-When you look at me, what do you see?
-[Young Emma] A puppet.

231
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,924
How are you seeing me?

232
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,261
I see pigtails and a denim jumper,

233
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,597
and always my little girl.

234
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,973
Well, not always.

235
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,683
To be honest with you,

236
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,435
always.

237
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:47,521
Dad, I thought you were done
looking at me like a little kid.

238
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,440
[sighs]

239
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,650
I'm sorry.

240
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,694
-If I gave you this impression, I lied.
-[gentle music playing]

241
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,739
Because I know that you're grown up,

242
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,408
but I still see the little girl
who played dolls with me.

243
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,161
Remember all the dolls you had?
You had, like, hundreds of dolls.

244
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:06,582
And every one of those dolls
had a backstory.

245
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,460
And then you would quiz me.
You'd ask me different questions.

246
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:12,755
If I got it wrong,
all hell broke loose, I tell you.

247
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,881
[laughing]

248
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,174
But I never turned it down,

249
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:18,052
because I knew that the day will come
when you grow up

250
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,138
and you will not invite me anymore
to play with those dolls.

251
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,516
I would give anything

252
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,269
to get to play dolls with you
one more time.

253
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,068
I'm sorry, Schatzel, if I--

254
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,781
If I always made you feel like
you're the little girl.

255
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,408
I… I will try to do better.

256
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:42,827
I promise.

257
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,831
[emotional music playing]

258
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,838
If cells are constantly dividing,
which makes their numbers multiply,

259
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,924
are they multiplying
or are they dividing? Math.

260
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,592
[intriguing music playing]

261
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,969
I think I'm high.

262
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:01,554
[phone ringing]

263
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,473
Security office, Lambert speaking.

264
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,684
This is CIA Officer Luke Brunner again.

265
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,228
Do not run the daily diagnostic check.

266
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:12,064
If you do, the virus
is gonna infect your system.

267
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,233
-[computer beeping]
-Hold on, something's happening.

268
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:17,778
Our coastal load center in Seattle's
in complete mechanical failure.

269
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,240
Seattle? That's where the Kodiak Island
nuclear power is sent.

270
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,324
Look, I… I gotta go.

271
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,744
If the load center's down,
our nuclear output has nowhere to go.

272
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,370
We need to shut operations down now.

273
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,955
No, no. Wait, wait, wait.

274
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,124
Greta totally misdirected us.

275
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,126
Her virus wasn't targeting
the power plant.

276
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,462
She was targeting where the power
was sent and distributed.

277
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,046
She knew
if she hit the coastal load center,

278
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,632
then Kodiak Island
would be forced to shut itself down.

279
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:41,761
Greta, two. Us, zero.

280
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,431
Don't worry, man. There are plenty
of other fish in the sea.

281
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,600
Just next time,
don't go fishing in the Baltic Sea.

282
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,060
Hey. Hey, hey.
I need to talk to you three.

283
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,397
-I think I made myself clear earlier.
-You're gonna wanna hear this.

284
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,192
OTS went through Tina's desktop,
laptop, and phone.

285
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,735
We found encrypted communications

286
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:59,487
between her
and her handler, Mikhail Volek.

287
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:00,654
That's our file on him.

288
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,781
Hmm.

289
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,659
They don't appear to have
any association with Dante Cress,

290
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,536
other than Russia's interest

291
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,122
in happily watching a terrorist
try to take down the US power grid.

292
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:14,084
Great, she's not trying to destroy
the world, just me.

293
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,544
[Reed] From what we've ascertained,

294
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:18,047
Tina's parents emigrated to Russia
before she was born.

295
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,840
As a child, she was part of a program

296
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,552
that paid families in exchange to send
children to a state-run espionage school.

297
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,180
As a teen, she was sent to the US
with a fabricated ID,

298
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:29,600
and began a career that led her
to the NSA, and ultimately the CIA.

299
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,310
I swear I had no idea about this, sir.

300
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,603
We know that now.

301
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:36,190
Among Tina's communiqués with Volek,
she said that she had not turned you yet.

302
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,441
You have been reinstated.

303
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,569
There you go. You're off the bench, pal.

304
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,239
-You feel better?
-Nothing can make me feel better.

305
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:48,494
Well, Greta's already halfway to her goal
to wipe out the grid.

306
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,329
[liftgate beeps]

307
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:53,249
Knowing her, she's probably already
on to her next move.

308
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,835
Then you should get out of here.
I'll wait for Cameron's sub guy.

309
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,002
How you gonna get home?

310
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,215
I'm the Great Dane.
I'll finagle a private jet or something.

311
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,633
We owe you one.

312
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:04,802
Thanks, Great Dane.

313
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,638
-Achtung, baby. Go save the world.
-[car doors open, close]

314
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,391
You guys are cool. [chuckles]

315
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,351
Tonight was fun.

316
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,313
Hey, I actually ordered a-- Whoa!

[door closes]

320
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,956
I wanted to look you in your eyes
and tell you what you already know.

321
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,209
And I know that what we had was real.

322
00:14:37,793 --> 00:14:39,169
The only reason you got caught

323
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,630
is 'cause you saved my life
while I was up in space.

324
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,133
So that means that deep down…

325
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,843
[breathing shakily]

326
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:46,969
…somewhere,

327
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:48,512
you care about me.

328
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,763
[inhales]

329
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,475
I invested a lot of time and energy
into you, Barry.

330
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,769
And if you'd died,

331
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:00,274
I would have had to start
all over again with someone else.

332
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,650
So,

333
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,653
you don't love me anymore?

334
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:06,989
I never did.

335
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,033

00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,653
Well, after everything
you two have been through,

343
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:48,405
I figured you deserve
one of your favorite breakfasts.

344
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,116
Mom, you didn't have to get up at 5:30
in the morning to make it.

345
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,370
Oh, I couldn't relax
until you came home anyway, sweetheart.

346
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,038
I'm just glad you're safe.

347
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:56,956
I love you.

00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,378
What's going on?

350
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,088
What do you mean?

351
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,048
We just recently broke up,

352
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,802
and now all of a sudden you're serving me
kaiserschmarrn and apfelstrudel?

353
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:14,264
I mean, look, I know you well enough,
and I know you have a guilty conscience.

354
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,476
Dad, please. She's allowed
to make breakfast for her family.

355
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,394
Right.

356
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:25,317
-What happened while we were gone?
-Uh… May I watch Franklin & Bash, please?

357
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:29,780
What happened?

358
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,200
I went to Romi's party,

359
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:35,661
and the Swedish mafia showed up
and tried to kill us.

360
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,745
There. I'm sorry.

361
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,455
-Romi?
-[Tally] No, everyone's fine.

362
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:42,084
-Well, Carter hit his head.
-What were you thinking?

363
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,377
I was thinking

364
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,005
I wanted to see my grandchild
for the first time in months!

365
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:48,966
I was thinking I hate that your job,

366
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,926
something I had no say in,

367
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,470
is disrupting so many lives!

368
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,056
People could've gotten killed
because of you.

369
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,599
That was a selfish move.

370
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:00,144
-Okay, Dad, easy.
-[Tally] I know. I was there.

371
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,979
I was terrified.

372
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,355
Thank God for Chips.

373
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,859
-What does he have to do with this?
-He risked his life to save mine.

374
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,448
There you go.

375
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:15,701
-You don't have to do this, you know.
-No, I'm happy to help.

376
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:20,789
Although, it would be much easier
if my… my hands were unfettered.

377
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,458
Look at this. So awkward.

378
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:23,584
Nice try.

379
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,127
[scoffs] Fine.

380
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:29,089
But I do appreciate
what you did for my mom.

381
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,258
You could've died
for a woman you hardly know.

382
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,010
Oh, but I do know her.

383
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,055
The put-upon wife of an international spy.

384
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,598
Yes, that was my mom.

385
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,475
She passed when I was seven, but…

386
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,310
[exhales]

387
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,228
…I never forgot the essence of my mother.

388
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,563
She was a good woman.

389
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,942
A good woman whose first
and last priorities were her family.

390
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:52,905
And, well, Tally,
her essence is the same as my mom's.

391
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,865
That does sound like her.

392
00:17:54,948 --> 00:17:57,034
You know,
before you and your father returned,

393
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,452
while she was cooking,

394
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,497
she brought me over a plate.

395
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,249
Shared a home-cooked meal with me,
a family meal.

396
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,169
I can't even remember
the last time I had that. It's magical.

397
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,670
You're very lucky.

398
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,548
-But you and your father were a family.
-I suppose.

399
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:14,384
Look, Emma, I, um… [sighs]

400
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,638
I know I'm a bit of a nutter,
but I more than fancy you,

401
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:21,809
and… and um…
I just can't lie to you any longer.

402
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:23,852
About what?

403
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,396
About how my father passed.

404
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,109
[inhales sharply] He died because of me.

405
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:34,905
As we were completing our final operation,
I took a bullet to the thigh.

406
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:38,659
He refused to leave me behind,
and we were under fire.

407
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:42,287
He jumps on top of me,
and he's… he's riddled with bullets.

408
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:47,251
And as he's bleeding out,
I'm just desperately trying to gather up

409
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,419
the top-secret paperwork
that needs to be transferred.

410
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,338
You see, we obtained this valise.

411
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,757
The lock had been shot off,
and the contents had spilled out.

412
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,925
We couldn't leave it behind.

413
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:58,137
Our government said
it was of the utmost importance.

414
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,140
-Always complete the mission.
-Always complete the mission.

415
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,562
I gathered everything, and…
that's when I saw they were photos.

416
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,356
A member of parliament and his mistress.

417
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,067
That's what cost
my father his… his life, you know,

418
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,986
covering up an affair. I mean, it's…

419
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,742
He saw those snapshots
in my hand as he was dying, and…

420
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:22,828
[sighs]

421
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,329
Theo.

422
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,292
That's when he knew
it was all for nothing.

423
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,422
I don't know why… I just…
I've never shared that with anyone before.

424
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,757
But with you, I'm…

425
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,761
I appreciate you listening, Emma Brunner.

426
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,305
I do.

427
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,975
Oh yes. I have, um…

428
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,351
Here, hold on.

429
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,646
…a sign of my affection.

430
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:51,940
How about that?

431
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,817
May I?

432
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,031
-There you go.
-Mmm.

433
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,115
Fits beautifully.

434
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,867
Now watch closely.

435
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,204
[ring whistling]

436
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,580
[both laughing]

437
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,749
Oh wow. Thank you.

438
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,292
I got a great deal on it, okay?

439
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,003
It was only like 500 tickets or something.
Can I kiss you?

440
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,671
Uh, absolutely not.

441
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,672
I didn't think so.

442
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,716
[both chuckle]

443
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,176
Uh, but thank you for this.

444
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,678
Wow. I… I do appreciate the gift.

445
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:26,516
And, uh, since we're done with the dishes,

446
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,062
I should probably, um,
get about an hour's sleep

447
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,397
before everyone wakes up
and this place gets really loud.

448
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,482
Well, I understand.

449
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,652
So rest up and, you know… [clears throat]

450
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,569
…dream of me.

451
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,739
-Back to the radiator.
-Back to the radiator.

452
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,241
[Luke] I'll get him settled.

453
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,492
[Emma] Hey, Dad.

454
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,371
Schatzel, better get some rest, okay?

455
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,373
-You too.
-Okay.

456
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,376
[handcuffs rattling]

457
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,127
[Chips exhales]

458
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,337
[Chips sighs]

459
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,047
Thank you.

460
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,093
[moaning]

461
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,596
It's the least I can do
after what you've done for Tally.

462
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,847
She and I may be through,

463
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,891
but I don't ever want anything
to happen to her.

464
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,019
And what you did took character.

465
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,690
Your thanks warms the cockles
of my frosty heart.

466
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,651
As long as you keep those cockles
away from my daughter.

467
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:18,568
[both laugh]

468
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,736
So no sleep for the weary?

469
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,031
The adrenaline is still pumping
through my body from the last mission.

470
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,242
You know, you actually exceed
Greta's stories of you.

471
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,827
Greta talked about me?

472
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,620
Said she got
all of her best moves from you.

473
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,956
[Luke] She's flattering me,
because the truth is,

474
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,960
she's the most brilliant operative
that I've ever encountered.

475
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:38,672
You know, Emma was hallucinating
today on the submarine

476
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,716
that I am a puppet.

477
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,884
I think that subconsciously,

478
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:46,138
she believes that I could be manipulated
by someone like Greta.

479
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:51,143
But Greta and I, we have a connection
that Emma will never understand.

480
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:54,980
I really believe that the only way
I emotionally disconnected from Greta

481
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,898
was because I believed she was dead.

482
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,776
-But now since we know that she's alive--
-Luke. Luke.

483
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,528
-What?
-I may have made a mistake.

484
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,113
[foreboding music playing]

485
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:04,948
What mistake?

486
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:05,907
Before you got back,

487
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,743
Donnie left his laptop
on the coffee table.

488
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:08,994
When no one was looking,

489
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:12,331
I sent an email to Greta explaining
that you still had feelings for her.

490
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,250
-Why did you do that?
-I don't know.

491
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:16,752
I just… It's…

492
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,297
After spending time
with your family and your team,

493
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,049
there's just so much good out there,

494
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:25,594
and I'd just rather be on the side
of protecting it than… than destroying it.

495
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,803
And I thought that the email

496
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,014
would get her to abandon
going through with Cress' plan.

497
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,184
If she knew you could be together again,
she'd stop attacking the grid.

498
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:35,771
You see, she's like me, Luke.
She's only in this for the money.

499
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,690
I don't think she wants to see
what happens when the power goes down.

500
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:39,900
No, I certainly don't.

501
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:41,902
Maybe I did once,
but I certainly don't now.

502
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:46,031
And if she believes that she has a future
with her once-in-a-lifetime love,

503
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,825
she might just abandon
this whole Dante Cress endeavor.

504
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:49,826
-But…
-[car door opens]

505
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:51,995
[car door closes]

506
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,707
I'm not sure any of us
have a future right now.

507
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,920
-Why?
-That's one of Greta's go-to mercenaries.

508
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:02,631
I must have left the connection open
on Donnie's laptop,

509
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,800
and they obviously traced
our signal back here.

510
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,718
Breach! Breach!

511
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,053
[tense music playing]

512
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,724
Six more out the back. We're surrounded.

513
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:16,103
They've stopped about 30 yards away.
They don't seem to be coming closer.

514
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,354
What the hell's going on?

515
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:20,357
Greta has a dozen guys,
front and back, in position.

516
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,567
What are they, vampires?
They need to be invited in?

517
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:24,027
Isn't he supposed to be handcuffed?

518
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:27,280
Three firearms per man,
sidearms, hip pieces, ankle bulges.

519
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,949
How did they find us?

520
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:32,494
I may have extended
an electronic olive branch to Greta

521
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,830
that turned out to be traceable.

522
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,872
Not cool, man.

523
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:37,791
Let's just focus
on how to get out of this.

524
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,710
-What's the hubbub?
-[Roo] We got some bad boys in the 'hood.

525
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,046
-Nope. No.
-Oh God!

526
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,673
-[Chips] Spotted dick.
-Oh my God!

527
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,466
-Bad, Donnie. Bad, Donnie.
-[Luke] What?

528
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,301
The sergeant needs his space.

529
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,637
-What?
-You guys are a bunch of prudes.

530
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,139
He likes to breathe.

531
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,890
Salt-and-pepper pubes.

532
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,892
-Oh Jesus!
-[Roo] Oh Don-a-mia.

533
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,187
I'm gonna get in touch with Reed,
get some backup here.

534
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:00,897
My phone is not working.

535
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,024
-I don't have any signal either.
-[Carter] Me neither.

536
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,652
-Email's out.
-And texts. The sons of bitches jammed us.

537
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,695
[phone ringing]

538
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,071
We have a landline?

539
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:12,492
[phone ringing, beeps]

540
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,661
Greta.

541
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:15,912
So that's her.

542
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:17,998
This is awkward.

543
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:25,505
So, what's your game plan now?
Rescue Chips and kidnap me again?

544
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,631
[Greta] None of the above.

545
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,841
I love you, you love me.

546
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,468
But I need to finish this job,

547
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:33,597
and you and your team
have become thorns in my side.

548
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,642
So for everyone's sake, I'm making sure
that your safe house stays safe

549
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,645
with soldiers of fortune
from around the globe,

550
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,190
the best Dante's money can buy.

551
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,066
They've been instructed not to harm you

552
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,446
unless anyone
so much as sticks a toe outside,

553
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,073
then it's shoot to kill.

554
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,951
You make a move,
and I put a bullet through Chips' head.

555
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,245
[whispering] I don't mean it.

556
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,956
Please do me the favor.

557
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,960
He not only got himself abducted,
but he hasn't even attempted to escape.

558
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,796
He's either useless or compromised

559
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,341
by something
that's taken precedence over me.

560
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,384
So just sit tight

561
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:15,931
until my hired guns finish the job
and take down the grid.

562
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:20,852
Then you and I
will ride off into the sunset

563
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,564
like we should have done
all those years ago.

564
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,901
Cut it.

565
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:28,902
[line disconnects]

566
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:29,819
Scheisse!

567
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,614
She's cut the line.

568
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,950
Now we have no way to call for help.

569
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,285
-Actually, wait, I have a sat phone.
-From where?

570
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:41,081
Nothing, it's just when we were fighting
the Swedes, I pulled it from their car.

571
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,416
-And what did you find on it?
-Stuff.

572
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,460
Shit, Aldon,
what the hell's wrong with you?

573
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,338
Look, I was gonna talk to Luke about it
in private when he got back.

574
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,841
-We just haven't gotten around to it yet.
-I order you to tell me what was on it.

575
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,221
-Carter's comic was on it.
-Oh God.

576
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,516
And an AI program the Swedes used
to match locations drawn in it.

577
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,811
Someone in their crew must read
online comics and they stumbled across it.

578
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,479
Carter, I'm sorry, man.

579
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:08,400
I know we're not each other's biggest fan,
but I didn't want it to go down this way.

580
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,317
It's impossible.

581
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,153
The only things I drew were stuff
I could see outside my bedroom window,

582
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,364
like downtown office buildings,
or a church steeple.

583
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:15,740
[Emma] That's all AI needs.

584
00:26:15,824 --> 00:26:19,160
They cross-reference photos and maps
and can pinpoint your general location.

585
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:22,497
The Swedes must have come here
and have been driving around for days

586
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,374
just waiting to spot one of us.

587
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,669
Clocked Tally and had their goons
follow her right to the birthday party.

588
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:30,338
Oh my God. I'm so sorry.

589
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,592
I'm sorry. It's not your fault.
I could've gotten us all killed.

590
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,093
Yes, it's definitely your fault,

591
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,345
but having their phone
actually might save us now.

592
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,141
It's blocked. We can't make a call, right?
But I bet there are Swedes still in town.

593
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:44,936
There is no way they sent all their men
on the one scouting party that found us.

594
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,563
If we turn the sat phone back on…

595
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,774
The rest of the Swedes will follow
the GPS signal to our doorstep.

596
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,986
-Greta or her soldiers see them…
-Think we called someone for help.

597
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,238
-They go after each other.
-While we make our escape.

598
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,781
Then we all go out for spicy pudding.

599
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,292
Pancakes without lingonberry.

600
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,752
-What's the point?
-[phone chimes]

601
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,046
[chuckles] It's Anders.

602
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,797
[man 1] What's going on
at the pizza place?

603
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,216
[man 2] He says
CIA cleaning crew is there.

604
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,011
Our guys are dead. Their guys are gone.

605
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:18,928
[phone chiming]

606
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,474
It's Sven's phone. It's back online.

607
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,518
It's a new avatar.
How do I make it bigger?

608
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,853
[soft rock music playing]

609
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,651
Greta found us here because of me, right?

610
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,695
So the least I can do
is fight alongside you.

611
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,699
He was armed in the pizza place, right?
Did he try anything?

612
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,909
Actually, no.

613
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,662
-He turned his weapon over to me.
-All right.

614
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,872
-I'll take your cuff off.
-[Chips] All right.

615
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,832
But if you try anything, you're dead.

616
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,459
Drop your pants.

617
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,418
[pants unzip]

618
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,340
Oh, so it's fine when he does it?

619
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:02,013
I spy with my little eye something

620
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,057
red.

621
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,266
[birds chirping]

622
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:06,893
Stop sign.

623
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:12,107

-How the hell did they call in for backup?
-Luke always finds a way.

627
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,001
Ready? Let's get to the SUV.

629
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,600
Hey, Tally, do me a favor.

630
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:49,060
-I need my hands free.
-Yes.

631
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,311
It's okay. It's okay.

632
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,063
Come on, let's go.

633
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,357
-Floor it!
-Got it.

Now, as civilians,
you might be feeling a little vulnerable

having lost your safe house.

652
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,600
More than a little.

653
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:11,851
Now, don't worry.

654
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,604
You're gonna be safe in here
until we get our new accommodations.

655
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:18,900
In the meantime, I got you all
limited access inside the building.

656
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,693
Here. For the gym,

the museum,

-Thank you.
-Yep. Yeah, thank you.

Whoa. Are those us?

00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:38,378
Yeah, they arrived yesterday
to augment your therapy.

664
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:39,295
[Donnie] Mmm.

665
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,424
Hello, handsome.

666
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:48,346
Uh, just out of curiosity,
what are we doing with Dr. No Thanks?

667
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,264
[Chips] Hmm?

668
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,307
It's a magnetic vest.

669
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,851
[Luke] Aldon, you check with OTS

670
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,645
and see how far along they are
with cracking that BlackBerry.

671
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,356
-Take Chips with you.
-What do I do with piggy boy?

672
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,233
-Carter will look after him.
-Copy that.

[Hamsteak snorting]

674
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,819
Okay, there you go.

675
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,736
Oh fuck.

676
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,865
So he likes squash and carrots at noon,
a snack of broccoli at four.

677
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,575
He always naps after he eats,

678
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,410
He prefers to fall asleep
to Smokey Robinson.

679
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,578
He's afraid of vacuums,

680
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:15,415
and I swear to God, if there's a scratch
on a hair on his chinny chin chin,

681
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:16,499
it's your ass.

682
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,252
So I'm a… I'm a pig sitter now?

683
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,504
And Emma and I
will talk to Greta's muscle,

684
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,131
squeeze everything
out of him that he knows.

685
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,008
All right, everybody? Let's get going.

686
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,551
-Come on.
-[Roo] All right.

687
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:28,344
So, what should we do first?

688
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,470
I'm good.

689
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:32,849
[Tally] Ugh.

690
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:36,185
Tally, after this morning's excitement,
a little walk might make you feel better.

691
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,062
-Yes, please.
-[Dr. Pfeffer] Let's do it.

692
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:38,980
Thank you.

693
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,443
Oh my God.

694
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,988
[Hamsteak grunting]

695
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,574
[door opens]

696
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,785
[Luke exhales]

697
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,954
It's a nice shiner you got there, Dieter.

698
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:57,123
Unless you want a matching set,

699
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:00,209
I suggest you tell us everything you know
about Greta's plan.

700
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,464
-Eat shit.
-Now that's not very nice, Dieter.

701
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,007
We're here to try to help you.

702
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,677
I've been waterboarded
and survived Chinese water torture.

703
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,012
You can't break me.

704
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,889
Oh, we're not gonna break you.

705
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,892
-We're gonna call our friend Norm Carlson.
-Norm?

706
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,770
Greta went to a DARPA facility in Kansas.

707
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:19,938
Why?

708
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,690
I'm just hired muscle.
She doesn't share any specifics.

709
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,734
Okay, contacts… [sighs]

710
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,069
Carlson, Norm.

711
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:26,986
Okay, wait.

712
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,238
She said she needed to borrow something
from your government.

713
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:30,448
-What?
-[Dieter] I don't know.

714
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,909
But there's stuff
that is instrumental to her plan.

715
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:36,454
And if she wants something,
she can't be stopped.

716
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,956
You should know.

717
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,667
You're the one
who has all been hotsie-totsie with her.

718
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,044
-[intriguing music playing]
-"Hotsie-totsie"?

719
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,630
-He's a liar.
-[Dieter] I'm not lying.

720
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,966
I don't want Norm Carlson
anywhere near my slacks.

721
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,885
I think we got everything
out of him we needed.

722
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,722
Please rally the troops. Briefing in ten.

723
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,017
[door closes]

724
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,144
How hotsy-totsy?

725
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,022
[music fades]

726
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:12,115
Director Reed,
may I speak with you a moment?

727
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:23,209
Well, we just learned from Dieter,
Greta hit a DARPA facility in Kansas.

728
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,713
DARPA spots are practically invisible.
How the hell could she pull that off?

729
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,381
Because it's Greta Nelso.

730
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,549
[door opens]

731
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,591
Sorry, I'm late.

732
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,761
The DOD has confirmed
that there is a secret DARPA facility

733
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,179
in Ulysses, Kansas.

734
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,348
That's not too far
from the hydroelectric dam

735
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,683
that Greta needs to take down.

736
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,768
The military's there,
and so far, they're fine.

737
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,605
DARPA's got all kinds of weapons
and gadgets, experimental and otherwise.

738
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,816
Scares me to think
what she could've taken from there.

739
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,192
-It's Reed.
-[phone beeps]

740
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,110
Yes, sir.

741
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,154
Understand.

742
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,280
[line beeps]

743
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,490
Well, one thing we know that she took,

744
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:58,161
which is an AWC,
an atmospheric water cannon.

745
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,162
What the heck is that?

746
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:03,207
It's like a bazooka gun that sucks air in,
pulls out all the humidity,

747
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,335
and then shoots water out the other end
at super high pressure.

748
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,254
-Like when you have dairy.
-Yep.

749
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,173
Let me guess.
They hooked the water bazooka up

750
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:14,343
to the Sun Tower's subterranean
molten salt exchange, and it exploded.

751
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:18,014
-Third power plant's down.
-And the National Guard surrounded it.

752
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,975
She must've made her team
drill underneath.

753
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,977
Bottom line is, Greta's down to the dam.

754
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,771
She takes that out, the grid goes with it.

755
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:26,439
And whatever else she takes from DARPA

756
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,816
is gonna tell us
exactly how she plans to attack that dam.

757
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:33,321
Roo and Emma, you both go to Kansas.
Find out everything that you can at DARPA.

758
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,322
-Why?
-[Roo] Boo.

759
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,239
[Luke] Very simple.

760
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:38,409
You have proven to work very efficiently
together under pressure.

761
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:40,828
Aldon, Chips, and I,
we're gonna visit the dam.

762
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,997
Actually, I just got an update from OTS.

763
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,084
The BlackBerry was a fresh burner.
Nothing on it other than emails.

764
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,669
But they confirmed
that the hitmen were hired by Cress

765
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:51,172
to take out Bashir the Builder
before he talked to us.

766
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:55,218
What's interesting is the emails are
in this distinct, rare Sardinian dialect,

767
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:57,053
so if we find the hitmen's handlers,

768
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,472
we're one link in the chain
closer to finding Cress.

769
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:02,767
And I know just the little Italian
informant who's gonna get us there.

770
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,768
Nonna.

771
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,436
That Nonna makes me uncomfortable.

772
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,564
She's kind of always… horny.

773
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,149
Barry, you're the eye in the sky.

774
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,444
And Chips and I, we're gonna go and visit
the dam in Colorado.

775
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,780
[Chips humming]

776
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,163
What? Come again?

777
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,249
-He was busy doodling Garfield.
-[Chips] Clancy.

778
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,376
[Luke] Chips, you're coming with me,
so you gear up.

779
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,961
We're gonna take the planes.

780
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,672
It's gonna take us a few hours
to get to the dam and to DARPA.

781
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,382
So let's get going. Come on.

782
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:35,341
[Barry sighs]

783
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:38,761
Hey.

784
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,513
You sure you'll be okay here,

one floor below
she-who-shall-not-be-named?

786
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:43,933
I think so.

787
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,060
I don't know.

788
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,021
Look, man, I know what it's like
to be in close quarters

789
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:52,024
with a woman you still feel for
that doesn't feel the same.

790
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,529
-Emma.
-Yeah, I'm still crazy about her, man.

791
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:59,031
No, um, I mean… [clears throat]

792
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,200
…Emma. [chuckles]

793
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,703
Shit.

794
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,581
I'm sorry. I just came back for my phone.

795
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,836
I can't really talk about this right now,
'cause of, uh, Greta.

796
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,922
Well, I don't wanna talk about it ever.
I'm gonna go save America.

797
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,048
[Emma] Okay.

798
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,425
Shit.

799
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:21,304
I mean, I've known about his and Emma's
real job for a few months now,

800
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,849
but to actually be in the building
where they work…

801
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:29,145
That's a lot to process. I'll teach you
some breathing exercises that might help.

802
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,146
Thank you.

803
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,648
You know what?
I'm just gonna use the restroom.

804
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,942
-I'll meet you back at your office.
-Sounds good.

805
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,029
I'm going to go find
some sugar-free snacks for everyone.

806
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,907
Remember, breathe.

807
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:41,866
Okay.

[ominous music playing]

809

Don't you run off now, comrade.

810
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,127
I'll be back in five.

813

What do you want?

814
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,896
When he was eight,
Barry lost his parents in a car accident.

815
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,942
At nine, his aunt got sick
and couldn't care for him anymore.

816
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,736
By 15, he had gone through
half a dozen foster homes.

817
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,364
Sixteen, he ran away from an orphanage

818
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:23,824
because they made him sleep
in the basement.

819
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:28,746
At 21, he became Luke's handler
and part of our family.

820
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:33,626
He has a caring, loving heart,
and you toyed with it.

821
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,710
It's a spy game.

822
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,838
If he can't handle it,
they're hiring at the post office.

I'm sitting here babysitting swine.

830
00:37:56,774 --> 00:38:00,111
Mellow out, man. Tally and Dr. Pepsi
will be back soon with snacks,

831
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:05,116
so we just get to sit here, chill,
and do puppet shit.

832
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,325
You care too much.

833
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,744
I don't think you care enough
about anything.

834
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,914
Donnie, not too long ago, you were
a successful accountant with a nice suit.

835
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,750
And now you reek of body odor
and grain alcohol.

836
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,837
You spend all day watching
Franklin & Bash with a pig.

837
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,213
Like, how are you okay with this?

838
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,425
Because when your heart's been crushed,
you see how meaningless it all is.

839
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:26,137
Great, you're another nihilist.
You're Dante Cress Jr.

840
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,596
Who's Dante Cress?

841
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,223
Holy shit, are you kidding me?

842
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,642
The guy trying to destroy the world.

843
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:35,313
The guy that everyone in the house
has been talking about for days.

844
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,858
-How long has that door been open?
-I don't know.

845
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,444
The pig. Donnie, the pig got out.

846
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,779
If we lose it, Aldon will kill us.

Okay, before I leave,
I wanna talk belly rubs.

00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,129
What the hell?

852
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,424
Hey, little buddy.

853
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,177
Did dumb Uncle Carter
and drunk Uncle Donnie forget you already?

854

What a bunch of idiots.

All right, well do you just wanna go
on a mission with Daddy? Huh?

856
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,517
Go extract some intel from an asset?

857
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,894
Okay, after you.

858
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,188
[Aldon sighs]

859
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,857
[vehicles beeping]

860
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,944
We really have no idea how she got in.

861
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,655
When we checked the bin for
the water cannon, it was full of bricks.

862
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,324
-Bricks?
-[man] Yeah.

863
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:31,744
The whole warehouse is weight censored.
We get a reading every half hour.

864
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:34,246
If it's so much as a pound off,
we know something's been taken,

865
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,333
so clearly she was careful
to replace the weight that she took.

866
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,419
[Emma] I noticed there's…
There are no guards outside.

867
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:43,464
Yeah, that's the irony
of the more clandestine sites. [chuckles]

868
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,425
If we don't want enemies to know where
we are, we have to be inconspicuous.

869
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:49,512
If we had a bunch of security,
we would stand out. [chuckles]

870
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:52,306
Some DARPA sites
have less personnel than a Home Depot.

871
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,682
This is by design.

872
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:55,393
-Security footage?
-All clear.

873
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,144
Except for a three-minute glitch.

874
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,729
-Uh, what glitch?
-No.

875
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:00,106
We had a brief power outage,

876
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:03,150
but there's no way that anyone
could've gotten in here, robbed us,

877
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,693
and gotten out in three minutes.

878
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:08,280
-[Roo] You don't know Greta.
-Okay, well, you don't know our warehouse.

879
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:10,074
[lights clicking and buzzing]

880
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,662
[intriguing music playing]

881
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:18,040
[Roo exhales]

882
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,252
Yeah, maybe it would take longer
than three minutes to find it.

883
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,631
Is that the only fire exit?

884
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,383
Uh, there's one in the southwest corner.

885
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:31,011
That leads to a fenced-in lot.
This one leads to the side street.

886
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:33,055
[Roo] Then she came through here.

887
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,432
She wouldn't try to pull this off

888
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:37,101
if she hadn't already paid
some teenage hacker six figures

889
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,644
to get into your inventory system.

890
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:42,565
She knew where she was going.
That's why she only needed three minutes.

891
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,775
-Where was the water cannon?
-Over here.

892
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:46,277
[intriguing music continues]

893
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,841
That was only ten seconds.
Add five because she was carrying bricks.

894
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,551
-What are you doing?
-Math.

895
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,971
No more than 30 seconds
to open a container, replace its contents,

896
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,681
and put it back where it was.

897
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:19,894
That's down to 135 seconds left
before she's out of here.

898
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:24,940
I'd say she's 5'9",
so she's got about 30-inch gams,

899
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,776
moving at a clip of…

900
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:29,778
Here.

901
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,617
Whoa, what do you think you're doing?

902
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:37,203
I'm gonna dig through your shit
to find out what Greta snatched up

903
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,662
right from under your nose.

904
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,999
We have devices and weaponry in here
which are completely experimental,

905
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,667
some of which are extremely dangerous.

906
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:47,171
If you think you're gonna rummage around
like it's a bargain bin at a Walmart,

907
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,756
you are very mistaken.

908
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,342
No, you're not touching anything
without a court order.

909
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,886
You listen very carefully.

910
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:57,306
If you take one step to leave
or make a single move for that phone,

911
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,100
I will break exactly four bones
in your body.

912
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,811
Not gonna tell you which ones.
I want it to be a surprise.

913
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,689
But the last one will make it impossible
for you to shit straight.

914
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,735
Hey, look me deep in my eyes.

915
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,529
Ask yourself,

916
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:14,031
"Is this woman serious?"

917
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,787
-[music ends]
-Ha… Hamsteak.

918
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,913
[blowing kisses]

919
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,122
Hamsteak?

920
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,499
He could be anywhere.

921
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:26,085
Who cares? We're finally out.

922
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:28,254
It's rumspringa, baby.

923
00:42:28,337 --> 00:42:31,048
-Complete freedom!
-Don't do that thing with your arms.

924
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,299
We're supposed to lay low.

925
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,219
-Someone might recognize us.
-Who? One of Boro's buddies?

926
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,054
They want the spies, not us.

927
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,848
-No, they'll hurt us to get to the spies.
-[pants unzipping]

928
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:42,393
We're all in a safe house together
for a reason, remember?

929
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,603
Oh my God.
What are you doing? We're in public.

930
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,022
What kind of animal pisses outside?

931
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,023
All of them.

932
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,733
-Fair, but--
-[grunts]

933
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,819
You know, we passed
a gas station a block ago.

934
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,404
I didn't have to go then.

935
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:54,321
[Donnie grunts]

936
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:56,949
Broken fly's always catching my nads.

937
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,826
Ah, yeah.

938
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:03,581
We should only have one ball. You know?
Like the size of a Cutie?

939
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,582
[Donnie groans]

940
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:07,001
Like the little oranges
kids get after soccer games?

941
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,919
Will you please stop talking about this?

942
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:11,005
We need to find that pig
before it gets hurt.

943
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,382
If I screw this up
after the comic-book thing,

944
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:16,969
that'll be one more reason for Emma
to think that I am utterly useless.

945
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,929
What did I tell ya? Don't care so much.

946
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:20,931
You get no shot with Emma, believe me,

947
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,934
especially with that special agent around
with the washboard abs.

948
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,520
Have you seen that guy in the shower?

949
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:28,897
No.

950
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:31,692
I have.

951
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:34,862
What the fuck?

952
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,697
Yeah, I just got the call.

953
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,074
Little hog just came in the back.

954
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:41,118
-Let me go check it out.
-Little hog?

955
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,829
Hamsteak's a little hog.
He's in the back room.

956
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:45,914
-[door opens]
-Well, let's go get him.

957
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:47,082
[door creaking]

958
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,878
[bikers chatting indistinctly]

959
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:53,839
[door closes]

960
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,883
[Carter] Hey, guys. Sorry to bother you.

961
00:43:55,966 --> 00:44:00,012
I think you guys might have
something that belongs to us.

962
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:02,431
You the buyers? It's not yours
till you show us the money.

963
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,433
[Carter] Oh my God.

964
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:08,687
I think there's been some confusion.
We are just looking for our pig.

965
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,314
-Your pig?
-Yeah.

966
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,274
-You mean hog.
-Okay.

967
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,109
I don't give out PCP for free, asshole.

968
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:18,030
It's like I said,
put the money down, and it's yours.

969
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:18,947
Oh boy.

970
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:23,577
I believe it's customary
to get the first taste free.

971
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,537
-What?
-Gotta know what we're buying here.

972
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,622
Stop.

973
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:29,833
-Who the hell are these pricks?
-[man] The buyers.

974
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,210
My buyers are Samoan.

975
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,128
Shit. Yeah, I'm Samoan.

976
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:35,798
I'm not actually Samo--
I'm culturally Samoan.

977
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,509
I was adopted by Samoans.

978
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:41,345
Ethnically, I think I'm Dutch,
if anything. I think--

979
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,722
I haven't done the ancestry.com…

980
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,433
Bad move, guys. CIA.

981
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,477
We're taking the drugs.
Hand over the drugs.

982
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,478
What are you doing?

983
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:50,396
[both scream]

984
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:54,525
No bricks.
You sure this is the area she took from?

985
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,568
-Don't question my math.
-Don't question her math.

986
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,322
What the hell is this?

987
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,281
Uh…

988
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,784
[spluttering] You are going to want
to put that down,

989
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:06,870
unless you wanna lose
the ability to speak for a few days.

990
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:11,834
I'm just wondering if maybe
she only took the water cannon?

991
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,005
Greta didn't turn off your power
and break into a supervillain's wet dream

992
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:19,258
to only walk away with one item.

993
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:22,428
Not when she had
two power plants to destroy.

994
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:24,596
-[dramatic music playing]
-[gasps] Bricks!

995
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:28,726
Run the inventory number and find out
what the hell was in this box.

996
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,102
[Roo exhales]

997
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,147
-Nice work.
-I know my way around a box.

998
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,064
[clicks tongue]

999
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,192
Don't really know why
you wanna look up here.

1000
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:39,945
If you wanna take down a dam,
you attack its base.

1001
00:45:40,028 --> 00:45:42,656
And you saw
the military personnel down there.

1002
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,116
There's no way she could get to it.

1003
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,452
Well, that's what we thought
at Litchfield and Kodiak.

1004
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,413
-We can't underestimate Greta.
-Hey, up ahead.

1005
00:45:50,038 --> 00:45:51,582
[dramatic music playing]

1006
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,338
It's the patrol captain.

1007
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,965
Yup, he's gone.

1008
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,093
[tense music playing]

1009
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,637
That's one hell of a booger.

1010
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:06,930
It's not a booger.

1011
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,307
It's a quick-hardening foam.

1012
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:11,393
Emma, Roo,
we found the patrol captain asphyxiated

1013
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:14,438
and expanding foam made from viscoelastic.

1014
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:17,065
The military designed that
as a non-lethal incapacitator

1015
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,609
to stop suicide bombers.

1016
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:21,236
-[Roo] How's this connect with the LRAD?
-What the hell is an LRAD?

1017
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,030
It's a long-range acoustic device.

1018
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,741
It's like a sound-wave gun.
Greta stole one from DARPA.

1019
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:28,619
What could you possibly do
with an acoustic device at the dam?

1020
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:29,912
[Barry] That I can explain.

1021
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:32,372
The viscoelastic foam
found in that guy's nose?

00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:36,293
That stuff expands rapidly to deaden
kinetic energy and to absorb impact.

1023
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:39,171
But underwater, it won't work.
It doesn't expand.

1024
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,631
But if you had an LRAD…

1025
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,633
If they dump the foam
into the dam's works,

1026
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:45,260
it can harden with targeted
acoustic vibrations.

1027
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,639
The foam hardens in the turbines,
the turbines stop spinning,

1028
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,891
the dam stops generating power.

1029
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,976
There goes the final point
of vulnerability.

1030
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,978
And we're back to the Dark Ages…

1032
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:57,356
…literally.
