I don't. I'm just saying that I think…

180
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:51,776
I can't believe you had a romance
with a spy at the height of the Cold War.

181
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,861
It was at the end of the Cold War.

182
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,697
And it was actually the relationship
that helped end it.

183
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,701
Oh, and here I thought it was
the economic collapse of the Soviet Union.

184
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,204
Well, two things
could be true at the same time.

185
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,665
Hey, what are you doing?

186
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,710
We have to scan this for bioagents
and explosives, and all the other--

187
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,795
Come on.

188
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:13,381
-Or just ignore me.
-I mean, this is not Greta's style.

189
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,175
She would want to look me in the eye
when she kills me.

190
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,510
Or when you kill her.

191
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,680
Or when I kill her.

192
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,476
Is that a pipe?

193
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,188
No. This is not a pipe.

194
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,399
Okay, Magritte, what is it then?

195
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,819
It's a two-way radio
tuned to a specific frequency.

196
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:35,736
[Roo] Huh.

197
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,823
That's how Greta and I
used to communicate in the '80s.

198
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,242
But you keep the top on, you listen.

199
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,913
You take the top off,
and you talk into this transmitter.

200
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:46,914
[Roo] Huh.

201
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:48,249
Can we trace her with it?

202
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,918
No, she would never use it
long enough to track her.

203
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,546
Why did you have a COVCOM with the enemy?

204
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:55,589
I needed kompromat on Gorbachev.

205
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:56,966
And Greta had it.

206
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,302
That blackmail actually helped us
tear down that wall.

207
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,387
[Roo] Hmm.

208
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:04,098
The enemy of your enemy is your friend.

209
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,808
Friend with bennies.

210
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:09,854
It was a very complicated relationship,
but we never betrayed our countries.

211
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,064
We only found pleasure
in each other's company.

212
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,858
And in each other's pants.

213
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,694
They definitely were fucking.

214
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,404
[Emma] Ugh.

215
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,824
[electronic warble]

216
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,200
No bugs or trackers.

224
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,721
How we'd dance?

[Greta] But I'm warning you,

229
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:57,234
you come between me and my work,

230
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,279

[Tally] I can't believe Greta is alive.

234
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,041
You told me she was dead.

235
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,210
Well, I thought she was dead.

236
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,046
And that you loved her once.

237
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,756
But it was way before you.

238
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,759
I mean, you have nothing to worry about.

239
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,719
[Donnie] Except for
the hot former girlfriend

240
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,430
who's back in your life
after years of being apart.

241
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,142
And I can attest that having a spy
enter your relationship

242
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:32,436
does not always work out so well.
Right, Carter?

243
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,605
We're not friends, man.
We just live together.

244
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,898
Whatevs.

245
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:36,857
Oh my God.

246
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,736
What you doin' with that hat, buddy?

247
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,240
Inventing shit.

248
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:49,286
Mrs. B., Luke was forced
to go into that hotel room.

249
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,288
Forced to dance, and…

250
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:52,665
It all happened at knife point.

251
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:59,880
-A knife didn't make that.
-All of this happened… against my will.

252
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,591
And I'm sure you hated every minute.

253
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,552
[in Italian] He must think I'm an idiot.

254
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:08,347
Okay, are you guys breaking up or what?
Franklin & Bash is about to start.

255
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,890
[soft rock music playing]

256
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:12,935
[sighing] Okay.

257
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:13,936
[music fades]

258
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,272
-[Emma] So, what's Greta's next move?
-Yeah, right.

259
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:17,273
Um. [clears throat]

260
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,316
She won't hit
the Beaumont Lake power plant again.

261
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,901
They, uh, they shut down the retrofit,

262
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,736
so it isn't a viable target
for her anymore.

263
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,365
Well, she will find another way
to attack the power grid, trust me.

264
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,868
-She's very smart.
-Yeah, but she's not an engineer.

265
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,953
And the US electrical grid is a labyrinth.

266
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:33,914
She'd need an expert
to navigate what to target next.

267
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,959
And with Dante Cress footing the bill,
she'll pay for the best.

268
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,712
We need Todd Demps,
former lance corporal in the Army,

269
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,505
part of the Office
of the Assistant Secretary

270
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,757
of the Army of Installation,
Energy, and Environment.

271
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,843
-He was a part of what?
-Yeah, what was that?

272
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:48,762
Part of the Office of
the Assistant Secretary of the Army for…

273
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:49,847
[laughs]

274
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,766
Real funny.
Anyway, Demps, a disgruntled employee,

275
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,144
caused the Northeastern blackout of 2003,

276
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,938
putting tens of millions into darkness
from Ohio to Ottawa.

277
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,648
I remember that story now.

278
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,108
He spent 12 years behind bars.

279
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,612
When he got out, he went to ground,
and nobody has seen him since.

280
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:08,866
But if we could track him down,
he could tell us how Greta's gonna pivot.

281
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,327
If anyone would know how to hit the grid,
it would be Demps.

282
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,369
Let's search for him.

283
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,956
Hey, did you retrieve anything
from the BlackBerry?

284
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,166
[Aldon] Tina's working on it,

285
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,293
but I'm not gonna lie,
it got pretty hairy out there.

286
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,753
What I can't figure out is how--

287
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:24,298
How does Cress even know
that we're targeting Bashir?

288
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,134
The only ones that knew
were the people in this house.

289
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,845
-And Tina, and Reed--
-Are you getting at something?

290
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,388
[intriguing music playing]

291
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:33,766
I don't know yet.

292
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:34,808
[doorbell ringing]

293
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,394
[music fades]

294
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,146
Peonies for your thoughts.

295
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,442
I almost bought the farm in Sardovia.

296
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,446
And I came this close to being sucked
into the power plant's chop-o-matic,

297
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,448
and after seeing what happened to Dot,

298
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,408
it just got me thinking…

299
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,829
If my life were to end,
what would my obituary say?

300
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,790
"Aldon Reese died today."

301
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:03,712
"He had a thousand one-night stands
and zero meaningful relationships."

302
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,797
[Dr. Pfeffer] A thousand?

303
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,548
Oh my.

304
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:08,008
Yeah, I've had tons of sex.

305
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,677
Yeah.

306
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,387
But I've never made love.

307
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,263
Well, tell me more about that.

308
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,557
[inhales] Well, it's kind of crazy.

309
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,978
When I was in that underwater pipe
facing real death…

310
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,020
[dramatic music playing]

311
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,648
…I kind of felt like
it wasn't the worst way to go out.

312
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,692
Because at least it was with Emma.

313
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,987
Like, honestly, I felt comfort in that.

314
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:30,280
But… [chuckles]

315
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:31,907
…I don't know, what does that mean?

316
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:36,078
Do I love Emma?

317
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,665
Or is it just a defense mechanism?

318
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:40,666
How old are you?

319
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,625
Thirty-two.

320
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,420
I have your file. I know how old you are.

321
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,506
-And you're having a midlife crisis.
-I'm a little young for that.

322
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,383
Hmm. Not if you know math.

323
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,678
And if you know actuarial tables,
you're actually past midlife,

324
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,055
especially given
your dangerous line of work.

325
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:58,851
Getting older before achieving
certain goals, relationship or otherwise,

326
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,894
is a very delicate topic.

327
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:04,314
The question is, do you really love Emma?

328
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,234
Or does she just check a box
off of your bucket list?

329
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,862
Well… [sighs]

330
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,324
Honestly, what I felt
in that pipe was real.

331
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,409
Which is a problem

332
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:19,538
because Emma said that it would be
a mistake for us to be together.

333
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,667
And what she meant by that
was that… that I'm a mistake.

334
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,836
And she's… she's right.

335
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,630
You know, I've never
taken any relationship seriously, so…

336
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,716
So why should I be taken seriously?

337
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,092
Well, how do we fix that?

338
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,594
Well…

339
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,263
-Uh…
-[intriguing music playing]

340
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:40,017
I have to prove to her
that I'm more than a walking stud farm.

341
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,311
-Mm-hmm. Correct.
-I need to learn to love.

342
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,521
I need to learn to care
for something other than myself.

343
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,982
That's right. You need to find
an outlet for your love.

344
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,818
Yes, and I need that outlet
to come from my heart.

345
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,195
-Yes.
-And not my wiener.

346
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,989
Maybe you are younger than your file says.

347
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,035
Oh my God, Demps is so boring.

348
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,330
I've watched this in double speed,

-[phone vibrating, ringing]

350
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:04,833
…hardly riveting either.

[phone beeps]

352
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:11,006
Hey. I've got an update
on the frozen Dante Cress accounts.

353
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,466
You were able to track the money?

354
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,094
All deposited
into a numbered Swiss bank account.

355
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,054
But Swiss privacy laws are strict.

356
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:20,390
Without several signed warrants,
which could take months to obtain,

357
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,059
they aren't giving anything up.

358
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,852
But I'll keep digging.

359
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,396
Though none of this would be necessary

00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,442
It's not your fault.

362
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,112
The important thing is you came home safe.

363
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,029
[Tina] Thanks.

364
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:38,784
And when you're finally able to come home,
I've got a little surprise for you.

365
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,828
I did a little shopping
at that store you like.

366
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,204
SuperBabe's Boudoir?

367
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,624
Let's just say you should get ready
to drop Thor's hammer.

SENDING THEM DOWN ANOTHER DIRECTION.

372
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,809
[Roo] This is useless.
Demps could be anywhere.

373
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:08,272
Actually, he can't just live anywhere.
He needs to be close to a pharmacy.

374
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,565
What's your theory?

375
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:11,525
[Dr. Pfeffer] See those yellow spots
on his eyes?

376
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,985
They're pingueculae,

377
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,988
caused by an accumulation
of glucocerebrosides.

378
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,949
A classic sign of Gaucher disease,

379
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,910
treatment for which
consists of enzyme replacement therapy.

380
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,371
And if he's not going into a hospital,

381
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:28,000
it means that he's receiving
regular IV bags for treatment,

382
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,294
which can't be shipped
in a hot mail truck,

383
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,504
or the meds are rendered impotent.

384
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,762
Psychiatrists go to med school.

385
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,891
Okay, so Demps has to be
near a pharmacy to get his meds.

386
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:47,186
I can run a list of pharmacies
where his drugs are being prescribed.

389
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,068
That is too many to check.

Cross-reference
with those near rural areas,

392
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,866
Down to 12 pharmacies.

393
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,327
Are any near a sustainable power plant?

394
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,788
Like hydro, solar, geotherm,
or anything like that?

Bing, bang, boom. We're down to one.
Pulling up the sat feed now.

396

Looks like a compound.
A few structures in a wooded area.

-That's gotta be where Demps is hiding.
-Good work, doc.

398

Paranoid personality disorder
with avoidant and antisocial tendencies.

400

He will not be appreciative
of anybody just dropping in.

401
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:31,772
He had a chance at his trial
to talk about his ideologies,

402
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,232
yet he pled the Fifth.

403
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,151
A sign he's given up on
ever actually being heard.

404
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,277
He won't trust you.

405
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,697
You need to catch him off guard,
and you need to make him talk.

406
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,865
So, what's the game plan?

407
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,118
Well, you got 60 acres fenced in
with one way in, one way out.

408
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,871
He's paranoid.
He'll have cameras around the perimeter.

-But we gotta be careful.

Good. One of our own in the boss's chair.
That'll make life easier.

Well, I'm not accepting the job.

00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:36,169
After we stop Greta,
the CIA wants me to make a recommendation.

I was considering putting your name up.

00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:41,758
Why not?

You're tough, you're smart,
and you were trained by the best.

What about Aldon? He's senior.

433
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,391
I offered Aldon years ago
a promotional position,

434
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,643
but I think he's still too much
into the action.

435
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,937
Yeah, it's a pretty awesome dopamine hit,

436
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:58,900
but I guess I could pass that up
for a chance to boss people around.

437
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,863
-What about your kid?
-Emma? She's too young.

438
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,866
Plus, I think she has her eye on Unit 9.

439
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,411
Unit 9? That's a hefty brass ring
to be reaching for.

440
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,954
I think she can pull it off,

441
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,249
as much as I think
you can pull off regional director,

442
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,752
but I just want you to know
you're not the only candidate.

That abacus humper?

445
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,010
I know he's a pain in the ass,
but he was always a great field operative.

446
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:28,221
Until his team left him in Belarus
for being annoying.

447
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:32,434
But he made it back to the United States
with $13 in his pocket.

He's very resourceful.

directly on top of the compound

00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,055
[Barry] Got the serial number,
and now the schematics.

517
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,682
Okay, you have to find
and open a side panel.

518
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,768
Should be on the opposite side
of the serial number.

519
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,144
[Roo exhales sharply]

520
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,189
Did you really break the record
defusing a mine at The Farm?

521
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,274
Yeah, third try.

522
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,070
-How did you do on the first two?
-Uh, incomplete.

523
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,863
How do you get incomplete on a mine?

524
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,281
Oh shit!

525
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:34,950
[tense music playing]

526
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,328
[door unlocks]

527
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,792
[door creaking]

528
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,258
[Emma grunts]

529
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,219
Freaking thing won't budge.

530
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:55,387
[Roo groans]

531
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,765
I knew the spy gods
were never gonna let me have nice things.

532
00:25:58,848 --> 00:25:59,808
Meaning?

533
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:04,479
Meaning your old man
was gonna put me up for regional director,

534
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,482
but now I'm gonna
get my cooter blasted out my pooter.

535
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,568
Really, you? Regional director?

536
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,860
Why is that surprising?

537
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:14,030
Just didn't figure you
for the management type.

538
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,240
Well, your dad does.

539
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,783
Okay, super.

540
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,994
And what do you think?

541
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:21,663
That I should focus on the mine.

542
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:25,208
Wow. You know what? I should take
my foot off this thing just to spite you.

543
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,877
[eerie music playing]

544
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,421
Bathroom is clear.

545
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,047
Copy bedroom.

546
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,216
But this is definitely Demps' place.

547
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,011
Well, then he must be in the compound.

548
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,305
Must've seen us come and hid.

549
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,222
[Aldon] Hmm.

550
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,350
Well, he couldn't have gone far
if he didn't take his landmine map.

551
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,273
[Luke] Wait a minute.

552
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,278
[dramatic music playing]

553
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:55,488
[Aldon] Huh.

554
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,408
Well, I'm guessing this is secured
with a tougher lock

555
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,076
than the one on the front door.

556
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,540
Let's search the outside.

557
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,543
Underground rooms need ventilation.

558
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,090
[Emma grunts]

559
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,303
[exhales sharply]
This plate is soldered shut.

560
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:19,220
What an asshole.

561
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,473
Or maybe he's misunderstood.

562
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,932
-What?
-Just saying.

563
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:25,310
You're not always
the best judge of character.

564
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,937
'Cause I don't think
you'd be a good regional director?

565
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,105
You admit it.

566
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,524
What do you care what I think?
I don't have any say.

567
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,652
-Just tell me.
-Fine.

568
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,905
Sometimes you can be unprofessional.

569
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,698
Eat shit. That's not true.

570
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,284
This vent must be around here somewhere.

571
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:43,203
Hey, little fella.

572
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,622
[pig snorting]

573
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:46,623
You want this?

574
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,710
Hey, stop screwing around
and look for the vent.

575
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,296
This wood's like a hundred acres.
The vent could be anywhere.

576
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,007
Hey, Hundred Acre Woods. I found Piglet.

577
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,010
Hey, Barry, use the thermal imagery scan

578
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:02,347
to see if there are any low-lying
warm air streams around the property.

579
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:05,308
-'Cause if we find that, we find the vent.
-Good thinking.

580
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,019
I got a pick-up 15 yards west.

581
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,313
-Come on.
-Here you go, bud.

582
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,272
Here you go.

583
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,401
-[sinister music playing]
-[fan rattling]

584
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,530
Which one's the input?

585
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:20,782
This one.

586
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,284
I hear the fan sucking in air.

587
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,623
-I'm gonna smoke him out.
-Copy that.

588
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,251
[Luke] Emma, how goes it?

589
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,838
Slow but steady. Roo's a bit testy.

590
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,131
'Cause you're a jerk.

591
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,968
How am I a jerk?
I'm literally trying to save your life.

592
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,387
And you're the one who called me
"Her Majesty" the other day

593
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,514
for using Dijon mustard.

594
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,433
That why you don't think
I'd be a good director?

595
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,143
I'm not fancy enough?

596
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,645
I'm the "yellow mustard" of people?

597
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:56,151
No. I just think the job
calls for a particular mindset,

598
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:59,154
and you can be unruly at times.

599
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,781
You were mad at me,
and you filled my locker with pudding.

600
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,451
[laughs] Nice try. That wasn't me.

601
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:08,037
Bottom line, the regional director
needs to be disciplined.

602
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,664
I am disciplined.

603
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,208
You know how long it took me
to make all that pudding?

604
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,671
[bird squawking]

605
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:17,714
Plate's open.

606
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,799
-[Barry] Let's talk which wires to cut.
-[Luke] See?

607
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,719
Teamwork makes the dream work.

608
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,262
[fan rattling]

609
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,769
[coughing]

610
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,604
[Aldon] Well, hiya, Todd.

611
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,608
I'm with the CIA, and I've got
a few questions about electricity for ya.

612
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,151
[coughs, wheezes]

613
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:41,196
[Barry] You just need to pull
the black wire near the trigger pin.

614
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,572
All the wires are black.

615
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,199
-Shut up.
-No, you shut up.

616
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,950
Be quiet. I hear something.

617
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:46,951
[branch breaks]

618
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,870
-[guns firing]
-Get down.

619
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,580
[tense music playing]

620
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,457
We got hostiles!

621
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,464
Get down!

622
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,053
These guys with you?

623
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,056
If they were,
why would they be shooting at my house?

624
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,307
[guns firing]

625
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,267
Everyone still breathing?

626
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,520
For now. How did Greta find us?

627
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,938
[guns firing]

628
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:21,361
[bullets whistling]

629
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,988
Are you using me for cover?

630
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,368
How many combatants are there?

631
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,702
Thermal camera says ten.

632
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:32,664
Make that nine.

633
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,916
Barry, how did you not
see these guys on thermal?

634
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:37,210
I had the landmine schematics
open on my screen.

635
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:38,628
We gotta get out of here.

636
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:42,090
Okay. Let me get my purse.

637
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,300
Oh wait, I'm standing on a mine!

638
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,804
-Where did you get the mines?
-Army surplus.

639
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,681
It was left over from the DMZ.

640
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,432
Did you hear that, Emma?

641
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,602
They're ancient.
They may not be operational.

642
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,856
Not the best option, but we might
have to take a chance and run.

643
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,525
Easy for you to say.
It's not your piggies at risk.

644
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,068
The mines might be too old to work.

645
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,030
Scratch that. They work.

646
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:09,576
Aldon, Dad, I need heavy cover.

647
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,035
On it.

648
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,705
What are you doing?

649
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:16,666
If we can't take you off the mine,
then we're taking the mine with us.

650
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,835
As long as the pressure plate
is compressed,

651
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:20,837
it won't go off, and we can run for cover.

652
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:25,508
You want me to run
with a mine strapped to my foot?

653
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,386
No, I want you to run your ass off
with a mine strapped to your foot.

654
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,512
[gun firing]

655
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,889
[groaning]

656
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:36,394
Why is this happening?
I just wanted to be left alone.

657
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,855
After you tried to destroy the country?

658
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,690
I tried to save the country.

659
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,984
I caused the blackout as a last resort

660
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,944
to show the government
how vulnerable we are.

661
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,364
I tried to warn them for years.
Nobody listened to me.

662
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:51,242
And instead of thanking me,
they threw me in jail.

663
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,078
What a surprise. A convict is innocent.

664
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,622
Damn right I was.

665
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,999
I was the only person
who understood the danger,

666
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,918
the only one who put it all together,

667
00:32:00,001 --> 00:32:01,836
and they all ignored me.

668
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,257
I gave up everything. My life, my job.

669
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,134
And after they locked me up,

670
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:11,763
they actually patched the grid issue
that I exploited for the blackout.

671
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,057
Secretary of the DOE gets all the credit.

672
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,059
I get a daily hour of yard time.

673
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,394
[scoffs] You don't believe me?

674
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:19,562
I have proof.

675
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,773
[guns firing]

676
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:24,734
[moaning]

677
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,780
[guns firing]

678
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,032
After I got out, I continued my research…

679
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:31,950
[glass shattering]

680
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:34,494
…and what I found scared me to death.

681
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:37,121
Four energy plants that,
if all taken down,

682
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,374
would cause an overload so severe

683
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,752
that the entire nation
would lose power irreparably.

684
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,171
[panting] They really didn't fix anything.

685
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:46,923
It's like Jenga.

686
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:50,259
You keep pulling out pieces,
eventually, everything will collapse.

687
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,595
Then why is that report here
in the middle of the woods

688
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,764
instead of on someone's desk
in Washington?

689
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:57,016
For the same reason
I'm in the middle of the woods.

00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,657
-Me either.
-[Aldon] Me either.

859
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,075
He has a nice accent.

860
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,368
-Sack tap.
-[winces]

861
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,203
Move it.

862
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,704
[suspenseful music playing]

863
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:17,623
Come on, let's go.

864
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,387
Switch on the lights.

865
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,597
[guns cocking]

866
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,558
[Chips tutting]

867
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,184
Drop your weapons.

868
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:38,727
Lads.

869
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:42,815
[Chips sighs]

870
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,775
I'm sorry I didn't trust you, Emma.

871
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,862
I never called Greta. Instead,
I came here and cut off your escape.

872
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,907
You see, I know you're not the kind
of person who would turn in Demps.

873
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,703
But on the plus side… darling,

874
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,580
look how highly I think of you.

875
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:02,001
So come on, let's go.
Let's head off to the continent.

876
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,045
-Go to hell.
-[Chips] With you, gladly.

877
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,672
It'd feel like heaven.

878
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:08,507
[in German] Crazy bastard.

879
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,342
[in German] I am crazy, sir.

880
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,052
[in German] Crazy for your daughter.

881
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:14,763
[in English] But alas,
if she won't come with me,

882
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,933
I'll have to leave her to the same fate
as the rest of her team.

883
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,311
So, Emma…

884
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,938
one last chance at eternal bliss.

885
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,524
Get fucked.

886
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,651
I will miss your spirit.

887
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,404
Right, well,

888
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,907
she's made her regretful choice…
[clears throat]

889
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,742
…so kill them all.

890
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:38,621
Except Luke. Just maim him,
or Greta will finish us both.

891
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:40,581
Cheerio.

892
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,666
[tense music playing]

893
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,168
Thank you so much, guys.

894
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,549

896
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,181
Oh, mind the body.

897
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:06,482
Now!

Oh, bloody hell.

907

Fuck!

[chuckles]

912
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,480
Well, bully for me.

913
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:47,606
[panting]

914
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:50,609
Where's my… Right.

915
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,486
[panting]

916
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,283
Oh bollocks.

917
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,912
Greta. Greta, come in. Can you hear me?

918
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,330
[Greta] Do you have Demps?

919
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:07,668
Demps? Demps is dead.

920
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:10,546
But I have his research.
I'm gonna have to read it off to you.

921
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:11,672
Right?

922
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:12,840
-So…
-[gun fires]

923
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,925
Yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay.

924
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,053
Now, there are four points
of vulnerability.

925
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,222
If we shut down
all four of these power plants,

926
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,767
it creates a… an overload,
which the grid can't handle,

927
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,227
and it all goes down.

928

00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,482
"That'll do."

944
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:13,942
Yes. Yeah, and that's the second point.

945
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:14,943
And then…

946
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:18,530
-Well, there's nothing else on the page.
-[Greta] Destroy it.

947
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:22,284
Find the rest of his research.
I need all four vulnerabilities.

Read anything good lately?

951
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:46,558
"The third and the fourth most vulnerable
locations in the power grid are…"

952
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:52,648
What are the other two?

953
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:55,609
Good luck getting it out of me. [laughs]

954

957
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:05,869
I don't need you.

958
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,082
I'll get it from Demps.

959
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:10,999
Demps?

[Chips chuckles]

964
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,559
You were saying?
