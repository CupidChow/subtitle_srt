crying in the romance section
of a bookstore, thanks to you.

348
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,139
You're just a sperm donor.

349
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,975
Now you're gonna be responsible
for the first time in your life,

350
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,393
and you're gonna help my granddaughter.

351
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,436
And my niece.

352
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:45,647
And my grandniece.

353
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:49,068
Thanks, Kyle.

354
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,070
I'll get this to the lab.

355
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,784
We're gonna let you know
if you're a match.

356
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,042
[Dot] Before we begin,

357
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,920
I've just been informed, unfortunately,

358
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,506
no one in this regional branch
is a match for Romi.

359
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,800
But I've personally reached out
across the agency.

360
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,301
We're getting more swabs as we speak.

361
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,262
Thank you very much, Director.
I appreciate your support.

362
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,265
Now, let's focus on Boro.

363
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,312
Boo!

364
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,648
That guy sucks.

365
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:29,233
[Dot] As an enemy combatant,

366
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,653
Mr. Polonia has no rights
under the Geneva Convention.

367
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:36,949
Technically, since he's in transit,
we could hold him indefinitely.

368
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,576
Boro has ties
with multiple terrorist groups

369
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,161
interested in purchasing his weapons,

370
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:44,289
from the Middle East, to the Far East,
to right here at home.

371
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,542
He's sitting on a trove of intel,

372
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,336
and we need to do
whatever it takes to mine it.

373
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,381
As such,
I've submitted a request to the DOJ

374
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,092
to employ enhanced
interrogation techniques.

375
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,135
We're awaiting a PDD.

376
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,303
-You down with PDD?
-Yeah, you know me.

377
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:02,057
Presidential Decision Directive
for authorization for torture?

378
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,393
That's a line that government
should never cross.

379
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,771
Is that why you're against it,
or is it 'cause it'd be used against Boro?

380
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:08,856
What does that mean?

381
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:13,485
I'm just saying, you paid for his school,
you looked after him from afar…

382
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,029
I mean… you have a soft spot.

383
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,614
[scoffs] That's ridiculous.

384
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,159
He was a kid that needed help.
That's it and that's all.

385
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,287
He was, and now he's a dangerous man
with dangerous friends.

386
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,122
I say we turn the screws on him.

387
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,291
[Luke] It's always easy to support torture

388
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,793
when you haven't seen it
from five feet away like I have.

389
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,296
I agree with your dad, Emma.
There are parameters.

390
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:36,175
In the canon of most superheroes,
they only torture as a last resort.

391
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,011
Oh, ixnay on the nerd itshay.

392
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,304
[Aldon] I agree with Luke.

393
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,598
I think there are better ways
to get info out of someone.

394
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,474
You gonna honeypot Boro?

395
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,645
I'm just saying,
you don't run headfirst into torture.

396
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,897
It's a big step.

397
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,567
I spent months on this guy's compound.
I know him better than anyone here.

398
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,195
Boro only understands violence.

399
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,571
So let's give it to him.

400
00:19:57,654 --> 00:20:00,032
It physically pains me to say this,

401
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,658
but Princess Emma's right.

402
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:05,913
This dickbag tried to kill
almost everyone in this room.

403
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,665
How are Covergirl and I
the only one with balls in here?

404
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,709
[Dot] Well, the point is moot
till we get that PDD.

405
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:14,171
In the meantime,
I'm putting Carlson on standby.

406
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:18,008
Carlson? Ooh, that guy be creepy.

407
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,347
Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.
You didn't corral your cart.

408
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,974
-Carts go in the cart corral.
-What?

409
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,894
Your cart rolled off
and it dinged my PT Cruiser.

410
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,479
Piss off.

411
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,232
Boy, that just creams my corn.

412
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,901
[man grunting]

413
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,653
[man groaning]

414
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,737
[phone vibrates]

415
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,447
Yello. Norm Carlson here.

416
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,659
Outstanding.

417
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,079
Yeah, I just re-upped on supplies too.

418
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,711
-[Norm grunts]
-[man groans]

419
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,381
[door opens]

420
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:58,966
[footsteps approaching]

421
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:00,050
Look at this.

422
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,176
A reunion.

423
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,179
Me, Finn, Danielle,

424
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,014
whatever your real names are.

425
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,225
I invited you into my home,

426
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,811
clothed you, fed you.

427
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,565
And you, Finn, I never once lied to you,

428
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,652
not even when I said I loved you.

429
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,612
I looked up to you,

430
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,781
and you kill my only living parent.

431
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,450
Now you chain me up.

432
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:29,204
Tell me, who's the bad guy?

433
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,957
The one selling nukes to terrorists?

434
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,877
-Now listen to me, Bengal--
-Don't "Bengal" me.

435
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,754
Let me ask you something.

436
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,506
Did you ever care for me at all?

437
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,259
Or were you just acting
to curry favor with my father?

438
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,760
And once you killed him,

439
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:48,432
you took care of things for me
out of guilt to assuage your conscience.

440
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,601
I cared for you then,
and I care for you now.

441
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,395
That's why I'm trying to tell you

442
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,481
that there's a man coming
to inflict tremendous pain on you.

443
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,567
Pain unimaginable,

444
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,696
using methods that slide through
the tiniest loopholes in our legal system.

445
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:04,656
I'm fighting to stop that.

446
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,992
[Emma] And I'm cheering for it
like it's homecoming.

447
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,994
I don't care if a Ginsu knife salesman

448
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:12,372
shoves his entire sample case
up your ass to get you to talk.

449
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,833
Danielle, bring it down a notch, okay?

450
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,501
[Boro] Listen to the man, Dani.

451
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,253
I am a shark.

452
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,549
You caught a shark. Good for you.

453
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,677
But play my way,

454
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,889
and I can catch you many blue whales

455
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,975
who all wanna get their fins
on my suitcase bomb.

456
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,352
The auction is in stasis.

457
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:37,314
One signal from me,
I could lead them all right to you.

458
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,775
What are the conditions?

459
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:41,360
Captivity on my terms.

460
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,070
House arrest in Bora Bora,

461
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,781
assets remain untouched.

462
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,408
A waterproof ankle bracelet
for dips in the ocean.

463
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,119
Still a prison,

464
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:54,873
just surrounded by white sands
instead of iron bars.

465
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,376
And… when we say no?

466
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,755
My buyers are off in the wind,
get their nukes elsewhere,

467
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:05,050
and you have countless deaths
on your hands.

468
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:10,847
You'll be lucky if we get you
a six-by-eight in Leavenworth.

469
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,475
[phone vibrates]

470
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,608
We will consider it.

471
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:23,902
Come.

472
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,407
[door opens]

473
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,746
Hey. What are you thinking?
We're not making a deal with him.

474
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,123
Kyle is a match.

475
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:43,672
[Tally exhales]

476
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,383
Creamer. We need creamer.

477
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,801
Yes.

478
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,429
Your mother's freaking out.

479
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,349
You don't look too good either.

480
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,603
Well, I got a sick kid
and a frantic wife at the hospital.

481
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,106
-What if he says no?
-He's gonna say yes.

482
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,316
What if he wants to see Romi
or wants visitation?

483
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,402
What if… he wants custody?

484
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,820
[Luke] Romi is your daughter.

485
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,532
Get your act together and calm down.
You hear me?

486
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,536
I'm gonna help Mom in the kitchen.
[exhales]

487
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,121
[in German] Sissy.

488
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,957
[Donnie in English] Sorry I'm late.

489
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,792
-Oh, hey.
-Oh.

490
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,377
Emma, Barry, Luke.

491
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,879
-Bean dip.
-Yeah.

492
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,423
Thanks very much.
Very kind of you to drop this off.

493
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,925
[spluttering] No, hold on.
I was invited to be here.

494
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,636
You must be confused
because this is family only.

495
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,847
-Barry's here.
-Well, Barry's family.

496
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,931
Damn straight.

497
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:38,018
-What's going on?
-He's just dropping off bean dip.

498
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,562
No, no, no, no.
I invited Donnie here for support.

499
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:43,482
I don't want Kyle to feel like
he's walking into a buzz saw

500
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,066
with all the people around here.

501
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,776
It's on a need-to-be-here basis.

502
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,777
Okay, Luke, please.

503
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,989
How do we even explain
Donald's relationship to Romi?

504
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:55,118
-Mom's husband's mother's boyfriend?
-[Tally] I'll take care of it.

505
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,663
Tally, it's fine. I don't wanna make
a difficult situation worse.

506
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,248
I'll be the bigger man and go.

507
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,875
-Can you walk me out?
-Sure.

508
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,879
-I'll, um, call you tomorrow.
-Yeah.

509
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:12,844
You must be Kyle.

510
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,638
Yeah. Hi.

511
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,348
Do the right thing.

512
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:19,976
[Tally] Kyle, hi.

513
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,228
It's nice to meet you.

514
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:23,980
Please come in.

515
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,695
[tense music playing]

516
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:32,447
[exhales]

517
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:36,826
[music builds, ends]

518
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,828
-I'll do it.
-Thank you.

519
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:44,251
But… my buddy's a doctor,
and he told me there's risks.

520
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,336
Infection, nerve damage…

521
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,463
My livelihood could be impacted,

522
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:53,051
so I think it's only fair
that we discuss cost.

523
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,594
Our insurance covers everything.

524
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,638
I don't mean the cost of the procedure.

525
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,432
I mean… my cost.

526
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,518
Missed work, recovery time--

527
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,478
-How much?
-Hundred fifty thousand.

528
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:06,773
[exhales] We can't afford that.

529
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:11,111
Mm. Pretty nice house.
You got a couple cars in the driveway.

530
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,320
You can figure it out.

531
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,283
I'm not gonna risk my life for nothing
just to save some kid I've never even met.

532
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,618
-You sneaky son of a bitch.
-Emma.

533
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,746
He doesn't give a shit about Romi.
He's doing this for a payday.

534
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:25,834
Emma, you hit him, he walks out that door,
and Romi doesn't get what she needs.

535
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,547
Think it over. You have my number,

536
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,842
and you have my number.

537
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,973
What just happened?

538
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,434
-Oh, now you talk.
-What does that mean?

539
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,061
Your kid is sick,
and you stand there and say nothing.

540
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,731
-Emma, that's not helpful.
-Dad told me to stay calm.

541
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,774
Who are you to talk to me like that?
You don't have a child.

542
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:52,694
You don't know what I'm going through.
Just shut up, Emma.

543
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,447
-Don't talk to your sister like that.
-Of course you stick up for her.

544
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,157
She's the son you always wanted.

545
00:26:58,783 --> 00:26:59,993
[Tally] He's gonna be okay.

546
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,956
Luke, you're gonna have to sell your ship.

547
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,417
[Luke] It won't fetch
the kind of money he wants.

548
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,961
-[Tally] Really?
-It could take months to find a buyer.

549
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,631
What about a second mortgage?

550
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,342
-We already took one out years ago.
-Oh.

551
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,844
[Tally] What are we gonna do?

552
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,597
Don't worry.

553
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:23,391
I'm not gonna let anything happen
to our granddaughter.

554
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,394
I promise.

555
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,105
Okay. [exhales]

556
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,192
Oh my God. [breathes shakily]

557
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:46,831
What's a kindergartener doing
with a six-figure uncut diamond?

558
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,501
This is just a little souvenir
from Antwerp.

559
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,753
I felt bad that I missed her recital.

560
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,463
Antwerp? Is that a conflict diamond?

561
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,132
If you call killing a bunch of guys
in a warehouse a conflict.

562
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,842
I mean, It's no big deal.

563
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,387
It's no different than me
getting you the necklace for graduation.

564
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,055
You mean for missing my graduation?

565
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,891
Because all your gifts
were apologies for you being gone.

566
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,267
I see what this is all about.

567
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:10,271
You wanted to go after Boro,
you wanted to kick Kyle's ass,

568
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,982
and you couldn't do either,
so you're pissed off at me.

569
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,402
You could not be more off base.

570
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,028
I feel bad for you.

571
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,822
All the mistakes you made
with Oscar and me,

572
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:21,574
you're making the same ones with Romi,
and you don't even realize it.

573
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,077
God forbid something happens to her,
and you'll--

574
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,497
You'll have blown your second chance
at getting it right.

575
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,041
[gentle piano music playing]

576
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,009
Hey, hey! Look what I got.

577
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,261
Found it at a tag sale.

578
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,388
I was looking for something
to cheer Romi up.

579
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:47,308
A rocking horse? Carter, the kid
can barely lift her head off her pillow.

580
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,602
I know, it's just for when she's better.

581
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,980
-Are you okay?
-Not really.

582
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,983
You said you'd do a donor drive,
not… not do arts and crafts.

583
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,693
Okay. I-- Wow.

584
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:59,571
Um, I really thought
you said Kyle was a match.

585
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:02,699
I never said he'd donate,
and now he won't until we pay him.

586
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:04,576
I didn't know that.

587
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,036
It's fine. We'll--
I will make some more calls.

588
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,621
I'm spinning a million plates,

589
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:12,709
and I just asked you to handle
this one thing.

590
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,587
Okay. Okay, okay. Look, look.

591
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:19,883
Em, you are somebody
who likes to control everything.

592
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,676
From academics, to your career,

593
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,472
to picking a handsome fiancé
who just kind of goes with the flow.

594
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,015
I think you're having a hard time

595
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,601
with the fact that
you can't control Romi's illness.

596
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,520
So why don't you… stain this horse with me

597
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,981
and just take five minutes
to think about something else?

598
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,443
Right.

599
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:39,903
Yeah, okay.

600
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:43,323
'Cause the one thing every sick child
wants is a toy from the Renaissance.

601
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:48,787
I was just looking for someone
who could lighten my load a little bit.

602
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,788
No, no. Wait, Emma--

603
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,500
[footsteps departing]

604
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,844
Nice to meet you, Mr. Polonia.

605
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,554
Name's Norm.

606
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,308
That art store has so many things
and so many aisles.

607
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:14,270
I had a dickens of a time
finding the right glitter glue. [chuckles]

608
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,980
Someone should make an app for that.

609
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,819
Norwegian krumkakers.

610
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,237
My mormor's recipe.

611
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,115
Let me know if you want me
to pop one in your mouth for ya.

612
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,536
Suit yourself.

613
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:43,675
This… is worth $300,000.

614
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:47,512
All you have to do is go to the hospital,
take some tests, make a donation,

615
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:49,639
and this is yours.

616
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:53,059
I'm gonna walk into
that jewelry store over there.

617
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,310
Guy says it's real…

618
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,438
you got a deal.

619
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,857
Oh, no backsies.

620
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,900
If you say yes,

621
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,570
the doctors are gonna set
everything in motion,

622
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,239
and they're gonna kill
Romi's immune system.

623
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:10,118
If she doesn't get a donation
within the next 24 hours, she'll die,

624
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,703
and so will you.

625
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,501
I know. Nothing's gonna happen to the kid.

626
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,340
I knew we could trust you.

627
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,220
[Norm] I know this looks pretty,

628
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:32,515
but there's a unique blend
of bonding agents to these art supplies.

629
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,559
They're gonna feel like
a line of fire ants

630
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,060
marching right up your ding dong.

631
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,813
Now let's get those slacks off.

632
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,773
Stop. We're pulling the plug.

633
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,567
I have a 24-hour cancellation policy.

634
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,485
You will be paid in full.

635
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,570
Boro,

636
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,488
let's cut a deal.

637
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,124
-What the hell?
-An extradition order came down from OFAC.

638
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:01,044
We lose custody of Boro in 48 hours.
I have to make a deal.

639
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:04,213
This is horseshit!
Tell OFAC to O-fuck themselves.

640
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,508
See, I don't get the luxury
of flying off the handle,

641
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,676
being unprofessional,

642
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,720
and cursing at my superiors
when I don't get what I want.

643
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,848
We have him right in that room.
You can't--

644
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,685
It is not your place to tell me
what I can and cannot do, Officer Brunner.

645
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,395
And let me be clear,

646
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:23,191
you raise your voice again
to me in my building,

647
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:26,527
you'll have a choice
between tech support and unemployment.

648
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,528
Am I clear?

649
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,323
Yeah.

650
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,080
You okay?

651
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,548
[Luke] What the hell is
the Office of Foreign Assets Control doing

652
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,425
sending a South American terrorist

653
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,594
that was arrested by Americans in Greece

654
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:53,680
to Zimbabwe, of all places?

655
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,306
Boro supplied the explosives

656
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:58,643
that were used in a terrorist attack
in Harare four years ago.

657
00:32:58,726 --> 00:32:59,852
There's enough corruption there.

658
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:03,189
He will most likely buy his way
out of incarceration within weeks.

659
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:06,484
But the US wants to play nice
with the Zimbabwe government

660
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,821
to access lithium mines
in the Masvingo Province.

661
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,157
It's always about money, isn't it?

662
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,243
If we want Boro's buyers,
there's no time to waste.

663
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,370
He will cooperate if we agree

664
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,873
never to prosecute him for crimes,
known and unknown,

665
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,375
prior to the date of the agreement.

666
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:26,129
So if we discover that he blew up
an orphanage a year ago,

667
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:27,255
we couldn't touch him?

668
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,506
Correct.

669
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:32,051
But we don't have to tell him
about the extradition order to Zimbabwe.

670
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:36,514
Once his African pals drop all the charges
against him, he'll be a free man.

671
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,516
Free to continue business as usual.

672
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:42,228
Free to be nailed for whatever
twisted nonsense he gets up to next.

673
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,022
All right, it's not perfect,

674
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:47,316
but I'm trying to turn chickenshit
into chicken salad here.

675
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:50,278
Maybe you can explain that
to your daughter.

676
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,196
Emma's having a real tough day.

677
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,325
She's so pissed about Boro
and very upset about Romi.

678
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,285
Not an excuse.

679
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,788
I'm telling you as her senior officer,
not as her father,

680
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,831
keep her in line.

681
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:02,749
[Luke] Understood.

682
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:06,669
But I hope that you know
how good she really is.

683
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,296
She's invaluable to the team.

684
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:12,050
She's a quick problem-solver.
She has guts. She has great instincts,

685
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:15,470
and I'm saying that as a senior officer
and as her father.

686
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,597
Thank you for the evaluation.

687
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,308
You're welcome.

688
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:24,395
And… thank you for being on my side,

689
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,189
eighty-sixing the torture.

690
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,900
Oh, I didn't take anybody's side.

691
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,404
Frankly, I'm the only one in this building

692
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,324
who's earned the right
to have an opinion on torture.

693
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,409
[dramatic music playing]

694
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,914
This was not an IED, was it?

695
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:49,170
Whatever they did to you,
you obviously withstood it.

696
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:51,964
You did your duty.

697
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,553
Whatever happened to you is your business,

698
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,349
but this conversation… never took place.

699
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,602
Thank you.

700
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,646
I'll owe you one.

701
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,783
[Luke] Steak from Mastro's,
milkshake from Bob's Big Boy.

702
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,701
Now, talk.

703
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:25,373
Uh, the buyers and I communicate
via an encrypted dark web message board.

704
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,794
They're pinged
once I upload an authentication video

705
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,713
of myself with the bomb
to prove it's operational.

706
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,049
How do you prove it's operational?

707
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,303
State-sponsored satellite,

708
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,765
one of America's many enemies,
one of my many allies.

709
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,935
It can trace the bomb's
unique nuclear signature

710
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,854
and send verification to the buyers.

711
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,022
All I need is my weapon.

712
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:51,899
Your suitcase nuke has been disarmed,

713
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,819
but it still has active nuclear material.

714
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:57,738
But we won't allow an enemy
to ping our HQ.

715
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,991
-We shoot the video off-site.
-Fine by me.

716
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,868
Once the video is online,

717
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:06,247
interested buyers will confirm
with ice cube emojis,

718
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,665
indicating everything's cool.

719
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:12,128
You track their IP addresses,
exact locations, commence raids.

720
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,422
I promised you whales.

721
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,965
My customer list

722
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,302
is a who's who
of the world's baddest leviathans.

723
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,726
I'm sorry that you turned out this way.

724
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:31,272
I turned out this way…
because you killed Omar Polonia.

725
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,482
He was a dangerous man.

726
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:37,236
But by killing him, I deprived
a little sweet boy of his father.

727
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,823
I thought I could fill that space
with peanut brittle and gifts

728
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,283
and sending you to school,

729
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,660
but every kid needs a father figure there.

730
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,330
So quality time with you
would've made me a different man?

731
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:51,167
Quality time is a lie peddled
by busy parents to alleviate guilt.

732
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,668
It's quantity time that counts.

733
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:56,589
So you're there for the wounded knees,
and doing science projects,

734
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,550
falling asleep watching cartoons together.

735
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:03,304
I'm sorry I deprived you
of all of these wonderful things.

736
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:07,058
Do you regret killing my father?

737
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:10,603
No, but I regret what it did to you.

738
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,612
-I still think this deal's a mistake.
-I know.

739
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,364
That's why I want you to sit this one out.

740
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:25,034
Go to the hospital and support the family.
They need you there.

741
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:28,579
Plus, you're too upset and distracted
right now to be in the field.

742
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,873
I've been working Boro for months.

743
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:33,793
What did you tell me
about choosing work over family?

744
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,295
It's too late for me, but not for you.

745
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,964
Take Aldon with you to the hospital.

746
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:39,799
Aldon, get your shoulder checked.

747
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,425
Injured, you're no good to me.

748
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,468
Yes, sir.

749
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:44,720
And Roo and I,
we're gonna take Boro upstate.

750
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,390
Oh yeah. Tag team back again.

751
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,141
Keep me updated, okay?

752
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:50,601
Yeah.

753
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:52,979
-[Luke] Come.
-[Roo] All right.

754
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,023
[suspenseful music playing]

755
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:17,962
[door closes]

756
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,509
[Luke] Okay, Boro, time for your close-up.

757
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:26,554
As soon as this video is posted,

758
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:31,559
our source will confirm that this device
contains legitimate nuclear material.

759
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,687
Interested parties, you know the drill.

760
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,188
Bonne chance.

761
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:39,567
[camera beeps]

762
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:46,532
Okay, the video will be uploaded
to the darkest of the web in a minute.

763
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,242
[phone ringing, vibrating]

764
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:54,457
What's going on?

765
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,208
Kyle flaked. No one can find him.

766
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,210
[Luke]
I knew that SOB couldn't be trusted.

767
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,463
Get in touch with Ops.
They know where he is.

768
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,380
Okay.

769
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,133
[Luke] Now, Emma, just be smart
with the way you handle him.

770
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:07,094
Just keep your cool.
We still need his help.

771
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,512
Yeah.

772
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,514
-[line beeps]
-[Emma sighs]

773
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:11,432
[softly] Fuck.

774
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,228
Director, Boro's video
is live to the underworld.

775
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:18,230
We'll be tracking scumbags in no time.

776
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,066
Copy that.

777
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,151
Dot's on her way.

778
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,528
What's up with Kyle?

779
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,031
Got him.

780
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,535
Car's parked at a bar in Chappaqua.

781
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,828
The Roundabout.

782
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,081
-That's where we met him.
-Thank you, Tina.

783
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,167
Jeez, little girl's dying,
this guy's pounding brewskies?

784
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,502
Just drive faster.

785
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:49,553
Hey, uh, just wanted to say
thanks for helping us track Kyle,

786
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,682
and sorry for pushing our second date.

787
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,642
Second?

788
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:58,687
First one only lasted two bites of pizza
before we got the call about Romi.

789
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:02,983
But if I say our second date,
it moves things forward.

790
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,779
And I, uh… want things to move forward.

791
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,280
Same.

792
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,908
Whenever you're ready for date número dos,

793
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,243
you know where I'll be.

794
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,161
[computer beeps]

795
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,330
[dramatic music playing]

796
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,790
Ice cube in Yemen.

797
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,877
Everything's cool in Syria.

798
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,052
[exhales]

799
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,806
-You're in the wrong place.
-Shit.

800
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:38,185
My father gave you something valuable.

801
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,812
Now you have to give
something valuable to us.

802
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,772
Actually,
I don't have to do anything, okay?

803
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,692
Hey, man, kudos for getting
those tests done. Takes guts.

804
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,069
But I'm guessing once the docs listed

805
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,488
the cover-their-ass,
one-in-a-million procedure risk,

806
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,282
it got too real, and you ran.

807
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,742
And there's no shame in that, man.
You're human.

808
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,119
But that kid is your responsibility--

809
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,663
I'm just a sperm donor, like her pop said.

810
00:40:57,746 --> 00:41:00,332
And as such, I'm under no legal obligation
to follow through.

811
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:04,211
My buddy did two years at Touro Law School
and he told me so, so…

812
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,547
Oh, what'd your buddy say
about stealing diamonds?

813
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,924
That possession is nine-tenths of the law.

814
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:12,052
-Oh.
-Look, I'm planted here, okay?

815
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,512
What you gonna do about it?

816
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,894
I'm gonna strike your Adam's apple,
making it impossible for you to talk.

817
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,353
Your head'll drop instinctively,

818
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,939
and we'll drag you out of here
like you're our buddy on a breakup bender.

819
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,442
In 30 seconds,
you'll be in the trunk of our car,

820
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,903
in five, you'll be wishing
you'd come voluntarily,

821
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,654
and in two, I'm hitting ya.

822
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,364
Oh, you mean business, huh, sweetheart?

823
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,450
-[grunts]
-[Aldon] Okay, here we go.

824
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,910
Oh, sorry, folks.

825
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:39,538
Girlfriend dumped him tonight, huh?
One too many. [laughs]

826
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,456
There we go.

827
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,376
-Sending coordinates in Mukalla.
-Ditto for Damascus.

828
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,087
Units from Al-Tanf and Lemonnier
are incoming.

829
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,632
[Barry] SEALs have landed in Islamabad.

830
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,844
-[Dot] Hold until all units are in place.
-[phone ringing]

831
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,016
What's going on?

832
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,434
-We picked up our friend.
-[muffled grunting]

833
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,228
He's still a little hesitant.

834
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,230
-[Kyle] Hey, let me out of here!
-Uh…

835
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:07,775
Just figured a… a workout
might clear his mind.

836
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,443
Bringing in a personal trainer.

837
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,361
Norm?

838
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:16,784
It's your call.

839
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,410
I trust your instincts.

840
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:20,788
-[Kyle yelling, hitting trunk]
-Thank you.

841
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:24,917
[Kyle] Goddamn, let me out!

842
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,418
[phone vibrates]

843
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,298
-Brunner.
-The favor you owe me?

844
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,424
That was fast.

845
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,969
[Luke] We need to use Merry Fitness
for personal reasons.

846
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,971
I need you to turn a blind eye.

847
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,472
[Dot] Asking for permission?

848
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,349
Forgiveness.

849
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:42,726
It's for Romi.

850
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,272
We never had this conversation.

851
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,235
[man] Don't you wuss out on me.
We're gonna pry that door open,

852
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:54,363
find those sales files
that prove that they're liars,

853
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,449
and then we're gonna take them
to the Chamber of Commerce.

854
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,576
-Hm.
-[exhales]

855
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,244
-You ready?
